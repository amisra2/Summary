Yes, it is more expensive for the state to kill someone than to incarcerate them.","death-penalty","06:55 AM","crime-debates","136"

ABSOLUTELY!!!!","Omegamon_X","327400","The police have been known to wind up killing innocent people over misinformation. Are you saying that we should do away with armed police officers for the same reason that one innocent life is too precious to lose?","death-penalty","08:41 AM","crime-debates","139"

The British Police have managed quite well without firearms for two centuries now. For us, since the gun nuts won't allow that here, I suggest that any cop who kills a person who is later shown to be innocent should be immediately dismissed from the force and that he/she be made personally liable for any civil judgment that is rendered. We have had enough Amadou Diallos, Sean Bells, and Frank Lovatos.","death-penalty","12:22 PM","crime-debates","142"

"10-11-2008","11312",10,"None","None","None","chester","327481","Here's the Wiki article on whether British Police carry guns: In the United Kingdom, the majority of police officers do not carry firearms, except in special circumstances. This originates from the formation of the Metropolitan Police Service in the 19th century, when police were not armed, partly to counter public fears and objections concerning armed enforcers as this had been previously seen due to the British Army maintaining order when needed. The arming of police in the United Kingdom is a perennial topic of debate. Most officers are instead issued with other items for personal defence, such as Speedcuffs, Extendable ""ASP"" Baton, and incapacitant sprays such as PAVA or CS spray. While not a ""normal"" firearm, CS spray is subject to the same rules and regulations as a projectile fireing firearm under Section 5 (b) of the Firearms Act 1968.[1]. The Ministry of Defence Police, Civil Nuclear Constabulary and Police Service of Northern Ireland (formerly the Royal Ulster Constabulary) are issued firearms as a matter of routine. Every force can also call upon the Force Firearms Unit's, Armed Response Vehicle in a matter of minutes, and certain specialist units of the Metropolitan Police are routinely armed. Any questions?","death-penalty","05:09 PM","crime-debates","148"
