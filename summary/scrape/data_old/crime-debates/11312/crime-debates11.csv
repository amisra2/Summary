I think the better solution to this would be to implement some kind circumstances that allow for the death penalty in a proper time frame. Some circumstances could be undeniable DNA evidence, several eyewitnesses, brutal murder, etc. I think with this the death penalty should be implemented and done quickly. Why waste time? To me it isn't about emotions or anything like that. It's more to do with saving money that would be spent on this criminal to keep him/her alive. Money that could be used on something more useful..but as stated, only under these certain circumstances. Also, if we want to keep them from coming back, how about we rehabilitate them first, rather than just throwing them in a yard with weights and basketball courts?","death-penalty","02:44 AM","crime-debates","151"

Unless a violent criminal is specifically sentenced to live the remainder of his/her life in jail, then in a lot of cases, that criminal is going to be free one day, unless a criminal is so old upon sentencing that death is eminent while in prison. So I have a solution, how would you feel about a convicted rapist being casterated along with his prison sentence, then upon release he is not likely to repeat the crime. How would you feel about a convicted murderer having his hands removed along with his sentence, and upon his release he can no longer use deadly weapons such as guns or knives to murder again, although a knife is questionable due to modern prosthetics. And how would you feel about a child rapist having to be casterated, plus undergo very painful mental conditioning that will keep him from repeating his crime, plus his sentence in prison, plus the mental conditioning will continue for the duration of his life after release. And drug dealers who give or sell to children, how would you feel about making them do so much of their own poison, that it scrambles their brains, basically turning them into a vegetable, and no longer able to repeat their crime, and although society would have to care for them, would it be anymore costly than if they were in prison. Just some ideas.","death-penalty","02:49 PM","crime-debates","154"

If a man rapes a child, I guess your idea would be to tell the rapist "" oh its ok, people just dont understand you, so try a little harder to be good in the future"" and then let him be on his way. Then would you look that child in the face and then tell him/her that its their fault this happened, because they dressed wrong or that they shouldnt have been there in the first place. Is this your idea of criminal justice, because thats the way it sounds to me. Im going to be honest, if a man raped my daughter, he would die, but he would pray to die before I got through with him and gave him the answer to his prayer, and if I got caught, the police wouldnt even know where to start filling out the report. The rapist would experience pain he could not have even imagined possible.

If you are sentenced to twenty years, you will get out in as little as five years if you behave yourself. I fail to see how you view this as justice, and even worse, you appear to support it. Why do you have pity for a man that rapes and then kills a child, or any other violent criminal. Violent criminals should be erradicated just like a killer disease, or steps should be taken to guarantee that they do not repeat their crimes after their release.","death-penalty","10:56 PM","crime-debates","164"
