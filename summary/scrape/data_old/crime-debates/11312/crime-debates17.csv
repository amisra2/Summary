I don't believe it is the policy to execute insane people.","antonia","356157","By legal standards, I believe he looks entirely sane, and competant to stand trial and answer for his behavior. I think it looks, minimally, like a First Degree Murder case, because it involved planning out in advance. I suppose it depends on the death penalty laws of that state, but FDM, I understand, is otherwise a capital murder case. Generally, I think the death penalty should be dropped. But that is not the issue here. And no, I don't the death penalty is murder. Depending on that state's laws, if you're going to apply the death penalty, I find the death penalty appropriately applied to this case. As they give him the jolt, let that sink in, for some people. Let it be a jolt felt throughout the nation. And his family has my entire support if they call the death penalty themselves.","death-penalty","04:17 PM","crime-debates","244"

I will defend my position once the argument starts.","EBHS_Senior","373415","How can you be in favor of killing someone? It's wrong to give them the ""easy way"" out.

"10-12-2009","11312",17,"Omegamon_X","314785","This is my position on the subject of the death penalty; I support it. I honestly believe that if you commit an act such as cold blooded murder, then you deserve to be killed and taken out of the equation. It's not a sign of backward barbarianism that goes against a developmental society, that's just an excuse used by the bleeding hearts who are too wimpy to do anything but whine and cry. No, the death penalty is society as a whole voting that someone is far too dangerous to be allowed to remain in the country and deserves to be removed. That's what the death penalty is all about. In fact I'll go a step further and state that we're too lax with the death penalty, we need to make it more severe. I vote for massive reformation of the death penalty in areas of crime that relate to child rape. If you rape a child then you deserve more than anybody to be put down and eliminated forever. Hell, the only people that qualify as being worse than child rapists are genociders. If you rape a kid then you shouldn't be allowed to live. This is an offense that can't be defended or rationalized no matter what. Anybody that tries to defend a child rapist and say that they don't deserve to die needs a serious psychiatric evaluation.","zsu2357","374107","Sorry I'm a little late,(but you know what they say)but damn, you sound like me.I really like the way you think!","death-penalty","04:33 PM","crime-debates","251"

I'm pro-death penalty because there is no atonement for murder. I am not a pacifist, so I am not opposed to all state-sanctioned killing. You probably feel that it's counterproductive to kill someone to show the wrongness of killing. It isn't homicide, however, that offends me as a citizen. It's homicide without permission. The state may have the moral authority to kill a human being. The individual does not. You're assuming (a) convicted murderers regret killing their victims (b) that they think of their victims as innocent and (c) that I care what murderers feel or think.","death-penalty","02:31 PM","crime-debates","252"

"03-09-2010","11312",17,"None","None","None","IME","393953","In my mind, every single crime, i.e. rape, muder, theft, is a crime, or sin agaist your fellow man. There for, all crimes are the same, just some more sever than others. As for the death penalty, although it should be used more often on murders and serial killers, even rapists, it probaly isnt neccary to use it on robbers. But think of this: should we keep the killers in jail for 100 year sentences with the possiblility of them escaping, or our jails overflowing, or should we just go with the 100 percent surefire way of keeping them off the streets just by the electric chair or lethal injecion.","death-penalty","11:17 PM","crime-debates","255"
