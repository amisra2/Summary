You want to return to the days of the Germanic Weregeld .(You kill one of mine, then I'll kill one of yours.) Fortunately, the law has evolved since such primitive ideas ruled.","grizzly6626","326363","As I said, it should be up to the family to decide, and if they so choose to forgive him and do nothing, then I would live by that decision. And I am not talking about revenge, im talking about justice. I know some of you dont believe in God, but I do. In my bible God has a lot to say about killing another human being, and God addresses both accidental killings and murder. It says in my bible that if a man murders another human being, that he is to be delivered up to God immediately, this means the murderer forfits his life. There is more but this is the only one I remember. I know some of you think you know more about how to do things than God does, so I fully expect a lot of ridicule over this post, and thats ok, we will see who is right in the end.","death-penalty","10:23 PM","crime-debates","76"

The fact that your definition doesn't match up with other peoples is one of your own blind spots. Grizzly: As far as I am aware, the Old testament mentions the 'eye for an eye' you want to encourage. The new testament kinda directly discredits that way of thinking. Ethmi: 'Thousands' is an overstatement in the extreme, at least in recent times. The BBC tells me prison murders in 2002 in the US were 4 per 100,000 inmates, with 2.1 million inmates incarcerated (incidentally, that's almost 1% of the total US population in jail. Woo for land of the free!). Some simple maths gives a grand total of 84 murders per year. Given that there were over 16,000 murders in 2003 out in the real world (I can't find 2002 figures, but they'll be similar), that's not a lot of killers who go on to kill in prison. In fact, that makes prison safer than the outside world - 4 per 100,000 behind bars, vs 5.5 per 100,000 in the free world. In short, that argument doesn't work. Especially when you consider that flaws exist in the criminal prosecution system.","death-penalty","11:11 PM","crime-debates","78"

And no matter how you pro death proponents cut it, you can't deny that fetuses/ unborn babies are ALIVE. And the evidence of that is that they grow from a fertilized egg into sentient beings which are true reflections of their biological parents. So the blind spot isn't mine at all, because I'm not in denial of reality in order to justify the killing of totally innocent unborn children as I argue against the legal executions of murderers who knowingly and premeditatedly steal peoples hopes, dreams and their very lives.

"10-05-2008","11312",6,"iangb","326386","A foetus cannot survive outside of it's host. As such, it is no more 'alive' than the sperm cell it came from. I don't deny that one day, it will be alive (probably). But up until that point, it is potential, nothing more. Furthermore, a foetus does not have a mental existence. I don't weep when I cut down trees, or eat beef for supper - and a cow is probably more aware of it's surroundings than an early-stage foetus is.","Archangel","326390","A mixture of ignorant semantics and blatant untruths. Is a person who is on life support NOT ALIVE? I don't think so. So since when is ones ability to survive without assistance a requirement for proof of life? A germinated egg grows into a sentient being if allowed to survive, That is a scientific fact and cannot be denied by anyone, except a pro-death proponent who is in denial of reality Really? At what point of its development are you referring to? And explain to me how a child can learn in the womb if he IN FACT has no ""mental existence"" as you so incorrectly claim? The parents of ten-year-old musical genius Ariel explain to the programme that they developed their son's talent by ensuring he listened to classical music when he was in the womb. He was raised in a house dominated by music and had his first piano bought for him before he was even born. By the age of five he had taught himself to play the piano and aged seven he was playing in concerts with an adult orchestra. The film follows Ariel, from Israel, as he plays in a late-night jazz club and jets to Italy to perform his jazz debut outside Israel. http://uk-tv-guide.com/pick-of-the-d...ure-or-nurture What I marvel at iangb, is the ease in which your side categorizes the unborn as not living, or having no mental existence, when all you need do is look into a mirror or think a sentient thought to realize that you were once exactly where they are now. Yet you think nothing of marginalizing who and what they are for the sake of your pro-death philosophy. It's pathetic, really, since at the same time you will attempt to take some imaginary moral high road as you argue against the death penalty for legally convicted murderers who acted with malice and premeditation. You just prove how twisted your reasoning is and how shallow your sense of morality is.","death-penalty","08:38 AM","crime-debates","81"

And the justification of holding sentient beings who MURDER others with malice responsible for their actions by legally executing them for choosing to kill other human beings. And the ability to appreciate the difference between these two issues. I'm pointing out the hypocrisy and inconsistency of YOU supporting that 1.4 million innocent babies are killed each year in the womb, while objecting to the legal executions of a thousand or so convicted murderers each year, who are the worst of the worst among humanity. These are people who enjoy murdering people because it feels good to them, yet you feel they deserve defending, while totally innocent unborn babies who have wronged no one at all are worthy of being victims of infanticide to you. And you are blind to the injustice in that. That is what makes you a reprobate and a hypocrite all at the same time.","death-penalty","09:00 AM","crime-debates","84"

Despite what you might think, this is simply a debate over metaphyiscal themes, and no one here is a reprobate for holding to a position different from yours. You have one definition of right and wrong; other people have other definitions. Some people have one definition of ""baby""; other people have other definitions. End of story. You do not get to dictate the terms of the debate nor the definitions of the terms within it. All that you can say is, ""This is what I believe, and here are the reasons why."" Then you must stand back and expect those beliefs to be examined and criticized, caustically in some cases. I may disagree with your ideas, I may and do call them foolish, damaging to the common weal, and ill advised, but I will defend your right to spread your error.","death-penalty","09:38 AM","crime-debates","85"

As if even that will ultimately be respected. Look at the reason given, it was for lifestyle reasons. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/ukne...n-Britain.html Almost 3,000 were carried out on women who were at least 20 weeks pregnant, according to the latest annual figures in England and Wales, representing a 44 per cent increase in less than a decade. The vast majority were for ""lifestyle"" reasons; less than a quarter were because of a risk that the child would be born handicapped. The figures come amid rising concern over the current 24-week time limit for legal abortions. Campaigners who cite research showing improved survival rates for very premature babies, combined with evidence suggesting young foetuses can feel pain, are putting pressure on MPs ahead of a crucial debate on the issue next month. MPs are planning to add amendments to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill to reduce the limit to 20 or 21 weeks. David Cameron, the Tory leader, has said he would back such a change.","death-penalty","04:39 PM","crime-debates","88"

If victims or families of the victim were allowed to prosecute, the prosecution would almost always be biased and unfair towards the accused. This is why I said the punishment should be decided by the victim or the victims family, and to my knowledge there is nothing in the bible that says that only the state can administer punishment. As far as rendering to ceaser what is ceasers, the bible is refering to possesions and taxes. But I have been known to be wrong before.","death-penalty","02:53 PM","crime-debates","90"
