Are you going to keep offering them opportunities for change, when they've proven 13 times that they don't want to change?","sinjin","329334","You really need to do some research on recidivism rates for murderers as well as sentencing for repeat offenders. The scenario you suggest seems far-fetched to say the least. http://www.sgc.wa.gov/PUBS/Recidivis...ivism_CY04.pdf The above is only for Washington State but you'll notice a 4% repeat rate for murderers the year of the stats.","death-penalty","11:45 AM","crime-debates","212"
"10-22-2008","11312",15,"iangb","329333","Omega, Chester is talking about spending more money on the education system in the first place . Not educating the criminals more, but trying to prevent people from becoming murderers in the first place. Although I would say that if you are going to release someone, further education should be near-mandatory while they are inside.","Omegamon_X","329338","That would only work if it can be proven that intelligent people don't commit crimes. But I haven't seen any evidence that only the poorly educated masses who can't afford good schooling turn to a life of crime. If that were the case then we wouldn't have white collar criminals who're guilty of embezzling millions of dollars and stealing thousands in office supplies.","death-penalty","12:10 PM","crime-debates","213"

My position remains the same; death to serial murderers, spree killers, thrill killers and child rapists. Failure to do so only deprives us of prison space that could be better used for other offenders.","death-penalty","01:18 PM","crime-debates","218"

"10-26-2008","11312",15,"None","None","None","Charliegone","329878","IMHO, both sides are correct. There are times when it is necessary, others when it is not. The problem resides on when, how, who and what. Like I said, certain factors are what determine the usage of the death penalty. Our justice system might be flawed to some degree, but for the most part it works well. Self-preservation is another story as are wars that are fought, because those are more complicated than killing someone because ""they looked at you funny.""","death-penalty","04:57 PM","crime-debates","222"

What standards shall they use? Who gets to determine whether the standards they use are the correct standards? What happens when one disagrees with the standards used? If we were all Platonic guardians equipped with perfect judgment and perfect rationality, then I might agree. Since we are not, then I cannot support the Death Penalty.","death-penalty","11:06 AM","crime-debates","223"

That is why there is always another decision to decide whether the death penalty applies or not. No one said we are perfect, but neither should be lenient towards people who commit horrible crimes.","death-penalty","06:42 PM","crime-debates","224"

Why do you assume that, because I oppose the Death Penalty, that I favor ""lenient"" treatment of those convicted of heinous crimes? BTW, if there are 12 fallible human beings on a jury, has fallibility been multiplied by 12 or divided by 12?","death-penalty","07:55 PM","crime-debates","225"
