"10-28-2008","11312",16,"chester","330040","Once again, the false dichotomy fallacy raises its ugly head. Why do you assume that, because I oppose the Death Penalty, that I favor ""lenient"" treatment of those convicted of heinous crimes? BTW, if there are 12 fallible human beings on a jury, has fallibility been multiplied by 12 or divided by 12?","Charliegone","330105","Did I ever say I thought you wanted to be lenient on criminals? I said we shouldn't be lenient on them. I never said, ""Chester wants to be lenient on criminals"" did I? I don't know whether you understand how the justice system works, but anyways there would be far more fallibility if there were less people to decide. That is why 12 people are chosen to decided whether a person who commits a crime such as murder will face the death penalty or not. It is not just one person who is deciding this persons fate you know.","death-penalty","01:30 AM","crime-debates","226"
"10-28-2008","11312",16,"Charliegone","330031","Jury of Peers has worked quite well for a very long time I don't see why we need to change it. That is why there is always another decision to decide whether the death penalty applies or not. No one said we are perfect, but neither should be lenient towards people who commit horrible crimes.","chester","330120","Are you going to fudge now and say that, because you did not specifically include me in the list of those who are lenient that I am excluded? That kind of silly ""logic"" gets us nowhere. Be that as it may, I still believe the DP is wrong for three main reasons: 1. It places in the hands of 12 fallible people the life or death of another fallible person. 2. It is an act of vengeance and revenge, not justice. and 3. There is always the possibility of an error, thus making the jury and the state (and by extension ME) complicit in murder. BTW, don't patronize about not knowing how the law works. I practiced law for many years, and I can tell you how the law works, except that you won't like it one bit.","death-penalty","07:42 AM","crime-debates","227"

I said we mustn't be lenient, whether you agree with that, really doesn't matter to me, but to answer your claims. 1. Again if we were to live our lives that way you might as well not drive to work (as there is the possibility of being in a car accident) heck you might as well not go anywhere! My point is, if we did this we'd never get anything done. Besides I'm not saying we should apply the death penalty in all instances of murder for example. I'm saying if the circumstances apply (like several eye witnesses, DNA evidence, the brutality of the crime and why.) The death penalty should apply. 2. Justice is applying a penalty or punishment for a wrong deed done. The death penalty is no different then that. 3. Again, with the kind of technology we have now, it is very difficult to make mistakes, especially with dna evidence that has set many people free.","death-penalty","02:47 PM","crime-debates","228"

Here in Colorado, the state just released a convicted murderer after 10 years in Max. It was conclusively proved that he did not commit the murder for which he was convicted. 12 tried and true jurors convicted this man. If the DP had been applied in his case, it would have been judicial murder, for which all Coloradans would have shared the blame. BTW, the prosecutors who hid the exculpatory evidence from the defense 10 years ago are now judges. How much money is the missing 10 years worth to an innocent man. He went to prison as a boy of 21? How does $1M per annum sound to you? You can read about it here: Convicted by doodles, Masters is freed by DNA - CNN.com","death-penalty","05:08 PM","crime-debates","229"

This was purely the fault of the prosecutor(s) who hid the evidence. It's like I said, depending on the circumstances. There was no real physical evidence that linked him to the murder which should have sent off several warning lights. A 15 year old kid would have a hard time trying to hid committing such an act of murder. 1 million a year, I think, isn't enough. If anything, the prosecutors (now Judges) should pay it out of their own pockets for not disclosing this evidence that was crucial to the defense.","death-penalty","05:46 PM","crime-debates","230"

(Except Self defense). I don't care if it was a crime of ""passion"". If you chose to kill someone who wasn't endangering your life at the moment you deserve to be killed. None of this poor criminal bs. You did the crime you pay for it. No its not an eye for an eye. Because the criminal and the person they killed weren't equal. One was a victim the other a murderer. There's a difference. Them being executed doesn't make up for the loss of the victim. It only insures that the rest of their life isn't wasting someone's time and mocking the victims death by them living happily.","death-penalty","10:44 PM","crime-debates","240"
