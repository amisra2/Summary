If you really want to improve the system, then you have to work at it, not just say that innocent people are dying and we can't do anything about it. That may be so, but it does nothing to answer the problem. Did he deserve to die for his crime?","Omegamon_X","314925","One man's quitting is another man's realization that nothing can be done so there's no point in wasting further resources trying. Considering this new information I'm going to have to say no on this one. At the time I was unaware that something like this actually happened. I didn't know that the term ""child predator"" could also be used to apply to kids who knowingly get adults into trouble like this.","death-penalty","09:43 AM","crime-debates","46"

I have used the word callous in a previous post. It fits like a glove. What new information? I gave all this information in post 42. Your callous ""well he should have known better"" reply was post 44. I asked again if this man should die in post 45. And now you say there is some new information that has changed your mind as to whether he should die? You show a willful disregard for the lives and suffering of your fellow man.

What you're proposing is completely removing the human element, and letting God Himself hold all trials and make all the decisions. Humans by their very nature are very flawed beings, prone to making mistakes at varying intervals. Evidence either gets lost or deliberately withheld so the case presented is biased in one direction or another. This happens every single day, and we can't base all future decisions on ""What if we're not being told every last single detail"", so we have to go by purely what's presented to us at the time of the trial. So if somebody is found guilty and sentenced to death based solely on the information provided, and it's discovered too late that the evidence was incomplete then that's simply too bad, but there's nothing we can do about it.","death-penalty","07:53 PM","crime-debates","50"

The simple solution to your ""insoluble"" problem scenario is that the state should not kill its citizens, on the basis that it can never be absolutely certain that any individual is guilty. Locking him up because we are 99% sure is acceptable, since if we later find an error, we can correct it.","death-penalty","08:07 PM","crime-debates","51"
"07-03-2008","11312",4,"iangb","314999","...you could have accepted that nothing is 100% perfect and imprisoned the criminal for life, instead. That way should they be later acquitted it is never too late. We made the system. That means we can always improve on it, unless it is perfect. Clearly this is not yet the case.","Omegamon_X","315017","Unacceptable when you consider the people we're talking about in this discussion. There's simply no way to improve on the system, it's as good as it's gonna get and that's the long and short of it. Human being aren't perfect and can't be made perfect. Anything we touch is going to be imperfect in one area or another.","death-penalty","09:36 PM","crime-debates","53"
"07-03-2008","11312",4,"iangb","315020","What, the people who are occasionally entirely innocent? Or the murderers who killed someone because they did something that the murderer considered worthy of punishment by death? See my hypocrisy point, still out there. I've given you a way to improve on it - abolish it, and use one that is not hypocritical and does not risk killing innocent people. Are you so desperate to kill criminals that you don't mind murdering innocents? That's lynch mob mentality.","Omegamon_X","315040","Child rapists is who we're discussing. These are the people that deserve to die for their crimes. Unacceptable. Paying for the permanent housing and care of a person that is beyond all hopes of rehabilitation is absolutely, 100% unacceptable as an option. Lynch mob mentality is the bypassing of the justice system entirely and doing what they perceive as ""right"". What I'm supporting is the death of people the justice system has ruled as being bad enough that they're worth killing.","death-penalty","10:29 PM","crime-debates","55"
"07-04-2008","11312",4,"iangb","315077","Firstly, prove 'beyond all hope of rehabilitation'. Especially given that you have accepted that some innocent people are executed. Secondly, it is often more expensive to execute than to incarcerate for life. No, you're trying to trying to change the justice system so that it reclassifies paedophiles as 'worth killing'. See your first post in this topic. That's attempting to do what you perceive as right, despite the fact that you will kill innocents on the way (which is arguably a breach of justice).","Omegamon_X","315088","Look at their recidivism rates. The First Amendment says we have a right to petition the government for a redress of grievances. One of the many grievances I have is that child rapists don't qualify for the death penalty unless the child that gets raped is also killed. I'm sick and tired of scumbags raping kids and being allowed out of prison only to rape again, it's unacceptable.","death-penalty","10:22 AM","crime-debates","57"
"07-06-2008","11312",4,"wikipedia","None","Look at their recidivism rates.

Disproportionate reaction? Then be honest about your intentions, rather than saying you are just 'trying to support the justice system'. Then lock them up for life. How does this give them the opportunity to rape again?","death-penalty","01:26 PM","crime-debates","58"

New DNA and forensic technology are working to alleviate this problem. Say what?? More murders are committed by black-on-black violence. And more people who are on death row are white!
