These stop criminals ""dead"" in their tracks. If I use any of these, the criminal cant ever repeat his crime. But with your prefered "" non lethal"" means of self defense, a repeat is highly likely, as our judicial system believes in just giving a criminal a slap on the wrist.","death-penalty","01:58 PM","crime-debates","196"

As I asked you previously, what if the victim had been a member of your family and you had extracted private justice? What would your widow tell your daughter if the members of the released man's family had taken you out for murdering their child/husband/brother? Do you get that there was no crime that he could have repeated, because he didn't commit one in the first place? Do you get that we are not living in the days of the Hatfields and the McCoys? Do you get that, if he had been executed that it would have been a judicially sanctioned murder?","death-penalty","08:23 AM","crime-debates","199"

As much as I love my child, people do lie, and just because a family member made an acusation does not always make it so. I would have to be absolutely certain that the man accused is the one who actually did it.","death-penalty","12:15 PM","crime-debates","200"

I don't see why we refuse to treat serial killers and child rapists in the same manner. To me it just makes sense. If you've been convicted three times on murder, and each time you got out early just to kill again, then you don't deserve anymore chances, you should be put to death because everyone knows that you're just going to murder again and again and again. They shouldn't be released into the general populace, nor should they be allowed to take up valuable prison space that could be better used by other criminals who keep getting let out due to overcrowding.","death-penalty","05:17 PM","crime-debates","202"

And to me, it makes sense that my opinion is worth more than yours, so there Really, I must say, when I listen to people in this forum and corellate how many a) want to have guns and b) brag of what they'd do if anyone hurt their little girl... Well, I just read this on a judo site and loved it:","grizzly6626","329271","I guess you are another gun hater, and hater of people who own guns, even though a law biding gun owner has done absolutely nothing to you. I have a response to your juno posting, when is the last time you heard that an NRA member commited murder, or raped a child, or raped anyone for that matter, and just so you dont get the wrong idea, I am not a member of the NRA. You all seem to think that everyone who has a gun is the same, but that is not true. People who have guns or knives can either be good or evil, but not both. I have had an assault rifle pulled on me in the past by a violent criminal, that is one reason I am so keen on the idea of arming as many lawfull people as possible. Let me ask you this, has putting criminals in prison slowed the rate of crime down. Do you feel safe knowing that if you are facing a guy with a gun, and he is going to possibly kill you, that his going to jail is going to save your life. Do you believe a violent criminal is somehow going to stop what he is intending on doing to you so you can call the police, he is going to kill you graveyard dead, no questions asked. People should and do have the legal and moral right to defend their lives with lethal force if neccessary. One last question, if you were in a convienience store getting gas or a coke, and a violent criminal came in and shot the clerk, and before the criminal could eliminate you as a witness to the crime, one of the other customers in the store shoots the criminal dead, and you learn the guy who just made sure you lived was an NRA member with a carry concealed licsense, would you tell that man that you dont think he should have a gun, or preach to him about how bad guns are in anybodys hands. Think about it.","death-penalty","11:19 PM","crime-debates","205"

An education is useless unless the person receiving it genuinely wants to better themselves and achieve greatness. It doesn't matter how hard you try, giving a sociopath serial murderer a Harvard degree isn't going to make them stop killing for enjoyment. Hypothetical situation, somebody has been in and out of prisons for most of their life, and everytime they get out they murder someone in cold blood and go right back to prison again. Are you going to keep offering them opportunities for change, when they've proven 13 times that they don't want to change?","death-penalty","11:15 AM","crime-debates","210"
