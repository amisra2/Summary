But if they believe in killing a man who has without provocation, savagely attacked a family member, then they are my kind of people, you dont by chance have any of their phone numbers do you. All jokes aside, you deal with crime your way, and I will deal with it my way. I will even do something for you that I bet you are not willing to do for me, I am not going to rag on you anymore for your beliefs in how a violent criminal should be dealt with, after all you are entitled to your beliefs and the right to express your beliefs, doesnt mean that I dont think you are wrong though.","chester","328507","Good way to end - with an agreement to disagree.

Just curious.","Penfold","328517",""" Kill one, you are a murderer, Kill thousands, you are a conqueror, kill millions you are a god."" is the quotation I was thinking of...But you not only hate this hypothetical person so badly you want to kill them, you want to torture them first.","death-penalty","06:33 PM","crime-debates","182"

"10-17-2008","11312",13,"iangb","328589","I really can't see this reworded as ""evil only loses if it's been tortured to death"", though. Seeing as Ethmi didn't like my 'evasion' (which I find impressive, evading something that wasn't aimed at me), another response. Scenario (to clarify): grizzly's child is raped. He catches the rapist, tortures them to death, and then is found guilty of murder and executed. Problem 1: What sort of message, grizzly, are you then giving to your child - who you have now left fatherless? The one they will take is - ""It's OK to break certain bits of the law if you think you can justify it"". Is that really one of lhe last impressions you would wish to leave on your child? Problem 2: Presumably, somewhere the rapist has familly. What argument would you give to them that would prevent them from torturing you to death, just as you have killed their son/brother/etc? Now consider the alternative. You catch the rapist, and hand them over to the criminal justice system. They lock him away for a length of time, and prevent him from legally working with children ever again. He may go on to rape again, but this is a problem that can be improved on - and not by the methods that you are suggesting. You bring your daughter up as a happy member of society rather than forcing her to live as a rape victim without a father figure. I really can't see why you would choose your original scenario.","grizzly6626","328592","People have been going to jail as far back as time nearly, and yet crime has gotten worse, criminals know that they will only serve a short time in prison because of early releases and parroll and so on. You gave me a scenario, so now I will give you one, a man savagely rapes you 13 year old daughter, you catch him and hold him till the police get there, he is arrested, tried, convicted, and sentenced to 20 years for his crime. Five years later, you find out he is getting out on parroll for good behavior. During that previous 5 years of his incarseration, you have spent a small fortune on counseling for you daughter who had been raped. The rapist is now out of jail, one night you are working late at the office, and you get a phone call, its the police, and they tell you that you need to come home now. So you hurry home, and upon your arrival the police inform you that your daughter, the one who was raped, was found raped and murdered and we have the rapist/killer in custody. It turns out to be the original rapist, exacting revenge on you and your daughter for putting him in jail. Now how would you feel if something like this happened to you and your child. What if the rapist raped your sister, or niece next time, what if your daughter took her own life as a result of the rapist getting out of jail after only five years or any length of time for that matter. All because you did not make certain that the guy that raped your daughter would never again repeat the crime. I just would not take a chance that somehow this rapist is going to turn into a model citizen while doing a short stretch in prison. Statistics show that a large number of convicted criminals go right back to their crimes after being released from prison. No, death is the one sure way to prevent repeats from violent criminals. And what message would I be sending my child, the message that the guy who did that to her wont do it again.","death-penalty","09:39 AM","crime-debates","185"

The rate of violent crime began to decline during the Clinton Administration, and it now stands at its lowest level in more than 30 years.

Any criminal in the world would just love to have you on his jury. I am not going to respond to any more of your posts, as I now see it is simply a waste of my time and energy. It is people like you that let violent criminals walk free, because you evidently feel sorrow for them. Every post you put up insinuates that we should do nothing more to a violent criminal thyan let him go scott free. I am done with you.","death-penalty","08:49 AM","crime-debates","188"

Murder thousands, you are a mass murderer or a terrorist. Murderer millions, you are a war criminal and have commited genocide. This is a lot more logical to me, and I am pretty sure history and society reflect this as well. But I know already you are going to argue it.","death-penalty","01:30 PM","crime-debates","192"

As for the family of the rapist, I would simply tell them thet he chose to do what he did and it cost him his life, I would tell them I am sorry for their pain, but I have absolutely no sorrow for my act of killing their family member, because he chose to break the law and rape my child. My actions and his may both be against the law, but I didnt make him a victim as he did my daughter, after that, they can do whatever they want to me, at least my child would be safe from him. As far as simply handing this rapist over to the police, I would not have so much of an issue with this if the judicial system would throw him in prison until he is dead, but thats not what will happen. He will get twenty years, and be out in as little as five years, only to repeat his crime or retaliate against my family. No thank you, I still prefer my way of handling a violent criminal, because my way is permanent punishment, no getting out after just a few years, no retaliation, and no repeat of the crime.","death-penalty","01:47 PM","crime-debates","194"
