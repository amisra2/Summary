By the way, in some prison, there are people who learn things, and can develop a sort of life, though it's not comparable to a regular one. No matter what kind of life it is, if it's bearable, it's always better than death. Innocent people have nothing to do with the guilty, therefore they should not pay, in any way, the price for others. Of course I wish you not to face such a situation ever. I still wonder how this risk can be accepted. Justice is not perfect, as you said, since it's a human enterprise, I got it, but its goal is to propose the best system possible. If you start from the principle that mistakes leading to death of innocent people can be made, even at a very low percentage, it's letting entrance to some random factor, an unbearable thing when it comes to life and death. That makes me think about the competitive examination you can do to get a job, which puts most people on a quite equal ground; but some propose a fistful of jobs for some thousands candidates. The system still works, but there are some external factors that come into account when the jury has to choose eventually among the best ones. Sometimes there is no way to distinct them except chosing the one who has the best tie or the most beautiful legs. When the ""bad luck"" factor takes care of you when you're judged for a murder you did not commit, I still don't see how you can accept it. Well, I know I'm a little redundant here, but you talk about the probability of this happening to your children as if it were a normal thing, and that's beyond me. the absence of weapons in my country is a powerful way to avoid a higher murder rate. Violent agressions still happen, but do not lead to death as often as they do in, say, your state of California. Here we see and you already knew that before the means to solve a problem we can think of the means to avoid them. what gave birth to the monsters, actually? You gave a bit of the answer. I don't support any violence on the pretext of poverty, segregation , etc, but I can understand how it happens. it's a known fact that power makes you a thug, generally. But it would be smarter to act in a wise way and not as a thug, because, yes, what goes around comes around. children get used to violence through its representation. some people view sexual practice through extreme movies, when it's totally remote from what people need and want. I can distinguish a movie or a game and reality, but I have observed how some images leave marks on a child's mind. There are, also, the famous videos displaying children going literally mad because of a failure at a video game. There is an association in that sense, not all the people have a a resistant mind enough not to be influenced at all by these media. Because you have been smart enough to make your own personnality and to find your own way of raising them. For this you have my congratulations but we are not all the same. You seem to interpret a more reasoned sentence (that is, not death penalty) as a sign of weakness. Violence and non-violence are not equals. Education is supposed to give people the tools to live together in peace when the conditions allow them to. Education is the first thing. Death penalty is at the end. I didn't get that one.","josephdphillips","395580","I don't want to rehabilitate murderers. I want to kill them. In a perfect world, yes, but I don't live in a perfect world. If one unintended result of capital punishment is an errant execution now and then, that's the price society, at least in California, is willing to pay. I live in an active earthquake zone. I accept the risk of dying every day. Actually, no, it's not. The goal is to achieve something that works. Perfect justice is neither attainable or desirable. It's quite bearable, thank you. The execution of innocents does not bother me. You're not making much sense here. It could be a lot worse. I accept the risk because it's too small to be worth considering. The chance of being wrongly executed by the state is negligible. I'd have to hit the royal in Las Vegas five times consecutively before I start worrying about one of my children being falsely accused of murder, wrongly convicted for the crime and mistakenly executed. Guns are part of American culture and always will be. There's a good reason for that. You French will give up wine and cheese before we give up firearms. What causes antisocial behavior is no big secret. It's the antisocial person himself. As I stated before, it's not upbringing or environment. It's simply a matter of attitude. You obviously didn't grow up poor. That argument can be used against all forms of law enforcement. By your logic we should not have any police, prisons, courts, etc. My problem isn't with thugs. It's with murderers. I'm not against violence. I am against malicious, premeditated homicide. That children are inured to violence isn't a bad thing. They should have an appreciation of violence and its consequences as early as possible. People don't need pornography to fantasize about sexual practices. They've been doing that for thousands of years, long before the advent of porn. Those are children that require more vigorous discipline. It's not the video games that are the problem. The children themselves are the problem. The media are not the problem. The children are the problem. I'm not that smart, and yes, we are the same. We each make choices. We each are responsible for our individual actions. That I accepted my responsibilities has to do with attitude, not intelligence. Yep. The death penalty educates the best. Of course, we do not exploit the educational value of capital punishment, as we should. The uneducated are mostly law-abiding and extremely few of them commit acts of murder. Education is not the answer. Harsh, unyielding and merciless punishment is the answer. It is often said that low self-esteem makes one angry and can make one violent. That may be true for people who act out, using their fists or who grab stacks of dishes and throw them to the floor. That is not true about people who murder. The extremely violent are sociopaths, in love with themselves, and hold themselves to be above the law.","death-penalty","12:40 PM","crime-debates","272"

If I understand you, you're saying benevolent government produces benevolent people. If that is what you believe, I am compelled to disagree, because people are not by nature benevolent.","death-penalty","10:51 AM","crime-debates","275"

I also think we were not born malevolant. We just need to receive a good education, with the best guidelines possible. I can't say a benevolent government produces benevolent people. There is no such ""perfect world"" indeed because it's not that simple. But I would say a place where you have the means to learn a better social behaviour is a place where you will see less violent acts, like murders.

The percentage of the population which refrains from murder is 99.9995, about the same as it is in France. If you're telling me there's something that 99.9995 percent can do to convince the 0.0005 percent NOT to murder, other than to harshly punish the crime, I would say you're being nave and foolish.","death-penalty","10:39 AM","crime-debates","277"

Homicide rates in DC are the lowest since 1966 now that firearms have been legal in DC for a whole year. District of Columbia Crime Rates 1960 - 2008 Metropolitan Police Department: Crime and Activity Statistics I also couldn't help but notice that the US cities you mentioned have tough gun laws, especially DC, where, until recently, a private citizen could not own a firearm.","death-penalty","06:37 PM","crime-debates","282"

Such people are no different from those that are inclined to use their truck to plow into a crowd of innocent bystanders, which happened in the Akihabara district in Japan. Don't allow dangerous people to remain free in society. That's the simplest way to go about cutting the number of crimes that occur. Don't come up with the nonsensical idea that you can somehow neuter these people if you just take away legal weaponry that they might choose to use.","death-penalty","07:12 PM","crime-debates","283"
"03-25-2010","11312",19,"None","None","None","olivortex","395875","NATO: It's true that danger comes from people, and that a gun is dangerous only when used. But if you don't allow use of firearms, it's less easy to kill people, whatever the crime rate is, because the means of killing is less powerful. Simpy put: a dangerous man with a knife is less dangerous than a dangerous man with a gun. That's why I've focused on Japan, I thought it was a good exemple of a culture with its flaws but without the danger increased by the use of firearms. Otherwise, I hope you have read the posts I have written while I was disussing with Joseph. COBHC: I will look for more information about gun laws, etc.","death-penalty","05:25 AM","crime-debates","284"
