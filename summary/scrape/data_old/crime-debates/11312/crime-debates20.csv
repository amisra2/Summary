What I say is that guns are a fast and easy way to kill people (even when you don't intend to, by the way). Bombings don't happen very often, on a large time scale. Gun murders are frequent. Yes. No. It seems Jack the Ripper was a serial killer, a psychopath. I don't see the point you're making here. They seem to be saying that assault weapons' chance to be restricted are higher because of their looks. I assume you're telling the truth, though I can't find a document to confirm it online. Here I join you to say we live in a world of contradiction and hypocrisy. I didn't found the Violence Policy Center. Anyway I don't see why they would cheat on figures, even less if they are an organisation that sells guns. France makes lots of weapons and sells it to other countries, but Jacques Chirac was against war in Iraq and had a generally peaceful discourse. In my country we have a quite easy access to some vaccins and all kinds of medecine that are not available in other countries of the third world. So yeah, if you can remove the cause, you won't have the effect. How come there is no way? Who says cars will last as long as man exists? I know the car market is strong and impossible to ignore today but it doesn't mean it will last forever. Forever is a long time, and nothing prevents us from making some effort to start the change. How come guns are not available in France the same way they are in a considerable number of states in the States? I have understood guns are part of american culture, but it's not a reason to think they can't be removed. Things change. Who's whining and crying? I'm just sharing my point of view on the topic. And to be more on topic, I consider death penalty as legal murder.","NATO 556","395917","So what would you suggest a ban on next? Then don't use them unless you're fully prepared to kill if its necessary. These aren't toys you know. They happen often enough. And death by AIDS are more frequent and common than both. Ignorance. First you admitted it was the people who did the killing, now you're saying that the people aren't a problem but instead their hardware is. I'm really glad you said this. Now we've established (and you've admitted) that there are people in the world who would kill even if you took away their tools. Now that we've got this point established, what exactly is your answer to them being in the general public? And how do we as citizens protect ourselves against them? You said you don't believe that the VPC would cheat, that they'd be honest about their agenda and not use trickery. And here we've got the head guy saying that because of a weapon's appearance, the public's interest can be exploited into support for a useless law. https://www.atfonline.gov/fflezcheck...5Pp7ftolbGmkTy Right from the mouth of the ATF. Your attitude suggests naivety about the world and how it works. Theirs is an organization founded on fear and political agenda. They support gun bans, not gun ownership. The facts of the real world don't support their message of fear, so they have to come up with a load of BS to shape the figures into what they say they are. Take for example how they said 95% of all guns in Mexico came from the United States. What they'll never tell you is that 95% of the fraction that Mexico turned over for the ATF to trace came from the United States. But they refused to turn over most of the confiscated weapons for tracing purposes. There's a difference between the Violence Policy Center and France. The VPC is actively calling for a ban on guns and using fear and trickery to try and further their message. And on the flipside they have an FFL license, which only applies to businesses that intend to sell guns. So why would they have a business license to deal in the buying and selling of guns, when they're calling for public support of more and more weapons restrictions? That would be like Obama wanting to see segregation brought back against black people. Except for the fact that such isn't realistic or possible. If you've even got France in the business of the arms trade, playing an active role, then you're gonna be hard pressed to get any country to stop making and selling weapons. Even if you could, you'd never be able to find, confiscate and destroy them all. There's always going to be enough left that somebody will be able to make more based on existing specimens. Guns have been around since at least the 1500s and in continuous production, made by the millions since their creation by people in all manner of shops and locations either with or without regulation. And that's just the ones the governments know about. Let's see the car industry compare to that. That's like the city of Chicago implementing their gun ban in hopes that other cities would follow their example. It simply doesn't work and it's pointless to make the attempt. It's a waste of time and resources that could be better spent focusing on dealing with the people most likely to offend. Because France chose to surrender. Just because things can change, doesn't mean that they should change. There's no reason to believe that we need to look for ways to implement a general gun ban of any sort. You qualify as the crier of the discussion since you still support the mentality of ""If guns didn't exist."" There's no such thing as legal murder, since murder is illegal by nature. Society is responsible for the death penalty, and society makes up the rules by which we're governed.","death-penalty","01:51 PM","crime-debates","290"
"03-26-2010","11312",20,"None","None","None","Montanae","396027","First off, for your pole. Is the Death Penalty murder? Why yes, yes it is. If you accidentally hit a person with a basketball while trying to shoot it, did it hit them? Yes it did. Was it on accident? Yes it was. It doesn't matter, it still happened. The same with the DP. I don't care if it is in the name of justice or if someone just wants to avenge a death, murder is murder, no matter how it is done. Doing it one way, does not make it right. However, that is where I begin to become a mass of contradictions. Yes, as I have just said, the DP is murder. It is just murder that people have called in the name of justice. Taking a life for a/many life/lives. Murder is murder, and murder is wrong. However, I do believe for CERTAIN individuals (such as, and these are examples over time as these people are not alive any longer, Gilles de Rais, Richard Trenton Chase, Jeffrey Dahmer, Albert Fish ,Andrei Chikatilo, Joachim Kroll, Dennis Rader, John Haigh, Javed Iqbal, Ted Bundy, etc.*) that it cannot, and should not, be avoided. I don't think that it should be done in a bloody way, but, when you think about it, what if these people were smart enough to escape, and got out? What if they came after someone in your family? With that on your mind, what if they came after you? So, now, should it be avoided? Is it still right? ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ *These stories are horrid, and, I do not suggest that those who do not have a strong stomach read that of Albert Fish or those after. I tried to get more examples, but, half way reading through the list, I felt as if I was going to hurl, and so I left it alone. You have been warned. ( PLEASE be warned against Albert Fish. Perhaps I just can't stomach gore, but, it is... Disturbing.)","death-penalty","11:49 AM","crime-debates","292"
"03-28-2010","11312",20,"Montanae","396027","First off, for your pole. Is the Death Penalty murder? Why yes, yes it is. Murder, as defined in common law countries, is the unlawful killing of another human being with intent (or malice aforethought), and generally this state of mind distinguishes murder from other forms of unlawful homicide (such as manslaughter). Murder - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia However, I do believe for CERTAIN individuals (such as, and these are examples over time as these people are not alive any longer, Gilles de Rais, Richard Trenton Chase, Jeffrey Dahmer, Albert Fish ,Andrei Chikatilo, Joachim Kroll, Dennis Rader, John Haigh, Javed Iqbal, Ted Bundy, etc.*) that it cannot, and should not, be avoided. I don't think that it should be done in a bloody way, but, when you think about it, what if these people were smart enough to escape, and got out?","snakespit","396280","No actually, it's not. Murder is a legal definition. Is the death penalty ""killing""...yes. Currently, the death penalty is lawful in the US, therefore it cannot be defined as murder. I don't normally use Wiki, but it clearly spells it out right in the first sentence. So it's ok to judge people based on the severity of their crimes and punish them accordingly...even if that punishment is death? I agree. That is why we have trials by jury, and specific qualifying and disqualifying criteria for the use of the death penalty.","death-penalty","09:30 PM","crime-debates","294"
"03-29-2010","11312",20,"olivortex","396309","Therefore pools and guns should receive the same treatment, but they don't because it's more politically correct to blame guns. I can also say: if we allow guns, why don't we allow bazookas? If you put a gun in my hand I may not become a murderer at once, but I could feel more secure and If on top of that I was a little stupid, I may say and do stupid things that could lead me to use the gun. For example I could feel safe enough to wander through a neighbourhood I was too scared to enter before I got the gun. Then I meet some guy who wants my money. I get nervous and I take my gun out of my pocket. But since anyone has the right to carry one, the other guy has his own, of course. You know the rest of this little scenario. Sorry, I wasn't born a good story-teller, I've tried to make it short! I have read somewhere (is it true?)that if you took away the gun homicides from the US statistics, the US murder rate would still be higher than in european countries. But the fraction that is substracted is not negligible. We talk about human lives; if we can avoid this fraction of murder from happening, don't you think it's a good thing? To say it another way It seems that guns worsen things About the feasibility of guns eradication - I must admit I'm not as pessimistic as others can be.","NATO 556","396322","Oh this is gonna be fun... That's quite accurate. I was under the impression bazookas were legal so long as the right paperwork is in order. So you're claiming to be a stupid person? Usually those that are demanding your money in a bad neighborhood aren't the kind of people who can legally own a firearm in the first place. So you just can't write this one off as ""the bad guy has a right to have a gun"" because that's not true. Even if you didn't have a gun, the guy after your money would still have one and you'd be on the short end of the stick, or on the mortician's slab. Simply put, no. Because what we're talking about are fundamental rights of the people. And you're not allowed to trade those rights for some degree of perceived security; especially when that perceived security isn't real. You could certainly stop a lot of racial hatred going on if you did away with the First Amendment's protection on free speech, but I'm sure a lot of people would say the cost is too much for what might be the achievable benefit. They also make things better. It depends on who you ask. Nor are you as realistic.","death-penalty","01:58 PM","crime-debates","299"

Or, at least, it sounded as if you agreed with me. Murder is: kill intentionally and with premeditation; ""The mafia boss ordered his enemies murdered"" mangle: alter so as to make unrecognizable; ""The tourists murdered the French language"" unlawful premeditated killing of a human being by a human being So, I can't see where I'm wrong. Trust me, you don't kill someone without thinking about it first. Even if you think about it a second before you do it, you thought about it, and, then, it classifies it as murder. As long as your eyes and brain register what you are doing, you're thinking about it. To me thinking = premeditated. Correct me if my equation is wrong. And? Didn't I say I was a mass of contradictions? I don't care about trials by jury or specific qualifying and disqualifying criteria for the use of the dp. I don't like it, but, what I'm saying is that death should be given without a trial. Perhaps I should have made that clear the first go around?","death-penalty","03:26 PM","crime-debates","300"
