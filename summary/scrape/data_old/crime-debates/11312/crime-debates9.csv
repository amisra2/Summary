What about all their future potential victims, don't they deserve some consideration?","chester","327161","Of course they do, but how is killing another person ""consideration""? Now there are two grieving families, and the DP has added to the toll of misery. Locking the murderer, provided that (s)he is indeed the murderer, for the rest of her/his life in a manner that makes it impossible that (s)he will harm another is a fairer and cheaper solution to the problem. BTW, how do you know the person that has been released is a ""known killer""? Convicted murderers are not released on bail. But you knew that, and you also know it was just your try to add more heat than light to the debate.","death-penalty","08:48 AM","crime-debates","121"

Heck its easier to murder someone than kidnap them. You people holding criminals hands and telling them that their life has value even after they have devalued anothers life is ridculous and weak. Honestly its people like you that are the reason that so many murders happen to begin with.","death-penalty","12:06 PM","crime-debates","123"

And until I see some stats of just how many people are wrongly convicted, I'm not changing my position that the death penalty is a good idea. Let's face simple facts here. The people who qualify for the death penalty are charged with committing some considerably heinous crime(s) that society has deemed unacceptable. That means they're not fit to remain free amongst society, and I don't see why they deserve to be taken care of for the rest of their lives by American tax payers. The death penalty is the only acceptable answer in this case.","death-penalty","07:47 PM","crime-debates","126"

Being locked in an 8x12 for the rest of one's life hardly qualifies as being taken care of. Besides which, it cost less to incarcerate someone for life than it does to execute him/her.","death-penalty","08:25 PM","crime-debates","127"

A thing can be widely known while some can remain ignorant of the fact. "" ..Report of the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice The additional cost of confining an inmate to death row, as compared to the maximum security prisons where those sentenced to life without possibility of parole ordinarily serve their sentences, is $90,000 per year per inmate. With Californias current death row population of 670, that accounts for $63.3 million annually. Using conservative rough projections, the Commission estimates the annual costs of the present (death penalty) system to be $137 million per year. The cost of the present system with reforms recommended by the Commission to ensure a fair process would be $232.7 million per year. The cost of a system in which the number of death-eligible crimes was significantly narrowed would be $130 million per year.

"10-11-2008","11312",9,"None","None","None","gansao","327374","When Britain abolished hanging for murder in the sixties the public was promised a life sentence would mean just that but very few murderers since have spent thier whole life in jail, mainly just a few high profile gansters and child killers. Other murderers that had committed far more brutal crimes than them but kept thier mouths shut were released much earlier. I think that murder should carry a whole life term with no chance of release. We have recently had two people released on appeal from a life sentence for murder. I remember at the time the newspapers reported one of them as an open and shut case but apparently the forensic evidence was misinterpreted by the 'experts' and he was innocent all along. If he was hung we would never know the truth.","death-penalty","05:24 AM","crime-debates","133"
