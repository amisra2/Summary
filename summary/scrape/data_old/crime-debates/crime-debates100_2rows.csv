"10-27-2008","1","11312","223","Charliegone","329878","IMHO, both sides are correct. There are times when it is necessary, others when it is not. The problem resides on when, how, who and what. Like I said, certain factors are what determine the usage of the death penalty. Our justice system might be flawed to some degree, but for the most part it works well. Self-preservation is another story as are wars that are fought, because those are more complicated than killing someone because ""they looked at you funny.""","chester","329989","What group of fallible human beings do you see fit to make the ultimate judgment on the life of another fallible human being? What standards shall they use? Who gets to determine whether the standards they use are the correct standards? What happens when one disagrees with the standards used? If we were all Platonic guardians equipped with perfect judgment and perfect rationality, then I might agree. Since we are not, then I cannot support the Death Penalty.","death-penalty","11:06 AM","crime-debates",86

That is why there is always another decision to decide whether the death penalty applies or not. No one said we are perfect, but neither should be lenient towards people who commit horrible crimes.","death-penalty","06:42 PM","crime-debates",59

Why do you assume that, because I oppose the Death Penalty, that I favor ""lenient"" treatment of those convicted of heinous crimes? BTW, if there are 12 fallible human beings on a jury, has fallibility been multiplied by 12 or divided by 12?","death-penalty","07:55 PM","crime-debates",63

I said we shouldn't be lenient on them. I never said, ""Chester wants to be lenient on criminals"" did I? I don't know whether you understand how the justice system works, but anyways there would be far more fallibility if there were less people to decide. That is why 12 people are chosen to decided whether a person who commits a crime such as murder will face the death penalty or not. It is not just one person who is deciding this persons fate you know.","death-penalty","01:30 AM","crime-debates",109

These stop criminals ""dead"" in their tracks. If I use any of these, the criminal cant ever repeat his crime. But with your prefered "" non lethal"" means of self defense, a repeat is highly likely, as our judicial system believes in just giving a criminal a slap on the wrist.","death-penalty","01:58 PM","crime-debates",109

As I asked you previously, what if the victim had been a member of your family and you had extracted private justice? What would your widow tell your daughter if the members of the released man's family had taken you out for murdering their child/husband/brother? Do you get that there was no crime that he could have repeated, because he didn't commit one in the first place? Do you get that we are not living in the days of the Hatfields and the McCoys? Do you get that, if he had been executed that it would have been a judicially sanctioned murder?","death-penalty","08:23 AM","crime-debates",142

As much as I love my child, people do lie, and just because a family member made an acusation does not always make it so. I would have to be absolutely certain that the man accused is the one who actually did it.","death-penalty","12:15 PM","crime-debates",86
