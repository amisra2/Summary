"04-03-2006","7837",5,"Steeeeve","None","If this is your standard then an unborn qualifies pretty earlier on. At worst you would have to say this unborn qualifies...this is before 3rd trimester. However, even in the first trimester an unborn qould qualify under your standard. Furthermore, you state that it doesn't need to be communicated verbally or physically....I never said it did and if this were the case why does the unborn require this? An Alzheimers patient in the severe stage is no more capable than the unborn in the link I just provided you. This is not an opinion based on observation...look at a brain scan of someone with Alzheimers. It is a little unreasonable to say a sperm is its own unique person. The sperm is not a human by itself and would die without being part of the whole. So my standard does rest with reasonableness but it sets no standard for anything human. Maybe a better way to put it is all humans are given the chance to be a person. I don't know where you got that quote from by the way...please link. So I am not sure where your standard lies. Is it movement or some thought at all? I thouht observation was not the way to determine this. Is it a sense of ""I"" because any doctor will tell you that an Alzheimers patient has no thought of ""I"". And once again, why does your standard have to be King? It seems a standard that is very open ended will surely allow for any error because of our limited knowledge in such a hard moral question.","Another opinion","205318","Your link just shows a human hand. Disturbing as that image is, that image says nothing about whether there is a mind present or not. We are naturally disturbed when we see a human form mangled - from mangled bodies to purposefully staged art images of mangled human forms. Just because we have the emotional reaction doesn't mean that there is substance behind it. We have to separate our emotional reactions from reality. So, what is the reality of such an early fetus? At 10 weeks, there can be spontaneous movement but spontaneous movement is not evidence of a mind controlling that movement. Touch a newly dead (headless) frog in certain spots and it will move around. We should not confuse things that appear to have a mind (ex. movement) with things that actually have a mind. One has to do a full analysis and I trust Science with such analysis (involving the back-and-forth debate within pear-reviewed publications). So, if you claim that a first trimester fetus qualifies under my standard of having a rudimentary mind since it shows spontaneous movement, then that is a false arguement. Purposeful movement (i.e. choosing to lift up one's hand) is another thing all together and that only happens later in the pregnancy. First, the link from another page of your same web site (about the organization who wrote your site): http://www.birthpsychology.com/apppah/index.html As for your standard, if it is a standard that all human life be given the cance to be a person, then a sperm is also human life. Why not give it a chance to become a person? Also, from your wording, it sounds like you acknowledge that a newly fertilized egg is not yet a person. Is that true? My standard lies at the beginning of some internal mental existence that doesn't need to be externally expressed. Since I don't have the background in biology or psychology to judge for myself when thought first starts, I trust Science, which tells me that it is late in the pregnancy when thought can first start. There has to be some reason to set a standard somewhere - otherwise, one can be so openended in one's standard that one requires all sperm and egg be given the chance for becoming people. I set my standard where Science has told me that thought can first start. Since we, as a people, have to set the standard SOMEWHERE, I am presenting this standard and the reasons behind it for consideration of other readers. You are presenting the standard of setting the limit at conception. I am still not clear why you place that moment as being of paramount importance.","early-fetus-not-human","11:51 AM","abortion-debates","62"

A lot of movement (probably the majority of it if we take into account moving to balance weight and smooth muscle stuff as well) requires no concious control from the brain at all, and in many cases you won't even be aware its happening. Don't forget that on top of this there are a lot of instincts babies have as soon as they are born that then are replaced shortly after, grabbing things is one of them.

Its the case with with more traditional reflexs like recoiling after touching something sharp or hot, or when your leg moves when the knee is tapped (which is one the balancing ones I mentioned). On top of that there are the frog leg and lizard tail examples. The laughing and coughing on is almost certainly going to be a reflex (you don't conciously move when you are poked or prodded unexpectedly, the signal doesn't even go up to the brain until after the movement is complete in these sort of cases in adults), the grasping one I'm less sure about as I don't know entirely where instinct works within the brain.","early-fetus-not-human","02:03 PM","abortion-debates","66"

From that website: ""By 15 weeks, ultrasound reveals babies moving in reaction to something as simple as a mother's laugh or cough"". So if 10 weeks isn't good enough for you..surely 15 is. How is a sperm a human life? But it doesn't tell you this. You haven't shown anything to suggest this! In fact, my evidence shows the exact opposite. I just don't know what thoughts and emotions you are looking for. I baby grabbing someones finger isn't good enough (that is a common photo btw)...a baby reacting to a mother isn't good enough....I don't know what functions you wish to have. An Alzheimers patient has all reactionary responses in the late stages..The breath and sometimes react to getting kicked in the knee...this is like the 15week old fetus listed above! Yet you find the Alzheimers patient to clearly be a person but the fetus not. I don't understand where you draw the line...please provide some scientific evidence...as I have to support your claim. As for my stance...it is very different from yours. Right now I am just arguing that your standard would lend a different result than what you have...however, my standard (the non-standard) doesn't play word games by trying to define person and human. A human is a person...it has never not been this way up until recently when people tried to find a difference. All of this differences prove nothing and are based on arbitrary points that change.","Another opinion","205358","I believe Tastyfish has already addressed these (Thanks, Tastyfish). If your requirement is that it is alive and has human DNA, then sperm is a human life. What is the difference between a sperm and a newly fertilized egg? Mainly, the newly fertilized egg has a COMPLETE set of DNA and will begin the growth process into a full human being. What do you think is so precious about a newly fertilized egg that is important enough to take away the woman's right over her own body? One has to distinguish between reflex actions and actions controlled by a mind. When one is emotionally involved, it is easy to read more into reflex actions and disturbing images than the reality supports. Scientists generally agree that thought and true emotional reactions are chiefly held in the cerebral cortex, which is much slower to develop. My evidence on the beginnings of thought were presented in my post #40, quoting from the fourth section of the link: http://www.2think.org/abortion.shtml . As for your evidence, please quote and reference a site that tells that there is no thought or cerebral cortex activity in the late stage Alzheimer's patient. You claim that a newly fertilized egg has always been called a person. I disagree and challenge you to come up with proof of your assertion. It is not word games when people simply disagree with your arbitrary view of what makes a ""person"" (which you have never actually defined in detail). My main goal in coming up with a criteria for abortion law is to analyze what exactly it is that we find precious. For me, there has to be ""somebody"" inhabiting a body for it to be precious enough to overrule a woman's right to her own body. You seem to think that a living human body with ""nobody home"" is more important than an existing woman.","early-fetus-not-human","03:10 PM","abortion-debates","69"
