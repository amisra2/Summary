"03-31-2006","7837",3,"thelmoose","None","This is untrue. Do you just make things up Steveeee? Trimesters are a longstanding medical designation that are related to fetal viability. They are roughly each 12 weeks. Fetal viability prior to the end of the 2nd trimester (24 weeks) is highly unlikely. That is the basis for which 1st and 2nd trimester pregnancy terminations are considered medically appropriate and therefore legal. I think that this may have some bearing on this issue of ""humanhood"". One needs to consider whether the fetus would be able to survive outside the mother's womb. Roe v. Wade did two things. The first thing it did was [it] said that states could not criminalize abortion. The second thing it said was that there was going to be a rather elaborate framework for determining when the states could regulate abortion. This was the famous trimester system that divided the term of pregnancy into three three-month periods. And many people objected to the trimester system because they thought it didn't leave enough discretion in the hands of state legislatures.","Steeeeve","204788","The court made this up in Roe v. Wade....at the end of the 3rd month there is nothing that changes enough to justify calling it something different (2nd trimester). It is just 3 periods....made up by the court...adopted by the medical field (because roe set the 1st trimester rule). http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontl...ws/balkin.html Care to rephrase your statement?","early-fetus-not-human","08:17 AM","abortion-debates","31"
"03-31-2006","7837",3,"thelmoose","None","Yes it does. Of course it does. It means that while your right to an opinion is as valid as anyone's, the scope of your experience does not allow you to express as fervently as you do, opinions about topics with which you have little familiarity.","Steeeeve","204789","appeals to authority is a fallacy that doesn't work. Try again. Who is to say the poster has little knowledge of the subject of abortion? Because he hasn't had an abortion? That is crazy. Does a doctor not know anything about heart disease eventhough he does heart surgery and has never had heart disease?","early-fetus-not-human","08:20 AM","abortion-debates","32"
"03-31-2006","7837",3,"Tastyfish","None","You mean DNA closely matching that of humans? Oh no, wait - you mean DNA closely matching the DNA of organisms that closely match with DNA of organisms we consider humans. Oh no wait...do you really mean organisms that have been shown to be able to breed with you? No problem with the second, which if you don't mind verging off into scifi will also cover AI and Aliens, however the first is just circular reasoning or using such a precise definition that you really don't want it in a legal argument. The second is enough to cover what any one would consider a person, and will hold equally well if we encounter anything really wierd in the future (though a Hive mind might give us an issue). However the first has really just been siezed upon as proof that abortion is wrong by people who really don't know what they are talking about.","Another opinion","204800","In theory, you are right that hypothetical aliens or artificial intelligence as well as possible human-animal hybrids could complicate the picture. However, none of those are part of our current reality, where my definition was based on our current reality. One could make the point that a definition should be all inclusive but it may be impossible to predict all future challenges to a definition, so I would suggest this one until a new reality forces us to rethink our definitions. One could also argue that people are not the only creatures that deserve rights. We also do give a sparse minimum of rights to certain animals against animal cruelty. One could also categorize any sufficiently intelligent hypothetical being (from aliens, to animal-human hybrids, to AI) under a separate category of rights which could or could not be equal to that of people.","early-fetus-not-human","09:49 AM","abortion-debates","33"
"03-31-2006","7837",3,"Steeeeve","None","I dont discriminate based on how much ""mind"" someone has. I am no more a person than a severly mentally retarded person is. Your claim would be that a person with asheimers disease is not a person. If they are not a person then why treat them as such? It is an inconsistent standard or an arbitary standard that you place. Third trimester is not scientific at all but rather a court made thing to say ""3 periods"". As for why I think a person deserves rights at conception (or soon after) is because it is the only nondiscriminative way to look at it. It provides equality as well and because this is an unsure question it is always best to take the safest stance.","Another opinion","204803","You are missing the point. Of course Alzeimer's patients and the mentally retarded have minds. I do not discriminate against anyone with a mind. I do discriminate against living human bodies without ANY minds. You may not discriminate how much mind a human has but I would guess that you would also be willing to discriminate against a human that has no mind at all - for example, someone who is pronounced brain dead, but who is being kept artificially alive via machine. The part of our brains that develop the earliest are only those that control the machinery of our body (blood flow, digestion, etc.). It is only later in the pregnancy that the brain starts developing to the point that thought or emotion (subconcious or conscious) are possible - at least according to Science. In placing my own choice of determination date at around the beginning of the third trimester (which is simply a unit of measure - one could choose, for ex. 26 weeks or 793 days if you prefer), I am actually erring on the side of caution in that the great majority (if not all) fetuses would not have achieved a rudimentary mind at that stage. If you dispute the scientific basis of determination when the earliest possibility of thought or emotion could occur, then present your case. I would guess that your case is purely based on religious grounds or arbitrary guesses - for which you have no evidence one way or the other.","early-fetus-not-human","10:03 AM","abortion-debates","34"
"03-31-2006","7837",3,"Prototype","None","It's true I am a male, but how does that relate at all? Any man can have a say in this matter and so can a boy. It's like saying unless you've been killed, you can't say anything against the murderer who killed someone else. You don't know what it felt like, how can you complain? I happen to know that pro-choicers seem to think that 16 year old girls who get pregnant early on can have a say and even make a decision regarding this issue. Simply because I cannot get pregnant and that I'm male makes no difference. And my world is hardly limited. I can't avoid this abortion issue anywhere I go. The newspaper, the internet, it's everywhere. I know a lot more than you assume and remember this. I am the fourth in a family of eleven children. I know what things go on during pregnancy and labor and birth. I have had seven brothers and sisters born after me. Would you like to withdraw that little assumption? Whether Michelle agrees with me or not doesn't mean I can't debate this. If she thinks I'm not worth debating or thinks I'm too young to try and convince her otherwise, she can leave. But as long as she stays and debates, I will try just as much to change her view on this issue. Simply because I'm young and a male makes no difference. I can still have a say in this matter and I can still debate this with older people. So please, don't make such assumptions when you want to debate.","simone","204809","How large a role does your religion play in what you believe about abortion?","early-fetus-not-human","10:21 AM","abortion-debates","35"

I'm 16. That's my age, I admit. But does that falsify anything I've said, or make anything I've said untrue? Does it have any less meaning? If I said my age was... 23, would you doubt me then? Come on, my age makes very little difference. Simone, my religion has nothing to do with my views on abortion. Granted, I needed some to know that murder and stealing are wrong, but that's about it. It really hasn't shaped my views on any of this.","early-fetus-not-human","10:32 AM","abortion-debates","36"

The brain develops much earlier than 3rd trimester. In fact, it really isn't ""for certain"" when the brain is developed enough to meet your arbitary standards. In your example, lets say this ""brain dead"" person has the ability over time to develop the brain back. Would you feel it is ok to unplug this currently brain dead person eventhough it is fairly certain that their brain will re-develop? For the record, a brain actually starts development from day 1 but more significantly around 1 month (or so) into it (for those concerned with brain waves). At birth the brain is only 1/4 developed. You haven't presented in ""scientific"" facts to show it is not a human you are killing . You also present many fallacies here such as ""religious grounds"". I haven't said one thing about religion in all of my posts to you. So lay off the fallacies for a bit.","early-fetus-not-human","10:54 AM","abortion-debates","37"

Until their mind degenerates to the point where they no longer have higher cognitive brain waves, then they still have some level of mind. The brain may start developing early on but that does not mean that rudimentary thoughts or emotions (i.e. rudimentary mind) can start from the beginning. So far, the scientific evidence I have read on the topic suggest that this can start happening in the early part of the third trimester (ex. ~30th week). Ex: from part 4 of http://www.2think.org/abortion.shtml Thinking occurs, of course, in the brain--principally in the top layers of the convoluted ""gray matter"" called the cerebral cortex. The roughly 100 billion neurons in the brain constitute the material basis of thought. The neurons are connected to each other, and their linkups play a major role in what we experience as thinking. But large-scale linking up of neurons doesn't begin until the 24th to 27th week of pregnancy--the sixth month. By placing harmless electrodes on a subject's head, scientists can measure the electrical activity produced by the network of neurons inside the skull. Different kinds of mental activity show different kinds of brain waves. But brain waves with regular patterns typical of adult human brains do not appear in the fetus until about the 30th week of pregnancy--near the beginning of the third trimester. Fetuses younger than this--however alive and active they may be--lack the necessary brain architecture. They cannot yet think. As for the recovery of the brain-dead person, my understanding is that, when a person is declared brain-dead, that means that their cognitive capabilities cannot recover. If you want to leave room always for the extremely unlikely 'just in case' scenario, then would you advocate for all people who are pronounced brain dead to have their bodies kept perpetually alive artificially? I never denied that it was a human that was being killed. I was simply saying that aborting an early fetus was not killing a ""person"" since, in my view, a ""person"" also has to have a mind. I am happy to hear that you are not basing your views purely on religious grounds. So many pro-life people do and do not admit it that it is often difficult to start a discussion. So, is it your opinion that thought or emotion is possible as soon as the brain starts to develop?","early-fetus-not-human","11:56 AM","abortion-debates","40"
"03-31-2006","7837",3,"Tastyfish","None","That was only a small part of the point, just a plus point of looking at it from a purely the mind point of view. Currently as you say there is just us, so the whole human bit is redundant anyway as well as just being more trouble than its worth. Why include it then?","Another opinion","204837","I include it since one could argue that many species of animals also have a mind - not as developed as ours, but still there. Perhaps it is simply an arbitrary statement based on preference, but I still would argue that we should cherish our own human minds more so than those of animals. That is not to say that we should allow ourselves free reign in how we treat animals. I advocate for humane treatment of animals. However, I would not put their rights as equal to our own.","early-fetus-not-human","12:00 PM","abortion-debates","41"
"03-31-2006","7837",3,"None","None","None","Tastyfish","204842","I see what you mean, but it needn't really be an all or nothing thing, various rights increase as the mind develops. Generally smarter animals get more protection under the law (animal cruelty doesn't apply to fish or insects, certain types of experiments are not permitting on animals of a certain intelligence etc). However I wouldn't think its that difficult to really set a level of inteligence or developed mind to grant what we generally think of as people the highest 'person' status rather than just animals (though I'm sure there might be some oddities slipping in somewhere). Probably best to leave that sort of thing unlegislated really, just have it as a principle on which rulings might be based.","early-fetus-not-human","12:18 PM","abortion-debates","42"

That would also be a more general approach to the ethics of how we treat people vs. higher animals vs. lower animals vs. objects. It would even encompass such hypothetically new beings as artificial intelligence, aliens, or human-animal hybrids. The only tricky aspect I can see in such a scale (besides simply having a good determination of how much of a mind certain animals have) is areas where they overlap. For example, there might be severely mentally ill people who have less developed a mind than certain apes. Should they have less rights than those apes? Indeed, should more intelligent people with more highly developed minds have more rights than those with poor mental capabilities? I would feel rather uncomfortable with such a policy. Perhaps you are right that it is best to leave such things unlegislated for now.","early-fetus-not-human","12:31 PM","abortion-debates","43"
