The first part is inaccurate because there are different kinds of twins. It doesn't have to be an abosolute as you claim it to be...even if we took your absolute standard you would have to say that conjoined twins are not a person in all situations...in fact, since you said ""twins"" even non-conjoined twins would be one person.","early-fetus-not-human","01:14 PM","abortion-debates","166"

Like you stated in another post "" a limb is not a person"" s it logically follows that a human body made up of limbs and organs in not a person,so that means you don't base personhood on mere biology alone..? Then WHAT do you base personhood and value on?","early-fetus-not-human","02:12 PM","abortion-debates","167"

In other words you have to choose between saving one or saving none. I choose to save one. I don't know of any ""fetus in fetu"" case that resulted in a convenience removal. So were they at some point two unique humans...yes. One doesn't develop and pretty much dies.","early-fetus-not-human","02:48 PM","abortion-debates","170"
"07-18-2006","7837",12,"happygrl35","None","No a parasitic twin is very much living *biologically*and to remove it would result in it's death. As in the case of the girl born with her parasitic twins head emerging from hers.The other head (although head no seperate body) was very alive ,it even would laugh and smile. No this isn't the case the Fetus in Fetu is very much alive growing with it's twin and hardley ever causes any physical harm. So can you re-answer?","Steeeeve","223231","I told you with the ""other head"" there was not enough information to make a determination. From what I have read, it either is dead..dieing or will cause the death of the host. Out of the 90 reported cases this has been what happens. In the impossible scenario that the child could remain alive with no harm done to the host (death) then it would not be ok to kill this human.","early-fetus-not-human","03:36 PM","abortion-debates","172"

Left alone, fetus-in-fetu do not seem harmful to the host, but in every case in which the fetus-in-fetu was not removed at the time of discovery, a slow growth has been described21,38,44.","happygrl35","223241","No thats not true. http://www.thefetus.net/page.php?id=290 And no the Fetus in Fetus is very much alive and growing with the host.","early-fetus-not-human","04:01 PM","abortion-debates","173"

The recommended treatment for fetus in fetu is surgical removal, without which the ""fetus"" would continue to grow as long as its blood supply remained adequate. This growth could potentially compress adjacent structures","Steeeeve","223257","There was one case (out of the 90) where the baby was dead inside a boy. The quote doesn't mention that it will become harmful to the host and deadly considering that they mention the twin continues to grow. Another case had a women with the twin in her neck. http://www.jultrasoundmed.org/cgi/co...full/24/9/1313 Perhaps you could live without a liver.","early-fetus-not-human","04:37 PM","abortion-debates","174"

"08-14-2006","7837",12,"Steeeeve","204676","This is the biggest fallacy done of these forums. Being male has nothing to do with it because I know many females with the same views as me and the original poster. So right there your arguement is irrelevant. Even more so though, we all understand the situation because we were all once a fetus. I guess, by your own admission, that if you are white you can't say slavery is wrong with any authority. Furthermore, if you were supposed to be aborted and were not yet you are a male you have no say in the issue. LOGICAL FALLACY","Joe@actsii","227695","I agree with Steeeeve. To say that just because someone is male is sexist. I disagree that because some women make this argument, that it is invalid. This is attacking the person because of there sex, and not dealing with the argument. If males cannot have a say on this subject, then the Roe v Wade decision should be overturned. If I remember correctly, most if not all of the Justices where men.","early-fetus-not-human","09:29 PM","abortion-debates","179"
