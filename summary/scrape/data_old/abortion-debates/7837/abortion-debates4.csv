The law is just rules for living socially written down, religion came later to enforce them - whether God recognises the importance of these rules and decided to lend his weight to society or whether it was just priests deciding that God would probably agree with the existing laws. People do not turn into random theives and killers if they become atheist and God isn't overly clear on Patent law. Most laws are just common sense, I am happy to waive any right to kill people if it allows me to live in a society which will try to prevent other people killing me, likewise with theft. In the abortion case, I have no problem with you deciding that you don't want one or even trying to disuade people from getting them because you beleive that the soul enters at conception and God does not approve (as long as you arn't too obnoxious whilst doing it and don't mind people doing the opposite back to you). I do have a problem with you trying to get your religion made law if you can't back it up with non-religious logic. In short, if your religion coincides with the laws you would propose, good for you! If you think abortion is wrong purely because there are passages in the bible that state God knew someone before birth and therefore they must exist as a 'whole person' by whatever definition you choose, then thats not enough to justify a law in my opinion. It also clogs up the threads, its best if the religious reasoning for and against and the secular ( not atheist ) reasonings for and against are kept seperate I think.","early-fetus-not-human","02:08 PM","abortion-debates","46"
"03-31-2006","7837",4,"Steeeeve","None","Well...if brain waves are the standard, then we can conclude that any fetus and anything past 30 days is a person. You are just avoiding the question here. It is obvious that a brain-dead person can't re-develop their brain...that is however, not the question. The question was what if they could (or we had a method that allowed this). Would you find it ok to pull the plug instead of allowing the person time to re-develop the brain. Your answer is obviously going to have to be ""it is ok to pull the plug because at that moment no measurable brain activity exists"". So you kill a human that can easily meet your standards for being a person. I thought you were for choice? Now you want to dictate what a person is? What authority do you have to tell me whether or not I am a person. Anyone that says they values others as equal would have to be pro-life or inconsistent (hypocrite). ... As for thought or emotion...this isn't a requirment to be a person...you only have to be a human to be a person. I don't believe any human is better or worse than me.","Another opinion","204866","It is not just ANY brainwaves. Brains not only define our thoughts and emotions (mind), they also control our bodily functions. In my understanding, all or most of these functions involve electrical brain activity (i.e. brain waves). If a brain is only putting out brain waves controlling bodily functions and there are no brain waves reflecting thoughts or emotions, then I would say that that living human has no mind and is therefore not a person, only a living human body. You had never answered my question that I had posed first about whether you would pull the plug if you knew that that living human body could not recover. As for my answer to your question, if Science could prove a mental existence without brain waves, then I would have to rethink the criteria. So far, that is not the case. If that were the case, then I would hope that other criteria could be found by which one could judge. The same authority you are using in saying that a person starts at conception. Neither of us has authority in making such a definition. We are simply stating our opinions and our reasons behind our opinions. Other people reading our views will simply make up their own minds. Why would you not include a mind in your definition of person? If there is no mind (or soul, if you prefer), then who exactly is it that you are having sympathy for?

"03-31-2006","7837",4,"Steeeeve","None","I guess my article didn't convince you that the trimester framework was set up by the courts. It certainly is used by the medical profession now. But only because the courts coined these terms. Otherwise, there is no real medical significance from 2months 29 days and 3 months 1 day. Trimester is kind of like the term ""partial birth abortion"" ...it wasn't created by any doctor but it has medical meaning now and is used by doctors.","thelmoose","204869","Please, please, can somebody help me? Steveeee thinks that the term ""trimester"" as it refers to human pregnancy is first a legal concept, defined with Roe v. Wade, then adopted by medicine. I have looked through as many medical sources as I can and I cannot find out when it was first used. It is such a common term, it is presumed a given and there is no elaboration of the term. I am in the medical field and I know this with utmost certainty. Please help as this is making my head hurt. [Aside: Steveeeeee, you are correct that ""partial birth abortion"" was never created by physicians. It is also not used by physicians as it has no meaning and inaccurately refers to a certain procedure that has nothing to do with those terms. It is a term that was coined by politicians.]","early-fetus-not-human","02:25 PM","abortion-debates","49"

Now, in this day and age, people like you will say that you cannot use religious views or beliefs to make a point. You are wrong, very wrong.

I didn't realize I was supposed to answer to that. I will first respond to your answer. The unborn is an example of brain activity growing into a mental existence as you define it. Why would you need to rethink your criteria for that situation but not this one? As to answer your question. It is surely scenario based. I wouldn't pull the plug on anyone that could breath or otherwise move on their own. It someone is on machines for every function of life then obviously there is nothing that person is doing on their own. Does this answer your question? perhaps I was unclear on this. It isn't my call to call them a person or not. Just give them the opportunity to determine that for themselves. This however, requires some kind of standards because your wouldn't reasonably give a tree time to see if it can call itself a person. These standards should be set for what could reasonably be a person by your definition (or in my case..I select the set of all humans). It is not unreasonable to let anyone with human DNA determine if they are a person or not. A soul and mind are different things. I don't think one losses their soul if they have lost their mind . Nevertheless, if a mind is your standard for human, you have to discount alzheimers patients as human, and even some mentally retarded ""persons"". I don't believe in this because who am I to say who does or does not have a mind. Are you all certain a 7 week old unborn doesn't have a mind at all as you define it? Science can't measure a mind really...not without communication (they can measure brain waves but not extent of what they communicate). you define ""mind"" (it seems) as with emotion and thoughts. Trust me when I tell you that mentally handicapped and disabled persons can have neither emotion nor thought (that one can know of). Spending much time in a nursing home leads to this conclusion. However, many people have taken the logic step from your views which is eugenics and euthanasia of persons that are a ""burden"" on society.","early-fetus-not-human","02:34 PM","abortion-debates","52"
"04-01-2006","7837",4,"Steeeeve","None","I agree, but you require evidence of this I thought. There is no evidence to support some patients having emotions or anything thought other than basic breathing type of thoughts. Then let me rephrase the question. If a person with currently the same brain activity as an early stage unborn was sitting in a bed and the doctors could in fact give him something (or maybe just on his own) to restore normal brain function as you define it, then would it be ok to kill this person before the treatment? I thought I made this clear. Breathing on their own...no. Every life function running by machine then yes. It certainly doesn't require this. An answer is irrelevant as it is still not my call. I don't have to assume mental existence...a mentally handicapped person from day 1 might not be able to determine this but I still don't get to call them a nonperson because of this. It is still their call...even if they can't make that decision. If this is the standard then you are going to have to push back personhood to starting sometime around the first month or two. An Alzheimers patient has about the same mental capacity. I am not sure how many you have seen...but the ones that are bad off have 100% no thoughts or emotions. In fact, some look like Terri Schaivo (sp) without the massive brain damage. It just seems your cutoff for when enough emotion and thought is enough is soley based on you wanted abortion to be allowed instead of any non-arbitrary standard.","Another opinion","205045","Though no one can read another's mind, Science does seem to say that thoughts are accompanied by certain types of brain waves, mostly associated with the cerebral cortex. I haven't heard of Alzheimer's patients or the mentally handicapped not having such brain waves. Though a completely unrealistic scenario, it is an interesting one since it involves a human body with mental existence, then no mental existence, then mental existence again. The philosophical question comes up whether this resurected person is a new person or a continuation of the already existing person. If it is a new person (who is essentially a cloned brain inhabiting the body of the old one), then, up to the point of brain restoration, he would never have mentally existed yet so yes, if it were necessary, I would condone killing that still uninhabited body since you can't kill someone who doesn't exist yet. However, for the brain restored person to be considered the same person, there would have to be some continuation of mental existence, which brings us to the same point as my previous posting - Science would have to prove that one can mentally exist without brain waves. How about breathing on their own but no mind or soul left - just a partially working body - a human machine - with ""nobody home""? Without a mental existence, there is no ""they"" to speak of - it is just a biological machine. There is no sense of thought or emotion and neither is there even a sense of self. A mentally handicapped person certainly has some level of mind. Do you really believe that mentally handicapped people only have a working body and nothing else? You keep coming back to this idea that Alzheimer's patients or severely mentally handicapped people have no thoughts or emotions. I do not understand why. Do you require thoughts or emotions to be either communicateable or even conscious to exist? I don't. As long as measurements of their brain waves indicate that there are some mental processes still existing that reflect some level of mind, then I would not support ""pulling the plug"" on them. I would only allow having the plug pulled if they had a living will, since I know that many people (including myself) would not want to be artificially kept alive in a hopeless, minimally existing situation.","early-fetus-not-human","02:40 PM","abortion-debates","56"

I say that this is inconsistent because brain waves start early yet you think 3rd trimester is when they have emotion and thought brain waves....something you later on deny as being possible to know. So I will just deal with all possible scenarios using your standards. Using Just Brain Waves: Brain waves start around 40 days (or so) in a baby...that we have been able to measure. Using thoughts and emotion Thought and emotion is rather limited with anyone that young (even a 2 day old baby). A baby has been born at 21 weeks before (this is 2nd trimester I might add). Some say the baby has ""dreams"" at 17 weeks although I don't know the extent of these dreams. Here is kind of a link...not sure how good it is though. http://www.babyworld.co.uk/informati...ies_brains.asp Either way, we haven't any reason to believe that thoughts and emotions has to be the standard. It would be like me saying 1yr old is the standard...and thus me aborting my 7 month old son should be very moral. It is just arbitary and against all reason. My idea of letting it be ""to each their own"" is the best way to look at it.

There are many types of brain waves - some purely associated with bodily function (those are the ones that start at the early dates you claim) and other associated with potential thought (or mind) that, according to what I have read so far, appear to start near the beginning of the third trimester. Since, for me, it is the mental existence that matters, those early brain waves associated with bodily function only are not that significant. 2) For me it is a mental existence that matters - and this need neither be communicable nor even conscious. As soon as there are indications that thoughts COULD be occuring (ex. via the higher level brain waves), then I would err on the side of caution and say that a mind COULD exist. Until the beginnings of a mind exist, I really do not see WHO it is you are having sympathy for. Please don't keep introducing the false arguement of Alzheimer's patients or severely mentally handicaped people not having ANY minds, since they do. Even the conscious effort of lifting up ones hand (as opposed to that hand making random motions) involves a mind. It doesn't take much ... One has to set the limit SOMEWHERE. I set it at the beginning of mental existence (i.e. beginnings of the mind) since, when we have sympathy for people, it is not their bodies we have sympathy for but themselves - i.e. their mental selves (the thing in yourself which you call ""I""). Until there is a mental existence, there is no ""I"" - there is just a body.","early-fetus-not-human","01:18 AM","abortion-debates","58"

You seem to require some visible sign - either through verbal communication or physical expressions. You assume that my interpretation of ""thoughts and emotions"" is the same as yours and therefore seem to assume that I would exclude such people as Alzheimer's patients from ""personhood"". My main point is that my definition of rudimentary thoughts and emotions is much different than yours. I neither require them to be communicated (verbally or physically) nor for the person to even be conscious. Even the person having a sense of self (the concept of I) is enough for a mind. Even the person being able to choose to lift up their arm or look in a particular direction involves a mind and simple thoughts. The scientific references I have come upon so far show that the higher brain waves accompany thoughts and suggest that, where there are no higher brain waves, there is no mind. Have you run across any literature that suggests that these Alzheimer's patients have no higher brain waves? If so, please quote and reference them. Your web site did not refute my claim that higher brain waves only happen afterward, and the great majority of its contents discussed late fetuses. But you do set a standard - you exclude all life prior to conception. Even the web site which you quoted writes ""We believe that life is a continuum which starts before conception, not at birth."" Some ancient Greeks thought that sperm were just miniature people ready to grow into a full person. It seems ridiculous now that these ancients endowed simple sperm cells with the full attributes of people, but it is just as ridiculous to endow a newly fertilized egg with such attributes. Somewhere along the line, something changes which changes a simply human cell or cells to a person. For me, that something is the beginning of the mind.
