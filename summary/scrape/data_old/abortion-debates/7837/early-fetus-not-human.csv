I posted this on Youdebate, but as this is becoming more popular, I'll post it here too. --- Some people call an early concieved baby just a fetus or bunch of cells early on. That is their view. But this question makes me wonder if they don't say this just to ease their conscience. ""If it is just a bunch of cells, why do they abort it?"" I think some people will agree that the fetus is a living thing. But I have never heard of a couple who didn't want a baby look at it and say: ""Oh, it is really just a bunch of cells. Why not wait a while before it starts looking like an actual human just to make sure?"" This one particular arguement infuriates me. If they're going to abort the baby, I say go ahead. But don't start calling a little child not a human being. The woman knows darn well it is a human being and that is why she has it aborted. The little children are the future of america. Well they don't have much future if they can't even get the respective title of ""Human Being"" just because they're young. I've seen aborted babies at just six weeks and they look an awful lot like a regular baby. Just a ton smaller. Every person reading this post (including you ;-) ) was a baby just like that thing. You were just as much alive then as you are now. If you truly weren't living, than how do you explain yourself now? Life doesn't come from non-organic material. I've smiled before because my Mom chose life for me and my ten brothers and sisters instead of making excuses like this. She went through a lot of pain and financial cost and worry. But there is no baby out there that isn't all these things. I think more women (Or adolescent girls who get into sex early in life) would choose to let their child live if they saw what a baby truly looks like and what a baby truly is. They wouldn't look at early babies like they were nothing more than an inert bunch of matter. So my question is this. Why don'y they call those bunch of cells a baby? Do they: 1. Do it because they believe it really is a baby or 2. Do it because it eases their conscience when they kill it?","early-fetus-not-human","12:42 PM","abortion-debates","1"

I often ask the question...if you are pro-choice...then why do you feel it is your job or the mothers job to determine if someone else is deserving of human rights that a person has? This might be ""begging the question"" but don't we have to? If not, then I could say John Smith is not a person and thus it is ok to kill him. Any reasonable person would find this crazy and say ""well of course he is a person"". What makes you so sure? What gives you the authority to make such a call? Who are you to tell someone else they are not a person deserving of rights? I suppose you can play words games all day though...but whether you call the unborn a fetus, human, person, dog, cat, goat doesn't really matter because he/she doesn't change based on a word. The unborn deserves life because you deserve life as well. We are all of the same kind and for whatever reason, we believe our kind is worthy of natural rights.","early-fetus-not-human","01:53 PM","abortion-debates","3"

I haven't heard any women who have had an abortion call it ""a bunch of cells"". I haven't heard any women post abortion not consider it a ""human being"". I have heard the term ""fetus"" more than ""baby"". This could be because 1. Eases their conscious or 2. It's a 'more correct' scientifically phrase. (up for debate with some) With the women I've talked to, if they've had an ""early on"" abortion they feel less like it was a baby and more like it was an unknown that lacked personification b/c it lacked personality, they couldn't feel it, they didn't ""show"", they didn't allow themselves to name it, use their imagination over what kind of person it would grow up to be, etc. Denial? Perhaps. I think it's a choice they make in their best interests, and they have to come to terms with their conscience. If they cannot come to terms with their conscience regarding having an abortion, then they have the child.","early-fetus-not-human","02:14 PM","abortion-debates","4"

Perhaps women who have abortions don't speak of it as much, but it still seems to be used by pro-abortion people. They try to justify this idea because the young fetus is the only arguement view they can fall back on in such a debate. At least, that is what I've seen. A fetus is not a fully developed person. So what? What difference does that make? They are still a person, and it should be just as much a crime for killing it as any person outside its mothers womb. And when I talk about abortions, of course, I am talking of humans. Please, at least try to avoid including dogs or other animals in this debate, it usually ends up with vulgar comments.

Until their mind degenerates to the point where they no longer have higher cognitive brain waves, then they still have some level of mind. The brain may start developing early on but that does not mean that rudimentary thoughts or emotions (i.e. rudimentary mind) can start from the beginning. So far, the scientific evidence I have read on the topic suggest that this can start happening in the early part of the third trimester (ex. ~30th week). Ex: from part 4 of http://www.2think.org/abortion.shtml Thinking occurs, of course, in the brain--principally in the top layers of the convoluted ""gray matter"" called the cerebral cortex. The roughly 100 billion neurons in the brain constitute the material basis of thought. The neurons are connected to each other, and their linkups play a major role in what we experience as thinking. But large-scale linking up of neurons doesn't begin until the 24th to 27th week of pregnancy--the sixth month. By placing harmless electrodes on a subject's head, scientists can measure the electrical activity produced by the network of neurons inside the skull. Different kinds of mental activity show different kinds of brain waves. But brain waves with regular patterns typical of adult human brains do not appear in the fetus until about the 30th week of pregnancy--near the beginning of the third trimester. Fetuses younger than this--however alive and active they may be--lack the necessary brain architecture. They cannot yet think. As for the recovery of the brain-dead person, my understanding is that, when a person is declared brain-dead, that means that their cognitive capabilities cannot recover. If you want to leave room always for the extremely unlikely 'just in case' scenario, then would you advocate for all people who are pronounced brain dead to have their bodies kept perpetually alive artificially? I never denied that it was a human that was being killed. I was simply saying that aborting an early fetus was not killing a ""person"" since, in my view, a ""person"" also has to have a mind. I am happy to hear that you are not basing your views purely on religious grounds. So many pro-life people do and do not admit it that it is often difficult to start a discussion.

Indeed, should more intelligent people with more highly developed minds have more rights than those with poor mental capabilities? I would feel rather uncomfortable with such a policy.

Why would you need to rethink your criteria for that situation but not this one? As to answer your question. It is surely scenario based. I wouldn't pull the plug on anyone that could breath or otherwise move on their own. It someone is on machines for every function of life then obviously there is nothing that person is doing on their own. Does this answer your question? perhaps I was unclear on this.

I thought I made this clear. Breathing on their own...no. Every life function running by machine then yes. It certainly doesn't require this. An answer is irrelevant as it is still not my call. I don't have to assume mental existence...a mentally handicapped person from day 1 might not be able to determine this but I still don't get to call them a nonperson because of this. It is still their call...even if they can't make that decision. If this is the standard then you are going to have to push back personhood to starting sometime around the first month or two. An Alzheimers patient has about the same mental capacity. I am not sure how many you have seen...but the ones that are bad off have 100% no thoughts or emotions.

I haven't heard of Alzheimer's patients or the mentally handicapped not having such brain waves. Though a completely unrealistic scenario, it is an interesting one since it involves a human body with mental existence, then no mental existence, then mental existence again. The philosophical question comes up whether this resurected person is a new person or a continuation of the already existing person. If it is a new person (who is essentially a cloned brain inhabiting the body of the old one), then, up to the point of brain restoration, he would never have mentally existed yet so yes, if it were necessary, I would condone killing that still uninhabited body since you can't kill someone who doesn't exist yet. However, for the brain restored person to be considered the same person, there would have to be some continuation of mental existence, which brings us to the same point as my previous posting - Science would have to prove that one can mentally exist without brain waves. How about breathing on their own but no mind or soul left - just a partially working body - a human machine - with ""nobody home""? Without a mental existence, there is no ""they"" to speak of - it is just a biological machine. There is no sense of thought or emotion and neither is there even a sense of self. A mentally handicapped person certainly has some level of mind. Do you really believe that mentally handicapped people only have a working body and nothing else? You keep coming back to this idea that Alzheimer's patients or severely mentally handicapped people have no thoughts or emotions. I do not understand why. Do you require thoughts or emotions to be either communicateable or even conscious to exist? I don't. As long as measurements of their brain waves indicate that there are some mental processes still existing that reflect some level of mind, then I would not support ""pulling the plug"" on them. I would only allow having the plug pulled if they had a living will, since I know that many people (including myself) would not want to be artificially kept alive in a hopeless, minimally existing situation.","early-fetus-not-human","02:40 PM","abortion-debates","56"

You seem to require some visible sign - either through verbal communication or physical expressions. You assume that my interpretation of ""thoughts and emotions"" is the same as yours and therefore seem to assume that I would exclude such people as Alzheimer's patients from ""personhood"". My main point is that my definition of rudimentary thoughts and emotions is much different than yours. I neither require them to be communicated (verbally or physically) nor for the person to even be conscious. Even the person having a sense of self (the concept of I) is enough for a mind. Even the person being able to choose to lift up their arm or look in a particular direction involves a mind and simple thoughts. The scientific references I have come upon so far show that the higher brain waves accompany thoughts and suggest that, where there are no higher brain waves, there is no mind. Have you run across any literature that suggests that these Alzheimer's patients have no higher brain waves? If so, please quote and reference them. Your web site did not refute my claim that higher brain waves only happen afterward, and the great majority of its contents discussed late fetuses. But you do set a standard - you exclude all life prior to conception. Even the web site which you quoted writes ""We believe that life is a continuum which starts before conception, not at birth."" Some ancient Greeks thought that sperm were just miniature people ready to grow into a full person. It seems ridiculous now that these ancients endowed simple sperm cells with the full attributes of people, but it is just as ridiculous to endow a newly fertilized egg with such attributes.

However, even in the first trimester an unborn qould qualify under your standard. Furthermore, you state that it doesn't need to be communicated verbally or physically....I never said it did and if this were the case why does the unborn require this? An Alzheimers patient in the severe stage is no more capable than the unborn in the link I just provided you. This is not an opinion based on observation...look at a brain scan of someone with Alzheimers. It is a little unreasonable to say a sperm is its own unique person. The sperm is not a human by itself and would die without being part of the whole. So my standard does rest with reasonableness but it sets no standard for anything human. Maybe a better way to put it is all humans are given the chance to be a person. I don't know where you got that quote from by the way...please link. So I am not sure where your standard lies. Is it movement or some thought at all? I thouht observation was not the way to determine this. Is it a sense of ""I"" because any doctor will tell you that an Alzheimers patient has no thought of ""I"". And once again, why does your standard have to be King? It seems a standard that is very open ended will surely allow for any error because of our limited knowledge in such a hard moral question.","Another opinion","205318","Your link just shows a human hand. Disturbing as that image is, that image says nothing about whether there is a mind present or not. We are naturally disturbed when we see a human form mangled - from mangled bodies to purposefully staged art images of mangled human forms. Just because we have the emotional reaction doesn't mean that there is substance behind it. We have to separate our emotional reactions from reality. So, what is the reality of such an early fetus? At 10 weeks, there can be spontaneous movement but spontaneous movement is not evidence of a mind controlling that movement. Touch a newly dead (headless) frog in certain spots and it will move around. We should not confuse things that appear to have a mind (ex. movement) with things that actually have a mind. One has to do a full analysis and I trust Science with such analysis (involving the back-and-forth debate within pear-reviewed publications). So, if you claim that a first trimester fetus qualifies under my standard of having a rudimentary mind since it shows spontaneous movement, then that is a false arguement. Purposeful movement (i.e. choosing to lift up one's hand) is another thing all together and that only happens later in the pregnancy. First, the link from another page of your same web site (about the organization who wrote your site): http://www.birthpsychology.com/apppah/index.html As for your standard, if it is a standard that all human life be given the cance to be a person, then a sperm is also human life. Why not give it a chance to become a person? Also, from your wording, it sounds like you acknowledge that a newly fertilized egg is not yet a person. Is that true? My standard lies at the beginning of some internal mental existence that doesn't need to be externally expressed. Since I don't have the background in biology or psychology to judge for myself when thought first starts, I trust Science, which tells me that it is late in the pregnancy when thought can first start. There has to be some reason to set a standard somewhere - otherwise, one can be so openended in one's standard that one requires all sperm and egg be given the chance for becoming people. I set my standard where Science has told me that thought can first start. Since we, as a people, have to set the standard SOMEWHERE, I am presenting this standard and the reasons behind it for consideration of other readers.

If your requirement is that it is alive and has human DNA, then sperm is a human life. What is the difference between a sperm and a newly fertilized egg? Mainly, the newly fertilized egg has a COMPLETE set of DNA and will begin the growth process into a full human being. What do you think is so precious about a newly fertilized egg that is important enough to take away the woman's right over her own body? One has to distinguish between reflex actions and actions controlled by a mind. When one is emotionally involved, it is easy to read more into reflex actions and disturbing images than the reality supports. Scientists generally agree that thought and true emotional reactions are chiefly held in the cerebral cortex, which is much slower to develop. My evidence on the beginnings of thought were presented in my post #40, quoting from the fourth section of the link: http://www.2think.org/abortion.shtml . As for your evidence, please quote and reference a site that tells that there is no thought or cerebral cortex activity in the late stage Alzheimer's patient. You claim that a newly fertilized egg has always been called a person. I disagree and challenge you to come up with proof of your assertion. It is not word games when people simply disagree with your arbitrary view of what makes a ""person"" (which you have never actually defined in detail).

At some point you gotta think that your goal is not really to find and answer but ot justify one you already have. I wonder if you might be working from the conclusion that the unborn is not a person and finding ways to justify this. ok, so we look at actual thought and emotion from the cerebral cortex. Alzheimer's Patients have the cerebral cortex destroyed. I couldn't really find a link that talks about it but here is a glossary which has some terms. http://www.zarcrom.com/users/alzheimers/w-07.html I just don't understand that if you have such a hard time saying we should kill severe Alzheimers patients. Many pro-choicer people have gone to this logical step. I however don't take the view that brain is everything...even more so if it is growing into a highly developed one. My view is not arbitrary at all..in fact, it is even what a common dictionary says. Human and person are just interchangable words...not that this even matters. http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=person I think it is not my call to try and make some standard for seperating humans and persons for the sole purpose of abortion law. This doesn't place an unborn above the woman but rather equal. It just seems that whenever we try to say ""this isn't a person"" it always backfires and is wrong. Better just to assume the position that trying to seperate the two is just a way to justify an action rather than seek the truth of the matter. Science actually told us that blacks were not people like whites but that proved to be wrong on so many levels...same thing with Jews. It goes farther back then this though. Once you decide to rank humans and classify them, you always end up discriminating and just plan being wrong.","Another opinion","205696","My goal is to try to analyze the situation as objectively as I can and then draw conclusions. If Science could show the highly improbable situation that a one month old embryo has a mind, then I would change my stance on abortion to not allow almost all abortions, and would then push hard for as good contraceptives as the medical profession could possibly make. As things stand, that is not the case (luckily for women who need to make such a choice). The scientific sources I've seen so far point to the potential for thought starting around the beginning of the third trimester. The two examples which you gave - a photo of an earlier fetus grasping a doctor's finger and the response stimuli to a mother's voice can, at first glance, appear that there is a mind that drove that finger or a mind that reacted to the mother's voice. However, one has to analyze farther. For example, with the fetus photo, it is easy to jump to assumptions that the fetus might have felt fear and held onto a finger for emotional support because that is what we might assume from similar image of a young child. It is an emotionally stirring photo because of that assumption. However, we have to ask ourselves whether that assumption is right and that is where Science comes in. Scientists have investigated wide ranges of biological / neurological behavior and are able to distinguish between behavior that involves a thinking mind and behavior governed by the body itself - as in reflex actions. I do not have the background in biology to judge for myself so I trust the results of scientific inquiry. The few links I have seen so far suggest that many areas of the brain (including the cerebral cortex) are in the process of being destroyed in an Alzheimer's patient, just like the fetus and born baby have cerebral cortexes that are in the oposite process of being developed. There comes a point in the development of a fetus' cerebral cortex that thought first becomes possible and that seems to be reflected by the onset of higher brain waves. If there would come a time that there are NO higher brain waves in an Alzheimers patient, then I would also agree that there is no mind left. You have not shown that that is the case and I haven't heard that to be the case. My definition of person is not arbitrary. Whenever we use the term ""person"" in any sense of having sympathy, then we always assume that there is ""somebody home"" in that human body. Otherwise, who are we having sympathy with?

"04-19-2006","7837",6,"Another opinion","None","My goal is to try to analyze the situation as objectively as I can and then draw conclusions. If Science could show the highly improbable situation that a one month old embryo has a mind, then I would change my stance on abortion to not allow almost all abortions, and would then push hard for as good contraceptives as the medical profession could possibly make. As things stand, that is not the case (luckily for women who need to make such a choice). The scientific sources I've seen so far point to the potential for thought starting around the beginning of the third trimester. The two examples which you gave - a photo of an earlier fetus grasping a doctor's finger and the response stimuli to a mother's voice can, at first glance, appear that there is a mind that drove that finger or a mind that reacted to the mother's voice. However, one has to analyze farther. For example, with the fetus photo, it is easy to jump to assumptions that the fetus might have felt fear and held onto a finger for emotional support because that is what we might assume from similar image of a young child. It is an emotionally stirring photo because of that assumption. However, we have to ask ourselves whether that assumption is right and that is where Science comes in. Scientists have investigated wide ranges of biological / neurological behavior and are able to distinguish between behavior that involves a thinking mind and behavior governed by the body itself - as in reflex actions. I do not have the background in biology to judge for myself so I trust the results of scientific inquiry. The few links I have seen so far suggest that many areas of the brain (including the cerebral cortex) are in the process of being destroyed in an Alzheimer's patient, just like the fetus and born baby have cerebral cortexes that are in the oposite process of being developed. There comes a point in the development of a fetus' cerebral cortex that thought first becomes possible and that seems to be reflected by the onset of higher brain waves. If there would come a time that there are NO higher brain waves in an Alzheimers patient, then I would also agree that there is no mind left. You have not shown that that is the case and I haven't heard that to be the case. My definition of person is not arbitrary. Whenever we use the term ""person"" in any sense of having sympathy, then we always assume that there is ""somebody home"" in that human body. Otherwise, who are we having sympathy with? I simply have never gotten a good definition from you about what constitutes a person. More specifically, do you or don't you think that a newly fertilized egg is a person and, if so, why?","Steeeeve","208301","You still don't give any links to these scientists.

I will give it again: It is part 4 of http://www.2think.org/abortion.shtml The others were found in passing, and I did not bookmark those sites, so it would take time to search them out. The link above is an exerpt from a text that has more references in the text itself (which is only found in the hardcopy that I did not have access to). If it will actually make a difference in your point of view, then I could go through the trouble of finding the references that the authors used in the text correponding to that link. Otherwise, it is not worth my trouble. In my own deliberations on abortion, I started out by analyzing all the situations in which I consider it wrong to kill and recognized that a core minimal requirement was that the person at least minimally exist mentally. The main consideration behind most of these deliberations was to treat others as I would have myself be treated. I believe my mother should have had every right to abort me before I started mentally existing. ""I"" did not start to exist until I started doing so mentally so it would not have made much of a difference if she had aborted me at three months, if she had used contraceptives, or if they had never had sex during that period. Nobody would have been hurt since nobody existed yet. I was fairly confident that first trimester embryos/fetuses did not have a mental existence but did not have a good feel about certain second trimester fetuses until I read such links. With proper scientific evidence, I could still be convinced that the mind can exist prior to the third trimester - I simply haven't seen any such convincing evidence. As for your last comment, I could just as easily say: A person is not a human is not a person and to try to make them the same is just playing word games to achieve a desired result.","early-fetus-not-human","05:09 PM","abortion-debates","85"
"04-21-2006","7837",6,"Steeeeve","None","An article from the well known (sarcasim) 2think.org that states scientists think this doesn't show anything about scientists..although this is not really the point as it is clear you take the ""neurological view"" which is not the view of many scienctists at all but rather just one group. This still presents a view that is both arbitrary and discriminative. It is arbitrary because one could easily say they think a person (or human...or whatever) begins at the develoment of fingernails. Furthermore, one could say that a person doesn't beging until the cerebral cortex is finished development (after birth I believe) or until the brain has gained the ability to development a sense of ""self"" (also after birth). It seems with someone so subjective (if you place a value on life) as this than you would probably either want a safe bet standard or find other criteria that everyone tends to agree on. This is how I can get to the idea of having no standard. So why is the sperm and egg not considered in this? Well, neither of them involve any of the views on development of life. I would then ask why a person is defined as a human.","Another opinion","208723","Of course, I am not counting the views of scientists that have nothing to do with the study of the brain since those opinions are much less relevant. My opinion as a scientist is not relevant on these issues since that is not my field. Therefore, I rely on the opinions of scientists (neuroligists) who do specialize in the study of the brain. You arbitrarily place your limit at conception, I place mine at the beginning of the possibilities of a mind. We each consider the other's limit as arbitrary since we don't agree with it. It is absurd to equate either of our limits with setting a limit at the development of fingernails. Since I consider your view arbitrary, I could say the same about you, but logic prevents me. As for being discriminative, I have no problem with discriminating against mind-less bodies, just like you have no problem discriminating against unfertilized eggs. If you think that we shouldn't discriminate against bodies without minds, then try to convince me WHY we should not discriminate against them. However, we simply have different views of where to set that safe standard. I am erring on the side of caution in setting my limit when a mind even has a first possibility of appearing. I have had discussions with a few pro-life people that wanted to err on the side of certainty - i.e. later in pregnancy or even after birth - but that is not my view. I am already erring on the side of safety - at least where that one critical criteria is concerned- the possible presence of a mind. Where my criteria of having the beginnings of a mind is concerned, my setting the point of safety at conception would be just as arbitrary as my setting the point of safety at an unfertilized egg - there is no logical reason to set it there. I set it at a point that makes logical sense. I do not understand what you are getting at in that last sentence. Certain animals can have minds as well but, if we were to also call them people, then we would have to grant them similar rights. Though I support anti-animal cruelty laws, I, personally, don't think animals should get the same rights as we humans do.

The experts for this viewpoint are neuro scientists and that is why I go to them. 2) Our minds are fully defined by a non-physical self. This is a religious point of view (or at least a faith-based point of view since there is no evidence of this). Since one cannot impose ones religious beliefs on the populace, this is not an option. 3) A mixture of physical (brain) and non-physical self. So, if one wants to avoid a religious arguement, then who could possibly be considered better experts than neuro scientists? You simply chose to define person and human as the same thing (all humans are persons as well). I chose to define person as a human with the possibility of a mind. What exactly is it that you are questioning? As for arbitrariness, if you truly believed that all unfertilized eggs were people as well, then you would also have to protect those.

You have another ethical stance that you are presenting. The readers will decide for themselves and, most likely, not choose either of our stances but come to their own conclusions. Prior to the abortion debate, human and person were almost exclusively discussed with respect to born people, where there is no question that human and person are the same thing.

It is simply a hypothetical question to see whether it is something about the fertilized egg as it is *at that moment* that is important to you or whether it is its potential to become something important (ex. you, me and everyone else). Your answer didn't really address the question though. I asked what it was in that unfertlized egg that you cherish, assuming that that egg will never develop farther. You simply restated your opinion that killing at all levels of development is murder. The one thing that you said that does touch upon truly answering the question is: ""the level of development is not a factor that determines us as people"". So, if I am reading you right, you view a newly fertilized egg as a person and that is why you would consider it murder. The thing that is confusing is that I have absolutely no clue what you mean, then, by ""person"" outside of simply having a complete set of human DNA and not being just one of millions of cells of another person. If that fertilized egg will stay as just that, then what makes that a person?

You don't especially care about conciousness, its not something that is pariticular important to you compared to anything else about the fetus, or so it seems anyway (not wanting to misrepresent your position but clearly something else is more important to you if you are adament about protecting from a fertilised egg onwards, or at least an implanted one). I don't think you can argue here in favour of something that might be, in practically every other circumstance regarding the law we only use what was done rather than what may be done in the future (classing intent as a crime, it is something someone physically does). Its a tricky question and will open a lot of issues either way if you start counting what might have happened later on if you had not done something. With any definition, the more precise you start making it the more things that you feel should fit in the category find themselves outside - alternatively if you try to broaden it then you start including things you feel shouldn't be in there at all. If think that looking for some form of conciousness and trying to reduce suffering is probably the closest we can get to protecting all of what we consider important without including too much extra or excluding things that are considered important.

However, once that mental existence comes into play then I believe that the woman should have to carry that dependent person since, after all, she had six months to decide and she knew what was coming. I acknowledge extenuating circumstances such as a risk of the mother's death or serious risk to her health as warranting exceptions. As for when that point of personhood would be determined, it is apparently easier to scientifically determine when it is too early for a mind to exist than it is to determine when a mind does start to exist.

Quote: Originally Posted by Simone What if the conjoined twins have completely independently functioning organs? There are widely varying sorts of conjoined twins.

Why would you consider it wrong? Because you are killing a person. So you believe that removing a parasidic twin resulting in it's death is wrong because it's a person,and the removal of a conjoined lesser dominant twin resulting in it's death is alos wrong.So like the picture of linked of a woman with a parasidic twin in the form of an extra leg(not her own leg,but that which was left of the parasidic twin) removal of the leg resulting in the death of the parasidic twins leg is wrong because it kils a person?
