I posted this on Youdebate, but as this is becoming more popular, I'll post it here too. --- Some people call an early concieved baby just a fetus or bunch of cells early on. That is their view. But this question makes me wonder if they don't say this just to ease their conscience. ""If it is just a bunch of cells, why do they abort it?"" I think some people will agree that the fetus is a living thing. But I have never heard of a couple who didn't want a baby look at it and say: ""Oh, it is really just a bunch of cells. Why not wait a while before it starts looking like an actual human just to make sure?"" This one particular arguement infuriates me. If they're going to abort the baby, I say go ahead. But don't start calling a little child not a human being. The woman knows darn well it is a human being and that is why she has it aborted. The little children are the future of america. Well they don't have much future if they can't even get the respective title of ""Human Being"" just because they're young. I've seen aborted babies at just six weeks and they look an awful lot like a regular baby. Just a ton smaller. Every person reading this post (including you ;-) ) was a baby just like that thing. You were just as much alive then as you are now. If you truly weren't living, than how do you explain yourself now? Life doesn't come from non-organic material. I've smiled before because my Mom chose life for me and my ten brothers and sisters instead of making excuses like this. She went through a lot of pain and financial cost and worry. But there is no baby out there that isn't all these things. I think more women (Or adolescent girls who get into sex early in life) would choose to let their child live if they saw what a baby truly looks like and what a baby truly is. They wouldn't look at early babies like they were nothing more than an inert bunch of matter. So my question is this. Why don'y they call those bunch of cells a baby? Do they: 1. Do it because they believe it really is a baby or 2. Do it because it eases their conscience when they kill it?","early-fetus-not-human","12:42 PM","abortion-debates","1"

There are human sperm and eggs, dog sperm and eggs, etc. When you say that they are human you are merely indicating the origin of the eggs and sperm.

"03-29-2006","7837",1,"None","None","None","Steeeeve","204538","aww yes, The Person v. Human arguement. This is more of a word game to justify rather than describing reality. I often ask the question...if you are pro-choice...then why do you feel it is your job or the mothers job to determine if someone else is deserving of human rights that a person has? This might be ""begging the question"" but don't we have to? If not, then I could say John Smith is not a person and thus it is ok to kill him. Any reasonable person would find this crazy and say ""well of course he is a person"". What makes you so sure? What gives you the authority to make such a call? Who are you to tell someone else they are not a person deserving of rights? I suppose you can play words games all day though...but whether you call the unborn a fetus, human, person, dog, cat, goat doesn't really matter because he/she doesn't change based on a word. The unborn deserves life because you deserve life as well. We are all of the same kind and for whatever reason, we believe our kind is worthy of natural rights.","early-fetus-not-human","01:53 PM","abortion-debates","3"

I haven't heard any women who have had an abortion call it ""a bunch of cells"". I haven't heard any women post abortion not consider it a ""human being"". I have heard the term ""fetus"" more than ""baby"". This could be because 1. Eases their conscious or 2. It's a 'more correct' scientifically phrase. (up for debate with some) With the women I've talked to, if they've had an ""early on"" abortion they feel less like it was a baby and more like it was an unknown that lacked personification b/c it lacked personality, they couldn't feel it, they didn't ""show"", they didn't allow themselves to name it, use their imagination over what kind of person it would grow up to be, etc. Denial? Perhaps. I think it's a choice they make in their best interests, and they have to come to terms with their conscience. If they cannot come to terms with their conscience regarding having an abortion, then they have the child.","early-fetus-not-human","02:14 PM","abortion-debates","4"
"03-29-2006","7837",1,"None","None","None","Prototype","204543","I have heard the arguement of ""a bunch of cells, not a person"" from men and women. Perhaps women who have abortions don't speak of it as much, but it still seems to be used by pro-abortion people. They try to justify this idea because the young fetus is the only arguement view they can fall back on in such a debate. At least, that is what I've seen. A fetus is not a fully developed person. So what? What difference does that make? They are still a person, and it should be just as much a crime for killing it as any person outside its mothers womb. And when I talk about abortions, of course, I am talking of humans. Please, at least try to avoid including dogs or other animals in this debate, it usually ends up with vulgar comments. And I won't equivocate animals with humans either. (Not that you were, but the people who read your post might.)","early-fetus-not-human","02:49 PM","abortion-debates","5"

The original post smacks of someone who has a limited understanding of this most complex issue. No serious discussion speaks of things like ""bunch of cells"" or quibbles about the words we use to discuss the unborn.

Mostly, as Simone suggests, this is someone who has never had to address this issue on even close to a personal basis.

Being male has nothing to do with it because I know many females with the same views as me and the original poster. So right there your arguement is irrelevant. Even more so though, we all understand the situation because we were all once a fetus. I guess, by your own admission, that if you are white you can't say slavery is wrong with any authority. Furthermore, if you were supposed to be aborted and were not yet you are a male you have no say in the issue. LOGICAL FALLACY","early-fetus-not-human","01:17 PM","abortion-debates","12"
"03-30-2006","7837",1,"None","None","None","Another opinion","204683","To those who are pro-life, I pose this set of questions: If a embryo were conceived that had no mind or soul and would never develop a mind or soul (so it would ONLY be a living human body with ""nobody home""), would you still have objections with a woman aborting that embryo? If yes, why? If no, then what are the main differences you would see between that situation and a typical pregnancy? If you think that there is a mind or soul in the earliest embryo (right after conception), then why do you believe this? Otherwise, do you think that one should not abort an early embryo because it will someday have a mind or sould?","early-fetus-not-human","01:49 PM","abortion-debates","13"
"03-30-2006","7837",1,"None","None","None","thelmoose","204684","Steveeeeee, All I am saying is that men certainly have a different, less personal and intimate perspective than women about pregnancy. I am not saying men cannot have an opinion about the legality of abortion. You misunderstood me. You can disagree with that, but the statement is not logically fallacious or irrelevant. I can understand if you are saying as a human being you are entitled to an opinion, but are you saying you remember being a fetus? As for slavery, I could rightfully say that I cannot know as a white person, the experience of being a black slave under white people or to be a descendent. That doesn't stop me from feeling that slavery is abominable. Now there is an illogical statement. (logical fallacy! logical fallacy! nyah-nyah!) Your last sentence, Furthermore, if you were supposed to be aborted and were not yet you are a male you have no say in the issue."", mystifies me.

Any man can have a say in this matter and so can a boy. It's like saying unless you've been killed, you can't say anything against the murderer who killed someone else. You don't know what it felt like, how can you complain? I happen to know that pro-choicers seem to think that 16 year old girls who get pregnant early on can have a say and even make a decision regarding this issue. Simply because I cannot get pregnant and that I'm male makes no difference. And my world is hardly limited. I can't avoid this abortion issue anywhere I go. The newspaper, the internet, it's everywhere. I know a lot more than you assume and remember this. I am the fourth in a family of eleven children. I know what things go on during pregnancy and labor and birth. I have had seven brothers and sisters born after me. Would you like to withdraw that little assumption? Whether Michelle agrees with me or not doesn't mean I can't debate this. If she thinks I'm not worth debating or thinks I'm too young to try and convince her otherwise, she can leave. But as long as she stays and debates, I will try just as much to change her view on this issue. Simply because I'm young and a male makes no difference. I can still have a say in this matter and I can still debate this with older people. So please, don't make such assumptions when you want to debate.","early-fetus-not-human","01:52 PM","abortion-debates","15"
