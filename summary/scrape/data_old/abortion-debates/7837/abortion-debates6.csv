"04-05-2006","7837",6,"Steeeeve","None","He addressed this based on his own thought and no evidence. At some point you gotta think that your goal is not really to find and answer but ot justify one you already have. I wonder if you might be working from the conclusion that the unborn is not a person and finding ways to justify this. ok, so we look at actual thought and emotion from the cerebral cortex. Alzheimer's Patients have the cerebral cortex destroyed. I couldn't really find a link that talks about it but here is a glossary which has some terms. http://www.zarcrom.com/users/alzheimers/w-07.html I just don't understand that if you have such a hard time saying we should kill severe Alzheimers patients. Many pro-choicer people have gone to this logical step. I however don't take the view that brain is everything...even more so if it is growing into a highly developed one. My view is not arbitrary at all..in fact, it is even what a common dictionary says. Human and person are just interchangable words...not that this even matters. http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=person I think it is not my call to try and make some standard for seperating humans and persons for the sole purpose of abortion law. This doesn't place an unborn above the woman but rather equal. It just seems that whenever we try to say ""this isn't a person"" it always backfires and is wrong. Better just to assume the position that trying to seperate the two is just a way to justify an action rather than seek the truth of the matter. Science actually told us that blacks were not people like whites but that proved to be wrong on so many levels...same thing with Jews. It goes farther back then this though. Once you decide to rank humans and classify them, you always end up discriminating and just plan being wrong.","Another opinion","205696","My goal is to try to analyze the situation as objectively as I can and then draw conclusions. If Science could show the highly improbable situation that a one month old embryo has a mind, then I would change my stance on abortion to not allow almost all abortions, and would then push hard for as good contraceptives as the medical profession could possibly make. As things stand, that is not the case (luckily for women who need to make such a choice). The scientific sources I've seen so far point to the potential for thought starting around the beginning of the third trimester. The two examples which you gave - a photo of an earlier fetus grasping a doctor's finger and the response stimuli to a mother's voice can, at first glance, appear that there is a mind that drove that finger or a mind that reacted to the mother's voice. However, one has to analyze farther. For example, with the fetus photo, it is easy to jump to assumptions that the fetus might have felt fear and held onto a finger for emotional support because that is what we might assume from similar image of a young child. It is an emotionally stirring photo because of that assumption. However, we have to ask ourselves whether that assumption is right and that is where Science comes in. Scientists have investigated wide ranges of biological / neurological behavior and are able to distinguish between behavior that involves a thinking mind and behavior governed by the body itself - as in reflex actions. I do not have the background in biology to judge for myself so I trust the results of scientific inquiry. The few links I have seen so far suggest that many areas of the brain (including the cerebral cortex) are in the process of being destroyed in an Alzheimer's patient, just like the fetus and born baby have cerebral cortexes that are in the oposite process of being developed. There comes a point in the development of a fetus' cerebral cortex that thought first becomes possible and that seems to be reflected by the onset of higher brain waves. If there would come a time that there are NO higher brain waves in an Alzheimers patient, then I would also agree that there is no mind left. You have not shown that that is the case and I haven't heard that to be the case. My definition of person is not arbitrary. Whenever we use the term ""person"" in any sense of having sympathy, then we always assume that there is ""somebody home"" in that human body. Otherwise, who are we having sympathy with? I simply have never gotten a good definition from you about what constitutes a person. More specifically, do you or don't you think that a newly fertilized egg is a person and, if so, why?","early-fetus-not-human","06:47 PM","abortion-debates","76"

Unsupportive of life; incapable of starting life. My conclusion does not eliminate masturbation, and you can't put abortion and masturbation on the same platform. Guess what, you happen to be nothing more than a bunch of cells yourself. You have things that babies haven't yet developed, true. But the fact is, your body is made up of nothing else. You're killing would lead to an investigation of murder, while a baby's life isn't because of people like you who try to make this belief a fact. It is not just a bunch of cells, it is a human body with a developing system arranging every single cell in such a way to form everything needed to live dependently. A bunch of skin cells or fluid cells are not a living person. I can't see how this is relevant.","early-fetus-not-human","04:19 PM","abortion-debates","81"

I will give it again: It is part 4 of http://www.2think.org/abortion.shtml The others were found in passing, and I did not bookmark those sites, so it would take time to search them out. The link above is an exerpt from a text that has more references in the text itself (which is only found in the hardcopy that I did not have access to). If it will actually make a difference in your point of view, then I could go through the trouble of finding the references that the authors used in the text correponding to that link. Otherwise, it is not worth my trouble. In my own deliberations on abortion, I started out by analyzing all the situations in which I consider it wrong to kill and recognized that a core minimal requirement was that the person at least minimally exist mentally. The main consideration behind most of these deliberations was to treat others as I would have myself be treated. I believe my mother should have had every right to abort me before I started mentally existing. ""I"" did not start to exist until I started doing so mentally so it would not have made much of a difference if she had aborted me at three months, if she had used contraceptives, or if they had never had sex during that period. Nobody would have been hurt since nobody existed yet. I was fairly confident that first trimester embryos/fetuses did not have a mental existence but did not have a good feel about certain second trimester fetuses until I read such links. With proper scientific evidence, I could still be convinced that the mind can exist prior to the third trimester - I simply haven't seen any such convincing evidence. As for your last comment, I could just as easily say: A person is not a human is not a person and to try to make them the same is just playing word games to achieve a desired result.","early-fetus-not-human","05:09 PM","abortion-debates","85"
"04-21-2006","7837",6,"Steeeeve","None","An article from the well known (sarcasim) 2think.org that states scientists think this doesn't show anything about scientists..although this is not really the point as it is clear you take the ""neurological view"" which is not the view of many scienctists at all but rather just one group. This still presents a view that is both arbitrary and discriminative. It is arbitrary because one could easily say they think a person (or human...or whatever) begins at the develoment of fingernails. Furthermore, one could say that a person doesn't beging until the cerebral cortex is finished development (after birth I believe) or until the brain has gained the ability to development a sense of ""self"" (also after birth). It seems with someone so subjective (if you place a value on life) as this than you would probably either want a safe bet standard or find other criteria that everyone tends to agree on. This is how I can get to the idea of having no standard. So why is the sperm and egg not considered in this? Well, neither of them involve any of the views on development of life. I would then ask why a person is defined as a human.","Another opinion","208723","Of course, I am not counting the views of scientists that have nothing to do with the study of the brain since those opinions are much less relevant. My opinion as a scientist is not relevant on these issues since that is not my field. Therefore, I rely on the opinions of scientists (neuroligists) who do specialize in the study of the brain. You arbitrarily place your limit at conception, I place mine at the beginning of the possibilities of a mind. We each consider the other's limit as arbitrary since we don't agree with it. It is absurd to equate either of our limits with setting a limit at the development of fingernails. Since I consider your view arbitrary, I could say the same about you, but logic prevents me. As for being discriminative, I have no problem with discriminating against mind-less bodies, just like you have no problem discriminating against unfertilized eggs. If you think that we shouldn't discriminate against bodies without minds, then try to convince me WHY we should not discriminate against them. However, we simply have different views of where to set that safe standard. I am erring on the side of caution in setting my limit when a mind even has a first possibility of appearing. I have had discussions with a few pro-life people that wanted to err on the side of certainty - i.e. later in pregnancy or even after birth - but that is not my view. I am already erring on the side of safety - at least where that one critical criteria is concerned- the possible presence of a mind. Where my criteria of having the beginnings of a mind is concerned, my setting the point of safety at conception would be just as arbitrary as my setting the point of safety at an unfertilized egg - there is no logical reason to set it there. I set it at a point that makes logical sense. I do not understand what you are getting at in that last sentence. Certain animals can have minds as well but, if we were to also call them people, then we would have to grant them similar rights. Though I support anti-animal cruelty laws, I, personally, don't think animals should get the same rights as we humans do. That is why I place being human as one of the criteria for being called a person.","early-fetus-not-human","12:45 PM","abortion-debates","87"
"04-21-2006","7837",6,"Steeeeve","None","Then you already limit yourself to viewpoints. Atleast represent it well and say many neuro scientists believe the celebral cortex begins development at 24 weeks. This doens't explain while person is defined as a human.","Another opinion","208808","The viewpoints about the mind have generally fallen in three categories: 1) Our minds are fully defined by our brains. The experts for this viewpoint are neuro scientists and that is why I go to them. 2) Our minds are fully defined by a non-physical self. This is a religious point of view (or at least a faith-based point of view since there is no evidence of this). Since one cannot impose ones religious beliefs on the populace, this is not an option. 3) A mixture of physical (brain) and non-physical self. So, if one wants to avoid a religious arguement, then who could possibly be considered better experts than neuro scientists? You simply chose to define person and human as the same thing (all humans are persons as well). I chose to define person as a human with the possibility of a mind. What exactly is it that you are questioning? As for arbitrariness, if you truly believed that all unfertilized eggs were people as well, then you would also have to protect those. Your goal of protection seems to start at conception, which is why I stated that you set your limit there.","early-fetus-not-human","04:46 PM","abortion-debates","89"
