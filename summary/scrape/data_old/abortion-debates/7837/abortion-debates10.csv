There are some cases where you kill one to save the other (as in both will die).

Well, since you feel you can restrict choice...I think it should be restricted even further to remove abortion as an opition.","early-fetus-not-human","05:04 PM","abortion-debates","145"

"07-17-2006","7837",10,"None","None","None","Another opinion","222787","Just to add another view to the list on this subject: As I had noted in many older posts, I and many others trust various scientific sources that argue that the beginnings of the mind cannot happen before the beginning of the third trimester. Therefore, I have no problems with abortion before the third trimester because there is no mind involved yet and, therefore, no person, and because the woman's right to her own body should supercede that of a living human fetal body that is not yet mentally existing. However, once that mental existence comes into play then I believe that the woman should have to carry that dependent person since, after all, she had six months to decide and she knew what was coming. I acknowledge extenuating circumstances such as a risk of the mother's death or serious risk to her health as warranting exceptions. As for when that point of personhood would be determined, it is apparently easier to scientifically determine when it is too early for a mind to exist than it is to determine when a mind does start to exist. However, I, personally, would be willing to err in law on the side of caution and set that point at the beginning of the third trimester.","early-fetus-not-human","12:43 AM","abortion-debates","150"
