Besides we know foetuses can become conscious and we know cancers will not.","Tastyfish","210531","Another opinion answered the first bit perfectly well, so I'll reply to this. You don't especially care about conciousness, its not something that is pariticular important to you compared to anything else about the fetus, or so it seems anyway (not wanting to misrepresent your position but clearly something else is more important to you if you are adament about protecting from a fertilised egg onwards, or at least an implanted one). I don't think you can argue here in favour of something that might be, in practically every other circumstance regarding the law we only use what was done rather than what may be done in the future (classing intent as a crime, it is something someone physically does). Its a tricky question and will open a lot of issues either way if you start counting what might have happened later on if you had not done something. With any definition, the more precise you start making it the more things that you feel should fit in the category find themselves outside - alternatively if you try to broaden it then you start including things you feel shouldn't be in there at all. If think that looking for some form of conciousness and trying to reduce suffering is probably the closest we can get to protecting all of what we consider important without including too much extra or excluding things that are considered important. If you want to exclude cancer, but keep fertilised embryos - what traits do you consider being important and worth protecting of one and not the other?","early-fetus-not-human","08:29 PM","abortion-debates","121"
"04-30-2006","7837",9,"Kcajymmij","None","A person has been murdered, in every abortion. The sense of loss or morning depends on how much we know the person, as you will know.","simone","210578","And, God murders a person in every spontaneous abortion.","early-fetus-not-human","09:42 AM","abortion-debates","122"
"04-30-2006","7837",9,"None","None","None","Tastyfish","210584","A slightly odd thought, the trouble with there being no difference between what happens to a fetus if its aborted by humans, or due to some other reason (spontaneus abortion by God for the sake of the arguement) - exactly what is God punishing as all that is happened is a soul has been guaranteed access to heaven rather than having to risk eternal damnation by actually living. Unless of course a fetal soul is significantly different from an adult one (lacking an system of morals and having made no choices) in which case the whole issue of god chosen spontaneous abortions suddenly seems a bit of a grey area (it does seem a little out of character as far as intervention appears to be).","early-fetus-not-human","09:58 AM","abortion-debates","123"
"04-30-2006","7837",9,"simone","None","And, God murders a person in every spontaneous abortion.","georged","210587","Not applicable. Christian belief system advocates are committed to their antiquated collection of policies and procedures which do not allow pursuit of individual requirements such as abortion defined as convenient or common sense. That's the stick and carrot aspect of faith. Do as I say, not as I do.","early-fetus-not-human","10:07 AM","abortion-debates","124"

"05-01-2006","7837",9,"simone","None","Sooo, spontaneous abortion at the convenience of God? Um, OK.","Prototype","210731","??? Convenience of God? I don't understand. But God does set a death time for each person. That could start a whole new thread, so if you want to pursue that, start a new one. But, along with the belief that God performs the spontaneous abortions (Never mind any possible unknown problems inside) also requires that God also grants the life of each person, including your and mine. The possesions we have, the air we breath, the food we eat and the computers we type on. God does care for us, he's not a ruthless killer. You'd have to include these things to make your idea logical.","early-fetus-not-human","09:43 AM","abortion-debates","126"

If God is responsible (directly rather than just creating the original seed) for all the food I may eat, then surely he is just as responsible for the heroin a junkie may OD on? Course I suppose this is sort of alright if God has a true long term plan that will eventually cause the greatest good for a population infinitely more than ours, however that it requires this much work and this much sacrifice surely calls God's omnipotence into question?","early-fetus-not-human","02:51 PM","abortion-debates","129"

Right?","Tastyfish","210979","Personally, I don't think God exists at all so no. However if God is responsible for everything, or even just all natural things that exist outside free will then possibly (the heroin is a product of a natural source and the tendancy to become addict is likely a genetic tendancy combined with being in a situation to be exposed to it). I just can't see the dividing line that would seperate God from being responsible for spontaneous abortion and every other biochemical process ever.","early-fetus-not-human","04:26 PM","abortion-debates","133"

Rights or not, it is wrong and its an injustice to human life to allow killing. If nobody has rights until they are born, you are assuming that life doesn't begin till birth. The only reason they are killed is because they were alive in the first place.","happygrl35","222517","Can you give me an example of a human being living off the body of another without consent?
