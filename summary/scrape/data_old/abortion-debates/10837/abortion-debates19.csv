Awareness of pain as something agonising, does entitle a being to certain rights. So if a foetus is aware of such pain, then it has rights. When does that happen? About week 27-32 Originally Posted by lesz Even a bacterium can perceive its environment. So can a thermostat. Awareness of pain as something agonising, does entitle a being to certain rights. So if a foetus is aware of such pain, then it has rights. When does that happen? Fetal pain, its existence, and its implications are debated politically and academically. Most medical researchers agree pain cannot be felt until around the seventh month of pregnancy.[1]However, there may be an emerging consensus among developmental neurobiologists that the establishment of thalamocortical connections"" (at about 26 weeks) is a critical event with regard to fetal perception of pain.[2] Nevertheless, because pain can involve sensory, emotional and cognitive factors, it is ""impossible to know"" when painful experiences may become possible, even if it is known when thalamocortical connections are established in the 26th week.[2]","Another opinion","303101","Wikipedia has a nice summary of various scientific investigations into Fetal pain: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_pain . To quote just the introduction: So, it seems that, though there is some disagreement between neurologists, there is agreement that fetal pain cannot occur before the 26th week. Prior to that, any reactions to stimulii are just reflex movement.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","10:28 AM","abortion-debates","276"

The blastocyst is formed after 5 days. It has all of the cells necessary to develop into a full grown human adult. So I guess we could call it an underdeveloped human life because it is human and not animal or plant or alien. A 7 year old child is also underdeveloped and has all the cells necessary to form into a full grown human adult. So if it is right to terminate a pregnancy or an unborn human life. Why is it not right to terminate a 7 year old childs life for the same reasons?","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","02:12 PM","abortion-debates","280"

In other words, we need there to be ""somebody home"" in the body, not just a developing body itself. That is the same reason why we don't place much value in the bodies that are left over after someone has suffered so much brain damage that they are no longer mentally existing. Once a person is brain dead - at least in that part of the brain that governs mental function - then the body is just an empty shell. It is equivalent to the religious view of a soul entering or leaving the body. Where embryos and fetuses are concerned, early term embryos and fetuses are just such empty shell whose worth lies ONLY in what they will become in the future - just a step farther from the same worth that an unfertilized egg has in potentially becoming a person in the future. It is only once the fetus gains that mental existence that many of us start claiming rights for the fetus. Based on our understanding of brain development, this cannot happen before roughly the beginning of the third trimester of pregnancy. Even the majority of pro-choice supporters would limit abortion rights in the third trimester - a trend which reflects this and similar reasoning.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","04:08 PM","abortion-debates","281"

I would ask you if you cannot see the considerable difference between a blastocyst and a 7 year old child. I feel the difference is staggeringly great. Do you see no difference at all? If you note any difference, it is worth exploring, and trying to understand why we might treat the two entities differently?

It was very polite and you got your point across. So because the brain isn't fully developed it's ok to end a human life? That reasoning is along the same lines of why slavery was constitutionally ok. Because in the opinion of the oppressors the black man was only considered to be 3/5 human. As for the comparison to someone with brain damage, that is something that cannot be recovered from. A fetus is developing and therefore will become a fully functional human at some point. That is like comparing a totaled vehicle with one being manufactured. The fact that the brain is not fully developed does not make it less human. It's just an attempt to justify terminating a pregnancy. As for religous views of the soul entering the body for the first time, that is a whole different debate but I understand the point you were making. The problem is that as a society it is ok to end an unborn human life based on the opinion that the life is worth less than that of our own. As for the unfertilized egg, it does not have all the cells necessary to develop into a fully functional human life. It is not a human life until it is fertilized. Some may call that an opinion but according to biology it is a fact.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","12:59 AM","abortion-debates","284"

I don't feel it is right to judge life based on what it looks like. Sure the blastocyst looks like a blob and a little kid looks like a precious bundle of joy (sometimes). But the fact that they look different doesn't mean that it is ok to destroy the uglier of the two. Also, it is never morally right to destroy one human life to save another. It is really hard for this society to not judge by appearences. Don't forget that many woman decide to terminate their pregnancies at 7 weeks and up. Have you seen images of a 7 week aborted fetus? You can see fingers and toes.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","01:05 AM","abortion-debates","285"
