"02-08-2008","10837",8,"Steeeeve","300453","Human rights aren't just in the law. Do you think rights just exists in the law? If so then if a right doesn't exist how can one say they have a right to something? How is that backpedaling? And how can you say they were due human rights when the law didn't say so? And if they were always persons and the law didn't treat them as such then how were they persons if the law is the only thing that defines this (as you seem to think)? You are all over the place it seems. Rights are not given by the law. I agree, the law and the way the law treats someone does not affect their personhood. Now apply that to an unborn baby and you see that personhood does not get defined by just the law. And roe v. wade was only referring to the original meaning of the 14th amendment. So it was not an overall view. Then what do you state? Were blacks treated as equal persons under the law in the 1800s? If not, then explain why they were still persons if the law didn't say so. Answered in the last post. Why are you scared to answer? Because you know the human embryo and fetus is a human being? Fallacy aside, that does not fit the definition so no. The unborn does fit the definition and is therefore a human being. You just did in the last post Roe vs. Wade never declared an unborn not to be a person...just not a person in terms of the 14th amendment. So were blacks inferior beings in the 1800s? You haven't claimed no species? Then what species is the unborn? Only to a fool. So if the law changes then you'd be against abortion? Human being is a biological issue and it just so happens the unborn is defined as a human being (no surprise). And you agree with this? Perhaps I should start counting how many times you use the word ""lie"" (or variation) in your posts. The good thing about this is that it gives me an idea of who I am posting too.","Dane","300770","One can say anything they want. But they don't hold a right until a law or rule supports that right. Because you first insisted that it was about African-Americans not being person's under the law and you now going away from that claim when proven wrong. Because that's my opinion. Actually, the law DID treat them as persons, just not as citizens and free persons. Rights are guaranteed by the law. Unless you have the law, you have no rights. Actually, the issue specifically was whether their designation as property affected them being persons, and it didn't as you now finally admit to despite denying it previously. As I said, I accept your appology for being wrong before. It does actually. It just happens that slaves DID fit within the definition of a person, while an embryo does not. As the 14th Amendment IS the Amendment dealing with personhood, yes it is. The law still saw them as persons. The law didn't give them rights as free persons, but they were still persons. Nope. You did NOT provide any clear answer to how members of a species is defined. Why must you lie ? (bolded and underlied per your request - see later) ""Being"" still implies individual existence. As such, embryos and fetuses are not beings. No fallacy. YOUR definition fits a hydatidiform mole as well as an embryo or fetus. Actually, it DOES fit your definition. It is a human fetus but not a being. Likewise, the hydatidiform mole is a human hydatidiform mole but not a being. Nope, I never called the fetus a parasite. YOU ARE LYING !!!! And as the 14th Amendment is the one dealing with that subject, Roe vs Wade showed that the fetus is not a person, your revisionist linguistic hyperbole none withstanding. ""inferiour beings""? I don't recall having seen that claimed anywhere. Correct. So you are again lying . It may be a human unborn. Again, how do you define a member of a species? Despite your lies , you have NOT given an answer to this. Please explain what a ""type specimen"" is and how that has implications for your argument. And again, what implications do your argument have for a hydatidiform mole growing in a human woman's uterus? Reported (that is how you debate, after all, right?) The law's definition of a person is irrelevant to my view on abortions, so no. This is an issue of you lying about the fetus being abortion, nothing else. It has nothing to do with abortions, ONLY about your LIES . Your claim about the fetus being ""defined"" as a human being is just another LIE in the long row of LIES you have continued to spew here. It is pathetic that you must LIE all the time in order to post and that you don't know how not to LIE . With the intent of the law, no. That at the time this indeed was the law, yes. Have at it. The way you post, that count will go up as your are rapidly escalating your LIES . (I am bolding and underlining it every time to help your counting). So if you are dissatisfied with how many times I call you on your LIES in these posts, the simple solution is for you to stop LYING all the time. Yes, somebody who will challenge you when you lie .","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","01:16 AM","abortion-debates","106"
"02-08-2008","10837",8,"Steeeeve","300602","Blacks were legally property. There was no legal ruling on the definition of a word just like their wasn't in Roe vs Wade. Blacks were not considered persons under the law in that they were not treated as such. If you are property you are already not treated as a person. No?","Dane","300771","Your claim is false.

"02-08-2008","10837",8,"Steeeeve","300604","A parasite has to be an entity of another species by definition. There is also nothing in the definition that requires one be self sustaining and if this were true a newborn wouldn't fit the definition.","Dane","300772","But you can be ""regarded as a parasite"" if this means that there is a parasitic function regardless of species designation or the lack thereof. If I somehow attach myself to your blood supply and generate a nutrient drain from you, then I am acting in a parasitic fashion.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","01:24 AM","abortion-debates","108"
"02-08-2008","10837",8,"Steeeeve","300766","They were legally property. Substance over form qualifies here, just because the constitution doesn't take the time to define who is or isn't a person doesn't mean it doesn't inherently do so. It did say they were property though and that makes you not a person.","Dane","300773","False. Nowhere in the Constitution is personhood dependent on whether you are a slave or not.

"02-08-2008","10837",8,"Steeeeve","300632","Physically independent of the mother, sentient, and self-aware are three things not required to be a human being. An entity with human dna is all that is required. Your liver is part of an entity and not an entity itself. Well using your definition (which is wrong it does have to be a different species) then you just admitted the fetus is a separate individual did you not? Dependency is not a criteria for obtaining rights. A new born is 100% dependent but they have rights.","lesz","300784","A liver can be transplanted, it can be kept alive outside the human body. So can human cell lines. A flask of human cells is packed with human DNA, but not even the pope would claim it's a human being. At least, I hope he wouldn't. So yes... physical independence and sentience are required for a definition of human being. It's an individual organism, though it's organically wholly dependent on its host. That doesn't make it a human being in any objective sense, using a definition based in part on sentience, which is in my correct view, essential. Of course they do. But a baby doesn't have a parasitical existence, it's a completely, physically separate organism. Anyone can look after it. Foetuses have fewer rights, however, in part because of their total, physical dependence on and umbilical attachment to their host, and in earlier embryos, because of their lack of sentience, or even a brain to be sentient with. A post-natal baby is not the equivalent of an attached foetus in the womb. Even a non-biologist should be able to tell the difference.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","03:01 AM","abortion-debates","111"

Unless you have the law, you have no rights."" is not correct. In this country we are allowed All Rights except those precluded by law. All powers not defined in the constitution were left to the states which were considered 'the people' For instance, if you found a completely new compound that made people feel awesome, until the Govt. passed a specific law against it, you could sell it all you wanted (just like coke cola, or LSD). Basically, you can do ANYTHING that is not against the law... you have the Right to do anything, until the govt.
