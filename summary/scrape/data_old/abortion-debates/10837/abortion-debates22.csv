Look at the two things you are comparing for goodness sake! Get real. I think the difference is obvious. That is all I am trying to say. Well you could. But it would be stupid because partially born has no meaning.","Steeeeve","303729","Of course they are different in some ways. My point is that a 1 day old baby and a 50yr old adult are also really really different. All are similar in certain ways too. For example they all are separate organisms with unique human DNA. Yes it does and by admitting you can use that term you accept it to have meaning. I'm not sure how else you could refer to a baby that is literally partially born.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","03:44 PM","abortion-debates","316"
"02-27-2008","10837",22,"None","None","None","thelmoose","303737","A final word. My involvement in this post started with a post by precious who had ""one simple question to ask."" He or she wanted to know why it is not OK to terminate the life of a 7 year old, but it would be OK to terminate the life of a blastocyst. I don't think that is a simple question, but it is a simplistic one. Unfortunately, this is a complex concern and sophomoric over-simplications such as this does nothing to help intelligent discussion. Some people consider we may treat these two entities differently. Why would that be? The amazingly obvious answer is because they are very different entities. Certainly they share some characteristics, but are they are not the same. Obviously not. That is why there is room for discussion on how one might treat these two entities differently. If you feel it is not right to terminate the life of a blastocyst because it has the potential to develop into a viable baby, fine. I see that as a valid point. I disagree, but I see the point. But to imply that the difference between the blastocyst and the grade schooler is so small that they are essentially the same is absurd. Calling this a ""simple question"" ignores some obvious facts. That is all I am trying to say. Lastly, using a moniker like precious life implies you think life is precious. The further implication is that others do not. I would guess there are some persons who do not consider life precious but I am not one of them. If you are of the belief that no persons who are favor legalized abortion consider life precious, you are incorrect.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","04:18 PM","abortion-debates","317"

That is where we will forever differ. To say one person has the right to choose over another persons life is sickening. The question still remains. Who should make the decision, regardless of whether or not you think the choice is ""sickening"", the pregnant woman or some nameless faceless government bureaucrat? Remember, if you choose the bureaucrat, you must needs have a penalty for the violation of his DIKTAT . Just what penalty do you suggest is appropriate for a woman who terminates her pregnancy, and, more important, are willing to have that sanction applied to the women in your family? If you are going to force a woman to carry her ppregnancy to term, are you willing to force one of the righttofetallifers to adopt that child and give it the love, discipline, and money it qwill need to be a productive member of society?","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","05:31 PM","abortion-debates","319"
"02-27-2008","10837",22,"preciouslife","303720","Stem cells from a tiny mole can not be used to create human parts because it is not human. The blastocyst has all the stemcells necessary to create all of the functional human parts. If you have issues with this then go to: ""I can't post liinks because my post count isn't high enough yet"" I'll say it again and again, a blastocyst has all the cells necessary to develop into a fully functional adult human life. After 21 days there is a heart beat at about 75-80 beats per minute. It pumps blood throughout the entire body. That's what the heart does, it pumps blood. Saying my research is incorrect and assuming I do not understand what I am talking about takes away from the heart of the debate. At 3 weeks the brain divides into 3 sections (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain). I can go into more details if you like. Do you want me to go into more details? Funny, you talk about detracting from a discussion about abortion and you've been doing this the entire time by attacking every little word I write I have been pro-life since long before the websites existed. You sound like you are getting angry. I am not using emotional histrionics. And what does pro-life websites and imagery have to do with our current debate? Am I pusing images on you? Dane, this is getting rediculous. You keep attacking my words and my research and my education but you are having difficulties with simple words. You get angry when I call a fetus an unborn child! Look in the dictionary! Go to Merriam Websters online dictionary and look at the 1st definition of child. The unborn have always been properly referred to as children. : an unborn or unhatched vertebrate especially after attaining the basic structural plan of its kind; specifically : a developing human from usually two months after conception to birth Oh, wait... my wife had a scheduled cesarean where there was no labor! My children were never born. They're nothing more than a couple of fetuses running around! If you call me an anti-choicer then using the same logic, YOU would be an anti-lifer. When the sperm fertilizes the egg and the blastocyst is formed all the cells are present to form a fully functional adult human. So in my opinion, the blastocyst is a developing human life, just like a born child is still developing. Are mole cells not different than human cells? So you have just explained yourself. You feel that regardless of how advanced the fetus is, you feel the choice of the woman outweighs the childs right to life. That is where we will forever differ. To say one person has the right to choose over another persons life is sickening. So that brings me back to my original question for you Dane. Why is it not right to destroy a 2 month old childs life? It feeds off of mother and it feeds off of the money that dad and mom labor for. I understand your logic if you believe the part about being sentient is relevant. But you stated that it is not, so you feel the mother deserves more freedom than the unborn child. You believe it is ok to end ones life for the sake of convenience? So it's ok for an unborn child to be a second-class citizen? Taking away the womans right to destroy her child is not about taking away her choice. It is about giving the child the freedom and the right to life that it so deserves. I will no longer use the word baby to refer to an unborn child. But your definition of child is wrong as stated before. Look in the dictionary. I don't like dishonesty either. But I've not been dishonest. I stand behind everything I've said. I don't debate often, I try to stick to facts. You are trying your best, or at least it would appear, to stray from the heart of the debate and pick at little things. I'm fine with woman or men or anyone have freedom to control their own bodies and anything they do so as long as it does not hurt another person. Unfortunately, abortion is a choice that harms another life. That life being an unborn child.","Dane","303781","You have NO clue what a hydatidiform mole is, do you! Please educate yourself: http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec22/ch252/ch252h.html http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydatidiform_mole And the hydatidiform moles have exactly the same genetic makeup. And at that time, there is nothing but a pulsating tube that does not pump anything. Why do you persist in repeating that lie? Are you deliberately dishonest, or just to lazy to check out things before you post them as facts? regardless, you end up posting falsehoods. It doesn't take away from you posting a flat-out falsehood of the ""fetus"" [sic} feeling pain at 6 weeks. THAT is the issue here, you posting falsehoods. Yes, please. Include what a ""brain"" is and what the significance of your claim is (other than your already proven false claim of pain sensation). Have an HONEST discussion with factual information, and we have a chance. When you continue to make false claims, whether deliberately or from extreme ignorance, then there can be no honest discussion until that falsehood has been resolved. So are you saying that you got those falsehoods from somewhere other than the pro-life lie-sites? fascinating. What lies preceded the lie-sites? Not at all, I am merely disgusted with all pro-lifers' endless dishonesty and ignorance. So until they/you are honest, there is little other to do than expose that endless stream of lies and misrepresentations. Sure you are, I documented it. You denying what is documented is merely a strong indication that you are not honest. You referenced them and the fetal pron silliness they try to push. All of which have been documented circumspect to the point where even other pro-lifers find fault with your claim. The ridiculousness is you clinging to claims that have been proven false. So agree to be an undead corpse, ok whatever. If you have such a desperate need for your revisionist linguistics and emotional histrionics, then it is clear that you have no actual argument, only sophistry. Well, just for the heck of it, I checked ""fetus"": There was labor, actually. It is not my fault that you don't know what labor is. Actually not. You oppose women having the choice to have an abortion. I don't oppose life. Nope. There are some of the ones what can eventually divide and change into a person. And the blastocyst doesn't form until the 5th day. The initial cell is a ZYGOTE. Once again, you show extreme ignorance of even basic aspects of this issue. How can you expect us to take you serious with such severe ignorance? You essentially have no fact or knowledge, only emotional fervor. And how do you know whether it becomes an ""adult person"" or a hydatidiform mole? Or even that it actually implants rather than end up getting flushed into the sewer as rat food because it doesn't implant (as is the case with far the majority of the fertilized zygotes. And in my opinion, it is a mass of non-sentient, non-sensate cells. So what? Nope. How would you tell the difference? A cell with the same number of chromosomes and genes, human in origin, no different than that of the zygote? Nope. It outweighs an embryo's or a fetus ""right"" to use the woman's bodily resources against her will. I said nothing about children, your emotional histrionics none withstanding. Yes, we have a difference in OPINION. A position I do not hold, your blatant lie none withstanding. Or is that another one of your mistakes, one of those cases where you misrepresent an embryo as a ""person,"" desperately clinging to the sophistry of your revisionist linguistic hyperbole? Back to my original point: Sentience and sensation. And the woman has the choice to let it or not. No bodily resources involved there. Irrelevant claptrap. What matters is the woman's right to not be enslaved. To not be second-class citizens to the theocratic, misogynistic culture you promote, a culture of oppression and control of women. No, she deserves more freedom than the fetus or embryo. I fail to see the individual existence, the individuality qualifying the embryo or fetus as ""one."" Back to the emotional histrionics, you corpse, you. Fetuses and embryos, of course, are not citizens your misrepresentation and dishonest distortion none withstanding. But then, nobody talk about destroying children, your misrepresentation none withstanding. And once there is a child, after birth, that indeed is the case. A hollow promise, as there is nothing such as an unborn child. Your pathetic desire to use fudge terms to blur known and specific distinctions merely result in misrepresentations. Please learn the CORRECT terminology so we don't have to continue this silliness of you trying for sophistry instead of honest discussion. The fudging sophistry you push is dishonest. I see nothing to disconfirms you being dishonest. Sophistry is not honest. I am looking forward to your factual, honest discussion where we can deal with the subject rather than your emotionally-laden misrepresentations. I want to discuss the subject, but not based on misrepresentations and revisionist linguistics. If you want to discuss facts, then you would use factual terminology rather than trying for emotional platitudes and emotional histrionics. But then, an embryo or a fetus are not persons. Rather, that life being an embryo or a fetus, your lame sophistry none withstanding. But yes, the embryo or fetus does die as it is dependent on the woman's bodily resources. If you find a way to remove the embryo or fetus without killing it per lack of resources, then I will be all for it. Until then, it is not acceptable to enslave women for the sake of tissue.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","10:53 PM","abortion-debates","320"

Now, given that you now know what a hydatidiform mole is, how does that tie in with your claim of what a human life or a person is?? So? Your use is deceitful and dishonest. The question here is whether you want an honest decision or merely an exercise in how good you are at sophistry. Are you honest or merely here to rant, THAT is the question. Yes. As long as you chose to use fudge terminology, revisionist linguistics and emotional hyperbole, THAT ends up being the subject of the discussion. Now, if you would rather have a factual discussion about abortion, that would certainly be much more productive. So far you have not given any inclination that such is your goal here. Well, then we can certainly have an honest discussion about that. If you are up for an honest discussion rather than sophistry. And I have factual evidence on my side. ""Person"" is a legal term based on the US Constitution. And it is clear per legal rulings that ""person"" does not apply to the unborn at any stage. It is only about words and terminology if you so chose per dishonest hyperbole and sophistry. THAT choice is yours. And you have that choice in a free country where the Government doesn't control your body and your soul. Isn't that nice? Nope. I believe that ""life"" that is not sentient does not control life that is. Ah, finishing with a dishonest attribution of others intent. yeah, clear evidence that you are not interested in honest and factual discussion. You can stuff your ad hominem dishonest fundie misogynist. It is human life, it is not ""a"" human life as in an individual.

Thank you for responding with a thoughtful answer instead of criticizing my every word. I actually see things a little differently now. It goes along the same lines as freedom of expression. A pro-abort might despise pictures of aborted fetuses posted in public places, but to try to prevent such things is taking away that of free speech/expression. For the pro-abort it is about choice and the freedom thereof. For the Pro-life (like myself) it is about life and the freedom to live it. It is extremely difficult to be pro-life in this world. I just wish that pro-aborts would understand that the majority of pro-lifers don't want to take away a womans freedom so much as we want to save what we believe is a life. I don't think the majority of pro-aborts understand how difficult it is for us to see so many lives being destroyed (what we believe is a life). It makes things like 9/11 and the ""war on terror"" seem so minute. It's sad that several thousand of our soldiers have died and it's sad that many other innocent people have lost their lives, but as a pro-lifer, thousands of lives are destroyed daily. It may seem foolish to a pro-abort, and if that is the case then so be it. The only way I can find peace is in my faith as a Christian. God knows what is true and just and he knows our hearts also. By the blood of Christ we can have eternal life. I believe the unborn will be saved. It is not my job to judge a person. God is the only judge. I can truly say that I hope I am wrong on my views of abortion.
