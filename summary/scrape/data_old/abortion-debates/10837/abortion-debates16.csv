That's why you trash science and defend religion.","Steeeeve","302327","I never said science was a cult...yet another thing you can't show. I said your religion is a cult. Trash science by calling scientists ""XXXXXX""? Oh wait, that's you.

"02-18-2008","10837",16,"Dane","302324","Regardless of what creationist lie-sites have told you, brain waves is the electrochemical pattern of interaction between the brain's cortex, brain-stem etc. As the connection that makes this possible doesn't happen until the end of the 26th week of pregnancy, this is also the time when the first actual brain waves occur. Now, 26th week is NOT early in the pregnancy.","Steeeeve","302329","Like normal, science disagrees with you: The brain is developing rather early and brain waves are detectable between 6-8wks http://pregnancychildbirth.suite101....egnancy_week_8 Be sure provide sources with your post to back up your ""26th week"" argument. Edit to add another reference: http://www.pregnancy.org/article.php?sid=1488 Day 40: Brain waves can be detected and recorded.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","03:15 PM","abortion-debates","227"

Look up ""thalamocortical tract"" Good heavens do we have to teach you EVERYTHING? Brainwaves are coordinated electrical impulses, not random ones. AT 40 d, the fetal ""brainwaves"" are similar to those you get from a plant. Go learn what brainwaves are, why don't you.

YOU are the one with a religion. I'm an atheist -- and that isn't a religion. And no... I've never called scientists XXXXXX. Neither have I trashed science -- that's your forte, because you pay it absolutely no heed at all. I've criticised the opinion of the idiot you quoted, because you were labouring under the mistaken impression it was a scientifically valid one, whereas he was merely contriving a definition to suit the anti-aborts. But you didn't understand enough of it to realise it wasn't valid.

Indeed, you merely implied it with terms like ""local yokel"" and dismissive of scientists that disagree with your religion. Wait I take it back because you just called him an idiot here.

I've seen how much mental and physical damage they can do to people, believers or not. Sometimes especially non-believers. But as you cannot identify what religion your bizarre imagination seems to associate me with, I'd suggest it's plain stupid to call a non-existent religion a cult. Since i have no religion, there are no scientists who disagree with it. The local yokel wasn't disagreeing with me, he was clearly contriving a pseudo-scientific definition for the sake of his religious beliefs. You anti-abortion activists ought to give science envy a rest. Sorry, dear, but I was just pointing out the yokel in question wasn't, in fact, making any kind of scientific argument. He wasn't proposing or testing any hypothesis. He was simply making assertions of opinion you happen to agree with because they fit in with your religion. For all I know, the yokel hadn't even intended to make a statement that purported to be scientifically valid, despite being nothing more than a personal opinion. It could be you simply misread what he said. Wouldn't surprise me at all -- you often read things into what people write that were never there. On the other hand, if he meant it the way you read it, I'll repeat he is an idiot.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","08:23 AM","abortion-debates","236"

Brain development isn't complete till some years after birth. Nerve cells start firing at about 6 weeks, but this isn't indicative of anything except that they are beginning to form synaptic networks and just starting to slowly organise themselves into a brain. There is a difference between the nascent brain which starts forming just before 6 weeks, and the rapid acceleration of brain development that begins at about 25-28 weeks. Or if you prefer, there's the Wiki summary. Note, the nervous system doesn't really develop enough to control any bodily functions till about the 26th week after fertilisation. One can call it a ""brain"", but what it really is, is a ""proto-brain"" -- the precursor of the mature brain. Its brain waves don't mean what you seem to think, that it is the developmental, emotional, conscious equivalent of a child or an adult human being. Scientifically speaking, that's nonsense.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","09:06 AM","abortion-debates","237"
