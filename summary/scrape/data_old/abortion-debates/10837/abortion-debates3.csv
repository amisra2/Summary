"02-03-2008","10837",3,"Ghost Rider","299921","Last I checked anybody who murders a pregnant woman doesn't face two counts of first degree murder, only one. Fetuses aren't counted as actual persons according to the law, so I don't see how murder of a nonperson could be illegal, or even possible. If a fetus isn't going to be counted as a person then abortion can't truly be considered a crime now can it? A judge on Friday upheld Pennsylvania's fetal homicide law in the case of a woman who is charged with assault of a pregnant woman that resulted in the death of the fetus, the AP/Philadelphia Inquirer reports (AP/Philadelphia Inquirer, 1/27). Corinne Wilcott was charged with ""murder of an unborn child"" and ""aggravated assault of an unborn child,"" after Sheena Carson miscarried her 15-week-old fetus four days after Wilcott allegedly attacked Carson. Wilcott's attorney Tim Lucas previously argued that the state's 1999 Crimes Against the Unborn Child Act is unconstitutional because the state allows a woman to terminate her pregnancy through abortion in the first 24 weeks, but under the statute in question a person could be charged with murder for killing a fetus of any age (Kaiser Daily Reproductive Health Report, 12/02/2002). Erie County, Pa., judge John Trucilla said that there was ""no contradiction"" or ""double standard"" between the fetal homicide and abortion laws because a woman can choose to have an abortion, but has no choice in an attack that results in the death of the fetus, the AP/Centre Daily Times reports.","lesz","299948","As a matter of fact, I think the law in some states now treat a foetus as a separate person in the case of an assault against a pregnant woman. For example, this case appeared in 2003: Judge Upholds Pennsylvania's Fetal Homicide Law in Fetal Murder Case And in Georgia and probably elsewhere, anti-choice activists are pushing the so-called ""Human Life Amendment"" to the state constitution that would make a foetus a legal person: Georgia's House Bill 1 (HB1) This would criminalise any act that resulted in the death of a foetus. So there are legal precedents for treating a foetus as a separate person, and if the law changes this definition, well, that becomes the new definition, irrespective of what biologists or women think or want. The law doesn't have to make sense, after all, it can be a completely arbritrary convention. As a man, BTW, let me agree with you that I don't think men really have anything valid to say about individual abortion decisions. It's never their body under consideration. However, they are entitled to general moral views on the matter. My own view is that within certain limits, such decisions should be left up to individual conscience, and no-one, male or female, should be able to dictate to any woman what she does with her pregnancy. The limits I have in mind are pretty close to the compromise that already exists in US law, with abortion being available virtually on demand in the first trimester and increasing restrictions thereafter, as I believe a foetus gradually acquires a certain right to life during development. However, I don't believe it's an absolute right that always overcomes the mother's right to life and make her own decisions especially if her own life is threatened by the pregnancy.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","03:16 AM","abortion-debates","33"

"02-03-2008","10837",3,"Steeeeve","299915","And yet you want to decide the fate for another as well. So wouldn't this make you a biased party? Seems you wouldn't be capable of making a moral decision when you have some personal benefit at stake. Should a victim in a case be able to decide the fate of the defendant? Should oil companies get to talk about global warming? The answer to those are NO because the two parties are biased and have a stake in the decision that limits their ability to make a good decision. Does this mean we shouldn't listen to women regarding abortion? No. It means women have no more standing to speak on the issue than men. You realize that rape accounts for about or less than 1% of abortions. Perhaps you should give a reason for the 99% of abortions that happen instead of opting for fallacy talk.","Dane","299993","""Another"" implies individual existence, which embryos and fetuses do not hold.

Just more sophistry. And as you have some strong conviction about abortion, you should be excluded from any say about the subject as well, right? Or are you a hypocrite who seeks to limit others input while controlling them? They **DO** however have standing to control their own bodies regardless of how much you seek to enslave and control them. Because the woman does not want to be pregnant, because the woman does not want her bodily resources used against her will.

You wouldn't have your mechanic take care of your bypass surgery would you? Excuse me? Women are the only ones who can get pregnant. We should be the ones with the only standing on the matter!

Better supply the source of those statistics to back up your argument.","Steeeeve","300003","The correct analogy would be that you wouldn't want the patient deciding a bypass surgery is needed. The doctor is an unbiased professional that knows what is best. The morality of abortion is not something men are naturally uninformed about. Under your crazy theory, no one can talk about death being a bad thing (or undesired) because we should only ask those who have died. Therefore we can't make any laws regarding murder. It's absurd. Get better analogies. No. And at worst I have been a part of a pregnancy (The baby) so I know half the battle. There are two parties involved in a pregnancy. I also suppose white people can't support civil rights for black people because they don't know what it is like to be black. That is the only logical conclusion from your argument and it seems a little racist. (as a note: I realize this is a logical fallacy). You just said it was in the last post!

Awww, I am trying to control you by making it so you can't kill someone. Oh so sorry. You can't kill me either by the way....double enslavement!

But it would be so vaguely worded that it would criminalize masturbation since every sperm has the potential to become a child. I still believe it, but I'm gonna use a different argument. I wonder how many men are really in support of a ban on abortion. How many of you scumbags that have some side-whore that you f**k when the wife isn't looking or not in the mood, would be in favor of a law that would make it impossible for your side-whore to have an abortion if you got her pregnant?
