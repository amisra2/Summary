"02-26-2008","10837",21,"preciouslife","303635","I was referring to late 2nd and 3rd trimester. But now that I think about it, a 21 week fetus has a 15% chance of survival outside the womb. So lets make my view of a late term after 21 weeks. On the matter of partial birth, I responded just a few minutes ago to thelmoose about that. I'll say again that it is unknown whether or not a child can feel pain at 6 weeks. As for the extremely rare case where a womans life is at risk because of the baby and she has to choose between herself or the child which could result in possible death for both. Who am I to say what decision she should make. That is a horrible thing for someone to have to choose. I do know, however, that my wife almost died during pregnancy and right after pregnancy because of the baby and she would have never chose herself. As for the innocent thing... a kid an adult a fetus an old person about to die, whatever... how about just another life, innocent or not. I think most people would agree that a newborn child is pretty innocent. So in my ""opinion"" that would apply to the fetus as well.","Dane","303640","False. 21 weeks of pregnancy is fetal age of 19 weeks. NO 19 week fetus has ever survived. Again, I recommend you get your facts straight before making such claims. Any more of this claptrap and I'll have to start accusing you of outright falsehoods and dishonesty. Do you really want to go there? And you were wrong. And repeating that falsehood merely makes it a repeated falsehood. There is no neural cortex at 6 weeks, your claim is false. I suggest you go read up on the thalamocortical tract before making ANY more claims about this. Here are a couple of links for you to educate yourself so that you will no more make this false claim: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1...?dopt=Abstract http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1...?dopt=Abstract http://www.parliament.uk/post/pn094.pdf http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4...?dopt=Abstract I take it that you are not educated about maternal mortality in pregnancy, then? Huh? Well, at least you dropped the emotional histrionics. And so what? In my opinion, if the woman doesn't want to be pregnant, then the fetus or embryo is invasive tissue using her body against her will in a parasitic fashion.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","09:11 PM","abortion-debates","302"
"02-26-2008","10837",21,"Dane","303634","If it had all the cells, then there would be no more growth. It has a pulsating heart tube. To claim that as a heartbeat is grossly exaggerated. More emotional histrionics. And the question begged, of course, is what that matters. Some muscle cells with an automatic pulsation rhythm are pulsating. So what? Not unknown, science actually explored this. And no, there is absolutely NO pain sensation at 6 weeks. You have to add another 20-26 weeks before there is any sensation. So that claim is nonsense. This is where you need to actually educate yourself from scientific sources rather than getting your info from pro-choice lie-sites. Nope. ""Birth"" is a specific term referring to the 3 stages of labor. No such occurrence happens during an abortion, so your CATCH PHRASE, your expression of emotional histrionics is indeed meaningless your denial none withstanding. That sounds like pure nonsense. More emotional histrionics. ""Baby"" is a term referring to a developmental stage beginning AFTER birth (you know, after the 3 stages of labor). As such, claiming that the fetus is a ""baby"" certainly IS a catch-phrase, is emotional histrionics and revisionist linguistic hyperbole. (1) How is it innocent? (2) ""unborn child"" sounds like more emotional histrionics. Sounds like the equivalent of calling you an undead corpse. Do you really think that is a normal and descriptive term, or does it sound stupid and contrived, just like ""unborn baby"" does?","preciouslife","303643","I'm gonna have to say you are incorrect on this one Dane.

At 6 weeks the fetus responds to prodding or stimulus. If you have a ""scientific"" source otherwise then please share it with us. Oh, ok so that's why ""Partial Birth"" has no clinical meaning. Well whether or not my term was correct, the procedure is still the same. My 1st child did not make it full term, he was a little premature. I guess he wasn't born.

And if you go for chromosomes or germ-cells as defining of human life, then you also have to insist that a hydatidiform mole is human life and should be protected. Are you REALLY willing to do so, or do you think it is time to discard your contrived and artificial distinction here? It has a heart tube beat. there is no heart yet. Again, your attempt at misrepresentation is bothersome and evidencing that you are either dishonest or didn't bother educating yourself beyond the emotional imagery. Either way, when you make misrepresentations and mistakes like that, THAT becomes the issue of the posts, instead of the subject you originally raised. If you want to discuss the issues, I recommend you know enough to make intelligent and accurate posts about it instead of inaccuracies we then get bogged down talking about. Fascinating. How do you define ""brain,"" and do you have any idea what the meaning of what you just said actually is? Your sloppy research is not my problem. Again, go actually educate yourself so at least there is no debate about what the facts are. because otherwise, your incorrect ""research"" becomes the subject instead. But hey, if you want to detract from a discussion about abortion by making it into a discussion about pro-life inaccuracies, exaggerations, misrepresentations and expressed falsehoods, go right on ahead continuing your emotional histrionics. At 6 weeks, it is an embryo, not a fetus. We are talking REALLY BASIC stuff here, so could you please educate yourself a bit more about this issue. That aside, a response does NOT mean consciousness. You can kill me and still have my leg respond to reflex stimulation. Does that mean my leg would be an independent living entity even after I am dead? I recommend you educating yourself about what a reflex is. It does NOT involve actually feeling something or have awareness of a stimulus. So an embryo or fetus ""responding"" doesn't mean that there is any sensation of pain. All sensation is processed in the brain's cortex. And I gave several links previous, showing that the connection from the sensory/peripheral nervous system to the brain's cortex is not hooked up until about the end of the 26th week of pregnancy (ie end of the 24th week of fetal age). So I recommend you NOT further persist in the pro-life lie about fetuses and pain sensation at 6 weeks or even 12-15 weeks. Check my links if you at all care to educate yourself about this issue. And I also recommend you NOT get your scientific/medical information from pro-life lie-sites that owe their existence to scare mongering lies in order to get donations and disciples for their ""cause."" A cause build on such lies is not much of a cause. See post 302 again: http://www.4forums.com/political/sho...&postcount=302 Yes, it is emotional histrionics by pro-life lie-sites in order to push emotional imagery to make you forget that they have no actual facts and are lying. I am %$#@$#@%$ sick of pro-life liars and I am saddened that you bought right into it. That would be ""not."" Correct terminology does matter. certainly. Now, if you want to discuss the procedure rather than pro-life lies, that's fine with me. But at least show enough respect for us to educate yourself about it and actually know what you are talking about. It is pointless to discuss pro-life strawman arguments. Why? I hope you are not deliberately misrepresenting how I defined labor, right? After all, if the 3 stages of labor occurred, then birth occurred. It has nothing to do with timing but rather about process. So why that silly remark. That was just MORE emotional histrionics. Please try to go with factual stuff instead, please. Who is anti-lifer? And it is more than different words, it is about misrepresentation and stark dishonesty. It is very hard to have a respectful discussion with an pro-lifer when that pro-lifer either deliberately or unwittingly posts falsehoods and lies (even if they are not your own lies). Absolutely. For not trying, you are doing a bang-up job at it with the emotional misrepresentations. How do you define ""human life""? Is an appendix a human life? Is the hydatidiform mole a human life since it is formed by the merging of a human sperm and a human egg? I tend to go with born, sensate, sentient persons over non-sensate, non-sentient tissue any day. I am sad that you do not. Sentience. But that even is not relevant. Nowhere else are we forcing people to give of their bodily resources against their will. Only when it comes to a non-sentient, non-sensate embryo or fetus do pro-lifers think it is OK to take such control away from the woman and enslaving her. To me it doesn't matter one bit how advanced the fetus is. All the pro-life arguments about development is utterly irrelevant and only serves as a source of discussions being derailed into the issue of pro-life dishonesty. The ONLY thing that matters is the woman's right to control her own bodily resources rather than being enslaved as a second-class citizen. That's the ONLY argument that matters to me. It doesn't matter if the fetus is Einstein, it doesn't have the right to use the woman's bodily resources against her will any more than a lung cancer tumor has the right to use your body against your will. Sure, no problem there. But then, it also is non-specific. Sperm is alive and are human cells, so they also are very young human lives. So that is just more attempt from pro-life of emotional histrionics and choosing words for emotional impact rather than factuality. It is lame and dishonest and lends you to accusations of dishonesty. Because it is incorrect and emotional histrionics and revisionist linguistic hyperbole. It is dishonest. ""Baby"" refers to a developmental stage that begins after birth. Why the dishonest need for emotional vocabulary. Is it because your argument doesn't stand on facts alone? From where I sit, that would be the ONLY reason for such insistence on inaccuracies and deception. Why? ""Child"" also is a stage beginning after birth. It will merely have me make remarks about your dishonesty. Again, if THAT is what you want the discussion to be about, have at it. But if you want a factual and honest discussion about abortions, then it requires YOU to be factual and honest as well. Your choice. From the end of week 8 to birth, that would be correct and accurate terminology, yes. In a discussion where pro-lifers insist on talking about developmental stages, such accuracy is vitally important. So yes, Fetus will work for me. Bothered? I have never stated that I am bothered by you viewing embryos and fetuses like that. I recommend you not try to portray me as being bothered by that. It is the pro-life insistence on inaccurate and misleading vocabulary that bothers me. I would say that is an accurate description of our differences. Because it is misleading, it is inaccurate, it is emotional histrionics. It is as silly and inaccurate as when I refer to you as an undead corpse. If you want a discussion based on emotional reactivity, then go ahead and use all those misleading, inaccurate terms, and you will end up with a discussion about pro-life vocabulary and level of honesty instead of a discussion about abortions. Which discussion is it you seek to have here? Yes, I can't stand dishonesty in debates. I can't stand misrepresentations. If you can not respect others enough to have an HONEST discussion with them, then no debate is feasible, only a fight about the level of the dishonesty in your arguments and terminology. So how is that working for you so far? have you had a lot of debate about abortions themselves so far? And when you are factually correct and point it out to me, I adjust to be factual as well. I expect you to show good faith and HONESTY and do the same. Do you love womens' freedom to control their own bodies instead of being enslaved to non-sensate, non-sentient tissue by theocrats?

The blastocyst has all the stemcells necessary to create all of the functional human parts. If you have issues with this then go to: ""I can't post liinks because my post count isn't high enough yet"" I'll say it again and again, a blastocyst has all the cells necessary to develop into a fully functional adult human life. After 21 days there is a heart beat at about 75-80 beats per minute. It pumps blood throughout the entire body. That's what the heart does, it pumps blood. Saying my research is incorrect and assuming I do not understand what I am talking about takes away from the heart of the debate. At 3 weeks the brain divides into 3 sections (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain). I can go into more details if you like. Do you want me to go into more details? Funny, you talk about detracting from a discussion about abortion and you've been doing this the entire time by attacking every little word I write I have been pro-life since long before the websites existed. You sound like you are getting angry. I am not using emotional histrionics. And what does pro-life websites and imagery have to do with our current debate? Am I pusing images on you? Dane, this is getting rediculous. You keep attacking my words and my research and my education but you are having difficulties with simple words. You get angry when I call a fetus an unborn child! Look in the dictionary! Go to Merriam Websters online dictionary and look at the 1st definition of child. The unborn have always been properly referred to as children. Oh, wait... my wife had a scheduled cesarean where there was no labor! My children were never born. They're nothing more than a couple of fetuses running around! If you call me an anti-choicer then using the same logic, YOU would be an anti-lifer. When the sperm fertilizes the egg and the blastocyst is formed all the cells are present to form a fully functional adult human. So in my opinion, the blastocyst is a developing human life, just like a born child is still developing. Are mole cells not different than human cells? So you have just explained yourself. You feel that regardless of how advanced the fetus is, you feel the choice of the woman outweighs the childs right to life. That is where we will forever differ. To say one person has the right to choose over another persons life is sickening. So that brings me back to my original question for you Dane. Why is it not right to destroy a 2 month old childs life? It feeds off of mother and it feeds off of the money that dad and mom labor for. I understand your logic if you believe the part about being sentient is relevant. But you stated that it is not, so you feel the mother deserves more freedom than the unborn child. You believe it is ok to end ones life for the sake of convenience? So it's ok for an unborn child to be a second-class citizen? Taking away the womans right to destroy her child is not about taking away her choice. It is about giving the child the freedom and the right to life that it so deserves. I will no longer use the word baby to refer to an unborn child. But your definition of child is wrong as stated before. Look in the dictionary. I don't like dishonesty either. But I've not been dishonest. I stand behind everything I've said. I don't debate often, I try to stick to facts. You are trying your best, or at least it would appear, to stray from the heart of the debate and pick at little things. I'm fine with woman or men or anyone have freedom to control their own bodies and anything they do so as long as it does not hurt another person. Unfortunately, abortion is a choice that harms another life. That life being an unborn child.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","03:06 PM","abortion-debates","313"

A WHOLE lot more? Before you compare the rights of one thing compared to another (which I was not doing, actually), let's just start comparing the thing in other concrete and amazingly obvious terms. If they are a completely different entity (blob of cells vis a vis person who plays baseball), maybe there are other things to consider before we talk about an abstraction such as that. Partial removal from the uterus cannot accurately be called ""born"". To do so is, well, precious.","Steeeeve","303724","Well what are we comparing? Size, brain, etc? There are considerable differences between as stages of development. I'm not sure either one of us are qualified to say which is more and what ""more"" is. I'm not sure what you mean? You can call it partially born just like you can call a half built building partially built.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","03:24 PM","abortion-debates","314"

Look at the two things you are comparing for goodness sake! Get real. I think the difference is obvious. That is all I am trying to say. You can compare anything you want. That doesn't make them similar. Well you could. But it would be stupid because partially born has no meaning.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","03:36 PM","abortion-debates","315"
