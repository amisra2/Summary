As a woman, I don't want any MAN to be deciding for me what I can and can't do with my own body. HOWEVER, that doesn't mean that I think abortion is right, but I want to make that decision on my own. My belief is that abortion shouldn't be a right, but it shouldn't be something that's criminal if the reasons are justifiable. I think it should be treated akin to homicide, you don't get punished if your actions were truly justified.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","01:19 PM","abortion-debates","16"

Not pretty is it? Imagine being one of those guys in the Alien movies and you've got a chestburster in you that's gonna kill you once its fully gestated, but you're not allowed to have an operation to have it removed from your body because of an intergalatic treaty declaring that all life is precious and must be observed. Men shouldn't be deciding because they can't get pregnant after being raped. When was the last time a man's life was ever at risk because his wife was pregnant? An independant perspective doesn't make it a good thing. Politicians that propose anti-gun legislation don't have to live in the real world with those of us that the bill will affect, they shouldn't be allowed to propose it.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","03:18 PM","abortion-debates","20"

Aside from the obvious logical fallacy, if alien life were precious (which it isn't) and assuming we ignore the chestburster since that doesn't happen in a pregnancy then I'd say you can't remove it. Since when does the fate get decided by the victim? A woman could be said to have a biased opinion on it because she is an involved party. Even so, I take the stand that no one has any authority over the other to make that decision. Ha, that is just an idiotic perspective. We'd have no laws (and many important ones) if you can't make a bill that doesn't affect you. Sorry Civil Rights legislation!","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","04:38 PM","abortion-debates","21"

"02-02-2008","10837",2,"jitobear","299873","Actually they can't ever get pregnant. Steve - its not about qualifications - its about impact. Women are the ones who get pregnant, we should have more authority in the matter.","Ghost Rider","299876","No kidding. F--k'in A! right! I don't want some damn MAN deciding what's going to be legal for my body. They have NO experience with the female anatomy except what they manage to bag, they shouldn't be allowed to decide for us. They have no idea what pregnancy is like, the damage it does to our bodies and our minds, and they don't have to pay to support a child that we were forced to accept at knifepoint. Where is the logic is violating women a second time? Where's the justification for it? Doesn't the life of the unintended mother account for anything at all? Do you men have any idea of the dangerous precdent you'd be setting up with a total ban on abortion? Women who have been raped and essentially told ""You WILL have this child, you WILL carry it to term, or you WILL go to prison!"" would likely commit suicide as a result, meaning that TWO lives are gonna be lost.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","07:41 PM","abortion-debates","28"

You just said it is another life just like the mother yet when people want to protect that life you say you are more important. So wouldn't this make you a biased party? Seems you wouldn't be capable of making a moral decision when you have some personal benefit at stake. Should a victim in a case be able to decide the fate of the defendant? Should oil companies get to talk about global warming? The answer to those are NO because the two parties are biased and have a stake in the decision that limits their ability to make a good decision. Does this mean we shouldn't listen to women regarding abortion? No. It means women have no more standing to speak on the issue than men. So now you admit its two lives. Interesting. You realize that rape accounts for about or less than 1% of abortions. Perhaps you should give a reason for the 99% of abortions that happen instead of opting for fallacy talk.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","10:36 PM","abortion-debates","30"
