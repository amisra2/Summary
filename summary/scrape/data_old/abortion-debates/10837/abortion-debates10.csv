I could be wrong because I don't know much about them but the mole is just the growth around the embryo as part of the placenta so it wouldn't match the definition I gave.","Dane","301103","You understand it wrongly. The hydatidiform mole develops INSTEAD of the embryo and fetus. It is formed from conception. So what standard do you use to distinguish them? Certainly nothing you have said so far is distinguishing between them. So better come up with a new definition that does indeed make a distinction.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","11:59 AM","abortion-debates","136"

Humanity is something you grow into, or become, not a category that is created at the moment of conception. If a zygote is a human being, then so is an egg or a sperm, or a liver cell. They all fit your definition.","Steeeeve","301108","Ok, well you are the definer of words. I go by biology definitions and/or the dictionary.

"02-10-2008","10837",10,"Steeeeve","300766","Don't you already have to have good and evil to decide this? If you comparing them and good and evil doesn't exist then how could you say one is good and one is evil? You can have a morality based on yourself but it leads to evil things (at least in my perspective) The problem with this is not that you can't do it but it doesn't hold up as a morality that can work. Many people do it though and I call it a selfish mindset. If you base your morality on your feelings then you can't say what Cho did at Virginia Tech was wrong...at least not wrong in the general. He went by his feelings and that led to evil....granted this is an extreme example. I don't understand. Do you mean like a ""built in"" morality the evolved? It would happen by random chance. Like a dice has no reason to land on 6 but it can. I don't know if it is hypocritical so long as you don't hold the position that you can't force morality on others. I think you can but not to an unlimited extent... So with an imperfect way to impose morality the best way to operate (according to our founders at least) would be to vote on things to some extent. Even this gets it wrong though. (1) I'd argue that morality is not at the whim of the people but rather is an outside standard by which we should try to achieve. The problem is morality in the law is at the whim of the people which is really how a lot of it is enforced. (2) I'd argue people are flawed and are unreliable. Which begs the question about how you can trust what I'm saying now It's just 4forums haha...not like we are writing a book","electrolyte","301174","I don't think so, in the same way that you can say that one square is larger than another without knowing the actual area of either. Remember, the approach I'm exploring here is relative comparison, not comparison to an absolute. I think this assumes that people are overwhelmingly inherently evil. I don't think that most people would up and kill a stranger given the opportunity to do so without legal (or eternal) consequences. It seems to me that it can largely work when the vast majority of people share the same set of morals. So, hypothetically, if my morality system comes from me, then it is selfish even if my morality tells me not to be selfish? I don't see how your labeling is justifiable. After all, we're talking about morals which almost by definition limit overt selfishness. (On the other hand, do we need to explore the idea that we behave morally only because it makes us feel good/prevents us from feeling guilty? I hate to admit that this may be a necessary consideration.) He also had mental problems, which calls into question how appropriately this example can be applied. I mean that morality might be a ""trait"" (if I may use that term a bit more loosely than a biologist would) that was selected for because it increases fitness within groups. This would explain seemingly inherent moral values, morality in different species (especially those lacking higher brain function). If this is the analogy, then why does the die get thrown in the first place? If you mean that you might be able to convince others of a better morality system, I hope that you're right. I'm not sure whether this is really possible or not. Some stories suggest it is, but so is brainwashing, which shouldn't count... Imperfect, lousy, unreliable... but any worse than any known alternative? I agree completely. This is why we've worked out reliable ways to analyze and/or test claims. And so far, this discussion is really making me think, which is good, and doubly so because it's a nice change from trying to refute repeated nonsense laced with ridiculous fallacies. Yeah, but I'd like to continue a discussion that has real potential for intrigue and civility, even though my half-devil's advocation approach may be aggravating for you.

If you are comparing for which one is ""more good"" then you already have an understanding of what good is. I'd say we are inherently evil and often times it is the legal consequences or lack of opportunity that holds us back. A good example of this is internet downloading. Without a question this is stealing yet people find it to be ok because lack of enforcement (easy to get away with) so it is justified to being ok. Of course if you would have asked someone prior to the internet if stealing music was ok (said just like that) then almost everyone would have said yes. In fact, today you don't see people walk into Best Buy, take the CDs, and walk out as if it were a-ok. So I think people will do the evil thing if given the opportunity. The evil thing always is the selfish thing. Yet someone would already have to have morals for this to work. Otherwise you would everyone saying ""i'll get more morals from society"" and because everyone is saying that society doesn't have a set of morals..just confusion. so you get back to the idea that morality has to be based on yourself. I morality based on yourself would be made to benefit yourself. This system won't always lead to a selfish result or always be immoral but it does lead to a moral system that can't justify itself. Well at this point you say there is an outside standard for judging the abnormality of a person. This would have to mean that morals can't be made in ones own mind because you say Cho can't do so. So now we get into a situation of what this outside standard of morality is (ie. it isn't based upon yourself). Yet many moral values are disputed...this forum is proof of that. If it is a trait then you also get into the argument used on the gay rights forums which is if it is an inherent trait then you can't say its wrong (which I actually disagree with). That goes back to my Cho example. If that is inherent then how does one say Cho was wrong and not just dancing to his DNA? For curious sake, has there been any research to suggest this is the case? I was just providing an example of something that happens at random. Everything is brainwashing to some extent. I say the difference is that a brainwashed brain would have reasoning and logic twisted as opposed to being consistent with what one says. Welcome to my world. It isn't one side of the fence that comes up with boneheaded ways of thinking. I generally don't read peoples posts who agree with me because it is a waste but sometimes I do and I am embarrassed that they believe what I do. I thought about actually finding a way to address to terrible posters on these forums because they actually end up bringing the good posters down sometimes. I have some ideas if you ever are interested (PM only). And yes this discussion has made me think as well...which is a bad thing sometimes ha. Oh trust me, this discussion is about 1000 times better than the previous one I had on this thread. Better to talk to one that disagrees with you and doesn't have their head in the sand then someone who disagrees with you and refuses to listen. I go out of my way to hear other opinions which I think is the right way to do it. For example, I attended a Hillary Clinton rally where Bill Clinton spoke the other day. I don't even support Hillary ha. meh, who cares","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","08:26 AM","abortion-debates","140"

"02-11-2008","10837",10,"Another opinion","301240","This thread is following the trend of so many previous threads in getting tangled up in applying definitions from one context into another context. Yes, one of the definitions of human being is member of the species homo sapien. Another definition of human being is ""person"", where the definition of ""person"" then also has a number of official definitions. Since many of these words (human being, person, etc.) have multiple definitions, one can pick and chose from among those definitions however one likes to support one's arguement. The important thing, in my view, is not the general definitions themselves but in what is generally meant in a particular context. Where human rights are concerned (which is why I would think the definition of human being becomes relevant), then the United Nations charter is a good place to look to see what is meant by human rights. The UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights was set up because of all the cruelty and suffering brought about by human conflicts and oppresive regimes. This is what drove its creation and what largely defined its scope. From Article 1 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (from http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html ): From the very outset, the issue of human rights is applied to born humans - where no issue of rights of the pre-born is even addressed. So, any appeal to human rights of a zygote or fetus is most definitely an extention of the usual and accepted meaning of ""human rights"". That does not mean that human rights need to be limited to born people but, if you want to extend the application of human rights before birth, you need to present a good case. I personally think that a good case can be made to extend human rights to a late term fetus - mainly because it can have a mental existence and can suffer. What compelling reasons would someone on the pro-life side have for extending the idea of human rights to a zygote or early fetus or embryo?","Steeeeve","301242","I disagree that the UN gets to define human rights. What authority do they have on the subject? Furthermore, the discussion was driven in terms of biology so the biological definition is what matters.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","03:29 PM","abortion-debates","144"

If I am wrong in that assumption, then please say so. In the context of human rights, it is not the biological definition that matters nearly as much as the definition as used in that context of human rights. If the UN is not a sufficient authority for you when it comes to human rights, then what organization is? If there is no accepted authority on human rights, then we are left back at square one - i.e. human rights only apply to those who people personally view them applying to. If that is the case, using it in an arguement is useless since we have no common basis of agreement about the concept of human rights on which to base a discussion.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","05:17 PM","abortion-debates","145"

I understand where you are coming from. Why does it have to be an organization? I think human rights are endowed by my Creator so the UN really has no say to me. In fact, I think they are wrong on human rights. The common set of human rights are going to be reflected in our laws but I don't think this means those what human rights mean. I think our laws should seek to reflect the outside standard of human rights.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","06:18 PM","abortion-debates","146"
