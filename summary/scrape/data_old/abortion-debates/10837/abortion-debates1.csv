The deliberate and systematic destruction of a national, racial, religious, political, cultural, ethnic, or other group defined by the exterminators as undesirable. ""Abortion is certainly deliberate and systematic. There is nearly one abortion for every two live births in America. Abortions are performed in a vast network of clinics around the country, almost 4,000 a day, 1.3 million a year, and more than 40 million since abortion was legalized in 1973. Furthermore, abortion targets a very specific group of human beings: unwanted, unborn children. While the appropriateness of calling abortion ""genocide"" depends on what definition of genocide you are using, it is a plain and simple fact that abortion is the systematic destruction of millions of human beings. This nation, and the world as a whole, has a sad legacy of dehumanizing people who have something we want or get in our way. Abortion supporters are infuriated at the notion that abortion is comparable to the Holocaust because they incessantly argue that the unborn aren't people. This is exactly the same argument that is always made to justify crimes against humanity. They're not really people. This is what Hitler said. This is what America said when it used to count blacks as 3/5 of a person. If we can't compare atrocities past to atrocities present, then the term ""never again"" loses all its meaning. At the end of the day, if the unborn are people (and they are), then abortion is not only comparable to past crimes against humanity, it is, in fact, the greatest holocaust of all."" from www.abort73.com","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","02:12 AM","abortion-debates","1"

That's a bit of a sidestep. Abortion is not genocide because abortion is not destruction of a certain group of people based on race, religion, ethnicity, etc. There is no way to make a case for abortion being genocide without making capitol punishment qualify as genocide. Frankly, I think it's easier to do the latter (yet most pro-lifers are also pro-death penalty). If you want to make an argument, then make an argument. But don't call abortion genocide; that's just dumb.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","02:39 AM","abortion-debates","2"

Unwanted, unborn children is not a specific group. Nor are members of any group specifically targeted for abortion. The practice in open to all in the US. Sorry. But all that shows is an abundant level of ignorance. Now, if you can show that abortion is only used to cull the Romany populations in East Europe...then you may have a point.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","06:36 AM","abortion-debates","4"

Would you, then, REALLY prefer that some nameless, faceless government bureaucrat control the future of a woman's pregnancy instead of the woman herself? If so, what penalty would you have the government impose on a woman and her physician if they committed what you must believe is the ""crime"" of terminating her pregnancy? BTW, hve you put your money where your mouth is by going to a pregnant woman and saying to her, ""I will adopt your child and provide it with the love, discipline, and money needed to have it become a productive member of our society."", or, like so many profetallifers, does your concern stop at birth?","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","08:30 AM","abortion-debates","5"
