"02-13-2008","10837",13,"Another opinion","301568","When you say that, you seem to imply that an embryo can be called a human being in all contexts. You seem to ignore the fact that words or phrases have different meanings in different contexts. So, where embryos are concerned, I could make a statement that **in the context of biology and archeology**, one could interpret embryos as falling under the definition of ""human being"". That conditional statement would be more accurate. My problem with your arguement is that it seems that you want to illegitimately drop the condition. Yes, but the great majority of the time that one hears the term ""human rights"" discussed IS in that international situations - i.e. what one group or country does to a certain group of people. The main use of words help determine their definitions. ""A reasoning for rights"" - that is the critical thing that I think needs to be addressed. I claim that a reasoning for rights that has been historically given is important in addressing a general reasoning for rights. Most of us have accepted the historical appeals for rights - those arguements appealed to our emotions of sympathy and our sense of fair play. What reason for rights would you give for rights of a zygote? Most of the times I hear of human rights is in the news. I'm not even sure if the Bible ever even mentions that term - I doubt it does. The UN is the closest thing we have to an international political union. Its power may depend on its member states, which certainly excercise a large degree of sovereignty, but there is no other global international organization that has similar power and authority (such as it is). What organization would you say has had a greater public say and influence on the international discussion about human rights? The thing is that your arguements about zygotes automatically deserving human rights sound just as arbitrary as if someone passionately claimed that unfertilized eggs automatically deserve human rights. The reasons for both are not sound. There are many good reasons why blacks deserved human rights. I just haven't heard any good arguements about why zygotes deserve human rights. Really, it would be far more productive if we discussed those reasons instead of discussing definitions. It could potentially be far more convincing.","Steeeeve","301625","You can use it in any context but that doesn't mean when used it means that. For example ""person"" in the constitution means something different than what person means in another context but if you use person when talking about the constitution you can use it in whatever context you want. I don't think it is the main area I hear it being discussed. I hear it more locally. We are looking at reasoning too different ways. You are looking at it as reasons for giving rights while I am looking at it as reasons for having rights in the first place. I understand how rights are argued for many times but this doesn't speak to why that right even exists. I think an appeal to sympathy is merely begging the question on the subject. One doesn't need to use the buzz word ""human rights"" to be talking about them. None. I say the UN has no authority on the matter. I don't believe human rights are developed by a group of people sitting in a big room. And are just as arbitrary as arguing for human rights for a child. This isn't a problem with the reasons but what you believe makes up a good reason for human rights. Naturally it is biased against the zygote because you think a certain mental state is a requirement for human rights. I disagree with this and thus the reasoning to me for a zygote having human rights is rather convincing. I think the mental state requirement is much more arbitrary than one that simply looks at a human being (for purposes we will assume my definition). Mental state varies from person to person and grows, normally, over time. As a human being you either are or are not one. There are no levels of being a human being. Talk to Dane and Lesz, I didn't bring up the definition question. I am merely defending my use of the word. In fact, it is a little odd that you come after me on this instead of the ones that make it an issue in the first place.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","10:18 PM","abortion-debates","183"

The state of being a human being with human rights is not definable by science -- unlike the state of possessing human DNA, which is a much simpler issue. It is not supportable by factual evidence, because it isn't a scientific question, period -- true, you do need human DNA to be classified as a human being, but that is generally regarded as insufficient in and of itself. Even a dogmatic believer like you wouldn't want to call eggs and sperm human beings. At least, I hope you wouldn't, though frankly at this point, I wouldn't be surprised if you did. You are the one who keeps inappropriately harping on science. Any position on this can only be supported or opposed by reason and logic.

""A human being"" is entirely a philosophical, theological or metaphysical issue. Science doesn't need the concept -- it deals with facts, such as the presence or absence of particular types of DNA. Any human cell will survive in isolation from other cells, if the conditions are right. So will any human being, in the absence of other human beings. If the conditions are right.

What does it take to penetrate? Look, Steve, i realise you aren't a biologist, so you get lost in scientific terminology and concepts. But yes, a cell is one of the fundamental units of biological organisation. It is an entity, and many human cells these days can be cultured in vitro, for longer or shorter times. A cell is a basic biological entity. And science is on the brink of being able to make almost any cell pluripotent, or capable of turning into other cells, perhaps even into growing into a new human being. That doesn't make them human beings. The very fact that I can say a cell might grow into a human being means that it isn't a human being to start with. So while you accuse me of lying, the fact is i know my biology, and you don't. Your accusations are worthless. Because science backs me up. Try a library -- you know... one of those big buildings with lots of books. Any definition of a human being with human rights I've come across that made sense included the notion of sentience. That is why Terri Schiavo's life-supported carcass was no longer a human being -- it didn't have a functioning brain to pilot it any more. But religious zealots weren't educated enough to figure this one out. A liver cell is a live human entity, but it isn't a human being. Not in any sense of human being that I've learned to understand. Try understanding what I wrote. So far, you absolutely refuse. Sweetie, you have resolutely refused to understand what I've been saying. No surprise there, you aren't a reasoning person. You are a religious believer instead. I've argued that human rights develop along with physiological development. An ovum or sperm has fewer rights than a zygote, which has fewer rights than an embryo, which has fewer rights than a foetus, which has fewer rights than a prenatal baby, which has fewer rights than a post-natal baby, which has fewer rights than a child... etc., etc. Rights accumulate with development and growing sentience. I realise you cannot accept this because of your religious dogma, but don't expect me to take your unthinking dismissal seriously. You are arguing from ignorance.
