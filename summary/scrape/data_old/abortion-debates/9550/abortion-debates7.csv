"05-02-2007","9550",7,"Another opinion","261417","Many answers can be retrieved from historical context. However, historical context often cannot give interpretations for a new situation that the founders never envisioned or made provisions for. Then, one has to try to interpret motivation behind the text. That is more difficult. If we are to have a rational and calm debate, I would appreciate it if you avoid the snide remarks such as justices using dictionaries. Nobody made any comments which justified that remark. Unfortunately, ""cruel and unusual"" is vaguely defined. The death penalty certainly existed during early America, but does that mean that all founders agreed that capital punishment was not cruel and unusual? I personally don't have the answer to that and don't have the time to research the history. Either way, they should have been more specific if they didn't want the interpretation to be more open. But what if all you had was the prohibition against drugs and no other historical input. One interpretation could be - they were against drugs but the only drug use at the time was recreational, so their criticism must have been only against recreational use. Another interpretation could be - they saw drug use as bad no matter how it is used. Since you have no way of figuring out their intent or what specifically they were against, you have to interpret their intent on insufficient information - which leads to a variety of interpretations. I remember reading that blacks got 3/5ths of a vote compared to whites. Otherwise, I don't remember reading any statement that blacks are not covered under the Bill of Rights, etc. Do you remember any such statement? Taking a quick look through the Constitution, perhaps I missed it but I did not see a specific statement outlining who HAS the right to vote. The Ammendments outline the criteria which one CANNOT use to exclude voting rights - by race, or by sex. I wonder, then, whether the Constitution would allow discriminating in voting rights based on, say, hair color ( a silly example but one that is relevant to legality). Anyway, it seems like the issue of rights for various races and for women would have to depend on whether there is a general statement about who gets certain rights. For example, I think it is assumed that women have all the rights covered by the Bill of Rights since it refers to people, not specifically to men. The Bill of Rights does not cover voting rights and I could find no statement outlining who specifically gets voting rights, so that would explain the need for a 19th Ammendment saying that women cannot be excluded from voting. Either way, this part of the discussion is getting off track.","Steeeeve","261423","Again, not the question we are addressing. huh? This is a fine example of you taking a meaning that I clearly didn't mean. My meaning to that statement was the correct one and you misinterpreted it. Just because you thought it meant something different doesn't mean it did. The constitution wasn't meant to be 600 pages long. It is similar to the idea that I don't have to define every word I write on these forums (although sometimes I feel like I have to). And this is not the case and I doubt ever could be. Seems hard to believe congress would pass a law in secret and never tell a soul anything about it. No, yet they were not considered citizens. This actually proves my point. They were was specific mention yet it was understood as the meaning and it took 3 amendments to change this. Yeah, doesn't say it does it. It does say the following: The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States At this time woman couldn't vote, blacks couldn't vote, and only men were considered to have the right to vote. This shows again that meanings were understood at the time and that it didn't change. We had to amend the constitution to get everyone the right to vote. It is very much on track. If you understand why there was a need for the 19th amendment or even 13,14, and 15th amendment then you could never conclude that the one original meaning is the only meaning that matters when interpreting the constitution. People was mentioned many times prior to those amendments. If we used Sigma's ideas then by saying blacks and woman are people for those previsions then those 4 amendments are rather useless.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","09:05 PM","abortion-debates","91"
"05-03-2007","9550",7,"Steeeeve","261418","I would say the only reasonable view of that law would be to say that unless congress changes the law (or amends the constitution) then marijuana will always been considered under that law. Otherwise you have changed what it meant. You assumed things that might misrepresent what the law meant just like I can assume things and misrepresent what you say. When this happens what you said or what the law says didn't change.","Sigma","261504","You're not talking about static meaning, you're talking about static application of the law. The most rational and logical view would be to look at the meaning of the prohibition (that recreational drugs are detrimental and have no legitimate benefit) and then say ""pot has been shown to have major benefits and few detriments. Therefore, by the meaning of the prohibition, pot is exempted from the ban"". The meaning was preserved and the application of the law is allowed to change to meet the changing society and situations. Imagine the Constitution had no specific prohibition against blacks. Regardless of the personal feelings of the authors, interpreting the meaning of the Constitution would allow them equal rights. Similarly, regardless of the personal feelings of the parents interpreting the meaning of the prohibition would allow pot to be exempted. That is the most rational conclusion.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","01:37 PM","abortion-debates","93"

Whatever meaning you wish to put, if the meaning no longer applies to pot then pot should not be covered by the ban regardless of how the authors felt about pot specifically. You seem to want a static application but you're inconsistent about it. Then by the meaning of the Constitution such an Amendment wouldn't be strictly required and laws prohibiting women from voting could be struck down as unequal application of law (after Incorporation, anyway). However, as with any law, saying something specifically eliminates wiggle room and prevents jokers, such as yourself, from saying ""original application didn't cover women omg omg!""","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","02:12 PM","abortion-debates","96"

Finally, your comment makes no sense.

The case even stated that equal application would indeed nullify the law and allow women to vote if voting were a Constitutionally protected right. They decided the ""right of suffrage"" was not Constitutionally protected. If the right of suffrage is one of the necessary privileges of a citizen of the United States, then the constitution and laws of Missouri confining it to men are in violation of the Constitution of the United States, as amended, and consequently void. The direct question is, therefore, presented whether all citizens are necessarily voters. Were it decided that voting was a right of a citizen then equal protection would do the job of the 19th. Whether women were originally intended to be included is irrelevent. My statement stands An unambiguous Amendment would be less subject to interpretation.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","12:47 PM","abortion-debates","101"

Did you just not read the case? I'm not exactly sure what you are thinking but the case ruled the 14th amendment (9-0 I might add) doesn't protect a womans right to vote.

My point is that the meaning behind the constitution does not change and the meaning certainly doesn't change to fit with ""current times"". This case uses originalism to make the decision and did so according to the law. The fact that voting was a privilege of some didn't mean it ever applied to voting.

Therefore, by the meaning of the prohibition, pot is exempted from the ban"". The meaning was preserved and the application of the law is allowed to change to meet the changing society and situations. In a few ways it is similar to the ""don't do drugs"" message, as well. One interpreter may look at the context it was said in and say ""It was meant to apply to drugs used for recreational purposes"" and another may look at the person who said it and say ""It was meant to apply to drugs that were used solely for recreational purposes at the time it was said"" (I believe you fall under that, Steve) and yet another could look at it and say ""The text says no drugs. There are no exceptions given in the text"" and interpret it as a prohibition on all drugs for any reason. All are valid interpretations. The most rational is the first, and the application would change based on the changing society. Exactly! Judges have to interpret the passages to apply their meaning to new situations :D Now you're getting it! Whatever the passage applied to 200 years ago is irrelevant! All that matters is the message and the meaning behind it, applied to today's society The entire ""Don't do drugs"" analogy was about changing what the law applied to, not changing the meaning. We apply the meaning in the context of today's society, not in the context of society when it was written. The interpretation of the meaning does indeed change with the times. It doesn't matter what the authors had in mind in regards to the application. All that matters is the message and the meaning behind it. It doesn't matter if the authors hated pot with all their being, or didn't believe women or blacks were equal citizens. The meaning of the Constitution, applied in the context of todays society, would treat them as such. Obviously it is not, since interpretations of the meaning do vary.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","04:46 PM","abortion-debates","105"
