SCOTUS does get to interpret the law but you are not saying this. You are saying SCOTUS gets to decide what the law should say....ie the meaning behind the words. SCOTUS may not be changing the ink on the paper but that ink is merely a way to communicate with the meaning being the important aspect. I do not understand how there is no right and wrong in your worldview yet you still continue to talk to me as if there is one.","Sigma","261150","... No, Steve, we haven't been talking about Federal power. The relevant portion re:abortion has much to do with individual rights and very little to do with Federal power. The extention of individual rights will undoubtedly come up with Phyllis, so it will be discussed then. That's blatantly false since what I said was: The message itself is important, and the meaning behind it. It is up to us to interpret that meaning and how it is relevant today SCOTUS does indeed interpret passages in applying them to situations today, using what they perceive the meaning to be in order to make rulings. Right and wrong are subjective in this instance.

If the message is not relevant today or the message is opposite of what is ""ok"" today then do we just disregard it? [snip] You try to assume that one can give more meaning to something than is possible. Thus you believe you can change the meaning without changing the words...all this does is just save paper. And yet this is still not what you are saying. You are saying the meaning changes. Subjective to what? can you explain how you can have a subjective statutory law and at the same time have people understand what it means? Not sure how this is possible as no other law seems to have this kind of power (for example a speed limit sign of 45mph is never meant anything other than the speed limit being 45mph no matter how long that sign has been there). [snip] The person that wrote something (or in our case the people that adopted it) get to decide what something means and without a doubt there was a meaning behind those words.","Sigma","261205","I'm clarifying your misconception. We have not been talking about the limits of Federal gov't. As to the limits of individual rights, that topic will be covered by Phyllis during the course of this thread and can be discussed then. We've hijacked enough Do you yet understand the analogy of the letter? What? You're speaking in Tongues, Steve! Is something that is unconstitutional ""ok""? I really don't know what you mean by this. ""[m]ore meaning to something than is possible""? That doesn't make sense either, Steve. How do you give something more meaning than is possible? How many meanings are possible for this ""something"" of which you speak to have in the first place for me to judge this? Actually, I said: SCOTUS does indeed interpret passages in applying them to situations today, using what they perceive the meaning to be in order to make rulings . It is more that the meaning of the passages are interpreted by SCOTUS to apply in new or changing situations. If SCOTUS decides that they judged the meaning to be before was incorrect the meaning may change, but what I meant is what I said above. ... My goodness. I'm certain the concept must be clear to everyone but your penetrating wit I'm saying that whether a particular interpretation or decisionis ""right"" or ""wrong"" is subjective to the criteria used, Steve. And if the speed limit sign said ""Don't drive at excessive speeds"" what would that mean, Steve? The most reasonable approach would be to examine why this prohibition was adopted and attempt to align the limit to that meaning. It would be stupid to limit the speed to what was ""excessive"" 200 years ago Without specifics, meaning can be interpreted.

My question exactly. How can something have more than one meaning. This is contradicting previous statements. Does the constitution have a single meaning or not (per section(s) that is)? You seem to think not. Insults aside, if this is what you are saying then you are simply avoiding the questions asked. You obviously believe the constitution should be interpreted in some certain way...commonly called a ""living constitution"" type theory. The question is, is this law subjective to judges. From the sound of your post it seems that you are just trying to fluff up the idea that no one can understand the law. You don't get to change the example. The sign doesn't say ""Don't drive at excessive speeds"" although that is clearly what the speed limit is used for. The sign says speed limit 45mph. Now, if that sign is 200yrs old can you say it should mean something different. Your avoidance of the example is not needed. Interpret does not mean develop meaning. Interpret means apply the meaning to the facts of a case just as you say it. The only difference is that you mean something different than you say. You don't agree that you apply the meaning to todays circumstances. What you really are saying is change the meaning to adhere to todays circumstances. The difference being that in one instance the standard stays the same while in your instance the standard changes to fit a desired need of today. In our letter example the letter had one meaning which is to not do drugs. What that letter meant at the time was not very difficult to figure out given the facts I gave (you seem to want to add facts where there are none in the example). However, since circumstances changed in society you seem to think the meaning on the letter could be changed which renders the letter useless. To apply a better example, look at the first amendment. Computers didn't exist when this was written. The first amendment still applies to stuff written on a computer though because the meaning of the amendment is still the same. Now say the first amendment said you have the freedom of speech but only for words spoken out of the mouth. When computers were invented does this amendment now change to go with what people feel is ok? I say no. In short, you wish to change meaning no matter how you look at it. When changing meaning you change the law. This is your view of constitutional interpretation is it not?","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","05:55 PM","abortion-debates","64"

I'm not entirely certain of what you are asking. Are you asking whether a section can mean different things to different people? I answer yes, then. Are you asking whether a section can mean many different things to a single person? I suppose, if looked at from many different points of view. But that would bring back my original point: It depends on the rubric. There are many possible meanings, whether one is correct or not depends on the criteria. lol, I'm expressing my amazment that you can misunderstand such a simple point. I've said the same thing throughout. I originally said: You must also establish why the ""language and history"" is the only correct rubric to use to determine whether Roe was decided correctly. Which, put another way, would say that whether a particular interpretation or decision is ""right"" (meaning: correct) or ""wrong"" depends on the criteria used, Steve. I'm just flabbergasted, really. My example is much more relevant to the discussion :P Such specifics are not part of this discussion, only examples that would be open to interpretation. lol, Steve! I mean exactly that. SCOTUS applies the meaning of the passage, that they perceive, to the facts of the case in today's circumstances. The application of such things as ""Don't do drugs"" would change since the circumstances in today's society change. Exactly! Judges have to interpret the passages to apply their meaning to new situations :D Now you're getting it! Whatever the passage applied to 200 years ago is irrelevant! All that matters is the message and the meaning behind it, applied to today's society lol, now you're changing what you're saying! So amusing. You said before: For example if the message in this letter from your parent was ""do not do drugs"" and your parent happened to be a strong believer than marijuana was no good then the message is obviously at that moment in time that she/he did not want you to do drugs including marijuana Let's take the First Amendment. Now obviously it did not apply to computers at that moment in time , therefore according to you it cannot apply to computers now until we change the passage through the Legislature! We're expanding it's coverage to respond to new situations, instead. Those darn activist Judges But now you're agreeing with me when I'm saying that the meaning of the letter was to prohibit recreational drugs, thus permitting pot for medical uses, whether the parent was against pot or not. Certainly the meaning can change if SCOTUS feels they've misinterpretted that meaning before.

You could take the phrase ""I like cookies"" to mean ""My name is Jack"" but that would not be very reasonable now would it. In this case it doesn't matter what it means to you personally. Who cares about that. What matters is what it meant to the people that adopted it. In this case, there is only one meaning. To do otherwise is making the law meaningless. I believe you said this to Phyllis, yes. The question before this is whether different ""rubrics"" can be used for different cases. Or is there only one understanding of the constitution much the same way their is one understanding of the 45mph speed limit sign. This assumes the criteria is the correct one to use. This is what is at dispute. No, it doesn't work that. Would you answer the question or not. 45mph speed limit sign...can this change over time without the legislatures doing so. No, not the meaning they perceive, the actual meaning. It has one true meaning. So you really don't mean ""exactly that"". You want the meaning to change. Yet you play with words. Interpret doesn't mean change and you want it to mean that. How is it irrelevant? They are the ones that passed the law in the first place. Seems that is the only thing relevant. Otherwise you might as well not even have the law! Again, this is misleading. The meaning behind it is irrelevant to you. The meaning behind something is not dependent on the person that reads it. If I tell you I am 6 feet tall then the meaning is what I meant not what you take it as. Again you misuse and twist words. You have text, meaning, and circumstance (for future application that is). I maintain text and meaning do not change. Thus a first amendment would have a meaning of protected speech. The circumstance that a new speech is developed is rather irrelevant. but look at abortion. Abortion is not a new circumstance. It certainly applied at the time of the constitution. Your argument is that the meaning changes. So for example the circumstance changes such as a new form of speech so the meaning must change for this. Of course it could change to not include it or do include it depending on what the judge feels that day. I disagree. The meaning of free speech is just that...to allow free speech. Perhaps you are confusing ""strict constructionist"" with orginalism. In any event, you seem to apply more of a meaning than what really exists and thus you feel like it could change. No, there was no mention of recreational drugs. In any event marijuana was known at the time. To say that ""well if parent would have known marijuana was ok then he/she woulda supported it"" is a wrong assumption on the meaning of the message. At that time drugs were considered bad to parent of which marijuana was one of those considered bad. The fact that it really isn't is rather irrelevant. You really confuse the word ""interpret"". Since when does interpret mean ""to make up a meaning"". Does an interpretor decide what words in one language should mean and translate them into the other language as he/she sees fit or does the interpretor take a definite meaning of the words in one language and explain it in the other language? Furthermore, if the interpretor said something in the second language that was incorrect (misheard the word for example) does this mean the interpretor is correct or was the meaning misunderstood?","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","07:39 PM","abortion-debates","67"

I dispute the idea that all of the ""rubrics"" are right. You would think after 200yrs (and the first 100 doing it one way) that you would get a general way to interpret the constitution. I guess you disagree. Interpret doesn't mean ""create meaning for"". application changing is another way of saying the circumstances changed. The meaning never changed. This is worthless for this debate though as abortion was around. Translate the meaning of who? The meaning of the person speaking. Which is exactly my point. They don't get to decide meaning they merely transfer it. Like I said above...not the judges meaning though but the meaning of the person that spoke (or in a judges case wrote). So in our fine example the meaning of the parent's ""don't do drugs"" does matter and this doesn't change even if time as elapsed. maybe but it isn't up to the interpreter to decide that. What if the parent did not mean that? This would be an example of a wrong interpretation would it not? Given the two facts I gave the interpreter can make no more meaning than ""don't do drugs"" with meaning of marijuana as being one of those drugs.

My argument is not that one way is perfect but that Sigma's method is irrational and goes against the original way constitutional interpretation was done. Assuming judges used a similar format in deciding then there would still be disagreements but all of it would be in the realm of reasonable. But how do you go from ""vague and unambiguously"" to ""has no one meaning"". For example the 8th amendment is vague but the death penalty was around when it was made so it would be rather unreasonable to claim this wasn't included as a reasonable form of punishment. In fact, some of the most controversial questions are not hard to figure out. You claim here is that they were incompetent and no one knew what was meant. Aside from the fact that the entire constitution and its meaning was literally spelled out in the federalist papers, what evidence do you have to support this idea? As for the ""vague"" terms. Those are only an issue when you have a new idea or thing come up and even then there were few vague terms (to them at least) at the time of adoption. So how would you decide these vague terms? Well, Sigma thinks they mean whatever we want them to mean. I maintain that you look back and try to figure out what the terms meant at the time of adoption. Afterall, they knew what they were doing. I don't subscribe to the idea that they just wrote down stuff and said ""well someone else will figure out what this means"". and most issues are clear cut an obvious. Justice Scalia answered this question very well actually and I'll try to get that exact quote as it pretty much ended that argument. There is room for disagreement but there is no room for more than one way method to figure out meaning. In my profession two accountants can come up with two different answers but we still use the same method.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","04:02 PM","abortion-debates","74"

Each Judge may have a differing opinion about what that meaning is, and whether it is correct or incorrect really depends on the criteria you are using All you have established is that you have one opinion about the meaning and SCOTUS has another.","Steeeeve","261362","Who's meaning?
