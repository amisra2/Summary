"05-04-2007","9550",8,"Sigma","261701","lol, what? My point has been that the application changes with the times. From earlier posts: The most rational and logical view would be to look at the meaning of the prohibition (that recreational drugs are detrimental and have no legitimate benefit) and then say ""pot has been shown to have major benefits and few detriments. Therefore, by the meaning of the prohibition, pot is exempted from the ban"". The meaning was preserved and the application of the law is allowed to change to meet the changing society and situations. Exactly! Judges have to interpret the passages to apply their meaning to new situations :D Now you're getting it! Whatever the passage applied to 200 years ago is irrelevant! All that matters is the message and the meaning behind it, applied to today's society The entire ""Don't do drugs"" analogy was about changing what the law applied to, not changing the meaning. We apply the meaning in the context of today's society, not in the context of society when it was written. The interpretation of the meaning does indeed change with the times. It doesn't matter what the authors had in mind in regards to the application. All that matters is the message and the meaning behind it. It doesn't matter if the authors hated pot with all their being, or didn't believe women or blacks were equal citizens. The meaning of the Constitution, applied in the context of todays society, would treat them as such. Obviously it is not, since interpretations of the meaning do vary.","Steeeeve","261707","Here you made up a meaning based on nothing. Given the facts I gave the prohibition could have been for moral reasons. And yet this is not what you argue. From this conversation and previous ones you adhere to a living constitution/substantive due process standard (if you can call it a standard). And in todays society the message still meant don't do drugs. The guessing of what reasons or goals were associated with it is inaccurate at best and probably illogical. Yet you just came up with reasons for why the author might feel that way! Then why do you state ""that recreational drugs are detrimental and have no legitimate benefit"" when this doesn't seem to matter to you? And this means they are correct? You seem to think so.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","05:16 PM","abortion-debates","106"

I did indeed assume there was reason, logic and rationality behind the prohibition. The ""guessing"", rightly or wrongly, is the prerogative of SCOTUS. You're babbling again. I think you're assuming my position based on what you assume my argument is. Based on the total mischaracterization and misunderstandings you exhibit this is not a winning strategy, Steve. I stated that drugs are detrimental and have no legitimate benefit is one valid interpretation of the meaning behind the ""Don't do drugs"" prohibition. Correct against what standard? What rubric do you use to determine this, Steve? Your opinion? We're going around in circles and I don't see either comprehension on your part of my argument, let alone any common ground to work toward. I move that we simply drop the argument and wait for Phyllis to respond.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","05:55 PM","abortion-debates","107"

You assumed pretty much that entire thing. Yet it isn't based on any fact...you just are guessing. Why can't it be that drugs are against the will of Buddha? Even so, you still assume that this even matters. All that matters was what was meant at the time...not always what it was trying to accomplish. You seem to think that anything goes. If this is true then why even have a constitution as you render it useless. Your argument is that no one could ever understand what the constitution says because it only has the meaning that 5 outta 9 people give it at any given moment in time. In other words, it has no meaning outside by itself.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","03:52 PM","abortion-debates","108"

I do not believe a prohibition don't do drugs is useless by any stretch in the situation I propose. No words have meaning without someone to read and understand them. Unless you propose that each person decides for themselves what the Constitution means to them , you are making little sense.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","04:07 PM","abortion-debates","109"

Who said: This Court does not subscribe to the simplistic view that constitutional interpretation can possibly be limited to the plain meaning of the Constitutions text or to the subjective intention of the Framers. The Constitution is not a deed setting forth the precise metes and bounds of its subject matter; rather it is a document announcing fundamental principles in value-laden terms that leave ample scope for the exercise of normative judgment by those charged with interpreting it and applying it. In particular, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which forbids the deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, has been read by the majority of the Court to be broad enough to provide substantive protection against state infringement of a broad range of individual interests","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","04:23 PM","abortion-debates","111"
