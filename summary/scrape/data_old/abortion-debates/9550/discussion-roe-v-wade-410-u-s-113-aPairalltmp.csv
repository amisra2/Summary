I think finding that moral views are an unacceptable means of judging a judicial decision is an important first step. Do you agree with this or not...specifically using Phyllis's post.

"","04-30-2007","9550","Steeeeve","260989","Not in the sense you mean though. You may apply it to situations now but you certainly don't change the message. For example if the message in this letter from your parent was ""do not do drugs"" and your parent happened to be a strong believer than marijuana was no good then the message is obviously at that moment in time that she/he did not want you to do drugs including marijuana. I think we agree here. Now, say, in the future, marijuana becomes legal and socially acceptable. Does this change the meaning of what your parent said? Certainly not. If you were to start doing marijuana it would clearly be going against what your parent said. This doesn't answer the question. In your opinion can judicial decision be wrong. They either can or cannot be. If you say ""maybe"" or ""sometimes"" then that would obviously have to be a yes. If you disagree then please explain.","Sigma","260992","A more correct analogy would be having the letter contain the message ""Don't do drugs"" and then advancments find clear medical benefit to marijuana use. You would have to decide, based on your situation and knowledge today, whether the message you were given was a prohibition against recreational use of drugs or if the prohibition was literally ""Don't do any drugs even for medical reasons"". Both interpretations are valid even if the intended meaning was to prohibit marijuana. To view it literally would be extremely limited and narrow-minded imo. I could not say it was wrong , however, by anything except my own opinion. It depends on the rubric. A certain decision could be wrong by one measure and not be wrong by another. Is that clear enough?","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","abortion-debates","53","02:13 PM"

The reason I added in my example that the parent said ""Don't do drugs"" and at the same time was very much anti-marijuana was because this shows a text and a history (context) behind the meaning. At that very moment at the time being written it was very clear what was meant is it not? There was no exception and there was no other meaning behind the statement. All you can logically say from that statement at the time written was marijuana was a drug that should not be done as spoken by the parent. In the future things might change but those words don't take new meaning. You have no way of knowing what the parent would think today and to imply their message means something different now is just absurd and is untrue. The way to change the statement is not to try to think for the person that wrote it but to rewrite a statement. Likewise in the law you just have the legislatures change the laws to suit the times. Your method is nothing more then merging the duties of the legislature with the duties of the judges. Would you disagree? Finally you say the approach I approve of could really not be wrong. This confuses me because it leads me to believe that you could never say a decision is wrong which is what I discuss below. This would imply that you find that a decision can never really be wrong. In fact, if Roe v. Wade were overturned you would not call that a wrong decision if they were using a ""rubric"" that found abortion not to be in the constitution...such as orginalism wouldn't find this. From what I understand it seems that you find anyway of viewing the constitution is ok. Is this a fair statement? Furthermore, could it be said that no one really could ever know what the constitution means if it is the case that it means whatever 9 people want it to mean at that given point in time? Seems like an awful lot of power for a branch that was supposed to have the least amount of it.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","abortion-debates","56","04:19 PM"

Aside from the fact that we are indeed talking about federal power might I ask how you can tell me, as one who doesn't believe I can be wrong, that individual rights are not meant to be limited and narrow-minded. You implied that the words of the parent have no meaning to today. You go on to say that we should still honor those words but change the meaning behind them. This, to me, means that all you are doing is saving a piece of paper with those words on it but you certainly aren't honoring what the parent said. The parent had one meaning and one meaning only so who are you to say it means something different now? Even if this did apply to the law how could one ever understand the law? In theory, you believe that, say, the first amendment could mean that you could limit all speech, limit no speech, limit some speech, limit only words that end in ""y"", etc etc and none of these would be wrong toe them so long as that is what you believed. What a crazy notion where words have no meaning. I agree that looking at the meaning of a passage does not change the passage but you already stated that the meaning of a passage is of no significance. SCOTUS does get to interpret the law but you are not saying this. You are saying SCOTUS gets to decide what the law should say....ie the meaning behind the words. SCOTUS may not be changing the ink on the paper but that ink is merely a way to communicate with the meaning being the important aspect. Simply put, you have words and meaning behind those words which allow us to understand things. Changing the meaning behind those words is just as much changing the law as is changing the actual words. I do not understand how there is no right and wrong in your worldview yet you still continue to talk to me as if there is one.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","abortion-debates","60","10:57 PM"

No, Steve, we haven't been talking about Federal power. The relevant portion re:abortion has much to do with individual rights and very little to do with Federal power.

That's blatantly false since what I said was: The message itself is important, and the meaning behind it. It is up to us to interpret that meaning and how it is relevant today SCOTUS does indeed interpret passages in applying them to situations today, using what they perceive the meaning to be in order to make rulings.

If the message is not relevant today or the message is opposite of what is ""ok"" today then do we just disregard it? [snip] You try to assume that one can give more meaning to something than is possible. Thus you believe you can change the meaning without changing the words...all this does is just save paper. And yet this is still not what you are saying. You are saying the meaning changes. Subjective to what? can you explain how you can have a subjective statutory law and at the same time have people understand what it means? Not sure how this is possible as no other law seems to have this kind of power (for example a speed limit sign of 45mph is never meant anything other than the speed limit being 45mph no matter how long that sign has been there).

My question exactly. How can something have more than one meaning. This is contradicting previous statements. Does the constitution have a single meaning or not (per section(s) that is)? You seem to think not. Insults aside, if this is what you are saying then you are simply avoiding the questions asked. You obviously believe the constitution should be interpreted in some certain way...commonly called a ""living constitution"" type theory. The question is, is this law subjective to judges. From the sound of your post it seems that you are just trying to fluff up the idea that no one can understand the law. You don't get to change the example. The sign doesn't say ""Don't drive at excessive speeds"" although that is clearly what the speed limit is used for. The sign says speed limit 45mph. Now, if that sign is 200yrs old can you say it should mean something different. Your avoidance of the example is not needed. Interpret does not mean develop meaning. Interpret means apply the meaning to the facts of a case just as you say it. The only difference is that you mean something different than you say. You don't agree that you apply the meaning to todays circumstances. What you really are saying is change the meaning to adhere to todays circumstances. The difference being that in one instance the standard stays the same while in your instance the standard changes to fit a desired need of today. In our letter example the letter had one meaning which is to not do drugs. What that letter meant at the time was not very difficult to figure out given the facts I gave (you seem to want to add facts where there are none in the example). However, since circumstances changed in society you seem to think the meaning on the letter could be changed which renders the letter useless. To apply a better example, look at the first amendment. Computers didn't exist when this was written. The first amendment still applies to stuff written on a computer though because the meaning of the amendment is still the same. Now say the first amendment said you have the freedom of speech but only for words spoken out of the mouth. When computers were invented does this amendment now change to go with what people feel is ok? I say no. In short, you wish to change meaning no matter how you look at it.

You could take the phrase ""I like cookies"" to mean ""My name is Jack"" but that would not be very reasonable now would it. In this case it doesn't matter what it means to you personally. Who cares about that. What matters is what it meant to the people that adopted it. In this case, there is only one meaning. To do otherwise is making the law meaningless. I believe you said this to Phyllis, yes. The question before this is whether different ""rubrics"" can be used for different cases. Or is there only one understanding of the constitution much the same way their is one understanding of the 45mph speed limit sign. This assumes the criteria is the correct one to use. This is what is at dispute. No, it doesn't work that. Would you answer the question or not. 45mph speed limit sign...can this change over time without the legislatures doing so. No, not the meaning they perceive, the actual meaning. It has one true meaning. So you really don't mean ""exactly that"". You want the meaning to change. Yet you play with words. Interpret doesn't mean change and you want it to mean that. How is it irrelevant? They are the ones that passed the law in the first place. Seems that is the only thing relevant. Otherwise you might as well not even have the law! Again, this is misleading. The meaning behind it is irrelevant to you. The meaning behind something is not dependent on the person that reads it. If I tell you I am 6 feet tall then the meaning is what I meant not what you take it as. Again you misuse and twist words. You have text, meaning, and circumstance (for future application that is). I maintain text and meaning do not change. Thus a first amendment would have a meaning of protected speech. The circumstance that a new speech is developed is rather irrelevant. but look at abortion. Abortion is not a new circumstance. It certainly applied at the time of the constitution. Your argument is that the meaning changes. So for example the circumstance changes such as a new form of speech so the meaning must change for this. Of course it could change to not include it or do include it depending on what the judge feels that day. I disagree. The meaning of free speech is just that...to allow free speech. Perhaps you are confusing ""strict constructionist"" with orginalism. In any event, you seem to apply more of a meaning than what really exists and thus you feel like it could change. No, there was no mention of recreational drugs. In any event marijuana was known at the time. To say that ""well if parent would have known marijuana was ok then he/she woulda supported it"" is a wrong assumption on the meaning of the message. At that time drugs were considered bad to parent of which marijuana was one of those considered bad. The fact that it really isn't is rather irrelevant. You really confuse the word ""interpret"". Since when does interpret mean ""to make up a meaning"". Does an interpretor decide what words in one language should mean and translate them into the other language as he/she sees fit or does the interpretor take a definite meaning of the words in one language and explain it in the other language? Furthermore, if the interpretor said something in the second language that was incorrect (misheard the word for example) does this mean the interpretor is correct or was the meaning misunderstood?","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","abortion-debates","67","07:39 PM"

And in todays society the message still meant don't do drugs. The guessing of what reasons or goals were associated with it is inaccurate at best and probably illogical. Yet you just came up with reasons for why the author might feel that way! Then why do you state ""that recreational drugs are detrimental and have no legitimate benefit"" when this doesn't seem to matter to you? And this means they are correct? You seem to think so.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","abortion-debates","106","05:16 PM"

You assumed pretty much that entire thing. Yet it isn't based on any fact...you just are guessing. Why can't it be that drugs are against the will of Buddha? Even so, you still assume that this even matters. All that matters was what was meant at the time...not always what it was trying to accomplish. You seem to think that anything goes. If this is true then why even have a constitution as you render it useless. Your argument is that no one could ever understand what the constitution says because it only has the meaning that 5 outta 9 people give it at any given moment in time. In other words, it has no meaning outside by itself.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","abortion-debates","108","03:52 PM"

Who said: This Court does not subscribe to the simplistic view that constitutional interpretation can possibly be limited to the plain meaning of the Constitutions text or to the subjective intention of the Framers. The Constitution is not a deed setting forth the precise metes and bounds of its subject matter; rather it is a document announcing fundamental principles in value-laden terms that leave ample scope for the exercise of normative judgment by those charged with interpreting it and applying it. In particular, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which forbids the deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, has been read by the majority of the Court to be broad enough to provide substantive protection against state infringement of a broad range of individual interests","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","abortion-debates","111","04:23 PM"
