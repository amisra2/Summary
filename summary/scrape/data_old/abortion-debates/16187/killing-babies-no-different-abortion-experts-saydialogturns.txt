No they're not contradictory: Hitler was not a socialist. In his early years he convinced the public that that was the direction he was going because; as I said, it was popular to do so. In his early years he was a populist and said things that people wanted to hear. If you'd really like an education on his popularism, watch the movie Triumph of the Will (1935) - IMDb It was done in 1935 when Hiter's popularity had peaked, and by 1935 Auswitch had been opened for two years as prison for political prisoners. Also during 1935 he began his designs on the east. He hid from the public and most of his military contacts all of his designs: that's what it made it work so well; nobody knew what he was doing at any given time. It was all 'need to know'. The Wehrmach hated him and so did the government. He supplanted the government with his sympathizers and the SS took care of the pressure on the military brass. And the rest is history . . . "Most cruel joke of all, however, has been played by Hitler & Co. on those German capitalists and small businessmen who once backed National Socialism as a means of saving Germany's bourgeois economic structure from radicalism. The Nazi credo that the individual belongs to the state also applies to business. Some businesses have been confiscated outright, on other what amounts to a capital tax has been levied. Profits have been strictly controlled. Some idea of the increasing Governmental control and interference in business could be deduced from the fact that 80% of all building and 50% of all industrial orders in Germany originated last year with the Government. Hard-pressed for food- stuffs as well as funds, the Nazi regime has taken over large estates and in many instances collectivized agriculture, a procedure fundamentally similar to Russian Communism."

How can you tell the difference between rhetoric based in Hitler's true ideology, and rhetoric carefully measured to build up support for the Nazi party? I have seen Triumph of the Will, it is merely one of the Nazi's famed mass rallies with the admixture of some ridiculous hero worship, how does that relate to the issue at hand? Hitler was named "Man of the Year" in 1938 by Time Magazine. They noted Hitler's anti-capitalistic economic policies: (Source: Time Magazine; Jaunuary 2, 1939.) See: " On the Theory of the Centrally Administered Economy: An Analysis of the German Experiment ," by Walter Eucken..... You might also read the Ominous Parallels by leonard Peikoff as it does a good job of exposing the socialist views of Nazi's; even if it is a little hard on Kant.

jet57:
The very idea that Hitler was noted as man of the year only stands as a testament to what Ive said about him already. I dont know if youve read all my posts to Freedom on this subject, but Ive covered all of these socialist and anti-capitalist notions. Socialism was huge in Europe following WWI. The early nazi party espoused the socialist ideal, however when it came to Hitler as a leader in 1933, socialism was not a part of his agenda although the masses believed it was. I entered Triumph of the Will as an example of Hitlers abilities to win the people of Germany over and bring them under his umbrella. It is the speeches that he makes in Nuremberg at that and the fact that Auschwitz had been opened for two years while people who knew nothing about it (by design) were showering him with flowers. Its a macabre juxtaposition and worth a look. Hitler was indeed anti-capitalist in the sense that capitalism as a system implied free will and any such organized movement of money represented a culture that was outside of his direct control, this is why he adopted the fascist model. Hitler was many things, but he was not a socialist and he did not like Joseph Stalin.
Turn No:4
Atlas:
So he was anti capitalist, but not socialist? You have not answered my original question, if Hitler had anti capitalist policies, and said he was a socialist, how can you conclude he was decieving people?
Turn No:5
jet57:
Boy: Hitler never said he was a socialist . . . in his propoganda, he said "we are socialists". Waaaay different. The history on this man and his police forces prove conclusively that he was a fascist demagogue. Please stop trying to force the square peg into the round hole. It isn't objective or reasonable.
Turn No:6
Atlas:
Prehaps a different focus, was the Nazi party socialist? Its seems non-objective to assert that a party called national socialism did not have any socialist ideals. It is even more silly to admit anti-capitialist policies yet claim they do not relate to socialist policies. Stalin, Mao, and the Ils have all used their military not only as symbols of unity and communal strength, but also to keep people in virtual slavery. Nationalism hardly precludes Socialism, they are in fact linked to the same tree of ideas.
Turn No:7
jet57:
The nazi party, as it came to be known, was derived from two differnt sources: The German Worker's Party and the Free Corp, which was run by a man named Ernst Rohm. The Free Corp was made up of former military men; all of them angry of the outcome of WWI who were also rapid nationalists. Rohm wanted a a private army to be derived, and so he too took Hitler under his arm. Only later, after the merger and the driving out of the Red "soldiers and workers council" from Bavaria / Munich, did there arise The National Socilaist Workers Party that we know from history. It must be made very clear that Socialism; as justa word was extremely popular then; and like the Epicapalian church of days gone bauy in Britain, was seen as the compromise between the two extremes of empire and communism. With the influence of Ernst Rohm however came the first movment of an SS: the SA; the brown shirts. It must be very clearly understood that anything to left of what Hitler's design was for Germany was immediately imprisoned or outright executed. When Adolph Hitler took national power in 1934, socialism was just a by-word of propoganda. Germmany; in particualr the east, was secretly policed (pun intended) into submission. When Hitler's design began to invade the east for extermination purposes, the German army was diverted to the French border: it's true! Having said that, it is very important to understand that this business of trying to equate Adolph Hitler with socialism; because "socialism" and "liberalism" have replaced "communism" for the right-wing, is just anopther paranoid propoganda campaign by the said right-wing: [i]there's nothing to it, It's all BS.

Good riddance, liar (1 John 2:22). And that's too bad. I was going to ask you to tell me which C-Rat was the most universally-despised meal among G.I.'s during the war? And what one of the first things you might expect to hear from a bar girl when you walked in a bar in Saigon to get a beer? And who else would try to hustle you in the bar? Did you know you could usually see the bar girls picking out lice and bugs from each other's hair as they sat on the bar stools? And did you know they roasted dogs on spits in Saigon? That you could often see girls and women squatting in the gutters going to the bathroom right in front of everyone? That in the alleys they'd tie a clothesline up and place a cardboard box top over it and that was a shelter for a family of four so they could cook their pot of rice? I'd ask you what their favorite sauce was and describe it to me? What was the tallest building in Saigon in 1968 and what was on the top floor? Ever seen an Arc-Light raid? Do you know which Saigon landmark the VC took over and occupied for a week or more during the Tet Offensive, and why they decided to take it? What's a P38? What could you use for illumination when your illumination rounds were spent? Describe the traffic in Saigon the day the Tet Offensive hit? What's a goofy grape? Yeah, I've got hundreds of these but then you weren't there so I doubt very seriously you would know about any of this. Enjoy your sabbatical. p.s. The helicopter that crashed exploded and the ammo aboard cooked off and killed a number of civilians. Not only that but I could never find a report of it on the internet. The story was it stalled and went almost straight in, killing everyone aboard.

Uh, no; people are not under any delusions about the right-wing. People are wise to whats going on. The Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei: National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP). The party was formed in 1919 by nationalist ex military men, one of whom was Ernst Rhome who militarized the party and was one of two who recruited Hitler strictly because of his oratory skills. Socialism was extremely popular in Europe with the fall of empire. Adolf Hitler allowed the word socialist to stay in the workers party as a come on to get people to sign on. Heres more: Nazi Party (NSDAP) Adolf Hitler 1918 to 1924 Hitler targeted; socialists, communists, unionists, freemasons; anybody or any group that was outside his revised nazi party. The very reason for Auschwitz concentration camp in 1933 was for a place to put these political prisoners in the first place. Having said that, I dont claim that todays right-wing are Nazis; I claim that todays right-wing are using the very same techniques, both in actual practice and their media. One great example is this business by the right-of real Americans; Hitler and the SS espoused the true German. If you werent a true German, you were less than, you were a traitor; you couldnt marry . . . etc etc. Knomb Chomsky said it very clearly as well: todays right-wing media is very much the same as 1933 Germany: you just have to know what youre looking for.

The right-wing in this country has been shown to be dangerously nationalist, they exercise a belligerent and chauvinistic foreign policy based more on manifest destiny than anything else. Right-wing domestic polices and attitudes are confederate in nature, supporting a new Articles of Confederation. The right-wing is ethnocentric and uses propaganda, hyperbole and out right lies to support an agenda of the real American and something called the Free Market. Right-wingers support the notion that any other opinion is, socialist, communist, or traitorous in nature. The right-wing is possessed of a religious apoplexy that is exclusionary, punitive, politically and personally invasive and carries xenophobia that rivals anything Oliver Crowell did.

Well, we got some problems; the right in this country are not racist, xenophobic, nor do they value any form of dishonesty in theory. They are nationalistic. The nazi party was nationalistic (in the extreme), racist, liars (who openly praised propaganda to control the masses), they were not capitalist, they were not religious, they certainly didn't call people who disagreed with them socialist because they were socialist. The people they lied to, in order to gain support was the religious and nationalistic in their country, their actions proved them socialist racist with a distrust of all religion and a hatred of other genes far deeper than the bonds of nationality. They conflated nation and race. Crossing out those things which the two do not have in common as impossible qualities of the right we are left with: Nationalist So to you, right wing means nationalist. Since the USSR was certainly one of the most nationalistic nations of the 20th century, certainly rivaling if not surpassing Nazi Germany (not to mention north Korea) they must be extremely right wing, no?
