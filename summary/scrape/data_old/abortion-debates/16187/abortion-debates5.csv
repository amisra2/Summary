I however would qualify that nazi comparrison though.","gansao","455459","The thing is Jet,a hippie commune could be said to be full of left wingers and so it could be said of the members of the Shining path terrorist group. A guy who wants less government control can be said to be a right winger , so can a nazi who believes in a totalitarian government? Didnt Hitler have more in common with Stalin than a teabagger? If one believes that the German National socialist party was a truly right wing organisation doesnt that just mean that the term ' right winger' is a rather woolly term?","killing-babies-no-different-abortion-experts-say","04:31 PM","abortion-debates","62"

The models by which they both operated were polls apart: Stalin operated on the communist ideal, which is socialism to the third power: in theory . Hitler on the otherhand, began his campaign with totalitarianism in mind. He remodeled the word ""socialist"" in his own image of ""Germany"" rather than an egalitarian social construct. Socialism became very very popular following WWI and the end of empire. Communism was not popular, but its ""equality"" ideal was what people were looking for, and equality for all was well known as an American ideal. But America and England had beat Germany, so Hitler went with protectionsim to inth degree, using the concept of socialism as a come on for requitment and acceptance of his policies: it worked. Now, the reason I left my qualification statement open was for the purpose of inviting a comment to see where it went . . . One of things I try very hard not to do , is label right-wngers nazis, as such. The right-wing polices and propoganda however are a very different matter . . . Those techniques and policies almost mirror the build up of Hitler's totalitatian regime and exactly how that build up worked; through extreme nationalism, ""the real American"" and ""the real German"", vitimization of some unseen power, the aim of which was to destroy ""the father land"", ""the mother land, and now of course the very fabric of ""the Home land"" (more and more accepted euphemism, used almost exclusicvely by the right). To Hitler, it was the Jew "", to right-wing Americans it was the communists in the 50s and 60s and the beast (I use the word advisedly) has just been shifted over time into the liberal ; the ""socialist"". The parallels are remarkable. What's frightening about it, is that the right-wing has taken the notion of radio as a propoganda tool in the 60s to outright owning networks; like Bain and Fox, and intentionally misleading and using an incendiary diatribe has become an almost acceptable form of media under the consistent guise of ""free speech"" . When one crossreferenes the two campaigns, one sees it very plainly. The communists however, were successful because they had a demonstrable and empirical adversary that was backed by a thesis that was equally demonstrable. That is to say, the communist adversary was not a ghost . . . Throughout human history we see examples of this type of undermining and take over of various societies. The radical right in this country is very well funded and has been using corporate domestic and foreign policies to develope their cashe; which is the very definition of fascism.","killing-babies-no-different-abortion-experts-say","05:30 PM","abortion-debates","64"
