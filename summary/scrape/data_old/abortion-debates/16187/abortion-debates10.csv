No it isn't, history before birth control is the story of humanity learning to live with babies coming from sex. All of that inconvenient marriage before sex stuff wasn't fun, so when birth control came along nobody listened to tradition. For most of history, if a woman didn't want a baby; she kept her legs closed. In every culture on earth societies worked to make unwanted pregnancies stressful shameful ordeals so that women would keep their legs closed. It worked. Sure there were plenty of babies out of wedlock, but way way way less than there would be today if 50 million hadn't been killed before birth. Because they know they can get an abortion if push comes to shove they won't have to deal with their own offspring. Of course young people are going to have sex, but without abortion or birth control most are going to get married or engaged first like they used to. So you think it was always this way or we only know about it now? Was there also a mass conspiracy to hide the constant abortion rate throughout history (performed without the medical knowledge necessary).' You don't have to be Christian to recognize simple facts, you just have to be objective. Kids are having sex earlier and earlier because they are exposed to sex earlier and earlier in schools and through the media.

When they were told ""don't, but at least get married if you do"" and they saw the stigma of bastards, runaway fathers, and single mothers they got married; sometimes very young. However most of the time since marriage is a big decision and they waited. God, you people are reinventing the %@(%@ wheel. No society in history has advocated life time abstinence. They have required that people who have sex be capable of raising children. Which usually means marriage and a means to feed them. The resolve that needs to waiver is the desire to have sex all your life without having kids. You want that you need to cuts somethings off. Just women?

Maybe we should consider cultural shifts that produce more responsible people and not make the single motherhood such an enviable predictament. Simply telling someone you should have thought of that earlier just makes a bad problem worse and does nothing to discourage it happening again. I don't believe that has changed. The world population has grown every year even with birth control and abortion. Births happen at an increasing rate regardless. The demographic of households began changing in the 50's, well before abortion became legal. Its her fault? For most of history women were property whose only purpose was to spread her legs. No it was so men wouldn't be humiliated by a wife who slept with another man or had to raise another man's child. It also helped to keep ""blood"" pure. Virgin females were a valuable commodity. Their purpose was to make sons. It works in Iran and Saudi Arabia. Want to use them as a model? Bet you a dollar that is not not what goes through any kid or young adults mind. They are caught up in their emotions and forced to be adults without suffucient parental involvement teaching them how to be. Getting married early usually ends in divorce. You then have single parents raising dysfunctional families which are the primary place from which those young unwed mothers come from. Getting married early isn't a solution. No exposure is not the issue. Maybe it contributes some small amount. By 15 most kids know, but comprehension of what it really means is beyond many of them who don't know what having to work, be responsible and sacrifice are. The consequences that come with that desire are lost on them. Like every young person they are invincible and everything will turn out the way they think. Bastards yes, runaway fathers is only recently and that because the state was tired of having to pay for those kids. The trend to wait until later to get married is also new. The only reason kids waited was girls were treated like prisoners and/or property. Our society is no longer able to have a parent always present and often that parent probably shouldn't be a parent. There are far to many learning as they go. And you think the @(*$& wheel is a rocket ship. That somehow just saying no or taking away abortion will cause a wave of conservative values to take hold. Abortion is not some self sustaining idea, creating the need for itself. It domes as the result of much deeper social and cultural problems. Ones that are not solved by punishing mistakes like pregnancy. Good luck with that. Never in recorded history has sex been for no other reason than reproduction. I don't know that the Bobbit method is something most people would like to go through. When society does more than just talk about how it should be and actually pays attention to how it really is then there will be no need to outlaw abortion, almost no one will want one. Society isn't anywhere close to that point though, And you really think that telling people they should only have sex if they are prepared to have a child? I suppose we should take their word they really are. How do you overcome the biological desire to have sex? Maybe we should sterilize kids at birth and then have it reversed when they want to have kids. Perfect. Shame the use of birth control so that it is used even less.

Simply telling someone to think about it now because it will be a bad situation if it happens does discourage it to happen. The reason it is a bad situation is because it is murder to kill your children so you are stuck with 9 months of pregnancy and would be stuck with even more if there were no orphanages. It sure has for the people who are throwing out the bath water because there is a baby in it. The demographic, you mean people started to have more abortions before it became legal? So wouldn't legalizing it then by validating the trend towards irresponsible behavior? Except in the case of rape, yes. And since the procedure requires who consent as well, the abortion is in every case. Revisionist history, women's rights may not have been ideal; but rape has always been considered an abomination by every civilization. Those societies which placed strong pressures on women to make themselves available (like prearranged marriages) also gave them full social support in taking care of any children. Yea, humiliating in the frame work of marriages being the only proper place for sex and kids. It worked in 19th century America, and I'd gladly use that as a model for sexual behavior that could produce children. No, getting married later is the solution; the one requiring marriage leads to. Then what's changed or are you one of those nut cases who thinks nothing's changed we just know about it now? No, the stigma attached to runaway fathers is as old as that attached to bastards, adulterers, and women getting pregnant out of wedlock. In many places the girls family would hold you to responsibility through force. I know the trend to wait for marriage is new, because you don't need marriage to bang each other anymore; and that's the problem. Marriage is functionally the acceptance of a possible family, and sex is making a family possible. Sex before marriage is risking an event before accepting it as a possible consequence. That is why people are freaking out and getting abortions, they were just in it for a good time; they don't want a family, often the family cannot even be constructed. The point of marriage was so that children didn't come into the world with no hope of a healthy family support being insufficiently cared for by someone who thinks of them as the thing that ruined their life.... and pro-deathers have the audacity to claim that this tragedy is why abortion is necessary. I really believe that if you take murdering your neighbor off the table, peaceful neighborhoods would 'somehow' take hold. I personally don't care if a generation does have to reinvent the wheel and learn the hard way to not have sex until your ready to have kids. When they do learn they will teach it to their kids, and presto conservative values take hold. I think it is to a large degree. If you were taking a test, and the professor places a card with all the answers on your desk. They tell you, that you can look at it as a last resort. You get stuck on a problem and ask if there is any penalty for looking at the answers. They then assure you that it's not your fault. They say that since you are stuck and there is not enough time left for you to get the answer on your own, telling you to study is just making a bad problem worse; and it wouldn't do to get bad grades. So you look at the card and you might feel bad about cheating for a while, but you get over it because as everyone keeps telling you; you are the victim. If I made this policy at a school do you think studying would go up or down? Just because I know you have particular difficulty with any and all analogies I will break it down for you. Studying on your own is using contraceptives, a good chance of working but not perfect. The cheat sheet the professor gives you is abortion. Only having sex after marriage is like bringing the book to the test and having 24 hours to complete the test.... studying means you won't have to stay as long, but even if you do it's alright. Don't tell me people ignore it as an option, and don't tell me options don't affect people's decisions. Roe v Wade effectively made it so that if any mother does not want to take responsibility for their offspring they do not have to. No such guarantee for fathers though :o Such as promiscuous sex? Any theories besides the cons got smaller? Nor has it been divorced from the production of children until recently in the delusions of young people. Very few people are cannibals, you could say society is at a point where that's just not a danger; but it doesn't really follow that we only outlaw things that aren't happening does it? It is unacceptable to wait until no one wants to kill their children just as it would be unacceptable to wait until no one wants to eat other people. You outlaw it and if the temptation goes away all the better. ... will be telling the truth? Yes. I don't need to take their word, I just charge them if they are negligent with their children. What are you trying to say? That people can't control themselves? The desire is not going to go away, but if you really cannot find any other way to release other than acts which may produce children then you should be ready to take care of children. Thinking of yourself as the inevitable minion of ancient imperatives is a sure way to erode self-control about sex. I am not religious and this is not about limiting earthly pleasure, but it is an objective fact that condoms and pills do not work 100% of the time; just as it is an objective fact that you are killing your offspring if you have an abortion. Anyone who thinks regular homicide is the price of pleasure and intimacy has a serious miscalculation of values. If we want to have sex all the time without getting married that would actually be the best strategy. Not kids at birth of course, whenever they want to start having sex you collect and store enough gametes so that if and when they want kids they have the material then you sterilize them so they can go off and have as many consequence-less orgies as they want. Realizing the truth is perfect. Birth control is imperfect and so it should never be used where full term pregnancy is absolutely unacceptable. Outlawing abortion will fix the abortion problem.","killing-babies-no-different-abortion-experts-say","02:24 AM","abortion-debates","144"

So the question is do you have an intelligence test before you recognize human rights? If you are willing to simply assume animals are worthy of rights how much more so should you assume the same thing for different individuals of a species known to have rights? Why do people think that they can stick their hand in the proverbial hat and pull out some chemical (metacognition ) or structure (thalamo-cortical complex) and decide ""Yes this is what gives you rights""? The premise there is clear, that you judge another human individuals mental traits to decide whether you are going to treat them like a lower life form or not. It is not necessary to say every human is as worthy as every other, or claim that 20 seconds after conception a fetus is a little Mozart. A principle derivation of rights must extend to the species and be divorced from arbitrary exception or else you get eugenics, concentration camps, and abortion on a massive scale.","killing-babies-no-different-abortion-experts-say","02:59 AM","abortion-debates","146"

The ability of metacognition is the reason we are 'sapiens sapiens' rather than just 'sapiens'. - The average adult brain size is somewhere around 1400 cubic centimeters. - a baby's brain size is obviously considerably smaller, and eventually grows to the full size towards the end of puberty. (em.. we start seeing signs of metacognition around 18 months or so) -metacognition obviously involves the brain. Therefore we can deduce that we are not conscious of ourselves as babies. This is partially why we do not form any long term memories as baby's. Since, without metacognition, it is considerably harder for us to memorize and remember things. A few things we can derive from the facts. Or so to speak, connecting the dots. We are given unalienable rights as human beings. Since human beings are homo sapiens sapiens. We can think about thinking, or metacognition. (We don't just say we are happy, we know why and/or what caused it). So the implication here is, to receive your rights, you must be a self conscious individual that is a 'homo sapiens sapiens'. Since babies are unable to perform metacognition (as are fetus's), they technically do not have unalienable rights. Or at least, that is how I interpret the law. I am not defending killing babies, and perhaps I am being mildly eugenic, but I think it would be acceptable to euthanize babies in certain situations; unfortunately, this is outside the scope of my argument. So we should be able to deduce that these ""experts"" are correct; it is morally and ethically equivalent to abort a fetus as well as a baby -- however, I must stipulate that the baby must not be self conscious. (It is also noteworthy that being self conscious or performing metacognition is a grey area, 18 months is a rough average... some may be a few weeks before or after.) -- as always I have avoided any religious affiliation when making an argument, since in my country of residence (USA), freedom of religion is also freedom from it. Thus, making it an invalid argument source. If anyone would like to contend that we get our values and morals from religion, please make a thread about it and invite me to the debate. I would be more than happy to give you examples to the contrary.","gansao","464172","You are not defending killing babies just making the case for it.","killing-babies-no-different-abortion-experts-say","06:45 AM","abortion-debates","147"

So let me answer it the best I can. Psychiatry is medicine. Psychiatrists practice medicine (in the US, psychiatrists have an MD). They deal with the physiological factors pertaining to mental illnesses. For example, depression may be the result of a neurotransmitter imbalance and usually goes hand in hand with low energy, fatigue etc.. The medicine fixes the imbalance and attempts to make you feel physically better. But it does not treat the illness itself, which is usually the result of a thought process we do not consider normal. Now, metacognition is not an arbitrary criteria which makes us superior to other animals. It is the only reasonable thing that you can point out which makes us superior. Because it allows our innovation. And no, other primates are not innovative, they are only conditioned. If we were not able to innovate ways to survive, we obviously would not be at the top of the food chain. (A male deer, or a buck, could easily maul a human to death. Without our ancestors innovating spears and other projectiles... we would have had a tough time bringing them down with a sharp rock and fists) Since.. baby's and fetus's cannot perform metacognition, they are not aware of themselves; thus, they are in equal standing with each other. Although I do have to agree with you, since we KNOW for 100% fact that fetus's aren't self aware. Baby's begin coming close to that grey area (18months) where they do become conscious. This would make me uncomfortable with the idea of aborting them. But if there is no question, no doubt, that the baby is not self conscious... then it really isn't that which makes us humans, humans. True, it would eventually develop consciousness. But, until it is capable of that independent thought through its own consciousness, a baby is a mere vessel. And you are putting very close together, with what could have been with what actually is. Although, most baby's do develop consciousness. Only a few don't due to factors outside of anyone's control. And be a few... I mean very, very few. Ex: damage to the brain Non the less, it is important to separate that which could have been and what actually is. Your argument, that a baby is superior since it will most likely develop consciousness. Is the same logic that would say that a High School student can buy a Ferrari because he/she wants to go to college to be a Doctor. But in reality, one has to become a doctor first to afford the Ferrari -- humans tend to say one thing but do the contrary.","killing-babies-no-different-abortion-experts-say","11:36 PM","abortion-debates","150"
