Abortion is indeed killing, but not the killing of a human being; a.k.a. person.

Jyoshu is correct, this is the natural evolution because at no point did any pro-deathers ever stop and consider by what principle they were deciding who has a right to life and who does not except whether they wanted them alive or not. None of the superficial excuses were rational, and indeed without a comprehensive moral theory there was no hope of it. If there is anything the left fears it is the concept of a comprehensive moral theory. If sensation was sufficient then animals would have a right to life. If lack of conscious thought made it OK to kill then killing a sleeping person would be alright. If it is permissible to kill the child because it is dependent on you than you would be able to kill them up until they got a job.","killing-babies-no-different-abortion-experts-say","02:54 PM","abortion-debates","9"

Subjectivism infects so very many. Is that where you would draw the line? Brain dead? because as soon as there is a brain there is activity.

That was in response to your suggestion that we might kill sleeping people since they are unconscious.
