You're too stupid to know the truth. As for FOX it's # 1. And you won't find many stories about the 43 Catholic Archdioceses suing the Obama Administration on what you watch. In addition, a rejoinder in the Hollywood Reporter noted, ""The study, though, didnt actually identify people who got their news only from one source, so they used multinomial logistic regression to create representations of such people who were then compared to a hypothetical construct of someone who had no recent news exposure.

"05-25-2012","16187",8,"jet57","455734","No they're not contradictory: Hitler was not a socialist. In his early years he convinced the public that that was the direction he was going because; as I said, it was popular to do so. In his early years he was a populist and said things that people wanted to hear. If you'd really like an education on his popularism, watch the movie Triumph of the Will (1935) - IMDb It was done in 1935 when Hiter's popularity had peaked, and by 1935 Auswitch had been opened for two years as prison for political prisoners. Also during 1935 he began his designs on the east. He hid from the public and most of his military contacts all of his designs: that's what it made it work so well; nobody knew what he was doing at any given time. It was all 'need to know'. The Wehrmach hated him and so did the government. He supplanted the government with his sympathizers and the SS took care of the pressure on the military brass. And the rest is history . . . ""Most cruel joke of all, however, has been played by Hitler & Co. on those German capitalists and small businessmen who once backed National Socialism as a means of saving Germany's bourgeois economic structure from radicalism. The Nazi credo that the individual belongs to the state also applies to business. Some businesses have been confiscated outright, on other what amounts to a capital tax has been levied. Profits have been strictly controlled. Some idea of the increasing Governmental control and interference in business could be deduced from the fact that 80% of all building and 50% of all industrial orders in Germany originated last year with the Government. Hard-pressed for food- stuffs as well as funds, the Nazi regime has taken over large estates and in many instances collectivized agriculture, a procedure fundamentally similar to Russian Communism.""","Atlas","455859","How can you tell the difference between rhetoric based in Hitler's true ideology, and rhetoric carefully measured to build up support for the Nazi party? I have seen Triumph of the Will, it is merely one of the Nazi's famed mass rallies with the admixture of some ridiculous hero worship, how does that relate to the issue at hand? Hitler was named ""Man of the Year"" in 1938 by Time Magazine. They noted Hitler's anti-capitalistic economic policies: (Source: Time Magazine; Jaunuary 2, 1939.) See: "" On the Theory of the Centrally Administered Economy: An Analysis of the German Experiment ,"" by Walter Eucken.....

I dont know if youve read all my posts to Freedom on this subject, but Ive covered all of these socialist and anti-capitalist notions. Socialism was huge in Europe following WWI. The early nazi party espoused the socialist ideal, however when it came to Hitler as a leader in 1933, socialism was not a part of his agenda although the masses believed it was. I entered Triumph of the Will as an example of Hitlers abilities to win the people of Germany over and bring them under his umbrella. It is the speeches that he makes in Nuremberg at that and the fact that Auschwitz had been opened for two years while people who knew nothing about it (by design) were showering him with flowers. Its a macabre juxtaposition and worth a look. Hitler was indeed anti-capitalist in the sense that capitalism as a system implied free will and any such organized movement of money represented a culture that was outside of his direct control, this is why he adopted the fascist model.

Socialism is, like freedom and prosperity; just a word used to move the masses that's true. It also has a real meaning like freedom and prosperity, and the Nazi party was socialist in deed as well as word. You prove nothing by pointing out that those who were 'to the left' of the parties agenda were curtailed and suppressed, anyone off the party program was regardless of what right left leaning you happen to want to pin on them. The truth is that if 'the right' in the modern united states is considered the right, there were no rightest in Nazi Germany, it was a fight between particular forms of collectivism. Communists and Nazis both wanted government control, big military and expansionist policies. Truly the only difference is that the Nazis wanted to control private firms with regulation and command instead of simply nationalizing them, and they were racist as well as nationalist. Having said that it is important to realize that connecting Adolph Hitler with socialism is just a probable coincidence, and may or may not have happened because collectivist reinvent names for themselves every decade anyway as their old word becomes politically dirty. What really matters is that his, and his parties philosophy and thus the basic parameters of their beliefs and actions were deeply collectivist even more so than the soviet union. There is nothing liberal about liberalism, it is the front for collectivism in the modern world and that is no conspiracy theory because it is evident in every policy, every speech, every piece of legislation. The conspiracy theory is by the left, who want desperately to disassociate their beliefs with those of Hitler, and hope that somehow the right will confuse their belief in individual rights with a desire to take over the world and subject their populace to the control of a massive secret police state.","killing-babies-no-different-abortion-experts-say","08:30 AM","abortion-debates","118"
