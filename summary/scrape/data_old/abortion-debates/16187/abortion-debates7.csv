I was going to ask you to tell me which C-Rat was the most universally-despised meal among G.I.'s during the war? And what one of the first things you might expect to hear from a bar girl when you walked in a bar in Saigon to get a beer? And who else would try to hustle you in the bar? Did you know you could usually see the bar girls picking out lice and bugs from each other's hair as they sat on the bar stools? And did you know they roasted dogs on spits in Saigon? That you could often see girls and women squatting in the gutters going to the bathroom right in front of everyone? That in the alleys they'd tie a clothesline up and place a cardboard box top over it and that was a shelter for a family of four so they could cook their pot of rice? I'd ask you what their favorite sauce was and describe it to me? What was the tallest building in Saigon in 1968 and what was on the top floor? Ever seen an Arc-Light raid? Do you know which Saigon landmark the VC took over and occupied for a week or more during the Tet Offensive, and why they decided to take it? What's a P38? What could you use for illumination when your illumination rounds were spent? Describe the traffic in Saigon the day the Tet Offensive hit? What's a goofy grape? Yeah, I've got hundreds of these but then you weren't there so I doubt very seriously you would know about any of this. Enjoy your sabbatical. p.s. The helicopter that crashed exploded and the ammo aboard cooked off and killed a number of civilians. Not only that but I could never find a report of it on the internet.

"05-22-2012","16187",7,"Freedom","455652","They had philosophy in common. Yes and? All collectivism is based on military power as that is the only sure way to control others. The manifesto was never rejected nor denied. Ideologies (philosophy) drive politics. If you see communism and fascism ending up in bloody repression, war, and ruined economies... perhaps it's because their philosophy told them it was moral to use military force to extort and enslave others regardless of individual rights so long as they could claim it was for the greater good. I am not embarrassed, now; answer my question. I asked: ""How did you know? Don't push the benefit of doubt beyond it's breaking point by claiming you read mein kamph and remembered that section."" I succeeded, your definition of rightism is not consistent. Why don't you address how I refuted what you claimed? You claimed Hitler didn't lie about being a socialist, yet he said he was. Therefore he must have been. All collectivism is based on military power as that is the only sure way to control others. The manifesto was never rejected nor denied. There are very fundamental differences between philosophy and ideology. Ideology refers to a set of beliefs, doctrines that back a certain social institution or a particular organization. Philosophy refers to looking at life in a pragmatic manner and attempting to understand why life is as it is and the principles governing behind it.","jet57","455662","No, it isnt. The communes of the 60s were not based on any type of military power; and they were collectives. The US started out as a collective and, like others; France and England for instance: the Gaelic countries . . . were driven to militarism. The Nazi manifesto you posted has absolutely nothing to do with this issue and Ive produced an a factual argument that shows it. As for your Ideologies (philosophy) drive politics; youre wrong again: Difference Between Philosophy And Ideology | Difference Between | Philosophy And Ideology Your fatal error is that you dont know enough about either governments or the history of the period: beginning in both 1917 and 1918 to form a credible argument. You cant show that the two ideologies were anywhere near each other: because they werent. Both leaders had their murder histories; Stalin killed more people than Hitler, but both holocausts happened from entirely different perspectives. And moreover; Ive already said this, Stalins Russia; not only an ally during the war, became a world power that financially collapsed in 1989. So the bloody ruin argument only works for Germany and fascist Italy. How did I know about your quoting Mein Kampf? I looked it up! Youre not just going to try and paint one thing as another around me! And BTW, I did indeed prove that right-wingism and 1930s Germany are every bit of connected. You lost that one dude and this ones not going very well for you either. Your refutations of my facts are just made up out whole cloth and have nothing credible behind them. So, produce some credible refutation and we have something to go on. (You can Google any facts Ive given you with respect to this subject, and aside from some wording perhaps youll find that what Ive said is absolutely true. (Im an historian; these subjects are very near and dear to me so I read about them and know people who were there . . . Adolph Hitler told anybody anything they wanted to hear about socialism on his way up because socialism was the new wave following WWI. The entire country of Russia literally dropped out of WWI in 1917 to pursue communism! Adolph Hitler was a far right-wing radical demagogue who used whatever argument that was handy to propel him into taking over the free country of Germany: against the wishes of said countrys standing government. In 1927 Adolph Hitler made many speeches at Nuremberg and what's really scary about it, is that in public he never talked about his hiddend agenda and what was going on behind the closed doors at the time: he was a politician in those days . . . get it? Yaknow; look: I know you really want to engage me in rousing political argument, and thats great. But please research a subject before you engage it.","killing-babies-no-different-abortion-experts-say","07:23 PM","abortion-debates","97"
"05-22-2012","16187",7,"Freedom","455664","They were collectives, and they may have even believed in collectivism; but they were not collectivist if they did not force others to conform. It's the difference between a protestor that advocates anarchy and someone that shoots policemen. Because they did not have military force, their collectives dissolved quickly. If they had been much larger, and the dictates of the leaders were enforced with guns it would be a nation with taxes. This is incorrect, an ideology is not necessarily emotional or irrational, nor is philosophy necessarily rational and pragmatic and certainly it is not concerned only with the current state of affairs. See ethics. Why did Hitler think they were then? You have some nerve lecturing me on historical knowledge shortly after you confused WW1 with the Napoleonic wars, and couldn't tell the difference between russian and french armies. If you don't think the USSR was a bloody ruin, you need to read the writings of some middle-old age Russians. If you kill more people than the Nazi's and your economy collapses even though you can command people to work; you are a bloody ruin. I see so you completely ignored my request and thus nullified the point I was trying to make... or did you? The point I was trying to make is that it was an explicit philosophical statement about an ideal, and that from the statement alone it was impossible to tell whether a fascist or a communist said it. By looking it up you admit by implication that you could not tell. Oh no, you're much to clever, you saw the danger involved in guessing who said it so you didn't guess. You only missed that my point was that you would have to guess because you couldn't tell, no one could unless they were already familiar with the exact quote. No you didn't. I have only ceded one common property, nationalism. Oh, and right after we saw what happened to easyrider when he tried to use the fact that he was in Vietnam... not too bright. You are declaring victory in preparation for giving up, and I will declare victory once you give up..... will it never end? Was he lying when he said he was a socialist? That's the question I'm asking, it's a yes or no question... get it?","jet57","455675","Yes: Adolph Hitler was lying when he said ""we was a socialist"".","killing-babies-no-different-abortion-experts-say","11:44 PM","abortion-debates","99"

"05-23-2012","16187",7,"Freedom","455677","Are the above to quotes contradictory?","jet57","455734","No they're not contradictory: Hitler was not a socialist. In his early years he convinced the public that that was the direction he was going because; as I said, it was popular to do so. In his early years he was a populist and said things that people wanted to hear. If you'd really like an education on his popularism, watch the movie Triumph of the Will (1935) - IMDb It was done in 1935 when Hiter's popularity had peaked, and by 1935 Auswitch had been opened for two years as prison for political prisoners. Also during 1935 he began his designs on the east. He hid from the public and most of his military contacts all of his designs: that's what it made it work so well; nobody knew what he was doing at any given time. It was all 'need to know'. The Wehrmach hated him and so did the government. He supplanted the government with his sympathizers and the SS took care of the pressure on the military brass. And the rest is history . . .","killing-babies-no-different-abortion-experts-say","06:22 PM","abortion-debates","103"
