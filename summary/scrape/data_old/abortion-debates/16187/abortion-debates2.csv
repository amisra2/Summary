Fetuses that have not developed sufficiently are not unconscious in the same way as a sleeping person. They are ""pre-conscious"" and are more akin to the brain dead in that they have no higher brain function since they have no higher brain.","Freedom","453718","So 5-6 months? Brain dead is brain dead, you can't say that about fetuses with operational brains just because they are partially operational, although I will accept that there is no cognition before the cerebral cortex.","killing-babies-no-different-abortion-experts-say","03:56 PM","abortion-debates","16"

You think that a rape which results in a pregnancy that itself results in a potential child being destroyed does not indicate that somewhere along the line there was a failure? You think that aborting the fetus and throwing it away makes it ok?I doubt that the pregnant woman does and it certainly doesnt make it ok for the unborn child( with or without an ' operational brain').","killing-babies-no-different-abortion-experts-say","06:49 PM","abortion-debates","20"

""Its"" implies possession. There is no one to possess. No one to deny that to which ""they"" have a right. I don't pretend to understand each individual situation. I can think of scenarios where an abortion would not be a ""failure"". I'm not sure what you mean by ""ok""? Part of the problem is that men like you have no problem speaking for women.

A fetus it is always a victim when its aborted. People like you label the fetus as a nonentity and even a parasite to justify the act of destroying it You need to dehumanise the fetus and use emotional and extremely rare cases of pregnancy through rape to justify the act of abortion itself. The 'unborn' does have a standing and there are people that believe quite rightly that it should have a voice and do even though you'd like them not to. People like you think that destroying an early fetus..getting in quick before the fetus inevitably becomes sentient makes it 'ok'( oh I forgot you dont know what this means) Whereas I cant see the act of destroying an unborn child ever being ok and can only been seen as a failure even if it is deemed the best decision out of number of bad ones..

I cannot claim the fetus is something other than it is as a means to limit a woman's right to self-determination. Do not those sorts of cases need to be considered when making law? The point being that the individual circumstances that might lead to a woman's decision to abort are none of my, or your, business. What I like has nothing to do with it and ""quite rightly"" is merely your opinion. One not shared by a majority of women. Ok by whose standard and for whom was what I was getting at.

The fetus is the only one that is destroyed in an abortion. How the hell can that be an assumption ? There is more than just the woman involved. You claim the fetus has no rights or status until YOU feel it should. You contradict yourself in the same post. First you want the extremes to be the default way to consider policy then you insist its only the womans decision and no ones elses anyway. Make your mind up. What ' you like' has everything to do with your mere opinion too. The ' majority' of women can share their opinion..the destroyed fetus does not have that privilege. I dont agree that the majority of women would believe that a fetus has no standing and an abortion should be considered anything other than a failure...have you access to a poll that says otherwise? You want a standard to help you understand ' ok'? Jeez You dont see a bad decision as a failure? Jeez again So you dont think of it as a failure then say how you think of it is of no consequence? You are probably right then You think that saying ' I doubt that the pregnant woman does' means that I am ' speaking for women'?

The point pro-lifers (the rational ones) make is that pain and cognition are not the values which needs to be protected life is, human life; and the value of human life is inseparable from the potential of that life. If you kill a man when he's thirty all you have destroyed is his potential life after that point. All he did and was before then remains inviolate. If it's not a real value you destroyed then whats the problem? The point is that the principle we act on in general is that you do not harm human life regardless of what temporary and arbitrary values you place on it. As a homosexual advocate might say 'only difference is genitals' I say the only difference is age. You may content yourself with your arbitrary identification of the thalmo cortical complex as the signifier of rights, but it obviously does not produce a functioning adult human. There is vast development left, and you are ultimately still drawing a line in the sand. As the OP makes clear... unless you can tell me why they are wrong about babies and 1/50 (random guess) the brain power of adult is sufficient but 1/60 is not.","killing-babies-no-different-abortion-experts-say","04:47 PM","abortion-debates","25"
