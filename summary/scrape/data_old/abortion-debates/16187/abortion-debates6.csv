"05-21-2012","16187",6,"Freedom","455478","They had philosophies in common, the particular collectives they used to move their countries to ruin and death are what you think is the great divide between them much like a prize fighter might think that the biggest difference between two barbarians is that one likes to kick and the other punches while sane objective people notice that they are both vicious barbarians. You want us to believe that Hitler was lying about being a socialist or pursuing socialist agenda's but he wasn't. What he did was socialism, no less so because it wasn't racially egalitarian. Who owns everything is just practical implementation, what matters is who controls everything; and the Nazi party did not hesitate to dispose of every piece of personal property it could if it thought it might be useful. Do you want to guess how? They called it taxes, they called it the draft, and regulation. You do anything you want with your money... so long as it ends up producing tanks. Fascism is merely a more distilled, more pure; more honest form of the evil of communism, much like the modern socialist left is a more dilute form of communism. The word that ties it all together is collectivism. The opposite of collectivism is liberty not nationalism. Can you tell me who said the following without looking it up, just based on your perceptions (Hitler or Stalin)","jet57","455554","Those two had nothing in common: Hitler hated Stalin, communism and socialism. Stalins Russia also became world power; so your assertions are not credible. Hitler was not lying about being a socialist; he wasnt a socialist period: he locked up socialists, communists, unionists and religious leaders. He snuffed any ideology that was not immediately under his control and completely: there was nothing other than his flag. Socialism"" was an organized socio political movement and style of government that would have been outside of Hitlers immediate control, so you are 100% way off the mark with your assertions. Hitlers Germany was not in any way egalitarian, and the nazi party didnt dispose of anything; the SS and the SA made the sweeps; SA destroyed property, SS rounded up and destroyed people. (Youve a lot to learn about this subject, so I suggest you get to readin). Fascism and communism are miles apart dude: youre just making all this up as you go along. Fascism is derived from an Italian word for bundle, of sticks fasci ; I think, something like that; you can look it up. Yeah, your definitions of liberty etc respecting world history is just all made up and has absolutely no credibility, it's is silly really. And your quote is from Hitlers Mein Kamph . He was referring to a persons desire to sacrifice all for the community: something youre trying to link to communism, hence your second choice of Stalin as the author. Look youre grasping at straws trying to link Hitler to the left: it wont work. History and all reputable research and publications show you to be wrong. What youre trying to do is reshape history to fit your political bent; which is what Hitler did . Your abilities with the truth are discredited by your ignoring said truths completely. Read read read. And then make an argument. Read objective sources; not right-wing web sites .","killing-babies-no-different-abortion-experts-say","03:38 PM","abortion-debates","79"

"05-22-2012","16187",6,"Freedom","455566","They had philisophy in common. Hitler was a socialist. Stalin's Russia was on the right side of WW2 nothing more. Were these not a lies? Socialism is run by the state, he was the state. No state is truly egalitarian, they all have their victims just as the united states favorite victim is big earners. He did claim to have egalitarian values though: Of course they did, they set prices for everything (including wages), they prevented quitting itself. All through cartels which were proxy agents of the state. The German economy didn't build one of the best armies in history for profit motive jet, they were commanded and taxed in the extreme. Only from the perspective of a fascist or communist who are both collectivist. Yet a bundle of sticks, a collective of sticks meant to represent the ideal human society. All words are made up, and what you find credible or silly is not my concern; only what arguments you can produce or refute. How did you know? Don't push the benefit of doubt beyond it's breaking point by claiming you read mein kamph and remembered that section. Oh I know what he was referring to.... indeed what he was demanding. Self-sacrifice for community is something you will never be able to unlink with communism. I see straws of carbon steel bolted to the bed rock of truth laying in my clenched high-grip climbing gloves. Reputable as defined by claiming the opposite of what I say I do not care about any appeal to authority. Translation: If you have historical facts like statements and actions of prominent Nazi's or their government use them, I am not interested in biased interpretations You're losing another argument on history because you came unprepared to defend your revisionist claims. The facts are the facts, it's not my fault that the right-wing are the ones who are preserving the history of the third reich while the left-wing is willing to tell you all about them, but mention what they said or did. Of all the books, documentaries, and articles on Nazism do you know which one was most densely packed with quotes from Nazi's and specific actions taken by the Nazi party? Ominous parallels, I wonder why that is..... You can collapse on the floor and whine 'biased source' all you want. Unless you are willing to claim the quotes and events themselves are fallacious I am not interested.","jet57","455625","The two had noting in common. When Hitler was on the rise, his purpose was to raise the membership of the nazi party. He was recruited by militarists whose design was take over Germany. Hitlers first job was to watch the meetings of the German Workers Party. Now, the communist ideal is not based on militarism; youre trying to force the square peg into the round hole, Ill give you another example: The nazi manifesto, from which you draw your points 9-17 was published in 1920: the nazi party was founded in 1919; Hitler did not come to power until 1934. Hitlers propaganda prior to that time appealed especially to farmers and working people: he roused people to support him and then subverted the entire country by supplanting the government with Nazis and controlling the social structure with a Chinese box of secret police forces. Nazi collectivism and fascism again have nothing in common with communism other than a form of umbrella, the ideologies; that is to say what communism did, and what Hitler was really up to are miles apart. Yaknow, youre really embarrassing yourself with trying to hide your sources: your last quote was from Mein Kampf , and you know that. Your lines form the nazi manifesto are placed with no cited source, and what youre doing is trying to trap me (ooohhhh) . . . so you can jump and say AH HA!, and its just not going to happen because you dont know what youre talking about and keep making it up as you go along: Your mission is to prove me wrong , not have an informative discussion about Adolph Hitlers Germany. I cited credible sources that absolutely refute your nonsense. So, youre really not helping yourself here. So, go out and get reputable sources that refute what I've just posted on this subject.
