"03-31-2005","4699",1,"None","None","None","chloe","103180","My essay: They are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights... Edowed: inherited through existence Unalienable: incapable of being alienated, surrendered, or transferred We have heard these words many times and have undoubtedly passed over them a time or two. However, it is necessary and vital that we pause and consider these words which reflect much about the governmental paradigm our forefathers and the worldview which shaped this nation. We hold these truths to be self evident. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. Our forefathers viewed these (all assumptions underlying the previous statements) as truths which were observable (self-evident) and indisputable. They viewed that there are certain rights that transcend society and culture. This phrase, which comes straight from the declaration of independence and is revisited in the constitution, is the cornerstone of our constitution. Therefore, it can be said that this concept (that there are transcendent rights endowed by someone higher than government) is the foundation of our entire government. In the declaration we read the very purpose of the structure of government as viewed by our forefathers. The purpose of government is: That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, Because these rights (life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness) transcend all of humanity, we must recognize that it is any governments responsibility to secure those rights for all members of the human race. So where do these rights come from? Well, if you ask a theist they will say they were endowed by God (the creator). If you ask a naturalist they will say they were created in the mind of man (endowed by nature). If you ask a transcendentalist they will say they were endowed by the force, Luke. However, rarely will someone who is reasonable deny they exist. Wherever you might like to say these rights originate, you are foolish to deny the existence of these certain inalienable rights (if not for the sheer purpose and means of self preservation!). It is essential to recognize that these rights do not come from government but are merely recognized by government. Therefore, we conclude that since they do not come from government, they should not be taken away by government. Let us examine these rights. We should be careful to observe any place where the concept of rights is mentioned in the documents. In observing we must look and seek to understand each right in the light and context of this statement: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. First, let us examine the right to life. It is interesting to note that this right is mentioned first, and that it is mentioned first for a reason. The right to exist is a fundamental right. Once one obtains the genetic code that is specific to the human race, one exists. From this point on one has a right to continue to exist and this right no one can dispute. Now, lets examine the right to liberty. What is liberty? What is true freedom? Bottom line, this must be defined as free choice in every circumstance. However, does the possibility exist that there is a type of liberty which transcends all of the experiences of mankind? Is there an ultimate freedom which frees mankind from oppression? I leave this for the reader to examine. Finally, the right to the pursuit of happiness. This is the whatever floats your boat right. Happiness is different things to different people and has been viewed as a celebration of individuality. However, is it possible that a true and ultimate happiness exists which transcends all of mankind? A certain happiness that enthralls men and brings them unsurpassing joy? Again, I leave this for the reader to examine. An understood and observed logical hierarchy of rights. We can observe within the constitution and declaration a hierarchy of rights. This hierarchy is based upon one foundational right and that is the right to life. All rights derive themselves from this fundamental right. It is reasonable to say that without this right there would be no other rights. For example, let us consider one scenario within the constitution. We have the right to bare arms. This right would not exist were it not for (partly) a right to defend oneself. The right to defend ones self would not exist were it not for the right to liberty and property. The right to liberty and property would not exist were it not for the right to life (were it not for the right of a human to continue to exist). It is reasonable for one to acknowledge that in order to be happy one must be free to be happy(whatever ones definition of happiness), and in order for one to be free to be happy one must exist to be free. What happens when the rights of two persons appear be in conflict? Upon casual reading one may conclude that all rights are of equal quality. However, this cannot be the case. It must be noted that the right to life is of a different quality of all other rights. The right to life is a right of sanctity and dignity while the right to happiness is a right which determines the quality of that sanctity and dignity. Whenever we see a confliction of rights within our culture there is always a right which takes precedent. Your right to bare arms stops with my right to defend myself. A rapists right to happiness stops with the victims right to liberty. A murderers right to happiness stops with the victims right to life. In every conflict of rights, it is necessary that the more fundamental right take precedent. Let us a look at the mothers right to choose whether or not to donate her bodily resources vs. the baby in the wombs right to life (the right to continue to exist). The conflict of rights between the mothers right to happiness and freedom may sometimes be in conflict with the babys right to life. Comparing these to rights as equal is impossible and unreasonable. The right to life is of a different quality then all of the other rights. The right to life is the assumption of all other rights, and to assume it to be equal to any other right is to commit a fallacy. When it comes to a fundamental right to life(the sanctity and dignity of a human life) vs. a right to happiness (the quality and personal desires of a human life). Which one should win? Well which one is more fundamental? Upon the fundamental right to life hang all other rights bestowed upon humanity and all laws which government can ethically mandate. So, my question remains: Why is there even an option of abortion (other then when the babys right to continue to exist conflicts with the mothers right to continue to exist)? Here is what I think. Those whose transcendent fundamental right to life is being trampled upon are being denied their right to life because they have no voice. Neither do they have the power to stand up for themselves. They are the most innocent among us. They are the weakest of the weak. They are the smallest of the small. Therefore no one notices when fundamental incomparable right to life is denied to these voiceless human beings. While so many are choosing the road of selfishness in exchanging anothers right to continue to exist for their own posh lifestyle and convenience, let those who have a voice and a heart cry out for equal justice under law for all. There may come a day when out of duty Americas citizens must make application of this statement found in the declaration. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. In our dynamic culture, let us embrace a culture that values a right to life. Otherwise we always be moving toward the antithesis and will become a culture that embraces death.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","02:39 PM","abortion-debates","1"

No doubt it is a life changing experience.
