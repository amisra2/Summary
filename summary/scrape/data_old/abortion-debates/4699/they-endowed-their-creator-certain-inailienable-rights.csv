"03-31-2005","4699",1,"None","None","None","chloe","103180","My essay: They are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights... Edowed: inherited through existence Unalienable: incapable of being alienated, surrendered, or transferred We have heard these words many times and have undoubtedly passed over them a time or two. However, it is necessary and vital that we pause and consider these words which reflect much about the governmental paradigm our forefathers and the worldview which shaped this nation. We hold these truths to be self evident. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. Our forefathers viewed these (all assumptions underlying the previous statements) as truths which were observable (self-evident) and indisputable. They viewed that there are certain rights that transcend society and culture. This phrase, which comes straight from the declaration of independence and is revisited in the constitution, is the cornerstone of our constitution. Therefore, it can be said that this concept (that there are transcendent rights endowed by someone higher than government) is the foundation of our entire government. In the declaration we read the very purpose of the structure of government as viewed by our forefathers. The purpose of government is: That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, Because these rights (life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness) transcend all of humanity, we must recognize that it is any governments responsibility to secure those rights for all members of the human race. So where do these rights come from? Well, if you ask a theist they will say they were endowed by God (the creator). If you ask a naturalist they will say they were created in the mind of man (endowed by nature). If you ask a transcendentalist they will say they were endowed by the force, Luke. However, rarely will someone who is reasonable deny they exist. Wherever you might like to say these rights originate, you are foolish to deny the existence of these certain inalienable rights (if not for the sheer purpose and means of self preservation!). It is essential to recognize that these rights do not come from government but are merely recognized by government. Therefore, we conclude that since they do not come from government, they should not be taken away by government. Let us examine these rights. We should be careful to observe any place where the concept of rights is mentioned in the documents. In observing we must look and seek to understand each right in the light and context of this statement: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. First, let us examine the right to life. It is interesting to note that this right is mentioned first, and that it is mentioned first for a reason. The right to exist is a fundamental right. Once one obtains the genetic code that is specific to the human race, one exists. From this point on one has a right to continue to exist and this right no one can dispute. Now, lets examine the right to liberty. What is liberty? What is true freedom? Bottom line, this must be defined as free choice in every circumstance. However, does the possibility exist that there is a type of liberty which transcends all of the experiences of mankind? Is there an ultimate freedom which frees mankind from oppression? I leave this for the reader to examine. Finally, the right to the pursuit of happiness. This is the whatever floats your boat right. Happiness is different things to different people and has been viewed as a celebration of individuality. However, is it possible that a true and ultimate happiness exists which transcends all of mankind? A certain happiness that enthralls men and brings them unsurpassing joy? Again, I leave this for the reader to examine. An understood and observed logical hierarchy of rights. We can observe within the constitution and declaration a hierarchy of rights. This hierarchy is based upon one foundational right and that is the right to life. All rights derive themselves from this fundamental right. It is reasonable to say that without this right there would be no other rights. For example, let us consider one scenario within the constitution. We have the right to bare arms. This right would not exist were it not for (partly) a right to defend oneself. The right to defend ones self would not exist were it not for the right to liberty and property. The right to liberty and property would not exist were it not for the right to life (were it not for the right of a human to continue to exist). It is reasonable for one to acknowledge that in order to be happy one must be free to be happy(whatever ones definition of happiness), and in order for one to be free to be happy one must exist to be free. What happens when the rights of two persons appear be in conflict? Upon casual reading one may conclude that all rights are of equal quality. However, this cannot be the case. It must be noted that the right to life is of a different quality of all other rights. The right to life is a right of sanctity and dignity while the right to happiness is a right which determines the quality of that sanctity and dignity. Whenever we see a confliction of rights within our culture there is always a right which takes precedent. Your right to bare arms stops with my right to defend myself. A rapists right to happiness stops with the victims right to liberty. A murderers right to happiness stops with the victims right to life. In every conflict of rights, it is necessary that the more fundamental right take precedent. Let us a look at the mothers right to choose whether or not to donate her bodily resources vs. the baby in the wombs right to life (the right to continue to exist). The conflict of rights between the mothers right to happiness and freedom may sometimes be in conflict with the babys right to life. Comparing these to rights as equal is impossible and unreasonable. The right to life is of a different quality then all of the other rights. The right to life is the assumption of all other rights, and to assume it to be equal to any other right is to commit a fallacy. When it comes to a fundamental right to life(the sanctity and dignity of a human life) vs. a right to happiness (the quality and personal desires of a human life). Which one should win? Well which one is more fundamental? Upon the fundamental right to life hang all other rights bestowed upon humanity and all laws which government can ethically mandate. So, my question remains: Why is there even an option of abortion (other then when the babys right to continue to exist conflicts with the mothers right to continue to exist)? Here is what I think. Those whose transcendent fundamental right to life is being trampled upon are being denied their right to life because they have no voice. Neither do they have the power to stand up for themselves. They are the most innocent among us. They are the weakest of the weak. They are the smallest of the small. Therefore no one notices when fundamental incomparable right to life is denied to these voiceless human beings. While so many are choosing the road of selfishness in exchanging anothers right to continue to exist for their own posh lifestyle and convenience, let those who have a voice and a heart cry out for equal justice under law for all. There may come a day when out of duty Americas citizens must make application of this statement found in the declaration. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. In our dynamic culture, let us embrace a culture that values a right to life. Otherwise we always be moving toward the antithesis and will become a culture that embraces death.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","02:39 PM","abortion-debates","1"

The reason they would be denied to someone by a government which exists to secure these rights for all of its citizens is because that person has taken rights from another by force.

However, the constitution expounded upon the basic fundamental rights and laid out a means of securing those rights. I am showing that the inalienable rights are not equal. Therefore, when there is a conflict of these rights between individuals, the more fundamental right wins out. Our government uses its power to stop someone from going around using their power to deny others their more fundamental rights. The government chooses not to recognize the rights of a murderer in order to secure the right to life of the murderer's potential victims. I dont think you know what my argument is. Just because you doubt doesnt mean anything. Actually, there have been many killers and rapists who have found their happiness by killing and raping. Right, they are endowed. The fundamental rights are not given by government. Our founding fathers recognized this. If you are a human you have fundamental rights. They are recognized and secured by government.

An argument needs to stand on the basis of sound logic and reason alone, not be rooted in the thoughts and ideas of some other person. Can we challenge the declaration? Not only can we not discuss the philosophy with the original writers to see what they, themsleves, intended and meant, but it's entirely irrelevant since our actual rights and our government, are not linked to the declaration in any way.

This results in a company that always follows in the right direction and has been proven to be the most successful companies. So how does this apply to the DOI? Well the DOI is like the mission statement. It was what founded the US (July 4th!). The constutition could be considered a kind of standard operating procedures (the laws too). One has to base laws and the constitution on something in order to get it. What do you look at? What direction? Well, the founders had the mission statement..the DOI. They created the constitution to reflect the ideals of that. To this day we are supposed to look at the DOI to know how this country was founded and why. We need to know our ideals and what we stand for in order to have a basis for making laws to follow our mission (that being freedom). The DOI is not a legal document per say but is a very important document in shaping the laws and ideas of the US. You are right though, it does give a list of things we didn't like.

When people start denying this then what is our country based on...what direction are we going in? I think we already see what happens when we forget what the DOI is and what it did. Today we see judges misusing power, congress being a bunch of babies, and more government controls then the founders could ever imagine.

Because until you do all it is is pure speculation. It's the day we declared independence from England. They never formed a new country until they wrote the articles of confederation. What do you mean ""their"" new country? They expected to be killed for treason and for England to continue to own them. They thought if they did that maybe more people would be aware about the situation and there may be future rebellion or bargaining that would get them the rights they thought they deserved. This is actually a statement on what this country is NOT supposed to look like. It was grievences to the king. How is that anything like a mission statement? The direction we are going in is the direction that voters decide, as in all democracies. And I'm sure you can show me right in the DOI where it says that judges shouldn't misuse power, congress shouldn't be babies and the government should have less control. Even though a lot of what you say is true, it has nothing to do with the DOI. The articles of Confederation was the first mission statement. Let's make there no central government. State money, state roads, state laws, this will be fun. This is a good question which many people argue over. We have an instinct that makes us want to be alive, right? That's why you don't want to jump off a cliff or anything. Well every person makes the agreement, ""I don't want to be killed, you don't want to be killed so let's agree not to kill each other and we will both be happy"". It's the same with property (you can't steal) and many other morals. So since we have an unalienable right to liberty, why are there so many laws? Why can't I use my right to liberty to go kill people? The answer is that it violates others' rights. Same with abortion, even if you assume an embryo is a human and a life (which I still disagree with you on) the right to life violates the mother's right to her body. Also if our right to liberty is truly unalienable why can't I smoke marijuana? It doesn't violate anyone else's rights.

I will say this again, that our government was formed to secure the rights acknowledged in the Declaration of Independence. This is not up for dispute.

It's a fact, it's not open to discussion. Stating that it was the opinion of individuals that drove the reasoning behind the abolition of slavery, and not the authority of a document as dogma, is not an appeal to society. I'm not making a claim, I'm stating a fact. People chose to abolish slavery, they decided, in their heads, they chose. If you wish to argue that they were instead under mind control go ahead. Did the declaration motivate them? Did they persuade people by referencing it? Probably, I'll take your word for it since it's irrelevant. What is relevant is that something is not right or wrong, because it's written down on a piece of paper. That's the 'ole appeal again. OK to who? Society? Yes, of course. Logically if society thinks slavery is OK, then slavery is OK to the society. Nonsense. Slavery was OK..i.e. legal, for quite some time. It was also legal in many civilizations in history.

If you want instead to appeal to the declaration, you can do that too, I just wish you would choose not to. People can always spot the weak argument. That's why your argument goes from: The declaration of independance, a historical document. The constitution/U.S. government/legal system.

Basically there are no black and whites with morals. If you say killing is always wrong you obviously are against the death penalty, hunting, eating meat, etc. I don't like to kill, but there are areas when you have to: Food, protecting health. There aren't absolutes. There is no such thing as an absolute truth when dealing with morals and opinions. As soon as you define what it means for a right to exist (NOT to be enforced) I will answer. You seem to think that if you have a right the government must enforce it, and you claim you have that right but you can't prove it. A right isn't something concrete you can hold in your hand. and before humans there was much killing You want to bring this in? The law of gravity is being enforced as we speak. Nature enforces it. You can't violate the laws of gravity and thermodynamics and motion (all of which are actually theories by the way, same as evolution, just wanted to point that out). Obviously people can kill. Even these forces kill. Earthquakes kill all the time, people drown, people fall (even gravity can kill). I would define a right as something being enforced, but if you want to have a separate definition, fine. Just PLEASE tell me what it is. You're right, I can't tell you what Hitler did was wrong. But since humans are kind of fond of life they decided to agree not to kill each other. It isn't right or wrong, we just know if we do it nothing will stop someone else from doing it right back to us. Obviously they didn't make that agreement with fetuses. This is the same reason we kill other animals for sport and for food. There is no absolute right or wrong, we have just made the agreement to have our life, property, and freedoms protected but we give up the RIGHT to violate the life, property, and freedoms of others. Does that make since? This right existed before because we could kill people but now we don't have the right to do it because the government enforces it.

Morality is neither logic, nor law, yet you keep getting the two confused. Morality (right vs wrong, a relative concept), and reality, that is, correspondance to reality i.e. true, or false. If what I say is true, it's objectively true, and anyone adhering to logic or reason accepts it as true. However, if I were to tell you that eating pork is ""wrong"", then it's just an opinion of mine, and does not necessarily have any meaning to you. If however I were to tell you eating uncooked pork increases your risk of developing paraistes, that would be correct, factual, true, all of these things. So yes, if I say something is true, and it can be verified as true, you should believe it to be true. If I offer an opinon about right vs wrong, it's just a relative term, there is no true or false. I hope that helps you understnad the definitions you are using. It's not a claim. It's an accepted definition, that is, a premise. Absolutes have nothing to do with this, it's a strawman introduced in an attempt to lead some novice into a logical contradiction. Truth has nothing to do with the word ""absolute"".

""I guess you could say the same thing about a mentally retarded person, alzheimers patients, 1 second old baby, a sleeping person (as they wouldn't know and therefore couldn't get outraged or offended)...."" No, you couldn't say the same at all. ""...I guess you define a person as being aware they don't wanna be killed."" I define a person based upon clinical signs of life. ""I recall some other people thinking the same thing in the 1930s"" Yeah and he was pro-life. Totally against abortion. Man, good to see you lifers are in good company with Hitler and Stalin. So much for the culture of life in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia! ""You are sadly mistaken there...It was illegal for about 200 years dude."" It is you who is mistaken. Abortion was only fully criminalized sometime in 1850...however it was a state-by-state campaign; not national. If you have a source which proves abortion has been illegal in America for 200 years...be my guest, really...I dare you. Because every textbook written about abortion laws here in America shows that abortion was perfectly legal until quickening by any mean and any way.

If you'll kindly read this post I think it will be evident that I meant resource, not aid. I view abortion as an action that results in the killing of a fetus, ie, actively killing the fetus. No, cutting a fetus from the body is to actively remove it from the life-sustaining resources it is already utilizing. You may argue it has no right to be utilizing these resources, but cutting the fetus from the body is not refusing to supply it with these resources, it is actively removing it from these resources. This is why I say that I'd like to see a woman refuse her resources to a fetus without any outside resource/help/aid. If she could do this, then she would be refusing to supply a resource she owns. Otherwise, she is actively removing the fetus from the life-sustaining resource it is utilizing. I obviously agree with this one Not to be picky, but I think you're going to need to define ""active killing.""","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","12:02 AM","abortion-debates","246"

If a person intentionally overdoses, thereby showing their intent to die, is it an offense against that person if medical personel to give life-preserving care to that person? How can a one day old infant have/express an interest to live? Having the capability is not the same as actually having it. Let me show you. A fetus has the capability to have an interest in life. Should we then conclude that it would offend the fetus to end its life?","Linus","110677","But they have expressed it before.

Not the person within a coma. If a person wants to die then let them. People make the choice to alter the way theyll live anyways so why stop now? How can it not? An infant has the ability to cherish does it not? If an infant can make emotional attachments to a mother then why not life? No, a fetus has the future possibility (not the absolute) of attaining an interest if it gestates long enough to develop such a feature. But if the fetus is somehow miscarried - whether by the aid of a doctor or natural circumstances - it will never have this ability; an ability it never had in the first place. Now tell me thiscan you take something away from something that never had it to begin with? So are you suggesting abortion would offend the fetus then?

This does not answer my question. Is it an offense against a person trying to commit suicide if medical personnell offer life-sustaining care to that person until they recover? What is the difference between a one day old infant, and a fetus who will be born in one day? How do we determine if such an interest to live exists? I believe the unborn has the fundamental right to life from conception. As such, abortion is in violation of its fundamental right to continue existing.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","12:39 AM","abortion-debates","250"

Either way, you get home, find him there, decide what you're going to do, and make him leave. ""Actively removing him"" from the resources he was living on. Later, he dies of starvation. Have you murdered him? In my view, no, you have not, since the resources you have removed him from were not his to begin with. Now if you went out and stole someone else's food and they died, that would be murder, or at least manslaughter. Similarly, a fetus does not own its' mother's body. To consistently apply a ""right to life"" even this narrowly, you have to agree that any hobo who moves into your house has a right to continue living off you, forever. In which case, please provide me with your address.","Cone","111132","No, not forever, but maybe until he can sustain himself.
