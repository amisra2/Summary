Instead that uncertainty should lead you to stop. If you dont like that example, consider a hunter who is unsure what is in the bushes.","Clive14","103429","Incoerrect.

Sadly though, you get all confused in your haste to find a little snippet of knowledge that appears to agree with your silly claim that ""human life begins at conception"". Dizygotic twins (ie twins formed from two zygotes, commonly known as non-identical twins) occur when the two overies both release eggs that become fertilized. Monozygotic twins (formed from one zygote, commonly known as identical twins) can occur in, broadly speaking, three ways: 1. The egg splits when it has formed two cells. Those two cells go on to produce two separate individuals. 2. At some stage up to 7 days after conception (ie before implantation in the uterus), the ""inner cell mass"" (the part of the embryo that will go on to form the fetus, placenta and chorion, rather than the amnion) splits in two forming two separate individuals. 3. At some stage between 1 to 2 weeks after conception, and after it has further differentiated into the endoderm and ectoderm, the ectoderm (the bit that will form the fetus and placenta rather than the chorion) splits in two and froms two separate individuals. A new human individual can form up to two weeks after conception. Life cannot be scientifically defined as always starting at conception.

Straight from my molecular and cellular biology book: The dynamics of a cell can best be understood by examining the course of its life. A new cell arises when one cell divides or when two cells, like a sperm and an egg cell, fuse. From the medical dictionary: life 1 a : the quality that distinguishes a vital and functional plant or animal from a dead body b : a state of living characterized by capacity for metabolism, growth, reaction to stimuli, and reproduction All of the genetic info which defines human life exists at conception, therefore this is called human life. Before the embryo splits into two separate parts it must be alive to do this. it could not do this if it were dead. At the fusion of the male and female nuclei a single nucleus is created. After this fusion the new entity (containg a unique genetic code) would have to undergo a process of cell death in order to be called dead. then your beef is with the founding fathers: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.""","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","03:34 PM","abortion-debates","41"
"04-01-2005","4699",3,"chloe","None","The Declaration states what our rights are, ""life, liberty, pursuit of happines"" (property) and why we declared our independence. The Constitution explains what form of government will best guard these rights. The purpose of a good government is to secure these rights for all of its citizens, and the reason those measures must be set in place is because these rights sometimes conflict. The reason they would be denied to someone by a government which exists to secure these rights for all of its citizens is because that person has taken rights from another by force. The government does this to punish the lawbreaker and better secure the rights of the other citizens. This keeps crooks off the streets who seek their happiness at the expense of other peoples more fundamental rights. Right, but life is not. That is why you cannot compare the two. Killing makes a killer happy, but it robs the victim of life. The right to continue to exist is necessary for all of the other rights. If you dont exist you dont have any other rights. The slave owners had a wrong understanding of humanity. This doenst negate the fact that the slaves were endowed with rights by their creator.","Duo_Maxwell","103501","You seem to think that the Declaration has impact upon how this country is run. Again, the Decl. has no legal standing whatsoever in the US legal system. Simply because it is written down does not mean it is true, nor does it mean it applies. Please tell me where the Consitution says you have the right to the pursuit of happiness. Furthermore, that is ludacrious. You can puruse happiness in a jail cell. No one can take that ability from you. IT is not really a right, but a simple fact of life. The consitution also states how you can LOSE those rights. Okay.... So you therefore admit that these rights are infact, NOT inalienable but on the contrary, very much so. That creates a internal contridiction in your argument. I doubt killing makes a killer happy, as many killers have seriously regretted such decisions. You don't have any rights in the first place. You are given rights , and these rights can be taken away just as easily as they were given. You made another contridiction. By stating previously that what the signers thought was right and now stating they were wrong, you have contridicted your argument. Make up your mind. Please make up your mind about whether or not what the signers thought was right, you have clearly contridicted yourself on that on several occasions","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","04:30 PM","abortion-debates","42"

However, the constitution expounded upon the basic fundamental rights and laid out a means of securing those rights. I am showing that the inalienable rights are not equal. Therefore, when there is a conflict of these rights between individuals, the more fundamental right wins out. Our government uses its power to stop someone from going around using their power to deny others their more fundamental rights. The government chooses not to recognize the rights of a murderer in order to secure the right to life of the murderer's potential victims. I dont think you know what my argument is. Just because you doubt doesnt mean anything. Actually, there have been many killers and rapists who have found their happiness by killing and raping. Right, they are endowed. The fundamental rights are not given by government. Our founding fathers recognized this. If you are a human you have fundamental rights. They are recognized and secured by government. No. They recognized the rights existed. This is kind of like a pro-choice person recognizes there exists a right to life, yet denies that right to those in the womb. Just because they do this doesnt mean the right to life does not exist.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","05:10 PM","abortion-debates","43"

But really, I'd just like to add something to this talk of rights. Rights are just abstract notions and have little bearing on the real practical world. I think Duo Maxwell is wrong when he says that no one has rights. Whatever rights you do have are entirely in your mind. Anybody who thinks they have rights just imagines that they do until these rights are codified by law. Think about it. If I drop you off in Saudi Arabia with a pound of cocaine in your pocket and you are arrested, they will want to execute you. You can scream on and on about your god-given rights to life and liberty, but they'll laugh and chop your head off. Where were your rights? In your decapitated head, nowhere else. Duo Maxwell is right in implying that whatever is made possible to you through laws is what is entitled to you and you may call these your rights if you like. The statement in the DoI is really just an ideal with no bearing on reality. they thought that these were the rights that should be protected by govt and they honestly thought that the creator endowed men with these rights, but any real practical right you have today has nothing to do with the creator and everything to do with the laws of man (men?).","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","06:11 PM","abortion-debates","44"
"04-01-2005","4699",3,"None","None","None","zachvac","103538","I think it's funny how chloe says we have fundemental rights to life and is trying to fight for the right that we don't have. It's not a right if we don't have it. A right is something you are allowed to do under the government, parent, guardian, etc. You don't have a fundemental right to life. You don't have a fundemental right to property. That's why we have government. You agree to give up some of your natural rights (rights to be totally free as when there were no government) for the government to protect other, more important rights. If the government doesn't protect a right, you don't have it. It's that simple. Also if the right to life is unalienable than why is it legal to kill flies? They are alive too. Why do only humans get a right to life? Why does an embryo count as a person? Even if it's alive, is it really a person yet? Also I find it irritating that you say we are endowed with a right to life and then look up life in the dictionary. A dictionary is not really a good source as to what it means to have that right, just the common use everyone uses it for. Dictionaries are good for spelling, pronunciation, and finding a basic definition of a word you don't know. To use it as most of the basis of your argument is pretty bad.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","07:46 PM","abortion-debates","45"
