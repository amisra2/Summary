If someone shows up at my doorstep about to die from starvation (by about, I mean he would certainly die if he were to try to go elsewhere), then in my view I have an obligation to do what I can to help him, i.e. feed him, etc. The presence of a fetus in the womb in no way implies that the fetus owns the mother's body.","DLynK46Seeking1","447514","WOW! Seriously? SYM: a baby is HOUSED in the womb. The baby has no place else to go and IS, most definitely entitled to sustenance from the body that houses him/her. I think CONE has a GREAT point, and I agree 100% Wow! I don't think I can continue to follow this thread. Was nice reading the discussion up to this point anyway.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","06:24 PM","abortion-debates","256"
