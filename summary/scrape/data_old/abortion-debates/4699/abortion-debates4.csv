However - that doesn't mean that Jim, Chloe, or Wubya the Monkey get to make blanket decisions for total strangers without their input and without regard to their circumstances. There are simply better ways to address abortion than stepping on the rights and privacy of pregnant women, strapping down their options, demonizing them for their sexuality and trivializing everything they are facing.","JPSartre12","103546","If you believe that life begins at conception and you also support abortion then how do you justify abortion?

This country was built on the idea that the government does not give rights but we already have them. The Bill of Rights is simply here to make sure the government doesn't try and take them away. This is different from other governments that try to give rights. The problem with government giving rights is that they are not ""rights"" if they can be given and taken away. For example, many claim the right for a women to do what she wants with her own body. If the government takes this away does that mean no right exists?(granted I dont believe in that right). Why are rights based on law? This would also mean that slavery was ok back in the 1800's. The slave owners had a ""right"" to their property. Does this mean that slavery was ok until this ""right"" was taken? The answer is no. This is why the US was created with rights endowed by the creator. Governments job is to make sure no one takes those and the Bill of Rights is set up to kinda make sure the government doesn't take certain ones away. The example of ones head being cut off for having cocaine is a bad one because the right to life still exists it is just that the government there has infridged upon this...it doesn't mean it was ever gone. As for zachvac, why are definitions bad...what do you think the founders used? Words mean certain things and sometimes we lose sight of that.

If we had no government you would have all the rights yet you wouldn't be safe because someone else could excercise their right to kill you. The point is that rights are not something you have without government. Our (the U.S.) government says that when you are born you have these rights under this government. You cannot name one single right that absolutely can't be taken away. You don't have the freedom of speech. You can't yell ""fire"" in a crowded hall. You don't have a right to life, there's the death penalty. I don't care how the US was created, rights aren't there unless someone is there to protect them. Without the government, your rights are what the biggest, strongest person says they are. In most dictatorships, you have no rights. You can't say they have the right to live the government just doesn't recognize it. The definition of a right is that you are allowed to do it. About the definition: I just meant that if you need a dictionary to define a word as basic as this, something's wrong. Everyone should know what a right is and I'm sure the founding fathers didn't consult a dictionary to make sure the words they used were consistent to every definition exactly. If you want to cite a dictionary to define an obscure word or if someone misses the point of a definition (if I tried to say that a right was a tool like a hammer used to murder people), use the dictionary, but if your whole case rests on the dictionary, you've got some work to do.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","11:11 PM","abortion-debates","49"

I have read the entire Bible and have discussed it at length with Lutherans, Witnesses, Mormons, Pentacostals and Catholics. I don't subscribe to a particular church. I believe life begins at conception and can end anywhere. I think frequently death is a sad reality (war, accidents and yes, abortion). I would like to find ways to help women not have to resort to it. I do not believe this can be done in the way most pro-lifers support. They want to place restrictions on women and then turn a blind eye. ""birth control"", ""Cramping lifestyle"", ""selfish"", ""no reason"" (like a total stranger would know). I am sorry they can claim to respect women - but until I hear such things as above get replaced with a little more understanding - I don't believe them.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","12:00 AM","abortion-debates","53"

I really think a lot of the men need to stand up and be men and take responsibility. However, i dont think we will really get women in these situations the help they need unless there is a culture shift. I dont think our society really understands the value of life and doesnt really understand what a culture of life is. If it really did, then there wouldnt be any women who would feel demonized. The heart of this nation must embrace life on the heart level and then as a natural result we will see fruit. We really need a radical culture shift in our society on so many levels for this to happen though. I can think of some things which would bring that but wont mention them here.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","01:13 AM","abortion-debates","55"

Which women are feeling demonized? those having abortions or those chosing to have the baby? If it's the latter, then I don't agree. The illegitimacy rate in the US is higher than it has EVER been. In big cities, illegitimate births significantly outnumber legitimate births in all demographics except for Asians and some Hispanics. Amongst blacks, for example, illegitimacy outnumbers legitimate births by 2 to 1. If they're being demonized, then they aren't aware of it because the rate isn't dropping.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","01:21 PM","abortion-debates","56"

Without that cultural shift, banning abortion will only harm more women. Abortion is a symptom of problems in society, not a cause. Banning it will not stop abortions (because the problems in society will still exist), it will simply drive them underground. A surgical practise such as this should not be driven underground because that will maim and kill many more women. ""Culture of life"" and ""value of life"" are meaningless buzzwords. Please be specific. Without the shifts you speak of banning abortion will do nothing to help. Absolutely nothing.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","04:04 PM","abortion-debates","57"

The right to live is the cornerstone upon which all other rights rest upon. You remove that right and the house falls. You can't compare any other right with the right to life because it is of a different quality. if you are dead then you dont have any rights. You must exist and continue to exist in order to have any right and to continue to have any right. A gov must make it first priority to secure the right to continue to exist (right to life) in order to secure any other rights. If someone takes another persons life they not only deny them their right to life, but also every other conceivable right. I would like to think that your right to continue to exist to post your opinions on this board (right to life) has more value than my right to liberty, happiness and my right to life has more value than your right to liberty and if these rights were to ever conflict we would both continue to live another day to argue. i do think you are wrong on this one sigma (and all who agree with sigma), and it wont hurt my feelings if you admit it You are absolutely right. Banning abortions will not solve all of our problems, but it will further solidify and secure the right to life, and therefore better secure all other rights for all. I have heard this so many times and the statistics on this have been blown astronomically out of proportion. Planned parenthood pushed this propaganda. Ill back this statement up if you like. A culture of life is a culture where the right to life is viewed as the most fundamental of all rights. A culture where the dignity of life is held above the quality of life. Banning abortion would save over 1 mill human lives a year. However, abortion won't be banned unless there is FIRST a cultural shift. The shift must come first.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","05:19 PM","abortion-debates","58"
"04-02-2005","4699",4,"Steeeeve","None","So if you and I were in space you would be ok with me killing you? No. Rights exist whether someone is there to enforce it or not. That is why the founders said they are endowed by the Creator. I can name one. You cannot take away the right to life. Just because someone kills you doesn't mean your right was taken away. It means someone abused your right. Read the article on rights that I posted.","zachvac","103714","I'm not ok with it but in this scenario life would not be a right unless you and I came to an agreement to not kill each other. Then we would have a right to life but not before. So you call the death penalty abusing their rights? I could also say I was given the right to smoke pot, but until the government lets me, it's not a right. I can continue to say that these are only abuses on my rights but I doubt you'd listen","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","06:17 PM","abortion-debates","59"
"04-02-2005","4699",4,"chloe","None","The declaration showed that the founding fathers recognized the rights. However, the constitution expounded upon the basic fundamental rights and laid out a means of securing those rights. I am showing that the inalienable rights are not equal. Therefore, when there is a conflict of these rights between individuals, the more fundamental right wins out. Our government uses its power to stop someone from going around using their power to deny others their more fundamental rights. The government chooses not to recognize the rights of a murderer in order to secure the right to life of the murderer's potential victims. I dont think you know what my argument is. Just because you doubt doesnt mean anything. Actually, there have been many killers and rapists who have found their happiness by killing and raping. Right, they are endowed. The fundamental rights are not given by government. Our founding fathers recognized this. If you are a human you have fundamental rights. They are recognized and secured by government. They recognized the rights existed. This is kind of like a pro-choice person recognizes there exists a right to life, yet denies that right to those in the womb. Just because they do this doesnt mean the right to life does not exist.","Duo_Maxwell","103731","What do you mean by recognized? They obviously did not recognize the majority of humanity's part in such rights. I ask you, how much US history and Law have you had? And taking them away. Does the consitution say your right to life and property is inalienable? You just skipped a important part of my argument. By your silence I take it you concede that the consitution does not recognize a right to the pursuit of happiness. How is that possible? We don't have rights that are inalienable. Life, and property are both very alienable. You cannot argue or show something that does not exist. Because... So you now think that these rights are alienable. Again, more contridictions. are these rights inalienable or alienable, you cannot argue that they are both at the same time! Realize your contridictions and straighten your logic out! I can't with all of your internal contridictions. You say one thing and then say it's wrong, and then say it;s right all in the same post! Make up your mind. And there are many who have not. Hence, such a statement is blanket and therefore meaningless. As soon as one disagrees, the blanket falls apart and loses all crediblity. Very silly. Oh so very silly. Before there was government, did you have rights? Did you have a right to life? no. Something could have killed your mother and bam you never had that right. Did you have a right to property? No. Something could have taken your property from you and you couldn't have done anything. Very silly. Rights assume that things act in accordance to what they set. Does the ocean care for your right to life while you slowly drown? Does the avalance care if about your right to liberty when you're trapped in a moutain of snow? Rights are bestowed, they are not fundemental. Then why did they not apply them? You said that they thought all humanity had them, but why did they act in a contrary manner? Again, deal with your contridictions before posting to me. gnojek: Rights as we mean in application. You can think you have everything, does it mean you do? No. Hence with rights. Rights are given, they are not fundemental. Our rights now are protected by force. In history, if that force did not exist, rights did not exist in practice. I don't think we disagree at all.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","07:15 PM","abortion-debates","60"
