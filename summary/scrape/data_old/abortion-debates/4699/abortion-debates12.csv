"04-09-2005","4699",12,"Cone","None","It was the Declaration of Independence that produced the notion that slavery was wrong. Try the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments. If that's not impact upon the legal system, I don't know what is. Just so I am perfectly clear in what I mean, the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments came to be because there was a perceived violation of the Declaration of Independence.","zachvac","105812","oh really? Where? I have a copy in front of me and would like you to quote where it stated or implied that slavery was wrong. Most of the authors were slave-owners, why would they think slavery was wrong? As well since there wasn't slavery in England they wouldn't even address slavery in the DOI. If you can show me where in the DOI it says anything about slaves (or even implies it) then I may take you seriously, but for now, well... Which perceived violation of the DOI was that?","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","05:39 PM","abortion-debates","166"
"04-09-2005","4699",12,"Steeeeve","None","I am not sure if you know anything about mangement or not but I just wanna point out something... Every good company has what is called a mission statement...from this we get things like Standard Operations procedures that reflect the ideals of the mission of the company. This results in a company that always follows in the right direction and has been proven to be the most successful companies. So how does this apply to the DOI? Well the DOI is like the mission statement. It was what founded the US (July 4th!). The constutition could be considered a kind of standard operating procedures (the laws too). One has to base laws and the constitution on something in order to get it. What do you look at? What direction? Well, the founders had the mission statement..the DOI. They created the constitution to reflect the ideals of that. To this day we are supposed to look at the DOI to know how this country was founded and why. We need to know our ideals and what we stand for in order to have a basis for making laws to follow our mission (that being freedom). The DOI is not a legal document per say but is a very important document in shaping the laws and ideas of the US. You are right though, it does give a list of things we didn't like. But this is what we base things on....we didn't like them, so we aren't gonna do things that way. This is why it acts more like a mission statement. Maybe it makes more sense now.","zachvac","105813","You really need to learn your US history. The DOI was written before the war so it didn't exactly found the US. Officially, yes but at that time they expected to be hanged for treason. There is much in common with the DOI and the Constitution, but all law that references the DOI has support in the Constitution or any other legal document (unless they are simply writing a new law). You are right here, but we never said we didn't like that they were giving abortions or having slaves.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","05:42 PM","abortion-debates","167"
"04-09-2005","4699",12,"Steeeeve","None","But it did talk about how people all have the right to life. The founders also knew that slavery should be gotten rid of because it really wasn't consistent with the values they had..however, they expected this would happen later on. If you don't think that the DOI made us a country then you might wanna think again. What day is July 4th again? Just because they knew they would be hung for treason doesn't mean they didn't think a country would be formed. They just knew if their new country failed then they would be hung... I am not claiming that the DOI is a legal document, but like I said, a mission statement...it is what the country is supposed to look to in order to know what we are about. When people start denying this then what is our country based on...what direction are we going in? I think we already see what happens when we forget what the DOI is and what it did. Today we see judges misusing power, congress being a bunch of babies, and more government controls then the founders could ever imagine. It is about time we look to our mission statment to get back on track. If all morals are made up then what is the basis for making them up? One has to have a set up principals or a basis of some kind in order to decide somethign is immoral otherwise what are you comparing? How do you decide it is wrong...Cone is right, Ab got the idea that slavery is wrong because of the DOI and the principals for what it stood. The DOI deosn't say slavery, it says the unalienable rights thing...this was the basis, from that Ab Lincoln decided that slavery violated that...im sure he had some religious help too .","zachvac","105835","and can you give me any proof of that? Because until you do all it is is pure speculation. It's the day we declared independence from England. They never formed a new country until they wrote the articles of confederation. What do you mean ""their"" new country? They expected to be killed for treason and for England to continue to own them. They thought if they did that maybe more people would be aware about the situation and there may be future rebellion or bargaining that would get them the rights they thought they deserved. This is actually a statement on what this country is NOT supposed to look like. It was grievences to the king. How is that anything like a mission statement? The direction we are going in is the direction that voters decide, as in all democracies. And I'm sure you can show me right in the DOI where it says that judges shouldn't misuse power, congress shouldn't be babies and the government should have less control. Even though a lot of what you say is true, it has nothing to do with the DOI. The articles of Confederation was the first mission statement. Let's make there no central government. State money, state roads, state laws, this will be fun. This is a good question which many people argue over. We have an instinct that makes us want to be alive, right? That's why you don't want to jump off a cliff or anything. Well every person makes the agreement, ""I don't want to be killed, you don't want to be killed so let's agree not to kill each other and we will both be happy"". It's the same with property (you can't steal) and many other morals. So since we have an unalienable right to liberty, why are there so many laws? Why can't I use my right to liberty to go kill people? The answer is that it violates others' rights. Same with abortion, even if you assume an embryo is a human and a life (which I still disagree with you on) the right to life violates the mother's right to her body. Also if our right to liberty is truly unalienable why can't I smoke marijuana? It doesn't violate anyone else's rights. I think you've got to work on your ""unalienable rights"" argument.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","07:00 PM","abortion-debates","169"
"04-10-2005","4699",12,"Cone","None","The Declaration appeals to the Supreme Judge of all the world, that Creator who endows men with unalienable rights which governments are supposed to secure. Thus I did not point to human agents for authority, and therefore committed no fallacy. [list]I argue from the Declaration of Independence because I value the principles that our entire system is founded upon. I will say this again, that our government was formed to secure the rights acknowledged in the Declaration of Independence. This is not up for dispute. This is historical fact, and is reflected in the Constitution itself as can be seen when comparing Article V with the following quote: Arguments should be based on principles (as the founders' were), not public opinion. You said This is nothing more than an appeal to authority (society), and by your own standard, I should not accept this as a backing for your argument. What a contradiction it is to say that I can't appeal to authority, but you can. You said This is nothing more than an appeal to authority (society), and by your own standard, I should not accept this as a backing for your argument. So as long as society thinks slavery is ok, it's ok? No, my point is that slavery was wrong before society agreed that it was wrong. I can say that with 100% certainty. Slavery was, is, and always will be wrong whether or not society or government say so.","Mach","105876","Careful, I never claimed you used fallacy in that way. I claimed that using the declaration as a reason for XZY (when not in a legal context) is fallacy. It's an appeal to authority (dogma in a document). You claimed the declaration had relevance because it was used in such a way in the past. I claim that does not make it relevant, since it's still just a document, that is not part of the U.S. legal system. THAT'S the fallacy ^^ if your reason for XYZ being ""correct"" or ""just"" or ""true"", and it's an ethical, moral, or otherwise ""choice"" driven claim, your back to appealing to a document. It can be your motivation, go for it. Probably a good motivator too, but it's not a reason in and of itself. Same reason most christians don't even follow their dogmatic bible literally, it's just some OTHER humans (misguided) opinons. That's simply an opinion of yours. If the founders had wanted to declare that the government was formed to secure the rights acknowledged in the Dec of Ind., they would have written ""This government is formed to secure the rights in the declaration of independance"". They didn't, you just made it up. They actually chose NOT to say that. How interesting. You are arguing against the fact that the declaration is not part of the U.S. government. It's a fact, it's not open to discussion. Stating that it was the opinion of individuals that drove the reasoning behind the abolition of slavery, and not the authority of a document as dogma, is not an appeal to society. I'm not making a claim, I'm stating a fact. People chose to abolish slavery, they decided, in their heads, they chose. If you wish to argue that they were instead under mind control go ahead. Did the declaration motivate them? Did they persuade people by referencing it? Probably, I'll take your word for it since it's irrelevant. What is relevant is that something is not right or wrong, because it's written down on a piece of paper. That's the 'ole appeal again. OK to who? Society? Yes, of course. Logically if society thinks slavery is OK, then slavery is OK to the society. Nonsense. Slavery was OK..i.e. legal, for quite some time. It was also legal in many civilizations in history. You again, can argue the contrary, but it's pointless. It's a fact that slavery was legal in the U.S., and in many other civilizations before it. Slavery is a human concept, and ""wrong"" is a human concept, that's of course completely relative. Suggesting that slavery existed before humans existed as a species, or that something was ""morally wrong to humans"" before humans existed, is just silly. It's also a fact that no human terms or concepts existed before humans existed, to suggest otherwise is again, simply not logical. We are the music makers, we are the dreamers of dreams. - W. Wonka Humans determine what is right, what is wrong, to themselves, as a group for society, as a society for a global society, etc., etc., etc. It's human choice, hopefully in most cases, fueled by reason and logic. If you have a reason..that is, something based on reason (!!) that makes it clear why some biological matter should have rights, do tell. If you want instead to appeal to the declaration, you can do that too, I just wish you would choose not to. People can always spot the weak argument. That's why your argument goes from: The declaration of independance, a historical document. The constitution/U.S. government/legal system. Abortion implications Slavery Abe Lincoln and the declaration related to slavery Human rights existing before humans existed It's all over the place. How could 6 unrelated things all be ""evidence"" that you're correct? Mind boggling. -Mach","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","02:20 AM","abortion-debates","173"

I said: If a Constitutional Amendment makes slavery legal again, it is still wrong. Just because something is legal, does not make it morally right. If the U.S. had an Amendment which legalized murder, murder would be legal, but still morally wrong. So wrong is completely relative? Then how can you tell me that I am wrong about the Declaration of Independence being the motivating factor of abolition?

Some think eating meat is wrong, some thing stepping on bugs is wrong, and some think abortion is wrong.

Correct (well since different people have different morals it may be morally right to some, but...) but if murder was made legal you would not have a RIGHT to life. Very simply: ""You are wrong about the Declaration of Independence being the motivating factor of abolition"". It's up to you to prove, not anyone else to disprove. You made the claim, you support it. No they didn't. Slaves were fighting to gain their right to freedom, they didn't have that right. Gays are fighting for their right to marry, they don't have that right, people are arguing for the right for a fetus to live, they don't have that right until a law similar to the laws banning slavery are made. Not quite sure what you're trying to say here. But wrong is definately relative. It can be realtive to law or relative to a person's morals, I just don't understand what you're trying to say. No I don't know where that leaves us. Please elaborate. Morals are relative. Some think it is morally ok to kill. The law sees it differently (except for the death penalty).

But since wrong is subjective, your statement means nothing to me. Second, you accuse me of misusing the word wrong, and your tone indicates that such misuse is a bad thing. Let's assume I did misuse the word wrong (which I didn't). What's so bad about misusing a word? This is incorrect. I have a right to life no matter what anyone says because morality is not subjective, it is objective. My right to life does not exist because the government exists, government exists to secure my already existent right. There you go again insisting that I am wrong. But wrong is subjective so I don't know what you mean. Are you trying to impose your subjective morality onto me? You have it backwards. People thought slavery was wrong, thus a law was made. The law wasn't made, and then people came into the belief it was wrong. This implies that it was wrong before the law was made.

One is not subjective. If I said 1+1=3 I would be wrong. If I said the Earth was flat I would be wrong. If you say slavery is universally wrong you are wrong. A subjective wrong has to do with morals. If you say slavery is morally wrong others can have different opinions and different morals that dictate what is wrong or right. Misusing a word isn't that bad, as long as you realize what you really mean and explain it. If I say all humans have claws, but I misused claw I meant hair, we would have a problem with communication. If you try to say something is universally morally wrong this is not true. yawn. So as Duo asked you before, how do you have a right if it isn't protected. You can argue semantics all you want, but your right isn't enforced without government. You can be killed and nothing will happen without government. Without government we can have abortions and with government we continue to allow abortions. So I would like to ask you a question. Where does your right to life come from? Where's your proof? I can claim I have a right to pee on your lawn, but it wouldn't hold up in court. and please don't say the founding fathers because where's their proof that it's a right? If they are there before government, please explain to me how rights came to be. I've already explained this above. You are using bad logic, but nothing is morally wrong with what you're doing. I didn't say anything about a law, I said right. And gays are fighting for a law, people are fighting for a law to protect fetuses. It's the same thing. But in a democracy all that matters is more than 1/2 think it is wrong and they can ban it (or 25% because of the stupid electoral college, but we won't get into that). People thought it was wrong so they made a law. Just as many people think restricting gays from getting married is wrong and just as people think abortions are wrong. I was refering to this: Where does it leave us? If morals are absolutely relative, where does it leave us? You have not explained this in the whole post.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","11:15 PM","abortion-debates","179"

All I have to say is . . . Wow. So lets pull the plug on all the baby boomers when they become the strain on the health care system. Also, according to this logic, everyone on welfare goes, everyone in the lower class goes. It makes sense though, this is the type of conclusion that comes when one does not place inherrent value upon human life. It is a logical conclusion to the naturalistic worldview, or any other worldview that does not place highest value upon all human life. This is bigotry at its finest.
