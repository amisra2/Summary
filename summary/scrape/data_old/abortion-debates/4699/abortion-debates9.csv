"04-03-2005","4699",9,"Steeeeve","None","we are talking about UNalienable rights...the DOI says unalienable..they mean different things. I can't believe I am even talking about this...Although they are close They were ""stomped"" on..not taken away. The people that fought for independence thought that rights were unalienable...how could you deny this? They wouldn't say unalienable if they meant they wanted their own government to create their owns rights....Why didn't they want this? Because it would mean that the government they created could do the same thing...Thus they believe rights were actually unalienable. Didn't we already address this?...your examples make no sense","Duo_Maxwell","103959","The mean the same thing. I even gave you the dictionary definition which states they are the same thing. Are you saying that webster is wrong? They never had them in the first place. What they believed is irrevelant. They never had them unless they were enforced. They make perfect sense. If a right is inalienable or unalienable, same thing, then only God can remove it. Chloe. I responded to your post. You have yet to reply. If rights are truly given by God, then why is it EVERYONE OF YOU CLEARLY WANTS TO AVOID TALKING ABOUT RIGHTS OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT?","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","06:00 PM","abortion-debates","123"

"04-03-2005","4699",9,"Mach","None","Chloe: Unfortunately, your premise is a document that has no legal relevance in the United States. It's a zinger to the world that we don't like the idea of monarchies, but more relevantly, that the King of England didn't have the right to rule subjects without their consent, etc. If you have an argument that has the premise rooted in the constitution, without any reference to gods, or the declaration, I'd like you to post it, having some more logic-driven debates on a hot-topic are always a good thing, in this case it's logic-driven, just with a flawed premise. In the end your entire argument fails because it's essentially an appeal to authority, that is, the authority of our forefathers as thinkers (which some indeed were). An argument needs to stand on the basis of sound logic and reason alone, not be rooted in the thoughts and ideas of some other person.","chloe","103985","This document recognizes rights which are secured under the constitution. the premises rooted in the constitution are rooted in the principles found in the declaration. Our constitution was rooted in the thoughts and ideas of its writers as well. I am not alone in my thoughts.
