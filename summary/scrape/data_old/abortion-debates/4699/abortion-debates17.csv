"04-21-2005","4699",17,"Sym","None","And if you criminalize abortion you will. It's called a coathanger. The fact someone assists them, in any case, has no relevance whatsoever to what their ""intent"" is. A woman gets an abortion. She might do it for any number of reasons. You claim she has murderous intent. and all we have is your word to go on that the intent of women having abortions is to ""kill"" their feti. In other words, we are expected to, on the basis of your mind-reading abilities, punish all women who have abortions","Steeeeve","110631","You don't need intent to be convicted of murder. Not that this matters. The point is you are killing someone and that is wrong. The difference in it being illegal is that the government doesn't support (and makes it criminal) to harm another person. The idea that people will ""do it anyway"" doesn't really matter. People are killing adults everyday eventhough it is illegal and I doubt we should legalize that. I don't follow you here. If the intent is not to kill their unborn child then what is it??? To see what surgeries they can do down there or something? I think a women knows why she is getting an abortion and if not, ignorance is no excuse for killing someone. So punish them...well, do you punish someone that kills a 40yr old man?","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","10:54 PM","abortion-debates","242"

The fact someone assists them, in any case, has no relevance whatsoever to what their ""intent"" is. A woman gets an abortion. She might do it for any number of reasons. You claim she has murderous intent. You cannot prove this. You effectively claim to read her mind and punish her on that basis. The fact she has someone assist her in her abortion in no way helps you determine her intent. Even if you could determine her intent it would be unjust to punish her on the basis of it. This is what is called - thought crime. And you are violating the right to live of every African every time one of them dies you could have saved. In other words, we are expected to, on the basis of your mind-reading abilities, punish all women who have abortions.","Cone","110637","It goes without saying that a coathanger is an outside resource. I do not claim murderous intent, I claim fundamental violation of the right to live of an innocent human person. Suppose Frank grabs an oozie and starts shooting it into a large crowd killing 5 people. Frank simply wanted to shoot his gun, but the unfortunate and definite side effect was that 5 people were killed. What should we do with Frank? 1) if we know Frank's intent was to kill these 5 people, can we justly punish him on this basis? 2) if we know Frank's intent was only to shoot his gun, not harm anybody, can we justly punish Frank in any manner. Afterall, he did not intend such adverse affects of his actions. 3) if we don't know anything of Frank's intent, what are we to do? Violated their right to live? Tell me Symbiote, how have I done this? I never said anything about punishing women.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","11:03 PM","abortion-debates","244"
"04-22-2005","4699",17,"Symbiote","None","Aid means assistance. Help. It implies another person working with her. Don't be facetious. If you can't hold a position without pretending you held a different position a moment before, maybe you shouldn't hold it. A resource is not aid. Frank actively killed these people. You have successfully shown intent is irrelevant. Fortunately I have no reliance on intent, though I think I misread you as taking it into account. If we grant that a fetus is a person, cutting a fetus off from your body is like refusing to supply a starving African with food. If we grant that a fetus is a ""person"", stabbing a fetus through the head with a nail is like stabbing a starving African through the head with a nail. It is murder. See the difference? All the examples you can provide of murder involve active killing - not refusing to supply a resource you own.","Cone","110665","Simply a typo on my part. If you'll kindly read this post I think it will be evident that I meant resource, not aid. I view abortion as an action that results in the killing of a fetus, ie, actively killing the fetus. No, cutting a fetus from the body is to actively remove it from the life-sustaining resources it is already utilizing. You may argue it has no right to be utilizing these resources, but cutting the fetus from the body is not refusing to supply it with these resources, it is actively removing it from these resources. This is why I say that I'd like to see a woman refuse her resources to a fetus without any outside resource/help/aid. If she could do this, then she would be refusing to supply a resource she owns. Otherwise, she is actively removing the fetus from the life-sustaining resource it is utilizing. I obviously agree with this one Not to be picky, but I think you're going to need to define ""active killing.""","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","12:02 AM","abortion-debates","246"
"04-22-2005","4699",17,"Steeeeve","None","Your right to life doesn't say you have free healthcare and it doesnt say you get a kidney if you are dieing and it doesn't force people to give blood.","Linus","110667","Of course it doesntbecause the right to life isnt superceding of all others. The right to conduct businesses will outweigh it, the right to own property fairly will outweigh it, the right to your own flesh and blood will outweigh it and etc..

"04-22-2005","4699",17,"Cone","None","But they can't express this will now Just because they had it before, doesn't mean they have it now. If a person intentionally overdoses, thereby showing their intent to die, is it an offense against that person if medical personel to give life-preserving care to that person? How can a one day old infant have/express an interest to live? Having the capability is not the same as actually having it. Let me show you. A fetus has the capability to have an interest in life. Should we then conclude that it would offend the fetus to end its life?","Linus","110677","But they have expressed it before. Are expressions to be only followed and respected by others if they are constantly implied then? Goodness, if so, then are legal system is in real trouble because apparently I didnt get my hourly update that theft is still a crime. Then the burden of proof would be on you to support this. Not the person within a coma. If a person wants to die then let them. People make the choice to alter the way theyll live anyways so why stop now? How can it not? An infant has the ability to cherish does it not? If an infant can make emotional attachments to a mother then why not life? No, a fetus has the future possibility (not the absolute) of attaining an interest if it gestates long enough to develop such a feature. But if the fetus is somehow miscarried - whether by the aid of a doctor or natural circumstances - it will never have this ability; an ability it never had in the first place. Now tell me thiscan you take something away from something that never had it to begin with? So are you suggesting abortion would offend the fetus then? If so can you provide proof of this?","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","12:29 AM","abortion-debates","249"

This does not answer my question. Is it an offense against a person trying to commit suicide if medical personnell offer life-sustaining care to that person until they recover? What is the difference between a one day old infant, and a fetus who will be born in one day? How do we determine if such an interest to live exists? I believe the unborn has the fundamental right to life from conception. As such, abortion is in violation of its fundamental right to continue existing.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","12:39 AM","abortion-debates","250"
"04-23-2005","4699",17,"Symbiote","None","You let a bum into your kitchen, to eat your food. Or maybe he sneaks in without you realising. Either way, you get home, find him there, decide what you're going to do, and make him leave. ""Actively removing him"" from the resources he was living on. Later, he dies of starvation. Have you murdered him? In my view, no, you have not, since the resources you have removed him from were not his to begin with. Now if you went out and stole someone else's food and they died, that would be murder, or at least manslaughter. Similarly, a fetus does not own its' mother's body. To consistently apply a ""right to life"" even this narrowly, you have to agree that any hobo who moves into your house has a right to continue living off you, forever. In which case, please provide me with your address.","Cone","111132","No, not forever, but maybe until he can sustain himself. If someone shows up at my doorstep about to die from starvation (by about, I mean he would certainly die if he were to try to go elsewhere), then in my view I have an obligation to do what I can to help him, i.e. feed him, etc. The presence of a fetus in the womb in no way implies that the fetus owns the mother's body.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","12:36 AM","abortion-debates","252"
