Why can't people just understand the truth? Could it be that these people walk through life in complete darkness, and will never recognize the truth? It is my opinion that folks who think that killing un-born children is a healthy activity are completely blinded to the truth that God has provided to the entire world and are headed straight to Hell.

"04-13-2005","4699",13,"zachvac","None","There are 2 meanings of the word wrong. One is not subjective. If I said 1+1=3 I would be wrong. If I said the Earth was flat I would be wrong. If you say slavery is universally wrong you are wrong. A subjective wrong has to do with morals. If you say slavery is morally wrong others can have different opinions and different morals that dictate what is wrong or right. Misusing a word isn't that bad, as long as you realize what you really mean and explain it. If I say all humans have claws, but I misused claw I meant hair, we would have a problem with communication. If you try to say something is universally morally wrong this is not true. yawn. So as Duo asked you before, how do you have a right if it isn't protected. You can argue semantics all you want, but your right isn't enforced without government. You can be killed and nothing will happen without government. Without government we can have abortions and with government we continue to allow abortions. So I would like to ask you a question. Where does your right to life come from? Where's your proof? I can claim I have a right to pee on your lawn, but it wouldn't hold up in court. and please don't say the founding fathers because where's their proof that it's a right? If they are there before government, please explain to me how rights came to be. I've already explained this above. You are using bad logic, but nothing is morally wrong with what you're doing. I didn't say anything about a law, I said right. And gays are fighting for a law, people are fighting for a law to protect fetuses. It's the same thing. But in a democracy all that matters is more than 1/2 think it is wrong and they can ban it (or 25% because of the stupid electoral college, but we won't get into that). People thought it was wrong so they made a law. Just as many people think restricting gays from getting married is wrong and just as people think abortions are wrong. I was refering to this: Where does it leave us? If morals are absolutely relative, where does it leave us? You have not explained this in the whole post.","Cone","107040","There you go again. Because wrong is subjective, wrong means nothing to me. You can try and draw distinctions between meanings of the word wrong, but because everything you say about wrongness is subjective, I cannot accept any such distinctions. There you go again. You say I'm wrong to claim that something is universally wrong. But because being wrong is subjective, I can't understand what you are saying. My right to life is endowed to me by the Creator. You say I've used bad logic (which I haven't). What's so bad about that? Just because there is diversity of opinion on an issue, it in no way follows that the issue has no right answer. If the nature of the word wrong is subjective, why bother arguing on a forum? Why bother trying to convince somebody they are wrong (as you have tried to do to me)? I can't relate to your personal moral standard, therefore when you say I'm wrong about anything, I cannot understand what you are saying. Who's to say being wrong is bad?

Basically there are no black and whites with morals. If you say killing is always wrong you obviously are against the death penalty, hunting, eating meat, etc. I don't like to kill, but there are areas when you have to: Food, protecting health. There aren't absolutes. There is no such thing as an absolute truth when dealing with morals and opinions. As soon as you define what it means for a right to exist (NOT to be enforced) I will answer. You seem to think that if you have a right the government must enforce it, and you claim you have that right but you can't prove it. A right isn't something concrete you can hold in your hand. and before humans there was much killing You want to bring this in? The law of gravity is being enforced as we speak. Nature enforces it. You can't violate the laws of gravity and thermodynamics and motion (all of which are actually theories by the way, same as evolution, just wanted to point that out). Obviously people can kill. Even these forces kill. Earthquakes kill all the time, people drown, people fall (even gravity can kill). I would define a right as something being enforced, but if you want to have a separate definition, fine. Just PLEASE tell me what it is. You're right, I can't tell you what Hitler did was wrong. But since humans are kind of fond of life they decided to agree not to kill each other. It isn't right or wrong, we just know if we do it nothing will stop someone else from doing it right back to us. Obviously they didn't make that agreement with fetuses. This is the same reason we kill other animals for sport and for food. There is no absolute right or wrong, we have just made the agreement to have our life, property, and freedoms protected but we give up the RIGHT to violate the life, property, and freedoms of others. Does that make since? This right existed before because we could kill people but now we don't have the right to do it because the government enforces it. Can I say I have the right to do whatever I want the government just doesn't enforce it? Of course not.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","06:51 PM","abortion-debates","185"

I didn't say what you were doing was morally wrong, I said it was just plain bad logic. Let me draw it out for you. You can't argue that my statement ""I am a person"" is wrong because it's true. You can argue if I say ""I am a good person."" because that is my opinion. Morals are just opinions. I can say that abortion is right and you say it's wrong. Neither of us is wrong, they are just opinions. I never claimed that your argument is immoral. I said that your logic was flawed. That has nothing to do with morals. No. The claim ""There are no moral absolutes"" is not a moral claim. It is a fact. Morality is subjective. No, the law is just one opinion of what is right or wrong. We decide to follow the moral code of the law, which is the accepted definition when talking about whether I can kill you or not. That is not absolute though. Many people think laws are wrong such as abortion being legal. Right now under the law it is moral to have an abortion. Does that mean abortions are morally right? No of course not, you have your separate opinion about what is right and wrong morally.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","10:23 PM","abortion-debates","189"
"04-15-2005","4699",13,"Cone","None","I claim that there is an absolute moral standard by which we can judge actions as either right or wrong. This is a claim about morality, actually more, this is a claim that states morality actually exists, and as such it is a moral claim. So what if a claim is true? Is being true a good or bad thing? Is being logical a good or a bad thing? Why argue logically to try and obtain truth when we can't know whether being true is a good thing or a bad thing? Thus, any claim can be turned into a moral claim. Why is there a need to point out that my logic is flawed? A claim about morality is a moral claim, especially a claim about the existence or non-existence of morality. If morality is subjective, answer me this: if we can't know whether something is right or wrong; good or bad, what basis do we have for making a law forbidding or allowing something? What basis do we have for actually following these laws? If we can't know right from wrong (or these things don't exist) how can we justly punish those who break laws? Why punish people for doing something that isn't wrong?","zachvac","107949","there's a difference between claims ABOUT morality and moral claims. One is commenting in general about morality, the other is saying that something is morally right, wrong, good, bad, etc. Sure, you can make the claim that making a true claim is morally bad. That's a subjective statement, or opinion. OK, if flawed logic is ok then I'll use some of my own. Proof: Given: The Earth is round, dogs are mamals. 1. Since the Earth is round, it must be that all animals like cheese 2. dogs like cheese 3. dogs are mamals (given) and I'm a mamal so I like cheese 4. Since my being here is supported by the Earth being round I'm right 5. Since you disagree with me you are wrong. Any problem with that? All it is is flawed logic. No it's not. If I said morals weren't moral (contradicting in itself, but you get the point) then it would be a moral claim. The claim that ""morals are opinion"" is not a moral claim. A moral is different based on each person, that's a fact. Therefor a moral must be subjective since different people have different morals. It's really bad that we've spent this long on something that should be common sense. These actions are wrong in the eyes of the law.
