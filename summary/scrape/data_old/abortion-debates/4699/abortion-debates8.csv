Says much about your argument, that you are unwilling to discuss rights in a natural state, while claiming they exist at the same time. hypocritical. The declartion is irrevelant because it does nothing. It didn't give anyone rights. It wasn't even practiced! You can say you have all the rights in the world, but until you enforce them, you have nothing. I ASK AGAIN. Does the ocean abide to your right to life as you slowly drown? ANSWER IT OR CONCEDE THE ARGUMENT My ability to drown in water does not mean that I don't have a right to live. I don't understand the argument.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","05:23 PM","abortion-debates","106"

"04-03-2005","4699",8,"chloe","None","So someone with terminal cancer has no right to life? I have an idea, lets just give them a leathal dose of morphine and save money for the country in the long run. Wow, just solved the social security problem! Or, we could just turn duo maxwell loose on them.","Duo_Maxwell","103933","No one has rights unless they are enforced. It's not a hard to understand. Why is it that you refuse to comment about the state of rights outside goverment?","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","05:32 PM","abortion-debates","110"
"04-03-2005","4699",8,"Duo_Maxwell","None","If your right existed, and was inalienable, then the ocean would abide to it. That obviously is not true.","Cone","103935","just because the ocean doesn't abide to my right to live doesn't mean I don't have that right in the same sense that just because a government doesn't abide to my right to live doesn't mean I don't have that right.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","05:36 PM","abortion-debates","111"

"04-03-2005","4699",8,"Steeeeve","None","also Clive, since this is about abortion, If government makes rights, then why did women fight for their ""right to do what they want to their bodies""? They don't have this right because government didn't give it to them. So why do they feel as if they are being wronged by not having this ""right""?","Clive14","103938","Don't know about your country, but here in mine those women were given that right. I'm slightly puzzled as to quite qhat it is you are trying to say here.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","05:38 PM","abortion-debates","114"
"04-03-2005","4699",8,"Cone","None","This is not what the Declaration of Independence says. If you don't agree with the Declaration of Independence, then you don't agree with the fundamental principles upon which the United States was founded.","zachvac","103939","The DOI was a couple of rebellious people who thought they would be hanged for treason. They weren't founding a country yet. The concepts of the United States are written in the Constitution, the DOI is a document of what they disliked about England.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","05:39 PM","abortion-debates","115"

The USA doesn't come into it. Please try to keep up.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","05:41 PM","abortion-debates","116"

"04-03-2005","4699",8,"Steeeeve","None","Sorry Clive, I forgot you are UK ....it doesn't matter though...Our country is founded on the idea that government doesn't give rights....this is partly why we broke off from you guys . Also, Clive, it is UNalienable rights...there is a difference.","Clive14","103951","Your country is founded upon the principal that settlers ought to be free to rule themselves rather than having a remote, ""nobility controlled"" government imposing its will upon you. ""Equal rights"" may have been talked about, but in reality they didn't happen for a long time after (when did women get the right to vote in the USA for example?) Is there? A quick peek at http://www.answers.com/unalienable&r=67 suggests the two words mean the same thing. If you wish to view them as separate though, then that's fine by me. I'll use ""unalienable"" henceforth.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","05:53 PM","abortion-debates","120"
