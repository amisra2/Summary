Isn't it interesting that your solution for the abortion issue demands that women deny their sexuality while permitting men to run the gamut of theirs. Does this attitude, of which you are not the only proponent, stem from a hatred or a fear of women?","poverty-pregnancy","07:43 AM","abortion-debates","8"

Is there a ghost of a chance that maybe men should keep their trousers zipped and a certain offending member contained therein?

Such a double standard would then make readers lose respect for your moral stance. 2) Even anticonceptive precautions fail ~1% of the time so responsible sexuality does not guarantee protection from an unwanted pregnancy. 3) If, either through irresponsible sexuality or bad luck of failed contraceptives, a woman gets an unwanted pregnancy, then the decision of whether or not she should be allowed to get an abortion should not depend on how she got pregnant but on general factors of rights of woman over her own body vs potential rights of the fetus. Indeed, if a woman did get pregnant through irresponsibility, then that would only ADD to the arguement of her getting an abortion since there would be a bigger risk of her being an irresponsible parent than if she simply got pregnant through bad luck of failed contraceptives.","poverty-pregnancy","05:56 PM","abortion-debates","13"
