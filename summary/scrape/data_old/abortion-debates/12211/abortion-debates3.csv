"01-14-2009","12211",3,"Steeeeve","340243","Actually I think we agree on the responsible options for handling an unwanted pregnancy. Basically we both feel that once a human is valued (I use value to mean something like it has a right to live) than the responsible thing to do is care for the baby until born. The difference seems to be what is valued (again I use that term very broadly). I think a human is always valued while you give value to some level of brain function.","Another opinion","340247","Yes, I would agree that we both do set limits on abortion rights once the human is valued. However, I would state my view as only valuing human bodies once there is a ""somebody"" in them. Since I view the core of the existence of people as their mental existence then, yes, in our current understanding of the source of mentality, that involves sufficient brain function. However, if one could prove to me that a mental existence could exist without brain function (ex. a soul) then brain function would be irrelevant. It is the mental existence I value - the mental existence that determines the existence (in my view) of a person. Brain function is secondary and important only in the sense that it achieves that mental function. Unless I have misunderstood your view all along, you value human bodies whether or not they have ""somebody home"" - it is the human life itself that you value, not any existing mentality.","poverty-pregnancy","04:51 PM","abortion-debates","31"

It is not enough to have an opinion without considering the consequences. And the consequences of abortion are just as relevant as the consequences of forced births. If you wish all fetus's to be forced into existence you must consider the outcome of this decision. Just as those who wish for abolishion of the death penalty should consider the consequences/repercussions of allowing such criminals to live. Everyone seems to skirt the issue of ""what happens to all these unwanted humans"", it seems the buck ends with the birth ... unacceptable I'm afraid. I have 2 words for that, ""social services"", spend a week with them and i guarantee you will start realizing the consequences of such opinions.","poverty-pregnancy","01:27 AM","abortion-debates","34"

Yeah....I doesn't make sense to debate abortion in the death penalty forum. ""Who cares for the baby"" after birth is largely irrelevant because nothing could be said that would justify abortion. If you are 80 and you have a mentally handicapped 1yr old, you don't get to argue that you can kill the 1yr old because ""who will take care of it when I die"".","poverty-pregnancy","10:18 AM","abortion-debates","37"
"01-15-2009","12211",3,"Another opinion","340130","A couple of points need to be made: 1) First, though I agree with you that people should act more responsibly where their sexuality is concerned, it should be pointed out that, as Simone implied, when you only criticize one partner, it does seem that you are presenting an illogical double standard of morality. Such a double standard would then make readers lose respect for your moral stance. 2) Even anticonceptive precautions fail ~1% of the time so responsible sexuality does not guarantee protection from an unwanted pregnancy. 3) If, either through irresponsible sexuality or bad luck of failed contraceptives, a woman gets an unwanted pregnancy, then the decision of whether or not she should be allowed to get an abortion should not depend on how she got pregnant but on general factors of rights of woman over her own body vs potential rights of the fetus. Indeed, if a woman did get pregnant through irresponsibility, then that would only ADD to the arguement of her getting an abortion since there would be a bigger risk of her being an irresponsible parent than if she simply got pregnant through bad luck of failed contraceptives.","simone","340359","Thank you, Another Opinion.

"01-15-2009","12211",3,"Winston Smith","340154","I wonder what pill that was, aspirin? Abstinence is the best contraceptive, after all sex is intended for procreation so abortion is going against a natural biological imperative. One doesn't see any animal apart from us having abortions. In other words abortion is an aberration from a Nature point of view.","simone","340361","Good! Let's start talking real loud about abstinence for men. Men are always seducing unwitting, I must add, stupid women into having sex. A man who tricks you, who lies to you is a total jerk. Unfortunately, there are a lot of these jerks running around. I have always managed to hang out with the non jerks.","poverty-pregnancy","03:17 PM","abortion-debates","39"

"01-19-2009","12211",3,"hollyh","340383","I was referring to your dismissal of the consequences for your position, not your choice of words. If you didnt get that i cannot help you. It is most certainly relevant! in every debate existing in this website consequences of decisions are being discussed. Try telling the pro gun advocates that there implied consequences for gun control is irrelevant. Or perhaps the anti gay marriage supporters have irrelevant arguments when discussing the believed consequences of its legalization. You are, like most (not all) pro-life members, ignorant of the consequence of your stance. Pro-lifers always skirt the issue of what happens to the baby apon birth. It is also interesting to note that on the same hand you are the very people who would refute a socialized health care system and have the poorer mothers and unwanted humans denied basic health care. If you cannot conceive or discuss the consequences of your stance then we have no debate.","Steeeeve","340772","My dismissal of the consequences doesn't make sense in the death penalty forum? I don't really post there so not sure what you mean. I'm not a mind reader so I guess you can't help me. What happens to the born child after birth is irrelevant to the discussion of abortion because there is no argument for something happening after birth that would make it ok. Don't change what I was saying. This is because it is irrelevant to the debate. It isn't a matter of ignorance. Another irrelevant point and a logical fallacy. No one has stated this on this thread. See Red Herring for more details. I can discuss consequences but this isn't what we are talking about. We are talking about what happens after birth and whether that is relevant. I am saying it is not because there is nothing that happens after birth that would matter as it relates to abortion.","poverty-pregnancy","12:05 AM","abortion-debates","42"
