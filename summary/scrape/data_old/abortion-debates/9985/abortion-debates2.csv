"06-09-2007","9985",2,"GrannyM","267472","In point of fact, the low birth rate in most of Europe is not due to the availablity of abortion, but to good sex education and the ready availablity of effective contraception to everyone who needs it. See this study, for instance: http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/PUB...heet/fsest.htm People have small families because they want small families. In point of fact, the abortion rate in Europe is generally much lower than the rate in the US, due, again, to education and contraception. Would you force folks to have children they don't want?","gman","267661","His point also addresses the intentional overpopulation for the purpose of overwhelming declining populations by Islam.","abortion-reason-europe-turning-arab","08:43 AM","abortion-debates","16"
"06-10-2007","9985",2,"chemist99a","267586","I fear that would lead to extermination of the women.","simone","267889","Nonsense! There are already a number of Islamic Feminist groups. And, quite frankly, the vast majority of Muslims are quite fond of their women and would be rabidly opposed to exterminating them.","abortion-reason-europe-turning-arab","11:18 AM","abortion-debates","17"

"06-10-2007","9985",2,"gman","267659","His point was criticism of people managing the numbers of their population with abortion. It also addresses the intentional overpopulation for the purpose of overwhelming declining populations.","simone","267897","I rather think that the incidence of abortion is far lower in Europe owing to their higher standards of sex education and access to contraception without the impeding hypocrisy of American religious culture.","abortion-reason-europe-turning-arab","11:23 AM","abortion-debates","19"
"06-10-2007","9985",2,"VTCruiser","267430","http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main...7/nfert107.xml Arab's birth rate - 7-10 kids Birth rate in UK - below 2.... And we wonder why it seems muslims are taking over the world... DUH !!! THEY care about life more than the ""free"" world.... I believe that one of the reasons we are dealing with terrorism in the world is because we are committing mass murder on babies in the womb... Need i say more...","Jo Bennett","267898","What the hell do arabs have to do with this? There are hardly any arabs (or even Brits of arabic descent) in the UK.","abortion-reason-europe-turning-arab","11:27 AM","abortion-debates","20"

In my case religion has nothing to do with my desire to stop slaughtering the effects of stupidity. It has to do with reverence for life and my overwhelming disrespect for people demanding ""rights"" as they snuff out the life of and disregard the rights of their victims. To add insult to injury, they not only demand the right to kill, they expect to be respected. Ha.","abortion-reason-europe-turning-arab","05:40 PM","abortion-debates","21"
"06-24-2007","9985",2,"Maz","270458","1. Simone is quite right...women will no longer breed to order according to the dictats of outdated religion. British Muslim women will follow at some point (many already are). 2. There are a few hothead extremists who sit on London street corners with placards stating that ""UK will be Islamic"", ""Sharia Law for UK"" etc. etc. But those nutters are ignored along with all the other (non-religious) nutters currently walking the streets of London. 3. Muslims are taking over' is a poor excuse of a reason to be anti-abortion and shows desperation, IMO!","gman","270467","1. Simone may be right about women choosing not to breed to order. Perfectly acceptable attitude. I doubt it has anything to do with dictates of religion. Which by the way, religion is different than belief and faith and reverence for life and the latter will never be outdated. 2. Sharia law is a reality where Muslims are a majority. Something to be kept in the forefront of the minds of secular progressives. 3.No reason is a poor excuse and desperation is a perfectly reasonable emotion when discussing the use of death as a tool of birth control.","abortion-reason-europe-turning-arab","10:07 AM","abortion-debates","23"

People have picked and choosed the people they cry over ever since time began. Hypocrisy is as old as religion. Sharia law is a reality where Muslims are the majority, yes. Why? Because Sharia law is Muslim law. What's your point? Western Muslim women will slowly and gradually realise their own individual rights. Its already beginning to happen. They are not going to continually have 7-10 children for the next five generations. Stop being so scared of people who think differently to you. Like I said, fear of minority communities ""taking over the world"" lol is a feeble excuse to take away a woman's right to choose. What individual women do with their own bodies is of no concern to you.","abortion-reason-europe-turning-arab","11:23 AM","abortion-debates","24"

Hypocricy is not isolated to religion. 2. So, you think western morality will seep into the land of Allah and empower women to break their shackles? Fear? You think I fear Muslims? No, it is ""you"" that I fear. You, who will kill even a helpless, defenseless, dependent being for the power to proclaim your greatness as ""woman"". 3. It's not my business what women do with their bodies that I have a problem with. I believe in legal prostitution. The body of a woman ""is"" hers to use or sell as she sees fit. But, I speak of the victims who become dead bodies to accommodate their rights. Rights over one's body are perfectly legit so long as one body is in question.","abortion-reason-europe-turning-arab","09:14 PM","abortion-debates","25"

You think I fear Muslims? gman But it is a worthy thread because of the reality that Islam ""is"" closing in on what we consider ""the free world"". If you love your freedom and the choices you now have, you should pay attention to Islam. They are consumed with a hatred for the west and are dedicated to their cause. Symbiote declares this the worst thread ever. It is unpleasant, but, Islam will not be denied. The numbers Cruiser provided mean a lot. Especially to progressives. ""Rights over one's body are perfectly legit so long as one body is in question""","Maz","271076","Hmmmm, yes ... your posts in this thread reeks of fear of Muslims. Yet, you fear me? Why? I've never had an abortion. I never will have an abortion, so why fear me? Actually, don't answer that. I think I already know the answer .... OMG I'm a bayyyybeeeeeeeeee killer Besides, you invoked the ""oh my god, everyone, look! the Muslims are breeeding, heaven help us"" fear into the debate, not me. So in reality you actually only ""fear"" legal abortion because you are scared that Muslims are going to take over the world lol And you are perfectly entitled to beleive that. But millions of other people don't agree with you. Which is why we have legal abortion","abortion-reason-europe-turning-arab","06:37 PM","abortion-debates","30"
