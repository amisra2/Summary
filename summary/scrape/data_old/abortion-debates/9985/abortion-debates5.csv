Yes - it is true that the rates are high in Eastern Europe, but recent also show that Eastern Europe has had the greatest decrease in abortions int the world in recent years - I think that is good.

During communist times, contraception was not always easily available - part of the bungled beaurocracy that kept many consummer products unavailable. Therefore, abortion was used far too often. The communist government seemed not to be significantly discouraging it. After communism fell and a new capitalism was introduced, then not only were contraceptives more easily available but the Catholic Church gained significant political influence and was able to essentially outlaw nearly all abortions. I cannot speak for other Eastern European countries, but some of the trends might have been similar.","abortion-reason-europe-turning-arab","10:02 AM","abortion-debates","62"

I am not saying its all the way fixed yet - but its an improvement. The stats do credit the availability of birth control being a huge contributing fact (as Another Opinion said). Solutions take time - and since half the abortions in the world are done illegally - criminalization will do little, if anything, to help.","abortion-reason-europe-turning-arab","12:15 PM","abortion-debates","63"

"03-28-2008","9985",5,"None","None","None","Existantia","306935","The reason we might be having 2.3 kids and Islamic countries is because women are given the right to choose abortion and have rights over their own bodies by law. In certain countries, women are overruled by law not to go out in public unattended, not to teach or have a job, and have no rights over their own body, but a man does. It's BS. The difference is, we are given a better sex ed than certain countries and that as women, it ISN'T our duty or only duty to be a baby machine. We are able to hold careers and be independent. (There are independent women within Arabic countries who are educated, who have careers of their own within these countries too, but they come from educated families and aren't as common place, perhaps.). I am not going to start having kids because of someone else's fear that we are being taken over by Islam. In fact there are many parallels between the fundamentalists there and the ones in the west. I, have been educated that I will have kids when I am damn well ready as a woman to take on that responsibility. That it is not my role, but my choice. No one else has the right to tell me what goes in and out of my body, but me. I think everyone deserves a right to choose their life.","abortion-reason-europe-turning-arab","02:44 PM","abortion-debates","67"

Because nowadays with their immigrant doles they find more comfortable rather doing nothing than working as labourers which those arrogant aliens conceder beneath their dignity or forbidden by their Allah. And that Allah is very strict guy. As soon as he sees that his subjects begin working hard he announces this activity abominable. But it is so tempting living in civilized country and stirring no finger for getting little money necessary for barely making ends meeting. As a result we have suburbs of our towns full of malcontent indigent Muslims prepared tore throat to every the least dressed properly European. The only thing to do is toughening control over Muslims living in Europe. If they want staying here they have to obey our laws and stop being burden and spongers. If their religion forbids them European way of life they should change their religion or adopt moderate Islam worked out by Europeans for Europe.","abortion-reason-europe-turning-arab","10:32 AM","abortion-debates","68"

It is difficult to believe that anyone would prefer to live a subsistence lifestyle based on welfare(dole) if they could achieve more affluence with proper employment. I think you underestimate what is involved with trying to ""jump in"" when you are constantly feeling judged unfairly and stereotyped. It takes time for both parties to find a middle way.

But it was right now that I got it at last. Those operations will take place not somewhere in a distant country but right here at territory of the US! I think that disgusting perspective we owe to our nutty officials unable to confine Muslims immigration to USA. Muslim newcomers are building new mosques and their communities are growing rapidly (partly due to rising figures of the native Americans converting into Islam). Im sure that our officials knew that most acts of terrorism occurred in USA are due to Muslim participation but in spite of it they are continuing to present all those shootings in broad daylight or explosions or other as just accidents caused by natural reasons! They hide the truth. In fact the guerilla warfare is being led by Muslims at the territory of USA and IMHO itll be on the rise in nearest future. I wonder why our top officials have been inactive and lying all the time! Theyve been preoccupied with Iraq and Afghanistan mainly and not caring about ordinary Americans personal safety! Sure this is huge error of Washington administration. Who will bear the responsibility I wonder.","abortion-reason-europe-turning-arab","10:09 AM","abortion-debates","72"

"05-23-2008","9985",5,"gman","267457","Your reasoning of the effects of abortion are correct. The liberals who see abortion as a normal, acceptable, right to choose abortion are aborting themselves into extinction. Reverence, and a love of life is not what motivates Muslims. The power of Islam is. There is nothing to indicate that Muslims ""love"" life. They'll cut your limbs or head off for nearly any reason. They'll remove your head with a hacksaw so to take the time for ""you"" the victim to enjoy the moment and to voice your opinion and video it for your family and countrymen to enjoy.","Shooterandproud","311642","How tolerant.
