"06-27-2007","9985",3,"Another opinion","271170","1. You have to be more specific. The militant Islamists view the West as encroaching on their Muslim civilization and accuse us of trying to destroy Islam. They view their actions as actions of defense of Islam. Many in the Muslim world support them based on this arguement of defense. If we would stop supporting Israel and pull out of engagement in the Middle East (not realistically achievable or even desirable from our point of view), then their main motivation and means of recruitment would be gone. It is only very fringe extreme groups that have any aspirations of forcing Islam on the rest of us through terrorism or military force. Most Muslims just want to live their lives in peace. About 2/3rds of Americans believe that abortion should be legal in the first trimester. I believe in Democracy where majority rules (assuming that people have the opportunity to get educated on both sides of the issue). 3. Do you believe that those 2/3rds of Americans should not get their way?","gman","271291","1. To be specific, I mean the ones who state it. Then, the ones who act on it. You make good points. I can see that they may view us as intrusive. However you'd be hard pressed to prove the intrusive part using immigration stats. I do believe that, like us, most common Muslim folks would simply like to be left to live their lives. 2. I don't believe that number. You have no way to prove it other than a poll taken where demographics favor the act. Which would likely be any large population. Or any left wing website where truth has little value. I believe in Democracy too. The issue should have been brought up on referendum at the time the supreme court ruled on it. The supreme court is to enforce and interpret law, not create it. Since it did not, I have stated in the past that I would not seek to have the decision reversed. But, only because the left would go wild and possibly tear our nation apart as that is the way they get their way. 3. If they exist, no. I do not respect their lack of reverence, nor them.

"07-01-2007","9985",3,"Another opinion","271386","1. The 66% number for people supporting the legality of first term abortions is from http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm - most of the way down the page. It comes from a CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll. Jan. 10-12, 2003. Surveying 1,002 adults nationwide - Margin of Error 3%. This is the most recent poll I know of which breaks up the question based on trimester. Last I heard, these organizations were not considered left wing. Indeed, I have heard many on the left consider CNN somewhat right wing. Anyway, you will also see that, in the poll, the majority of people view that second term abortions should be illegal, which goes against most pro-choice views. So, this is obviously not a left-wing biased result. 2. The constitutionality of an issue is not something that is decided by refurendum in this country. The constitution itself can be changed by popular vote electing representatives that can change it. As for the constitutionality of Roe vs Wade, you just happen to disagree with the decision so you call it ""creating laws"". I am sure you would not label court decisions in your favor as such. 3. If Roe vs Wade were overturned, there would be no ""tearing our nation apart"" but it would certainly politically mobilize the silent majority of pro-choice supporters that now take those rights for granted as being guaranteed by Roe vs Wade. You would be waking up a sleeping giant. On a last note, last year, I had a discussion on the Abortion forum with some Brits who said that, in Britain, once third trimester abortions were largely outlawed, a large part of the furvor died down regarding the abortion debate since there were few people who were adamant about pushing the law further. I hope that something similar happens here.","gman","271892","1. CNN is without question left wing. However, Gallup adds credence in my view. I do not consider it feasible that 1002 people could possibly represent the ideas of 260 million accurately. 2. Abortion is not mentioned in the constitution to my knowledge. Any ruling on it or any other issue not mentioned specifically is equivalent to creating laws. Therefore should be brought up on referendum or handled by the legislature. 3. I disagree concerning which side has a majority, but I can't prove it. That is why I would love for it to come up on referendum. Just to settle the issue. But, I must add that in my heart, I do not wish for a reversal. What I wish for is responsibility by people for their actions.

There are many things that are not specifically mentioned in the Constitution and that the Court has ruled on - in either direction (left or right). That is why the court exists in the first place - to interpret the Constitution for a given new situation. If the Constitution was clearly defined for all scenarios, then one would only need administrative clerks (or even only a computer nowadays) to make such a ruling - not well experienced and educated justices. 3. Most polls that I have seen (from pollingreport.com) show the pro-choice and pro-life side being close, but the pro-choice side slightly leading. However, the poll about first trimester abortions, and the situation that occurred in Britain, tell me that it is late term abortions which most concern people. That, along with my personal stance on abortion, is why I hope that we will have some reasonable law limiting third trimester abortions. That may finally put the issue mostly to rest. I think that is part of the reason why the right does not push for a law specifically outlawing third trimester abortions. Thy might well realize that this would spell the end of further pro-life movement.","gman","272040","I accept your absence of ""skew"" explanation. I would feel better if at least 1% of a population were polled. I have rarely seen a poll that question form was not used as a lead. But, the discussion concerning polls are irrelevant to me. I cannot alter my feelings about stopping the slaughter on what even a majority believes. 2. Then the court does not take it's job seriously enough. It should have created extremely tight parameters for the action of ending lives. Those parameters being only to save the endangered life of a mother who makes the choice or a consenting spouse or guardian if the mother is not capable. There is no other acceptable reason. 3.
