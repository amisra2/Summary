"12-16-2007","10685",5,"Archangel","294059","Uhh, these two statistics are posted above by both jito and me and answer that question perfectly. Don't you read the posts before asking for more evidence? You can thank jito for the link as she posted it above.","electrolyte","294098",""" Uhh ,"" I called bullchip on both of these. First, the fact that a woman who gets pregnant is young is not in any sense a valid indicator of being an unattached, barhopping slut. Second, saying that any reason besides rape/incest or health constitutes a ""social reason"" a.k.a. ""inconvenient or unwanted"" is a gross grouping of many issues, many of which aren't nearly as despicable as you'd like them to be. Don't you read my posts before just lying unabashedly about the topics that I cover? Of course, if you don't, that would explain a lot: you hardly ever respond to me, and you virtually never respond substantively to me, and you always fail to provide any actual counterargument or impeachment.","abortion-self-defense","06:19 PM","abortion-debates","61"

Archie, You still don't get that you and your ilk ARE the issue, do you? It is you and your ilk who continue to try to politicize the issue of abortion, which is perhaps the most private choice a woman can make. As for the women in my family, there is no more of a ""moral"" question involved in aborting or continuing a pregnancy than there would be in removing a burst appendix or a malignant tumor. We do wish that you and your ilk would practice your morality within your families and leave us alone to practice ours. Is that too much to ask?","abortion-self-defense","07:07 PM","abortion-debates","62"

And the saddest thing for me in what you say above is that your mother didn't consider you any more valuable than a tumor and have you removed as if you were a cancerous cyst. Your shallow perspective and empty World view makes me wish you could exerience first hand what you are so willing to impose on almost 2 million unborn babies each year. So don't expect me to coddle to your sick life perspective as you treat the unborn more like an unwanted infection rather than the precious new potential lives they are.","abortion-self-defense","07:16 PM","abortion-debates","63"

So neither can I allow millions of unborn babies get murdered annually by a bunch of misogynistic and narcissistic ego maniacal women without voicing both my opinion and my concern. And that is my right as a member of this Democracy and if that bothers you than all the better. If you think it's your God given right to murder the unborn and denigrate the natural gift women have to procreate then it's my God given right to defend them. And since they are human beings, it doesn't matter if they are your family members or not. Because if you consider them disposable human beings of no more value than tumors then they need protection from you because your soul is obviously dead anyway and you are a threat to any living thing that is too weak to defend itself from you.","abortion-self-defense","09:26 PM","abortion-debates","65"

My concern is that you have decided that anybody who supports an abortion is misogynistic, narcissistic, and ego maniacal. But then, I pointed that out about two dozen posts back, and you completely ignored me, as is standard for you. Ahh, the classic complex question fallacy. It's not murder, but that's how you have to spin it because you don't have any real arguments. Who is denigrating this ability? Only you, by regarding them merely as walking baby factories instead of people. We're pro- choice , not pro- abortion for everybody no matter what . Quit being such a dipstick and pretending that anybody is trying to make abortions mandatory... Keep ignoring me, Archie. I'm enjoying these free shots.","abortion-self-defense","09:46 PM","abortion-debates","66"
"12-17-2007","10685",5,"Archangel","293990","you really should read your link before posting it jito because it is calling you a liar. And supports precisely what I have been saying all along. None of these statistics support your contentions for why so many abortions occur and repeatedly by the same women. And if you'll notice the income level of those getting them, it is the higher income women who are getting the most abortions, so poverty isn't the reason for the majority of them. And besides, if you look at the number of teens getting abortions, that number correlates fine with the under 15,000 annual income level because most teenagers (20% statistic) don't even have jobs so of course they statistically would appear to be in poverty. But they aren't at all as they still live at home. You have accidently defeated yourself jito by actually posting an objective web site. One I didn't think even existed. But your own numbers show that the assumptions you make above are false and a corruption of reality according to your own link. Which I have re-posted for your convenience. Thanks for making my case for me.","jitobear","294150","You should have read it the first time I posted it when I was calling you on the idea that women are getting abortions becuase they are vain and don't want to give up partying. These stats still don't say that and they do not call me a liar. Nothing in here says that the same women are repeatably seeking abortion. The poverty number was a best guess based on those making less than 15K a year and a percentage of those in the next level up as $16k is not out of poverty. Its not objective. Its pro-life. Several of the links I posted were - you just didn't look as none them back up the orginal assertation you made. I didn't. You said women seek abortion because they are vain and don't want to give up partying. None of these stats indicate that. Secondly - as already pointed out to you - the 93% includes a lot of things - which were further broken down for you on other pro-life websites. (money, relationship issues/abuse, job, education, age, etc.) I have also noted your lack of response at the near 70% seeking abortions to be Christian.","abortion-self-defense","10:31 AM","abortion-debates","67"

One of the first things they teach in the Navy is never to whizz off the windward rail of the ship. It's time for us to stop discussing things on Archie's terms and just say once and for all that it's not our, his, or anyoe else's business why a woman chooses to trerminate a pregnancy. She owes no one an explanation, least of all a Profetallifer like Archie who just loves to meddle into others' private affairs.","abortion-self-defense","10:54 AM","abortion-debates","68"

I believe this can be acheived by changing the way we educate girls about men and by addressing the needs of pregnant women. As a woman who faced an unplanned pregnancy and as a mother Archie's stomping around on his high horse makes me angry. He claims to be acting in the interest of these fetuses, but he's not. I want him to know that - and if he really cares, I want him to change his tune and offer something of substance and help. One can be opposed to abortion and still recognize that these women are facing real tough choices - and you might actually do some good from that perspective. Being opposed to abortion by insulting millions of women with stereotypes, generalizations and trivializations serves nothing but his own damned ego.","abortion-self-defense","11:24 AM","abortion-debates","69"

(Stats on illegal abortion provide by the World Helath Organization.) That link below is the Guttmacher Institute that nearly all sites use (pro-choice and pro-life) for their stats. The lowest abortion rates are in Western Europe - where there are comprehensive social and health programs and abortion is legal. Also - the countries that showed the greatest decline were those where abortion is safe and legal. http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_IAW.html Stats clearly show that when women's needs are met and reproductive health is comprehensive abortion goes down - this is even evidenced between the Clinton and Bush years. Education, economics and resources make all the difference. (By the way Arch - the Guttmacher Institute also indicates that women in poverty are FOUR TIMES as likley to have an abortion as those who are not.) http://www.e-thepeople.org/article/3...e=best&skip=30 http://peacelovekindness.org/abortionQuestion.html","abortion-self-defense","02:09 PM","abortion-debates","71"

And if abortions were a rare alternative procedure which the laws regarding it say it should be, then you wouldn't have people like me screaming about almost 2 million babies a year being killed in the womb.
