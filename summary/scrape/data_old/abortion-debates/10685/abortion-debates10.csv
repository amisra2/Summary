"01-21-2008","10685",10,"Another opinion","None","The same arguement can be made against you. Namely, I think you would agree that the unfertilized egg does not have a mind. Nevertheless, you would presumably argue that miraculously at conception, a non-sentient being becomes a sentient being. I am confident that your answer to that puzzle is that you claim that a soul enters the body at conception and that it is in that soul that our sentience resides. I am curious, then. Do you deny that the brain has anything to do with our mind or our sentience?","Archangel","298242","I reposted my original post that you picked and edited minutia from to respond to so as to once again try to make me look stupid as you ignore the real evidence and the meat of my argument to Another opinion. Please notice the link that proves that the unborn have brain activity, and that they are in fact living, feeling, although not fully developed beings. I repost this so others can read again the points I was making and then read how you distorted and attempted to corrupt what I said through selective editing. Please reread my post electrolyte and attempt to respond to what I was actually saying, not to what you want to imply I was saying. An excellent question to consider Ao; I believe that life begins at conception, so yes, the soul is present long before self awareness is. Here is evidence that brain activity in fetuses is measurable and testable. http://www.uams.edu/today/2002/090602/fetal.htm And this value distinction plays out in life also as coma victims that show measurable brain activity are kept alive long enough for the body to heal and repair itself. They aren't just disconnected as if they are no longer alive. We have learned so much about basic human biology today that it is completely hypocritical for the pro abortionist to then deny that a fetus is alive and anything less than a developing full and complete human being from conception. The moment the egg is fertilized, life is then present and the child is then growing into a unique individual with all of the potential of everyone who will ever read this post. After all, at one time in each of our very lives, we were all in exactly the same place as that fetus we are now discussing. Talk about irrational hubris and arrogance that it takes to deny that fetus the same respect that we demand for ourselves as sentient beings when we know beyond any doubt at all that we started out exactly as they are now. I do deny that the brain has anything to do with our sentience as human beings. The brain is necessary to determine the quality of the lives we live in this body, but not that we are alive. For example, children are born with partial brains, or even no brains at all. The family might decide that no extraordinary efforts be made to keep such a baby alive, but if the baby survives once disconnected from life support, Neither the parents nor the hospital have the right to just kill it. That is evidence that according to our moral and ethical laws, life is not determined by ones ability to think.","abortion-self-defense","06:33 PM","abortion-debates","136"

It is the result of the reproductive act which has sustained and propagated the human species since Adam and Eve were created. Are you actually declaring that as you type your response to me that you were nothing more than a cancerous tumor while in your mothers womb? And if you were, then didn't you deserve to be destroyed by your mother getting chemo and radiation treatments to expunge you from her body? An abortion is far too unreliable a procedure to kill cancer because doctors know that you might not get it all with an operation. Are you unable to distinguish the difference between a tumor which if allowed to grow indefinitely will only result in a larger tumor, and a human fetus that if allowed to grow to term will result in a viable human being with the same hopes, dreams, desires and potential that you yourself possess?

That's the best you've got? That even though there is NO DOUBT that an unborn child is in fact a sentient being and not anything like a cancerous tumor you insist that it can still be killed like so much disease infested flesh just because it's a woman's right to kill their offspring? Great, nice debating the facts with you. The surely you agree with the fathers right to kill his child also if he decides he doesn't want the woman to force him to be a parent, right? I mean, you want to be fair to both parents right? The fetus has no rights but surely both parents have equal rights, right?","abortion-self-defense","11:05 PM","abortion-debates","142"
"01-22-2008","10685",10,"Archangel","298285","And my reason for posting that link along with my position is to show that even though children are born without brains, they are sentient beings in that they aren't taken outside and disposed of in a medical waste dumpster once their anencephalie is confirmed like a tumor is after it is removed and biopsied. But they are allowed to live until they die a natural death. They are treated with the same respect as a child born under any other circumstances and extreme measures are taken to insure they are respected and comforted. Does not a 15 week old fetus have its fingers and toes? Does it not have a nose and mouth? Is it not growing into a full and complete human being if allowed to grow unchecked by an abortion... ? based on this statement you insulted my knowledge of biology. So please tell me what about this statement is untrue. Especially in light of this link which proves that not only are unborn babies alive but that they have brain functions and activity. A premature baby was so young at birth that his nerve endings were so under developed that for 2 months no one could touch or handle him as the slightest touch was excruciatingly painful. So when the pro abortionists claim that the unborn feel no pain as they are being killed is in fact a complete deception as these infants feel more, and are even more sensitive to pain and stimulus than a fully developed baby is at term. To me this is just common sense though. But that's because I'm just too stupid to understand biology I guess.","electrolyte","298287","Non-sequitur. The fact that anencephalic children (sometimes) aren't treated like tumors is not an indicator that they are sentient. (Fetuses with genetic or developmental defects are often aborted.) Seriously, you need to look up what sentient means if you're going to keep using the word. 8) Stop relying on lies, frauds and hoaxes [and fallacies] But the examples in your second citation did have brains, so you cannot reasonably use them as as examples of children with no brains. Do you know what ""reasonably"" means? 8) Stop relying on lies, frauds and hoaxes [and fallacies] I take care of my property. I try to use it properly, maintain it, and prevent it from being damaged. I use it until it cannot continue to serve its function. Until that point, it is treated as I treat the majority of my other property. Is this because my property is sentient? Maybe I'm delusional and think that my property is sentient? 8) Stop relying on lies, frauds and hoaxes [and fallacies] Apparently you forgot this thread discussing a group of people showing off a dead anencephalic baby. So do chimp fetuses. Does that make chimp fetuses human beings? 8) Stop relying on lies, frauds and hoaxes [and fallacies] I'm not an embryologist, but: it doesn't have developed lungs, among plenty of other things. In fact, it is so underdeveloped that it cannot survive outside the womb. You mean does it have potential to be a human being ? Sure. But that's different than being a human being, isn't it? No, I based my statement on the reams of evidence you've provided about your lack of knowledge about biology. You don't understand genetics, you don't understand natural selection, you don't understand biochemical processes, you don't understand phylogenetic relationships through time... It's not an insult, it's a statement of fact. If you can prove me wrong by showing that you really understand how genetic material affects biochemical processes, be my guest. 10) Claiming to be an victim when you are losing I've told you three times what is untrue about your statement: a ""developing"" thing is not a ""full and complete"" thing. 7) Stop pretending that refutations of your posts don't exist 11) Claiming everyone is lying or distorting what you say Where did I deny that fetuses at some particular stage of development will have brain functions? 8) Stop relying on lies, frauds and hoaxes [and fallacies -- strawman] I never claimed that there were no fetuses that could feel pain. 8) Stop relying on lies, frauds and hoaxes [and fallacies -- strawman] What role did the prematurity of the baby's birth play in its sensitivity? Can you support your assertion that -- in general -- the unborn are more susceptible to pain than the born? Based on a spattering of fallacies and unsupported assertions? Perhaps. (You said it, not me.) But the real shame is not that you don't currently know much about biology, it's that you refuse to allow yourself to be educated about it.","abortion-self-defense","02:28 AM","abortion-debates","146"

Early fetuses and many coma patients do not show any of the higher brain activity. To clarify this point, I would compare it to a hypothetical computer where one has powered up all the transistors but one has not connected them sufficiently yet to have any real function. Without sufficient electrical connections, that computer may be ""on"" but it is not yet functioning - so measurements would show electrical activity but that electrical activity would not necessarily show actual function. The same goes for the higher level aspects of the brain. The brain develops in stages and neurologists agree that any higher brain function (outside of the basic functioning of the body - controlling heart beat, lung function, etc.) needs the type of neural connections that happen fairly late in the pregnancy in the section of the brain that deals with those higher brain functions. Unless one believes in the presence of a sentient soul, this means that the fetus cannot be sentient or have any level of mind until those later brain developments happen. I admit that I do find the concept of the soul appealing and haven't completely given up on it. However, I, personally, can have no confidence in an existence of a soul without evidence and the opposing evidence (where so much of our mental function and personality has been attributed to the physical brain) makes it hard to justify many claims one would like to make about the soul. Also, even if I allowed myself the belief in a soul, I would think it a cruel fate for a sentient soul to exist in such an underdeveloped body - something I would not attribute to a hypothetical benevolent God. I presume that the pro-life definition of the beginnings of life, if one defines it more exactly, would be defined as the first point at which a genetically unique life form exists that, if left to natural processes, will become someone like you and me. Given that definition, I doubt many pro-choice proponents would deny that. However, often, pro-life proponents treat those beginnings of life as a magical event in which something (a person) arises from nothing and they don't analyze in detail what actually happens. The question I so often ask pro-life proponents is: What are the key differences between a newly fertilized zygote and an unfertilized egg? The egg is, after all, alive. However: 1) The egg will never grow into you and me (people) without the critical step of fertilization, so it has a far smaller chance of becoming a persom. A zygote, however, has a much greater chance of eventually becoming a full person. It's potential is much larger. 2) The egg only has half the DNA. 3) If one believes in a soul entering at conception, then one could claim that sentience or a sense of mind exists in the zygote, where it does not exist in the egg. I suspect that it is the first point and the third point that are most critical for you - i.e. its potential, and a belief that something more than merely biological happens at fertilization that makes that zygote special whether or not it has the chance to grow into a full person. I think that the anger accompanying so many of the discussions / arguements about abortion does prevent many pro-choice proponents from expressing that many also value the potential of the zygote to become more. I, personally, do value that potential and agree that it is not the same as a non-sentient piece of flesh, mainly because of this potential. However, potential is not the only thing that one can value in contemplating the beginnings of an unwanted pregnancy. I know that you don't place much value in the rights of a woman to her own body, but those of us on the pro-choice side most definitely do, and that value outweighs the value we place on the potential of the zygote. After all, a zygote having potential of becoming like you and me is not the same as it being you and me. For many of us, it is the onset of sentience or some rudimentary sense of mind that determines the point where their value outweighs the value we place on a woman's right to her own body. I don't think that anyone denies that the zygote is alive. However, most of us would deny that it being alive means that it is sentient or has any mind. There is no biological reason to think that a zygote would have sentience or a mind. The only way one could believe that life means sentience is if one assumed a supernatural component to life beginning at the zygote stage - i.e. a soul.","abortion-self-defense","11:46 AM","abortion-debates","148"

My only reason for originally posting info on children born without brains was to show how they were treated by the medical professionals who had to care for them based on the legal and social norms we live by in this Society. I showed that we don't just dispose of brain dead people as we dispose of tumors. That we treat them with respect and don't kill them but allow them to die a natural death. In response, electrlyte posted a story how an anencephalic child born in a Country I have never even heard of paraded one down the street as if that proves something about how our Society treats them. Remember that the link I posted in making the point I did regarding the soul and sentience of the child was the link that showed normally developing fetuses that show brain functions and activity that directly refutes the pro-abortionists claims that the unborn children who face abortion are not like us in that they have no brain functions nor can they feel pain. My problem here is that for every point i make that proves the unborn are miniatures of us, someone changes the boundaries of the debate and attempts to redefine the arguments being made. Yes, and to be clear; I am saying that takes place at conception. At that moment life is present and the growth process has begun. Actually, in most debates, it's your side that speaks to a magical event when life begins. It is they who insist that a second trimester fetus is NOT ALIVE, yet a third trimester fetus is miraculously some how all of a sudden ALIVE. That argument is ridiculous. Correct. I have never claimed that the egg or the sperm by itself is a living being. It is only a fertilized egg that grows into a person, so that is the only subject I am discussing here. I am clearly saying that a child in the womb that is developing normally has every potential to become what we are and that is a life worth protecting. It is in no way a non living person. And because it has been shown that 25 and 30 week old fetuses have brain activity then they have proven their human potential, and that if allowed to grow to term they will inevitably be just like you and me. I would agree with this statement. If left alone, will the unfertilized egg grow in the womb and become a life? or will it get washed away with the next menstrual cycle? So you see, that question takes care of itself as the egg by itself, never grows into a living being. This paragraph may very well define the crux of the issue separating our two sides from every being able to compromise a solution. The pro-choice side gives credence to the mother's rights as supreme at the baby's expense. The pro-lifers believe that the mother made her choice as an adult by being irresponsible and that the innocent child shouldn't be made to pay for her irresponsibility with his life. I have always said that in the cases of moms health, rape or incest, a choice to abort needs to be available to the mother. But I reject abortion as a form of birth control which makes up the vast majority of them per year in America. You see I disagree with this summary of what defines a fetus as sentient. If we accept your definition of sentient, it could successfully be argued that if I chose to kill anyone I wanted to kill while they were in REM SLEEP, then it isn't murder because they are unconscious, unaware of their surroundings and lacking an reason or common sense because they have no mind to speak of at all at that time. Of course you would argue that all we must do is wake them up to make them sentient, right? Well, my argument is that all we must do is allow that fetus to grow to term uninterrupted and he too will be sentient. How can we not respect the human dignity and potential of our most helpless and defenseless demographic simply because they are unable to speak for themselves, and choose in favor of the women who are the reason this so called problem exists in the first place. Shouldn't the culpable party be given the most responsibility for correcting the problem they caused by their own actions? Why should the new life be sacrificed when its potential is equal to that of every other human being who is allowed to live?","abortion-self-defense","01:51 PM","abortion-debates","149"
