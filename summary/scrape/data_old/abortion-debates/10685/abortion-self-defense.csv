"12-10-2007","10685",1,"None","None","None","Iuris","293270","Well, not quite self defense, but a similar institute, I'm not sure what it's called in english, but approximately ""dire need"" would be a possible translation. Self defense means that an otherwise illegal action made legar when used in defense against an unlawful attack. ""Dire need"" is similar, except a bit more limited. In our legal system, the distinction is that with dire need, the prevented harm must be greater than the inflicted harm. As example, a starving man could not be punished for stealing food to prevent his own death, if he has not caused the starvation. Applying this to abortion is, of course a more complex issue. By the rule, no doctor could be prosecuted for aborting in case the pregnancy threatens the woman's life, for example.","abortion-self-defense","03:12 AM","abortion-debates","2"

It's true that abortion cannot be covered by self defense - because self defense is a specific instrument requiring an attack, something the foetus is not likely to be able to pull off.

That is especially true in pregnancy. Of course a fetus does not intend to harm. (Frankly one lacks the ability to intend anything until well after their first birthday.)

From web searching, I have seen some definitions of self-defense that include a requirement of intent, and others that don't. So, I am not sure of the legal structure. There are occasional examples in real life of people who can cause harm without intending to. An example I saw from a internet forum was of a man who was being shot at by a hunter who thought, from that far distance, that he was an aniimal. In those cases, one usually can resort to other methods to stop the harm being done. The case of self defense in abortion in unique for many reasons. First, one cannot exactly warn the fetus to tell it to stop harming you. There are very few options for stopping the threat to the woman's life or health other than abortion. Presumably, in threats that happen at a very late stage of pregnancy, premature birth or ceasarean section would be an option, but often times it is not (loss of blood would be much too risky). So, abortion is the only self-defense choice in many of these situations. Also, in barely any other situation I can think of (except for conjoined twins) is the other being imposing itself in on the life of another in so inextricable a way. Yes, the late-term potentially-mentally-existing fetus is innocent in that it intends no harm, but that does not mean that it will not cause harm. I think it should be the choice of the woman whether or not to sacrifice her life or major health for the fetus that she is already making the sacrifice in carrying. I can admire those who make major sacrifices of themselves for others, but I don't think that it should be made into law for them to do so.","abortion-self-defense","10:53 AM","abortion-debates","7"

But if the mothers life is threatened by the pregnancy, I as a pro-life advocate would never condemn that ""early term abortion"" from taking place. A pregnancy should not equate to a death penalty. It's the wholesale destruction of life which makes up the majority of the abortions that take place each year so women either wont be inconvenienced by the pregnancy, or because they don't want to change their partying lifestyle yet, or because they don't want their bodies to go through the permanent changes women's bodies go through due to child birth such as wider hips, a stomach ponch and sagging breasts. Vanity is one of the main motivators of abortions by todays American women, whether they admit it or not. They know in their hearts that is true in more than 90% of all abortions. Statistically, under 3% of all abortions are due to the health of the woman being threatened, and many of those are more for justification rather than true threats to her health.","abortion-self-defense","11:08 AM","abortion-debates","8"

However, the claim that all other abortions are carried out because women are partying or vain is vile, insulting, false and one of the worst examples of misogyny I have seen in a long, long while. (Pity whatever fool of a woman ends up or ended up with you.) Granted - this is typical of a lifer who really cares not a whit about women or children - only in maintaining their supposed moral superiority. There are lots of reasons women abort - you can help by trying to address them or you can generalize, trivialize and insult.

I said that all of them were valid and important issues that I cared about, about 8 in total. She responded that I was allowed to pick as many as 3 issues that I cared about but the program didn't allow for me to pick all of them.

But since when are they the real reason that motivates the woman. Last night I got a call from a Political Surveyor who asked me multiple questions regarding this election cycle. One set of questions were about what issues were most important to me regarding the Presidential election. I said that all of them were valid and important issues that I cared about, about 8 in total. She responded that I was allowed to pick as many as 3 issues that I cared about but the program didn't allow for me to pick all of them. So it is with the questionnaires every woman who gets an abortion must fill out. They have questions about why they are seeking it but not one option is to prevent wide hips, sagging boobs, a ponch stomach or not ready to stop partying, drinking or drugging. Those options aren't even made available to choose as the real reasons why women abort their babies so in your World, they don't even exist.

How many benefits do atheists get in prison compared to men who want out of their cells for bible studies, church services and worship services. The Christians also have access to special programs that lead to early release and community service points that lead to early release. And as the coup de graux, how many convicts want to go before the parole board labeled as godless heathens who don't even believe in God? NONE OF THEM, THAT'S HOW MANY. So like typical atheists and the smart criminals they are, they lie like hell and call themselves christians who just made a mistake. Well, you can be sure that if we could get a thousand of these so called christians here for a Poll, they would relate a lot better with you atheists than they would with me. And so it is with the questionnaires of abortion clinics. The questions on it are designed to manipulate the outcome to appear as innocent and morally right as possible.

UNITED STATES Number of abortions per year: 1.37 Million (1996) Number of abortions per day: Approximately 3,700 Who's having abortions (age)? ]52% of women obtaining abortions in the U.S. are younger than 25: Women aged 20-24 obtain 32% of all abortions; Teenagers obtain 20% girls under 15 account for 1.2%. Why women have abortions 1% of all abortions occur because of rape or incest; 6% of abortions occur because of potential health problems regarding either the mother or child, and 93% of all abortions occur for social reasons (i.e. the child is unwanted or inconvenient). having abortions (income)? Women with family incomes less than $15,000 obtain 28.7% of all abortions; Women with family incomes between $15,000 and $29,999 obtain 19.5%; Women with family incomes between $30,000 and $59,999 obtain 38.0%; Women with family incomes over $60,000 obtain 13.8%. Likelihood of abortion: estimated 43% of all women will have at least 1 abortion by the time they are 45 years old. 47% of all abortions are performed on women who have had at least one previous abortion. None of these statistics support your contentions for why so many abortions occur and repeatedly by the same women. And if you'll notice the income level of those getting them, it is the higher income women who are getting the most abortions, so poverty isn't the reason for the majority of them. And besides, if you look at the number of teens getting abortions, that number correlates fine with the under 15,000 annual income level because most teenagers (20% statistic) don't even have jobs so of course they statistically would appear to be in poverty.

I've said it for years, and I'll say it again here: Imagine if all of the money that goes into obligatory Christmas gifts, cards, and decorations, into donations to the already disgustingly and wastefully wealthy faux-charity organizations, and into contributions to unneeded, egotistical projects went toward things like helping the hungry or the homeless, or promoting education.

Can you prove or show how a life form no more complex than a fungus miraculously becomes a sentient being as all of the people on this forum are now in the last trimester of pregnancy?

And on and on? Did you just go to sleep one night and wake up the next morning in a different stage of life? I think not. You grew and developed and went from stage to stage. So how can you treat the development an unborn child goes from conception to birth is any different a growth and development process than any other stage of growth we experience in life? It makes no sense at all shooter. Now regarding this charitable giving; talk about a sweeping generalization designed to condemn a whole segment of Society! How unfair and inaccurate you are to boot. Here is some evidence that proves that conservatives out give liberals on all counts with pretty conclusive and sweeping evidence. http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=2682730 Sioux Falls vs. San Francisco We assume the rich give more than the middle class, the middle class more than the poor. I've heard liberals care more about the less fortunate, so we assume they give more than conservatives do. Are these assumptions truth, or myth? To test what types of people give more, ""20/20"" went to two very different parts of the country, with contrasting populations: Sioux Falls, S.D. and San Francisco, Calif. The Salvation Army set up buckets at the busiest locations in each city -- Macy's in San Francisco and Wal-Mart in Sioux Falls. Which bucket collected more money? Sioux Falls is rural and religious; half of the population goes to church every week.

Early fetuses and many coma patients do not show any of the higher brain activity. To clarify this point, I would compare it to a hypothetical computer where one has powered up all the transistors but one has not connected them sufficiently yet to have any real function. Without sufficient electrical connections, that computer may be ""on"" but it is not yet functioning - so measurements would show electrical activity but that electrical activity would not necessarily show actual function. The same goes for the higher level aspects of the brain. The brain develops in stages and neurologists agree that any higher brain function (outside of the basic functioning of the body - controlling heart beat, lung function, etc.) needs the type of neural connections that happen fairly late in the pregnancy in the section of the brain that deals with those higher brain functions. Unless one believes in the presence of a sentient soul, this means that the fetus cannot be sentient or have any level of mind until those later brain developments happen. I admit that I do find the concept of the soul appealing and haven't completely given up on it. However, I, personally, can have no confidence in an existence of a soul without evidence and the opposing evidence (where so much of our mental function and personality has been attributed to the physical brain) makes it hard to justify many claims one would like to make about the soul. Also, even if I allowed myself the belief in a soul, I would think it a cruel fate for a sentient soul to exist in such an underdeveloped body - something I would not attribute to a hypothetical benevolent God. I presume that the pro-life definition of the beginnings of life, if one defines it more exactly, would be defined as the first point at which a genetically unique life form exists that, if left to natural processes, will become someone like you and me. Given that definition, I doubt many pro-choice proponents would deny that. However, often, pro-life proponents treat those beginnings of life as a magical event in which something (a person) arises from nothing and they don't analyze in detail what actually happens. The question I so often ask pro-life proponents is: What are the key differences between a newly fertilized zygote and an unfertilized egg? The egg is, after all, alive. However: 1) The egg will never grow into you and me (people) without the critical step of fertilization, so it has a far smaller chance of becoming a persom. A zygote, however, has a much greater chance of eventually becoming a full person. It's potential is much larger. 2) The egg only has half the DNA. 3) If one believes in a soul entering at conception, then one could claim that sentience or a sense of mind exists in the zygote, where it does not exist in the egg. I suspect that it is the first point and the third point that are most critical for you - i.e. its potential, and a belief that something more than merely biological happens at fertilization that makes that zygote special whether or not it has the chance to grow into a full person. I think that the anger accompanying so many of the discussions / arguements about abortion does prevent many pro-choice proponents from expressing that many also value the potential of the zygote to become more. I, personally, do value that potential and agree that it is not the same as a non-sentient piece of flesh, mainly because of this potential. However, potential is not the only thing that one can value in contemplating the beginnings of an unwanted pregnancy. I know that you don't place much value in the rights of a woman to her own body, but those of us on the pro-choice side most definitely do, and that value outweighs the value we place on the potential of the zygote. After all, a zygote having potential of becoming like you and me is not the same as it being you and me. For many of us, it is the onset of sentience or some rudimentary sense of mind that determines the point where their value outweighs the value we place on a woman's right to her own body. I don't think that anyone denies that the zygote is alive. However, most of us would deny that it being alive means that it is sentient or has any mind. There is no biological reason to think that a zygote would have sentience or a mind. The only way one could believe that life means sentience is if one assumed a supernatural component to life beginning at the zygote stage - i.e. a soul.","abortion-self-defense","11:46 AM","abortion-debates","148"

However, I, personally, can have no confidence in an existence of a soul without evidence and the opposing evidence (where so much of our mental function and personality has been attributed to the physical brain) makes it hard to justify many claims one would like to make about the soul. Also, even if I allowed myself the belief in a soul, I would think it a cruel fate for a sentient soul to exist in such an underdeveloped body - something I would not attribute to a hypothetical benevolent God. I presume that the pro-life definition of the beginnings of life, if one defines it more exactly, would be defined as the first point at which a genetically unique life form exists that, if left to natural processes, will become someone like you and me. Given that definition, I doubt many pro-choice proponents would deny that. However, often, pro-life proponents treat those beginnings of life as a magical event in which something (a person) arises from nothing and they don't analyze in detail what actually happens. The question I so often ask pro-life proponents is: What are the key differences between a newly fertilized zygote and an unfertilized egg? The egg is, after all, alive. However: 1) The egg will never grow into you and me (people) without the critical step of fertilization, so it has a far smaller chance of becoming a persom. A zygote, however, has a much greater chance of eventually becoming a full person. It's potential is much larger. 2) The egg only has half the DNA. 3) If one believes in a soul entering at conception, then one could claim that sentience or a sense of mind exists in the zygote, where it does not exist in the egg. I think that the anger accompanying so many of the discussions / arguements about abortion does prevent many pro-choice proponents from expressing that many also value the potential of the zygote to become more. I, personally, do value that potential and agree that it is not the same as a non-sentient piece of flesh, mainly because of this potential. However, potential is not the only thing that one can value in contemplating the beginnings of an unwanted pregnancy. I know that you don't place much value in the rights of a woman to her own body, but those of us on the pro-choice side most definitely do, and that value outweighs the value we place on the potential of the zygote. After all, a zygote having potential of becoming like you and me is not the same as it being you and me. For many of us, it is the onset of sentience or some rudimentary sense of mind that determines the point where their value outweighs the value we place on a woman's right to her own body. I don't think that anyone denies that the zygote is alive. However, most of us would deny that it being alive means that it is sentient or has any mind. There is no biological reason to think that a zygote would have sentience or a mind. The only way one could believe that life means sentience is if one assumed a supernatural component to life beginning at the zygote stage - i.e. a soul.","Archangel","298334","Hi Ao, What you must never do is read electrolytes interpretation of what I say before responding because you will get the wrong idea of the point I was making. My only reason for originally posting info on children born without brains was to show how they were treated by the medical professionals who had to care for them based on the legal and social norms we live by in this Society. I showed that we don't just dispose of brain dead people as we dispose of tumors. That we treat them with respect and don't kill them but allow them to die a natural death. In response, electrlyte posted a story how an anencephalic child born in a Country I have never even heard of paraded one down the street as if that proves something about how our Society treats them. Remember that the link I posted in making the point I did regarding the soul and sentience of the child was the link that showed normally developing fetuses that show brain functions and activity that directly refutes the pro-abortionists claims that the unborn children who face abortion are not like us in that they have no brain functions nor can they feel pain. My problem here is that for every point i make that proves the unborn are miniatures of us, someone changes the boundaries of the debate and attempts to redefine the arguments being made. Yes, and to be clear; I am saying that takes place at conception. At that moment life is present and the growth process has begun. Actually, in most debates, it's your side that speaks to a magical event when life begins. It is they who insist that a second trimester fetus is NOT ALIVE, yet a third trimester fetus is miraculously some how all of a sudden ALIVE. That argument is ridiculous. Correct. I have never claimed that the egg or the sperm by itself is a living being. It is only a fertilized egg that grows into a person, so that is the only subject I am discussing here. I am clearly saying that a child in the womb that is developing normally has every potential to become what we are and that is a life worth protecting. It is in no way a non living person. And because it has been shown that 25 and 30 week old fetuses have brain activity then they have proven their human potential, and that if allowed to grow to term they will inevitably be just like you and me. I would agree with this statement. If left alone, will the unfertilized egg grow in the womb and become a life? or will it get washed away with the next menstrual cycle? So you see, that question takes care of itself as the egg by itself, never grows into a living being. This paragraph may very well define the crux of the issue separating our two sides from every being able to compromise a solution. The pro-choice side gives credence to the mother's rights as supreme at the baby's expense. The pro-lifers believe that the mother made her choice as an adult by being irresponsible and that the innocent child shouldn't be made to pay for her irresponsibility with his life. I have always said that in the cases of moms health, rape or incest, a choice to abort needs to be available to the mother. But I reject abortion as a form of birth control which makes up the vast majority of them per year in America. You see I disagree with this summary of what defines a fetus as sentient. If we accept your definition of sentient, it could successfully be argued that if I chose to kill anyone I wanted to kill while they were in REM SLEEP, then it isn't murder because they are unconscious, unaware of their surroundings and lacking an reason or common sense because they have no mind to speak of at all at that time. Of course you would argue that all we must do is wake them up to make them sentient, right? Well, my argument is that all we must do is allow that fetus to grow to term uninterrupted and he too will be sentient. How can we not respect the human dignity and potential of our most helpless and defenseless demographic simply because they are unable to speak for themselves, and choose in favor of the women who are the reason this so called problem exists in the first place. Shouldn't the culpable party be given the most responsibility for correcting the problem they caused by their own actions? Why should the new life be sacrificed when its potential is equal to that of every other human being who is allowed to live?","abortion-self-defense","01:51 PM","abortion-debates","149"

The main difference in our outlook is how we look at what the zygote or early fetus is AT THAT MOMENT, not counting potential for what it will become in the future. I suspect that your belief in a soul residing in the zygote or early fetus makes you automatically attach certain aspects to it without even realising that it is because of the belief in that soul that you attach those aspects. The main aspect is the idea that there is ""somebody home"" in that zygote or early embryo - that it is not just a body, but an early version of a person in there. I think that that is the reason that you use words such as ""innocent"" and ""justice"". Again, you must remember that, for those of us who do not share your belief in a soul residing in the early fetus, it is really just a body at that stage so that the ONLY thing it has going for it is what it will become in the future, not what it is at that point in time. That is a very big difference in outlook. Presumably, you might think that there is some sense of suffering, fear or loss that the fetus itself might feel if it is aborted and I would think that any such thoughts would have to stem from religious belief in a soul. If the early fetus would have no soul, then you might also agree that, at that early point in time, the biology is not yet ready for it to have any mental existence - no suffering, no fear, no pain, no emotions or thoughts of any kind whatsoever, conscious or subconscious. Without that mental existence, concepts such as ""innocence"" or ""justice"" just cannot apply. I was trying to think up an analogy for you so that you can understand the point of view but I suspect that, if I presented an analogy of a zygote conceived without a soul, then you might think that it never will achieve sentience - that a soul is necessary for sentience. However, imagine a soul that itself spiritually develops - starting off as only a spark of energy that accompanies life, and only later on gaining some sense of sentience or mind of any kind, conscious or subconscious. In that scenario, you might also agree that the early fetus without any sentience or mind cannot suffer, fear, have any emotions or thoughts or mind of any kind so it can neither be guilty nor innocent, or have any sense of injustice until it gains that sentience. That is equivalent to where we stand in our view. I personally don't view myself as having existed as a person - as ""me"" - until I did so mentally. Before that, there was just a living body with ""nobody home"". It is those first sparks of mentality that determined my beginnings as a person. If, for whatever reason, the progress of my developing body would have been halted at the first trimester, then nothing would have been lost since ""I"" as a person would never have existed. Then, it wouldn't have mattered much to me if I had been aborted at the first trimester or if I had never been conceived - either way ""I"" would never have come into existence. It comes down to the basic idea that I believe that our mental selves are the very core of what makes us exist as people. Every step (from development of the egg, to fertilization of the egg, to carrying to term of the fetus) that comes before the development of mental existence is an important step for my existence to happen - I cannot have discounted any of the steps as necessary for that potential ""me"". So, this establishes that it is indeed a combination of soul and potential that you most value. I think the thing that is most blocking our mutual understanding are the beliefs that automatically get attached to a belief in the soul. I think that your belief in a soul is the equivalent to my stress of a mental existence. How would you view the situation, I would ask, if you were assured that the soul did not enter until the beginning of the third trimester? In many of our views, the first trimester fetus may have the same potential for becoming a born walking talking person as the third trimester fetus, but the critical difference for me at least is that the thid trimester fetus is already similar enough to us to be called us - a person in the most critical sense. The key ingredient is the beginnings of the mind. Since you view some sense of mind as entering with the soul, you might not think that much happens at the beginning of that third trimester. However, not believing in a soul entering at conception, most of us DO INDEED believe that a very critical thing happens around the beginning of the third trimester - a mental existence begins in the fetus. That is a very important difference in our outlook.","abortion-self-defense","10:32 AM","abortion-debates","165"

"01-23-2008","10685",12,"Another opinion","298402","We both agree that the zygote or early fetus will very likely grow into a full person if not prevented from growing. The main difference in our outlook is how we look at what the zygote or early fetus is AT THAT MOMENT, not counting potential for what it will become in the future. I suspect that your belief in a soul residing in the zygote or early fetus makes you automatically attach certain aspects to it without even realising that it is because of the belief in that soul that you attach those aspects. The main aspect is the idea that there is ""somebody home"" in that zygote or early embryo - that it is not just a body, but an early version of a person in there. I think that that is the reason that you use words such as ""innocent"" and ""justice"". Again, you must remember that, for those of us who do not share your belief in a soul residing in the early fetus, it is really just a body at that stage so that the ONLY thing it has going for it is what it will become in the future, not what it is at that point in time. That is a very big difference in outlook. Presumably, you might think that there is some sense of suffering, fear or loss that the fetus itself might feel if it is aborted and I would think that any such thoughts would have to stem from religious belief in a soul. If the early fetus would have no soul, then you might also agree that, at that early point in time, the biology is not yet ready for it to have any mental existence - no suffering, no fear, no pain, no emotions or thoughts of any kind whatsoever, conscious or subconscious. Without that mental existence, concepts such as ""innocence"" or ""justice"" just cannot apply.

It is not much different than trying to relate to an unfertilized egg. Your contention is that fetuses are just miniature versions of ourselves. I might agree with you in the essentials for late term fetuses - since they have the brain development that allows for that essential criteria of mental existence - but would disagree with you when it comes to early fetuses. The brain in just not developed enough to allow for that mental existence. A religious world view may support it but science just does not support it. There is some uncertainty in that line of when the higher order mental processes could start in the brain - where some studies suggest that it can happen a few weeks prior to the beginning of the third trimester. That is why I mostly try to refer to that point as ""around"" the beginning of the third trimester. I would agree with a point that Steeeeve once brought up that trimesters are too large a unit of measurement to use and that weeks would be better. Once discussions and investigations finalize some consensus among neurologists in their understanding of brain development and when such higher order processes can start, then one could set a dividing line in weeks, after which there is too much of a chance of mental existence to allow unrestricted abortion. Either way, there is no scientific support fot the idea that any such mental existence, pain, etc. can happen in the first trimester - where the great majority of abortions occur. Are you claiming that a first trimester embryo/fetus can suffer, feel pain, emotions, etc. - for reasons other than a belief in a spiritual soul? These are relatively late term fetuses. Even so, neurological studies that I have read summaries of say that early fetuses can experience reflex actions that may look to us like pain but are really just the body's automatic reaction to a stimulus (as disected frogs still might show that stimulus response) but do not reflect that the brain itself is registering that pain. I suspect that the earliest of those fetuses in the study you posted (ex. the 20 week-old fetuses as opposed to the 30 week fetuses) are showing just such reflex response. Unfortunately, you article did not mention whether or not this question was addressed and answered. Yes, I cannot say with absolute certainty that there is no soul in a zygote, but I can be equally uncertain that there is no soul in an unfertilized egg, etc. If one takes a belief in a soul into account, which shows no evidence of its existence, then the point at which one can claim that it enters the body can be completely arbitrary. Even the traditional views of Christiantiy, as to when that soul entered the body, varied widely through history - where for much of history, it was viewed to enter the body at ""quickening"" (relatively late in the pregnancy). The idea that the soul enters the body at conception is a relatively recent belief within the Christian tradition. So, even the Church was not clear about this point. Given that uncertainty and the lack of evidence either way of whether or not a soul even exists, I follow the evidence presented by science - evidence that is repeatable and which can be explored in more and more detail.","abortion-self-defense","01:40 PM","abortion-debates","170"

Just because something will become a being we can sympathize with doesn't mean that it is that being AT THIS MOMENT. I just don't understand what it is about the fertilized egg/zygote that you sympathize with. You have no sympathy with the unfertilized egg even though we all also started from unfertilized eggs, yet you have sympathy for the fertilized egg. So, something happened during that process of fertilization that suddenly adds sympathy in your eyes. That is what I don't understand. I can understand that, if you believe in the soul, then you would believe that the fertilized egg has some mental sense of ""us"" in it, but you claim that you would hold this sympathy whether or not a soul would enter the zygote at conception. I guess I just don't see how one can sympathize with something that has no mental existence unless one is artificially attaching a mental existence where there is none. Yes, it will, in the future, gain a mental existence with which one can sympathize but, up to that point, it is just a mindless body - not a being I can sympathize with. I make a clear distinction between what it currently IS and what it WILL BE, perhaps you don't. Also, I will again mention the point that, for me, it would not have mattered if I had been aborted in the first trimester or whether I had never been conceived - the consequences would have been identical. Since I view mental existence as the core of our existence as people, ""I"" would never have existed either way. I owe my existence not only to the fact that my mother's pregnancy was carried to term, but also to the fact that I was conceived, that my parents even met, etc. I am certainly happy that nothing happened to stop that process but it really wouldn't have mattered at which stage of pregnancy or conception that process was stopped.

It gives me the same warm, fuzzy feeling I got when I was raped. Have I ever told you the stories of my grandma and my mom? My mom grew up in a one room shack with 11 siblings and an abusive father. My grandma could not get birth control without her husband's permission, which he would not grant. So my grandma kept having babies. Babies that he would do little to support. Now this was during the glorious culture of the 40s and 50s that you are glamorizing so on top of not being allowed to make birth control decisions for herself - it was damned hard for a woman to divorce or get the kind of work that would support a family. Telling your husband ""no"" wasn't an option. Spousal rape is still legal in many states. My mother has three children. Her last was my brother born in 1974. She decided at that time she no longer wanted children. She could not legally get her tubes tied without her husband's permission - which my father only granted after the doctor lied to him about the risks of my mother becoming pregnant again. My father would walk out ten years later. I am sorry that you think its unjust that men don't get to make decisions like this for the women in their life. But that is just too damned bad.

There is nothing wrong with them and its completely natural to like them. There was all kind of sexy going on in the 50s - the styles were just different. Marilyn Monroe is still the most revered pin-up girl of all time. How about Bettie Page? Pedal pushers? Tight sweaters? WHOAH! Now I KNOW you are a misogynist. This really doesn't warrant any more repsect than when Siggy gets on the board and talks about the inferiority of blacks or how the Holocaust didn't happen. Straight up pathetic. Do your daughters know that you find women to be predatory and unable to make a decent living for themselves? As long as people have sex there will be unwanted pregnancy. It happens to single people, coupled people, and married people. And its not new. In previous posts to you I told what things I believe will work and backed those things up with stats and evidence. You have not done this - you have just spun a wildly innacurate fairy tale about the 50s. This will not make a difference. I wear low-cut tops and glitter out to the bar all the time. I never take trash home (or go home with it). The girl next to me could wear a ankle-length skirt and turtle neck and be nailing everything that moves.

This all ties to how I feel we raise women and how I feel that needs to be changed. They are told all their lives - by popular culture and often by religion that having a man is the end-all, be-all of the universe. A good relationship with a good man is a wonderful thing. But there are women who will stick to a loser like glue over dealing with the stigma of being single. I choose to be single and I get jeers about it all the time. ""Can't catch a man??"" (like its that hard). We need to stop making a relationship with a man the measure of success for a woman. It is my belief that this idea is responsible for more unwanted pregancies than anything else. They can't stand the thought of being alone so they will do anything to hold on to that man - including sex, getting pregnanct, etc. I wish girls today understood that their sisters, eons ago, had little to no rights over their own lives and were given away in marriage by their fathers. A lot of these women became nuns. In part because they found freedom and power in celibacy that they would not have had married.","abortion-self-defense","04:57 PM","abortion-debates","174"

What I am arguing, and you are evading/distorting is the fact that men are held to and limited by what the woman decides to do in all cases, whether the baby lives or is killed in the womb, when they are both equally culpable for the pregnancy existing. Pregnancy is a team venture, activity, responsibility and therefore a team decision. If the father is willing to keep, love and raise the child, then the woman should have the child but be released of all responsibility for raising it. If the woman wants the baby and the father doesn't, and they're not married, then let her have it and raise it alone, freeing him from any responsibility for raising a child he didn't want. That would take care of the millions of cases of women entrapping men into marriage by using pregnancy as a trap. And you know that is a common practice with women. So where is the equality of consequences since there is equality of cause? Women don't get pregnant alone yet they alone determine the fate of the child in every possible scenario as the man is forced to submit to whatever the woman decides to do even though he is equally responsible for the pregnancy. All you are doing here is reiterating that men are victims of the whims of women who don't necessarily have anyones best interests in mind other than their own personal, selfish self interests. A woman can single handedly manipulate and control 2 lives legally just because she is a woman. With one decision she can force a man into servitude for 18 years. And with another decision she can kill an innocent child even if the real and legitimate father wants, and is willing to raise that child which is his child too. WHY??? Why is a joint creation, only the woman's domain to determine the outcome? What ever happened to cause and effect or taking responsibility for ones actions? How can the man be castrated of all choice and power when he is half of the relationship and DNA in the life being killed, and yet be forced to stay involved for 18 more years against his will if that is the woman's choice? And yet that is PRECISELY what you are endorsing and proscribing for every man when you give the woman the ultimate power to determine the outcome of her pregnancy without even considering what the man wants when he is an equal part of the child's existence. Now name for me any other example or scenario in life when one of the parties responsible for creating a problem is allowed to decide the outcome at the expense of all others?

Oh, nonsense. First of all, who says the woman is acting ""irresponsibly""? You do, but all you have to support this claim is your unfounded opinion. Second, the foetus does not have a right to gestation. Where is this right written, and who by? Most conceptions spontaneously abort, anyway. Third, the man always has the option to keep his sperm to himself. If he can't, then he has a responsibility if the child is born. If he doesn't want that responsibility, then he can enter into a legally binding, pre-coital agreement with the woman absolving him of any responsibility. Or he can keep his pecker in his pants. That's the extent of his choice. And no, the man has no more right to force a woman to carry his genes to term than the foetus has of gestation. All you argue for here, in essence, is a right to rape. Well, lots of relationships that result in pregnancy, sadly, are not consensual, but I don't see you arguing for abortion in such cases. Second, consent is usually to the sexual act only, less frequently to the conception of a child and starting a family. Consent to sex shouldn't be read as consent to pregnancy, where the two can be separated. If a man and a woman together agree to start a family, then of course he is more than ""just a sperm donor"" he becomes a parent. People who agree to start a family together aren't going to be wanting abortions, or if forced by medical circumstances into considering one, will probably reach agreement to have it or not. It's situations where consent to raise a family hasn't been involved that the issue of abortions can become real. Two people who have sex together aren't necessarily a couple in the sense of a family; indeed, they may have agreed beforehand NOT to start a family. And in the end, it is still the final right of the person doing the incubating to decide the disposition of her own body. That is a unique situation, without an external analogy. She is slave to neither the husband, the foetus, the church or the state. False analogy. A pregnancy is like no other demand on a woman's body or resources. It's a special case. Well, if they have agreed on paper beforehand that she will carry the entire financial responsibility, then you can certainly argue that the state doesn't have a right to forcibly break that agreement and dun the man for child care. On the other hand, I can understand why the state would look to the father if the mother becomes incapable, for any reason, of looking after the child with her own resources. Why should the public pay for their moment of fun? His solution, if he fears this will be a problem that will come back to bite him, is to keep his pecker in his pants, unless he wants to adopt responsibility for any potential issue. That can't be difficult to do, can it? No, dear, it's always the woman who gets screwed. Didn't they teach you basic biology? Life isn't fair. The woman takes the vast share of the risk and burden of pregnancy, and invests far more physical resources into it than any man. That is just an unfair fact of life, unfair for men and women. There is no reproductive equality between men and women, never was, and probably never will be. Not even their genes are all equal, as it turns out. So the argument for ""equal rights"" in deciding the fate of a foetus are specious. Objectively speaking, there is no equality at all. So that argument is full of holes as well. If you were making an argument against abortion from an assumption of the ""sanctity of life"", i.e. an assumption that life should be treated with reverence, dignity and respect, then you could make a coherent and seemingly plausible case. It would not be compelling, though, because it would be based on the not-so-obvious assumption that all living things are worthy of equal respect, and few would want to go that far. We do not accord equal respect to all forms of life, or even all stages of human life. We never have and it's not likely we ever will. However, trying to base an argument against abortion because it ""isn't fair"" to men who would force women to bear their children has to be one of the most flaccid ploys in the anti-abort arsenal.

Well, no surprise there. Yes, the man is responsible for any baby he fathered; no, he doesn't have the right to force a woman to bear his child. What's your problem with that? Sweetie, I don't minimise anything. I merely point out that the rights of the foetus and the man are not equal to those of the woman, and I provided many arguments to support that, none of which you have bothered to answer. Because it's not his body! Duh! Didn't they teach you the difference between ""mine"" and ""yours"" in school? First of all, rape and conception are not caused by a woman's voluntary actions. Women never consent to rape by definition, and they do not always consent to pregnancy. Second, we are not talking about a child; we are talking about a foetus. It can't even think or feel at the time abortion is legal. It isn't a person with the same rights as a person. Sweetums, I've been perfectly honest and direct. I've told you what i believe, and I've explained why I believe it. You haven't even come close to understanding what I've been saying, let alone making an argument against it. And no, men and women are not equal in terms of reproductive rights. That's just a fact of life you have to live with, just as you have to learn to live without a vagina or womb. They aren't yours to steal whenever the hell you feel like it. So bug off.","abortion-self-defense","08:45 AM","abortion-debates","197"

Point One: Hyperbole and emotional histrionics. You are now trying for emotional histrionics, which obviously mean that you do not have a honest argument to present instead. Two outright lies in your paragraph. One is that embryos and fetuses are NOT Children. You are blatantly misrepresenting developmental stages here. Secondly, nobody here have defended murder, nobody have defended the illegal killing of persons. Or is it that you are not a dishonest lying anti-choicer but rather are incredibly ignorant and didn't know the meanings of the words you used? You must then mean 7 weeks after birth, right? After all, ""baby"" is a biological/medical descriptor of a newborn. You can not possibly refer to the embryo, as it is not a baby. mttu is not exactly a reliable, honest site to use as a reference. Or didn't you know that you have to be a little bit careful about your sources to retain credibility? Now, I know this doesn't matter to you, because we already know that anti-choicers go for emotional histrionics rather than reality and honesty, so of course you don't care about your sources. After all, why would you get so excited about fetal porn otherwise? But it doesn't answer the question about sentience which was the question you were answering. How does fetal porn evidence anything about sentience? Yup, all about fetal porn shock value. You forgot to put verification on these pictures, to show how these are not Chinese term abortions, miscarriages or plastic models and whatever the anti-choice pack of liars usually go for. Once again, regardless of your emotional histrionics and dishonesty/ignorance, these are not babies, neither are they murdered. Any other stupid fallacies you want to present here? And since you would never have an abortion, why are YOU arguing about this? Butt out and stop your attempt at enslaving and controlling women.

The best we can work towards are services easily available in every state, coupled with widespread realistic family planning and sex education, services that make child rearing easier and more affordable (for example, affordable childcare, universal pre-k, universal health care, employment options for working mothers), and of course, RTLers are free to try to convince others to go their route instead.

However, the claim that all other abortions are carried out because women are partying or vain is vile, insulting, false and one of the worst examples of misogyny I have seen in a long, long while. (Pity whatever fool of a woman ends up or ended up with you.) Granted - this is typical of a lifer who really cares not a whit about women or children - only in maintaining their supposed moral superiority. There are lots of reasons women abort - you can help by trying to address them or you can generalize, trivialize and insult. One will actually help the women and potentially her baby - the other allows you to pat yourself on the back.","Existantia","306880","Well said Jitobear.

A baby is something natural to the body, the only time the body is threatened is when a foreign object has invaded the body, and is causing damage. A baby is not causing damage to the body, as a matter of fact it is something that the body itself made with the help of a sexual partner(and I'm not talking about those who have health issues.

But since when are they the real reason that motivates the woman. Last night I got a call from a Political Surveyor who asked me multiple questions regarding this election cycle. One set of questions were about what issues were most important to me regarding the Presidential election. I said that all of them were valid and important issues that I cared about, about 8 in total. She responded that I was allowed to pick as many as 3 issues that I cared about but the program didn't allow for me to pick all of them. So it is with the questionnaires every woman who gets an abortion must fill out. They have questions about why they are seeking it but not one option is to prevent wide hips, sagging boobs, a ponch stomach or not ready to stop partying, drinking or drugging. Those options aren't even made available to choose as the real reasons why women abort their babies so in your World, they don't even exist.
