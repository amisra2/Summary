You are actually comparing an unborn child to a plant or a fungus?!?!?!","Colonel Ingus","308114","Why not, new research now shows that all life on this planet first stared with a virus.

But since when are they the real reason that motivates the woman. Last night I got a call from a Political Surveyor who asked me multiple questions regarding this election cycle. One set of questions were about what issues were most important to me regarding the Presidential election. I said that all of them were valid and important issues that I cared about, about 8 in total. She responded that I was allowed to pick as many as 3 issues that I cared about but the program didn't allow for me to pick all of them. So it is with the questionnaires every woman who gets an abortion must fill out. They have questions about why they are seeking it but not one option is to prevent wide hips, sagging boobs, a ponch stomach or not ready to stop partying, drinking or drugging. Those options aren't even made available to choose as the real reasons why women abort their babies so in your World, they don't even exist. Talk about being told what you must think and buying it hook line and sinker. Get out of that box jito, it has to be awfully tight in there.","Christina_Castl","311300","I so agree with you!!! These women who are having abortions are selfish, and if thier lives are in danger of carring a child they should have not gotten preagnant in the first place, we all know what happens when we are having sex, dont we?","abortion-self-defense","04:13 PM","abortion-debates","212"

He then, and you now, have provided evidence of nothing but your own misogyny.","abortion-self-defense","09:07 PM","abortion-debates","213"

Baby at 7 weeks: http://www.mttu.com/abort-pics/7weeks.jpg Baby at 8 weeks: http://www.mttu.com/abort-pics/8weeks.jpg Baby at 14 weeks: http://www.mttu.com/abort-pics/14week1.jpg And here is some of the monstrous things you support if you support abortion( warning - horrendous pictures of death of babies from abortion): 10 week abortions: http://www.cbrinfo.org/Resources/Abo...0_weeks-13.jpg 22 weeks: http://www.cbrinfo.org/Resources/Abo...2_weeks-01.jpg Abortion: http://www.abortiontruth.com/images/abortion/03.jpg 8 weeks: http://www.cbrinfo.org/Resources/Abo...8_weeks-06.jpg Abortion: http://www.abortiontruth.com/images/abortion/01.jpg 22 week abortion: http://www.abortiontruth.com/images/abortion/36.jpg Anything? Or is your heart so frozen that you don't care that these children are being murdered and dismembered like this? Then you should not really be arguing about this - you aren't even old enough to HAVE an abortion.","Shooterandproud","311638","*Patiently waits for proof that these things have a mental existance* Well considering I'm a guy, that would be kind of hard. If I was a girl, then yes, I would be of age to have an abortion.","abortion-self-defense","12:08 AM","abortion-debates","214"

Cyclists, especially here in LA, have a high risk of being hit. Probably the same risk of getting pregnant while using contraception. So if a cyclist gets hit by a car, does he accept the risk of being hit and therefore deserve no medical attention?","abortion-self-defense","09:30 PM","abortion-debates","215"
