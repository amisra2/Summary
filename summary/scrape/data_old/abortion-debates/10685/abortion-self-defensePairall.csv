If that truth is ugly, it's your truth, because the minute you agree that less than 3% of all abortions are health related then you must admit that the reasons I gave are valid in over 90% of the remaining abortions each year.","jitobear","293525","I don't HAVE to do anything but stay white and die.

But since when are they the real reason that motivates the woman. Last night I got a call from a Political Surveyor who asked me multiple questions regarding this election cycle. One set of questions were about what issues were most important to me regarding the Presidential election. I said that all of them were valid and important issues that I cared about, about 8 in total. She responded that I was allowed to pick as many as 3 issues that I cared about but the program didn't allow for me to pick all of them. So it is with the questionnaires every woman who gets an abortion must fill out. They have questions about why they are seeking it but not one option is to prevent wide hips, sagging boobs, a ponch stomach or not ready to stop partying, drinking or drugging. Those options aren't even made available to choose as the real reasons why women abort their babies so in your World, they don't even exist. Talk about being told what you must think and buying it hook line and sinker. Get out of that box jito, it has to be awfully tight in there.","abortion-self-defense","05:42 PM","abortion-debates","232"

You are either a complete misogynist or not man enough to manage relationships with real women and thereofore the ones you people your life with are useless twits. Just promise me you will never have a daughter. You frankly don't deserve to be within ten feet of any woman. There is an ""other"" option. No - how about we talk about how I am a woman and a mother and how you don't know $hit. Like so many Christians I encounter - the main motivator of your faith is complete self-indulgence. You just loooove believing you are morally superior. You don't give a damn about pregnant women and their babies. You just write them off as vain party animals rather than address the real issues or take on trying to actually doing anything to help - but then why would you? Helping them would do nothing to feed your supposed morally superior ego. Pathetic.","abortion-self-defense","12:11 PM","abortion-debates","226"

Not all women, only those women who will kill their own offspring so as not to inconvenience themselves after it is they who acted irresponsibly, not the babies they so easily murder in the name of controlling their own bodies.

Just because because you say it, think it, or believe it does not mean that it is clearly anything outside of your ramblings, thoughts and beliefs. I'd like to see how you'd handle the government interfering with your dick. In any case. This simply confirms for me what I accused you of earlier. That your stance on abortion is complete self-gratification. You really don't give a damn about women facing unwanted pregnancies or their babies at all. You simply continue to trivialize what they are going through, generalize about as to their character with absolutely no evidence to back up these character assisinations and you offer zero solutions - just condemnation. I have a long list of ideas for addressing unwanted pregnancy and abortion - and not one them involves trivializing or insulting anybody. When I see evidence that this is an issue that you actually care about for a reason other than serving your own ego, I will share them with you. You did no such thing. You kept making the claim. You have not backed up your claim at all. Another accusation. Back it up. Now I did just a tich of poking around. Looked at two pro-life websites to see who they reference as their source for their stats. They site the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health organization that is pro-choice. I glanced through several of their reports to see how they obtained data. It was through independent studies - not clinic questionaires. http://www.guttmacher.org/sections/a...hp?pub=reports","abortion-self-defense","04:22 PM","abortion-debates","285"

But they do go out to party and get laid, and lo and behold when they end up getting pregnant they just figure it's easier to abort than to mess with their lives as they can easily rationalize why they don't want an unplanned baby. But we all know the reality is that they aren't ready to change their partying lifestyle and take responsibility for their actions.
