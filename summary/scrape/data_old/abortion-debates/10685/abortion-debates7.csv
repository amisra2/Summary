BTW, I don't care who leaped where? Maybe it was the nine lords a'leaping during the 12 days. I also don't care what the women in your family choose to do about the future of their pregnancies. What I DO care about is your silly attempt to set yourself up as the Chief of the Pregnancy Police and to attempt to tell the women in my family that you are better able to determine the future of their pregnancies than they are. BTW, when ""God"" formed Adam and breathed the breath of life into him, did he equip the said Adam with a bellybutton? Also, since Genesis tells us that Adam had sons but is silent on the subject of daughters, do you suppose old Shem, Ham, and Japeth were martyrfrockers all on a summer's EVE ?","abortion-self-defense","12:37 PM","abortion-debates","91"

And I haven't run away from any question at all. I asked you to post a specific question in your last post just 5 above this one where you asked me a question and just posted a link with pages of info. I asked you to copy and paste the pertinent part of that link that applied to the question you wanted to ask and you come back with this? And yo answer your childish question about women, I love and respect women but believe in holding them responsible for their actions just like any other member of Society. You see, that is true equality in action. So I don't believe that women deserve a special exemption in life which allows them to MURDER THEIR OFFSPRING FOR NO REASON AT ALL. Infanticide is wrong yet millions of women commit it each year in this Country with impunity. According to your warped and corrupt moral center that may be just fine, but according to mine, it isn't now now will it ever be.","abortion-self-defense","08:40 AM","abortion-debates","98"

As one of the authors you respect so highly once said, ""Judge not, that you be not judged."" That refers, among other things to other folks' sexuality and their choice as to whether or not to continue their pregnancies.

You see no problem sacrificing more than 2 MILLION unborn children each year to satisfy the vanity and convenience of women who placed themselves in their situation. In 98+% nobody forced them to have irresponsible sex. And you are so weak in defending what you claim to believe that from my prior post you only copy and past one lousy line rather than quote, and answer to the whole post and multiple point I made. So here it is again for your consideration. Try answering it all. Starting with why you changed your name so soon after joining? Did you get called on your trolling one to many times?

Your negative view of women and your desire to punish them for their sexuality plays an important part in your vehemence, doesn't it?

As for the unborn being nothing more than tumors, PROVE IT!!! Lying is not evidence either Capo? And are you actually denying you are thecapO? Do you think your style or arguments aren't recognizable, or that admin can't check your IP address? Lie to yourself if you like, but don't lie to me. And notice that you even titled your post ""choice, an all-american value"" just as the capO did. And incredibly, you even quote people like the capO does, by bolding what they say rather than using the quote feature.

Now who is it that is dissing and insulting women? It is you who is claiming they will turn into abussive monsters rather than take care of their children. On the other hand, you might have a point though as any woman who would kill their own offspring for such selfish reasons, might abuse the ones they willingly have anyway.","abortion-self-defense","02:50 PM","abortion-debates","105"
