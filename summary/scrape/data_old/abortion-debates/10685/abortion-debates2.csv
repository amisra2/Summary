"12-11-2007","10685",2,"sinjin","293547","AA- Please shows us where you get your stats or are you just ""infilled"" with this knowledge?","Archangel","293557","Have you ever seen an abortion questionnaire sinjin? What I'm trying to show you is common sense, something the left is sorely lacking. It's like when lyte argued that statistically atheists make up less that 1% of our Prison population, and produced ""ACTUAL SO CALLED STATISTICS"", But ask yourself this just for the sake of common sense. How many benefits do atheists get in prison compared to men who want out of their cells for bible studies, church services and worship services. The Christians also have access to special programs that lead to early release and community service points that lead to early release. And as the coup de graux, how many convicts want to go before the parole board labeled as godless heathens who don't even believe in God? NONE OF THEM, THAT'S HOW MANY. So like typical atheists and the smart criminals they are, they lie like hell and call themselves christians who just made a mistake. Well, you can be sure that if we could get a thousand of these so called christians here for a Poll, they would relate a lot better with you atheists than they would with me. And so it is with the questionnaires of abortion clinics. The questions on it are designed to manipulate the outcome to appear as innocent and morally right as possible. But we all know that is a blatant lie. It's just that some prefer the lie to the truth which is why such distorted statistics exist in the first place.","abortion-self-defense","06:51 PM","abortion-debates","18"

Show me results of polls that (1) are anonymous, thereby sidestepping this alleged cause of number slanting, and (2) support your point. Until then, I'll just point out how ironic it is that you say atheists are ""smart"" when they're criminals yet crazy and illogical when kicking your XXX on a debate forum, and that it's almost like you're complaining that Christians get preferential treatment when they're crooks.","abortion-self-defense","12:44 AM","abortion-debates","21"

But since when are they the real reason that motivates the woman. So it is with the questionnaires every woman who gets an abortion must fill out. They have questions about why they are seeking it but not one option is to prevent wide hips, sagging boobs, a ponch stomach or not ready to stop partying, drinking or drugging. Those options aren't even made available to choose as the real reasons why women abort their babies so in your World, they don't even exist. Talk about being told what you must think and buying it hook line and sinker. Get out of that box jito, it has to be awfully tight in there.","jitobear","293637","What evidence do you have that they aren't? The most thorough stats I provided were from a PRO-LIFE website. I have provided stats and evidence - you have provided NOTHING. You have zero credibility here. None. Nada. Zip. I doubt highly that they have to fill it out at all. You are either a complete misogynist or not man enough to manage relationships with real women and thereofore the ones you people your life with are useless twits. Just promise me you will never have a daughter. You frankly don't deserve to be within ten feet of any woman. There is an ""other"" option. No - how about we talk about how I am a woman and a mother and how you don't know $hit. Like so many Christians I encounter - the main motivator of your faith is complete self-indulgence. You just loooove believing you are morally superior. You don't give a damn about pregnant women and their babies. You just write them off as vain party animals rather than address the real issues or take on trying to actually doing anything to help - but then why would you? Helping them would do nothing to feed your supposed morally superior ego. Pathetic.","abortion-self-defense","12:11 PM","abortion-debates","22"

If you had an ounce of understanding why so many American women are promiscuous, with no self respect at all, you wouldn't be defending and justifying abortion, but would be talking about how to rebuild within women a morality based value system in order to stop the all out human carnage taking place in our abortion clinics due to the out of control and irresponsible sex that is taking place in this Country, and around the World.

"12-13-2007","10685",2,"None","None","None","jim's trucking","293765","I would say it's more self preservation than self defense. To call it self-defense would require some attack or intent to attack on the part of the pregnancy. I'm not aware of all the various conditions behind abortions for health reasons, but I do not see a deliberate attempt by the fetus to hurt the mother. Natural causes likely precipitate the need to abort. Self preservation drives the decision to do so. To me, that is justified. Whether it is homicide or not doesn't matter. If it is, it's justified.","abortion-self-defense","11:40 AM","abortion-debates","29"

I have every right to them and to voice them here without proving that anyone else agrees with me at all in order to voice them. So there is nothing to concede as my beliefs are self evident. It would be nice though if you could prove that the results of surveys the abortion industry does to support their own predetermined outcomes weren't fixed and loaded to confirm precisely the results they want to come up with. Of course you will ignore that aspect of this as ignorance is bliss to your side of the issue.","abortion-self-defense","11:54 AM","abortion-debates","30"
