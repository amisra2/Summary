Nope, I'm not CLAIMING a single thing; I'm simply extrapolating from known statistics about child abuse. How's about we require every rightofetallifer to adopt at least three of the ""babies"" they save through their nefarious efforts? Would you go for that? How's about a massive tax increase to pay for parenting classes to prevent the type of abuse we already know exists as well as the increased number of cases that might occur as a result of women being forced to carry and deliver children they are unable/unequipped to raise? Not that, either? Well then, why not tell us what your solution will be to ensure that these children are provided with the love, guidance, discipline, and money it will take to see that they become productive citizens in the future.","abortion-self-defense","05:17 PM","abortion-debates","106"

Would you go for that? You vote for saving the healthy babies from infanticide and I will easily get them adopted into good homes.","abortion-self-defense","06:47 PM","abortion-debates","107"

Tell us again about how you're not into punishing women. Show the forum that you have the adoptive families lined up, and then we will discuss the matter further. BTW, how many of the adoptive couples will be same-gender? BTW, once you, as you did here, allow rape and incest exceptions, you place yourself in the pro-choice camp. Welcome. We're just sorry it took you so long to get here. Now explain why a fetus conceived through rape or incest is less deserving of the law's protection than any other. Frankly, I believe that statues ought to be erected in public squares all across America to honor women who stand up to the likes of you and make a choice you disagree with. Here's a hypo for you: Let's suppose your Draconian absurdity is enacted into law in the USA but abortion remains legal in Canada. How will you determine if: A) A woman on a plane to Toronto is pregnant? B) Whether she is going to Canada for the purpose of terminating her pregnancy? and C) Whether or not she is pregnant upon her return to the USA?","abortion-self-defense","07:00 PM","abortion-debates","108"

What's so hard to understand about that. It's your law after all as you wanted to require that all right to lifers had to adopt 3 babies we save through our so called nefarious efforts. Did you then expect those women who break the law to just get away with murder? Are you for not enforcing the laws of the land capo? Are you pro murder without consequences? If a drunk hits a car and the pregnant woman survives but her unborn child dies is that vehicular homicide or does that drunk get a free pass cuz it's just an unborn child?

When I called you by your previous name in that last post I spelled out capO, with a capital O. Now when you innocently ask who cap0 is, you mysteriously use not my incorrect spelling which someone who isn't that person would obviously do. But Noooooo, you spell it correctly as only the original would know to do. See? So do yourself a favor and stay away from crime because you're not to good at covering your tracks.

I just want America to be an infanticide free zone except for the reasons agreed upon originally which was Incest.Rape and the health of the mother.

Most likely, he'd agree on the principle but demand to know what this way actually is, then he'd come up with some pathetic argument that it's a bad idea. Studies show that abortion rates decrease dramatically with increased access to contraception. End the futile, impotent (an accurate descriptor ripe with poetic justice), ineffective/countereffective ""abstinence-only"" programs and replace them with bona fide sex education, including proper use of contraception. Remove the taboo aspect of sex and sex paraphernalia such as condoms and the pill so that young adults aren't so scared to death of their parents learning of their sexual activity that they refuse to be safe and responsible with their decisions.","abortion-self-defense","02:08 PM","abortion-debates","114"

(Archie's definition, incidentally, means that miscarriages and failure of a zygote to implant in the uterine wall are God committing murderer.) Using actual meanings of words, you are correct. Although no law can guarantee that the USA will necessarily be an infanticide-free zone (inasmuch as laws against murder cannot guarantee that the USE will not be homicide free), there are laws against killing infants .","abortion-self-defense","03:02 PM","abortion-debates","117"

Your shallow perspective and empty World view makes me wish you could exerience first hand what you are so willing to impose on almost 2 million unborn babies each year.
