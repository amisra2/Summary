So how do you say that this guy just left his DNA lying around like it just fell out of his pocket Axolotl? Your statement makes no sense in reality at all.","Axolotl","298476","Archangel, I do emphasize the part a man plays ... once there is what we can all agree is a baby. Fathers should be held fully accountable for their children. And because men don't have a choice in what women do with their bodies, they should think carefully upon the consequences of their actions as consenting partners. What happens if their partner gets pregnant? Do they agree about how that will be dealt with? If Dad doesn't want a baby, and she does, he's got a long road ahead of him. If Dad does want a baby, and she doesn't, he may be in for some very painful moments. (And sometimes young people don't know their sentiments on these matters until it's the real thing, with the young women entitled to change her mind from anything she said she believed before.) Granted, most couples make these decisions together. But ultimately, if a woman gets pregnant, it's her decision whether or not to follow through on the pregnancy. And just personally speaking, I wouldn't want to force someone by law to do something they didn't want to do. Especially in a matter as serious as having a baby and raising that person to adulthood. I'm just saying that DNA in and of itself is not a valid argument.","abortion-self-defense","12:43 AM","abortion-debates","181"

What I am arguing, and you are evading/distorting is the fact that men are held to and limited by what the woman decides to do in all cases, whether the baby lives or is killed in the womb, when they are both equally culpable for the pregnancy existing. Pregnancy is a team venture, activity, responsibility and therefore a team decision. If the father is willing to keep, love and raise the child, then the woman should have the child but be released of all responsibility for raising it. If the woman wants the baby and the father doesn't, and they're not married, then let her have it and raise it alone, freeing him from any responsibility for raising a child he didn't want. That would take care of the millions of cases of women entrapping men into marriage by using pregnancy as a trap. And you know that is a common practice with women. So where is the equality of consequences since there is equality of cause? Women don't get pregnant alone yet they alone determine the fate of the child in every possible scenario as the man is forced to submit to whatever the woman decides to do even though he is equally responsible for the pregnancy. All you are doing here is reiterating that men are victims of the whims of women who don't necessarily have anyones best interests in mind other than their own personal, selfish self interests. A woman can single handedly manipulate and control 2 lives legally just because she is a woman. With one decision she can force a man into servitude for 18 years. And with another decision she can kill an innocent child even if the real and legitimate father wants, and is willing to raise that child which is his child too. WHY??? Why is a joint creation, only the woman's domain to determine the outcome? What ever happened to cause and effect or taking responsibility for ones actions? How can the man be castrated of all choice and power when he is half of the relationship and DNA in the life being killed, and yet be forced to stay involved for 18 more years against his will if that is the woman's choice? And yet that is PRECISELY what you are endorsing and proscribing for every man when you give the woman the ultimate power to determine the outcome of her pregnancy without even considering what the man wants when he is an equal part of the child's existence. Now name for me any other example or scenario in life when one of the parties responsible for creating a problem is allowed to decide the outcome at the expense of all others? Show me any other situation where the cause of the problem is able to victimize all others involved while insuring the best results for themselves.","abortion-self-defense","10:31 AM","abortion-debates","183"
"01-24-2008","10685",13,"Archangel","298507","WHY??? Why is a joint creation, only the woman's domain to determine the outcome?","lesz","298521","The answer to that is simple. The woman is the incubator, but unlike a machine, she has choices. When men come to be able to conceive and carry babies to term, then they will gain the right to decide. Then there are cases of rape, where a woman is made pregnant against her will. No ""joint creation"" applies there. It's theft and violence. If you can't see the difference between a man who merely donates sperm, and a woman who has to carry the burden of pregnancy, then that explains why you are all at sea on this issue, as well.","abortion-self-defense","11:40 AM","abortion-debates","184"

The fact is that every response to my arguments is exactly the same. The woman can act as irresponsibly as she wants to but just because she is the incubator, she has absolute control over life and death, and whether the man is forced into financial servitude whether he agrees with her decision or not. Again, if you read the thread you would see that I have also dealt with that issue. It has constantly been stressed that my argument is in response to a consensual relationship. If you can't see that a man is much more than a sperm donor but is an equal half of what is referred to as a couple, then you have no concept of what the term equality means. Let's carry this perspective over to other parts of the man/woman relationship and test how fair it is. When a woman who never works outside of the home, marries a man and then divorces him, doesn't she get alimony as credit for emotionally supporting him as he earned all the money? Why should she? What makes her worth anything more than the cost of a maid for the time they were married? And even if they agree before marriage that they will never have children, if the woman breaks that promise and gets pregnant, in the event of divorce the man is still held financially responsible even though he has been deceived and defrauded by the woman. My point is women win from all directions and the man gets screwed. Feel free to outline any scenario you can come up with in reality where the man is treated fairly in the area of reproductive rights.","abortion-self-defense","12:31 PM","abortion-debates","185"

Somehow, it seems that you are crying crocodile tears about something that is of minor importance, given the fact that men control American society from top to bottom. Are you saying that you have no objection to a woman's terminating her pregnancy if the man agrees? Seems to me that your exceptions to your righttofetallife positions are beginning to swallow your rule. So far, YOU have exceptions for the victims of rape, for women made pregnant through an anonymous sperm donor, and now for women whose ""men"" consent. As we have come to see it, the only women you would prohibit from terminating their pregnancies are those in committed relationships whose ""men"" do not consent. I would suspect this is a mighty small number.","abortion-self-defense","01:11 PM","abortion-debates","186"

Oh, nonsense. First of all, who says the woman is acting ""irresponsibly""? You do, but all you have to support this claim is your unfounded opinion. Second, the foetus does not have a right to gestation. Where is this right written, and who by? Most conceptions spontaneously abort, anyway. Third, the man always has the option to keep his sperm to himself. If he can't, then he has a responsibility if the child is born. If he doesn't want that responsibility, then he can enter into a legally binding, pre-coital agreement with the woman absolving him of any responsibility. Or he can keep his pecker in his pants. That's the extent of his choice. And no, the man has no more right to force a woman to carry his genes to term than the foetus has of gestation. All you argue for here, in essence, is a right to rape. Well, lots of relationships that result in pregnancy, sadly, are not consensual, but I don't see you arguing for abortion in such cases. Second, consent is usually to the sexual act only, less frequently to the conception of a child and starting a family. Consent to sex shouldn't be read as consent to pregnancy, where the two can be separated. If a man and a woman together agree to start a family, then of course he is more than ""just a sperm donor"" he becomes a parent. People who agree to start a family together aren't going to be wanting abortions, or if forced by medical circumstances into considering one, will probably reach agreement to have it or not. It's situations where consent to raise a family hasn't been involved that the issue of abortions can become real. Two people who have sex together aren't necessarily a couple in the sense of a family; indeed, they may have agreed beforehand NOT to start a family. And in the end, it is still the final right of the person doing the incubating to decide the disposition of her own body. That is a unique situation, without an external analogy. She is slave to neither the husband, the foetus, the church or the state. False analogy. A pregnancy is like no other demand on a woman's body or resources. It's a special case. Well, if they have agreed on paper beforehand that she will carry the entire financial responsibility, then you can certainly argue that the state doesn't have a right to forcibly break that agreement and dun the man for child care. On the other hand, I can understand why the state would look to the father if the mother becomes incapable, for any reason, of looking after the child with her own resources. Why should the public pay for their moment of fun? His solution, if he fears this will be a problem that will come back to bite him, is to keep his pecker in his pants, unless he wants to adopt responsibility for any potential issue. That can't be difficult to do, can it? No, dear, it's always the woman who gets screwed. Didn't they teach you basic biology? Life isn't fair. The woman takes the vast share of the risk and burden of pregnancy, and invests far more physical resources into it than any man. That is just an unfair fact of life, unfair for men and women. There is no reproductive equality between men and women, never was, and probably never will be. Not even their genes are all equal, as it turns out. So the argument for ""equal rights"" in deciding the fate of a foetus are specious. Objectively speaking, there is no equality at all. So that argument is full of holes as well. If you were making an argument against abortion from an assumption of the ""sanctity of life"", i.e. an assumption that life should be treated with reverence, dignity and respect, then you could make a coherent and seemingly plausible case. It would not be compelling, though, because it would be based on the not-so-obvious assumption that all living things are worthy of equal respect, and few would want to go that far. We do not accord equal respect to all forms of life, or even all stages of human life. We never have and it's not likely we ever will. However, trying to base an argument against abortion because it ""isn't fair"" to men who would force women to bear their children has to be one of the most flaccid ploys in the anti-abort arsenal. It just doesn't pass the giggle test.","abortion-self-defense","05:15 AM","abortion-debates","191"

So why is the man left with no power at all to determine the fate of the pregnancy? You say because she is the incubator, And that is where we disagree. Since they both consented to the sex, and since a very real living being who is part of both of them is at stake, then that decision should also be made jointly. But it isn't, is it. So now you are allowing abortion in those cases where both the man and the woman in a consentual relationship agree to it. It seems that your exceptions have truly swallowed the rule. Let's see now: 1. Abortion OK if the woman is raped (no committed relationship). 2. Abortion OK if the woman is pregnant via a, anonymous sperm donor (no committed relationship there, either). 3. Abortion OK if both partners in a committted relationship agree. It would seem that the only case where you would not permit a woman to abort would be if she were in a committed relationship and the man did not give his consent. We are left to wonder, is your primanry concern the fetus or the man? Please clarify.","abortion-self-defense","10:56 AM","abortion-debates","194"
