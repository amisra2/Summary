But since when are they the real reason that motivates the woman. Since when is it any of your business why any woman chooses to continue or terminate her pregnancy? Neither you, nor I, nor any other individual has any right to inquire. MYOB For those who don't like how I quote folks, just scroll on by. Nothing here is required reading.","abortion-self-defense","abortion-debates","19","08:25 PM"

They have good healthy self images with good healthy relationships with me so they never had to go out and prove they can be loved by having physical relationships with men and having random sex in order to feel like complete women who can be loved by a man. If you believe that they would tell YOU the details of their sex lives, you must be waiting for the plane to take you to Fantasy Island. Even more important for you and all the busybodies: What business is it of yours?","abortion-self-defense","abortion-debates","27","09:20 PM"

I will grant that you have the right to preach to the females IN YOUR FAMILY to be continually pregnant, to have babies until, as Luther said, ""They are dead of it."" What I require, no, DEMAND, is that you cease your attempts to impose your absurd beliefs on the women in MY FAMILY!","abortion-self-defense","abortion-debates","31","01:01 PM"

If you don't like that then refute them but don't you dare tell me not to share my beliefs and opinions because you just don't carry that kind of power here, at least not with me. I will be happy to publicize the fact that there is a wacko on this forum who has theabsurd belief that some nameless, faceless governmenrt bureaucrat is better able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is. That is what ALL you profewtallifers want, isn't it - to deprive women of control of their bodies. In just what ways are you different from the Taliban?","abortion-self-defense","abortion-debates","35","04:09 PM"
"","12-14-2007","10685","None","None","None","thecap0","293945","archie, But they do go out to party and get laid, and lo and behold when they end up getting pregnant they just figure it's easier to abort than to mess with their lives as they can easily rationalize why they don't want an unplanned baby. And this is your business based upon just exactly what? One thing for certain, the Creons, the Torquemadas, and the Jauverts of the world all think they have the right to control others.","abortion-self-defense","abortion-debates","44","10:57 PM"

I suggest that you reread my #31. I fully support your right to spout your nonsense. You're the one who brought up the idea of banning anyone. The only thing more disgusting to me than your posts would be any attempt to ban them. By all means, let the world see just how absurd your POV really is; let the world see that your POV stems from a desire to control others, women especially; let the world see that your POV stems from a Pauline hatred of sex. BTW, how many of the babies of the ""fallen"" women you deride so constantly have you adopted? Finally, if you don't like the way I quote your nonsense, use your scroll feature. Since you don't, I can only assume that you don't like the disinfecting sunlight of truth being shined on the pollution you post here.","abortion-self-defense","abortion-debates","50","05:36 AM"

And my all time favorite, if I hate abortions so much, how many children have i personally adopted? You say ""Leftist"" as though it were a BAD thing. I notice from your rant that you have neither responded to the first comment nor answered the question. Just what is it about you Profetallifers that you feel that the government is better able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is? If that's not CONTROL, then someone changed the definition of the word.","abortion-self-defense","abortion-debates","52","09:36 AM"
"","12-16-2007","10685","None","None","None","thecap0","294067","archie, Uhh, these two statistics are posted above by both jito and me and answer that question perfectly. Even assuming the validity of the ""statistics"" you present, no matter how dubious the source, what business is it of yours what women outside your family choose to do regarding the future of their pregnancies?","abortion-self-defense","abortion-debates","59","03:19 PM"

Archie, You still don't get that you and your ilk ARE the issue, do you? It is you and your ilk who continue to try to politicize the issue of abortion, which is perhaps the most private choice a woman can make. As for the women in my family, there is no more of a ""moral"" question involved in aborting or continuing a pregnancy than there would be in removing a burst appendix or a malignant tumor. We do wish that you and your ilk would practice your morality within your families and leave us alone to practice ours. Is that too much to ask?","abortion-self-defense","abortion-debates","62","07:07 PM"

If so you think, then so you must order your life and the lives of those around you; just don't try to impose your sick view on those who have a different perspective. Tell the forum here and now that you do not seek legislation that would take the decision of whether to hand the decision continuing a pregnancy to someone other than the pregnant woman and this debate is over. On the other hand, if you DO favor turning this most private of decisions over to the government, tell us all now, so that you can stand exposed as one who lacks trust in women to determine what is in their interest.","abortion-self-defense","abortion-debates","64","08:14 PM"
"","12-17-2007","10685","None","None","None","thecap0","294152","jito, You should have read it the first time I posted it when I was calling you on the idea that women are getting abortions becuase they are vain and don't want to give up partying. One of the first things they teach in the Navy is never to whizz off the windward rail of the ship. It's time for us to stop discussing things on Archie's terms and just say once and for all that it's not our, his, or anyoe else's business why a woman chooses to trerminate a pregnancy. She owes no one an explanation, least of all a Profetallifer like Archie who just loves to meddle into others' private affairs.","abortion-self-defense","abortion-debates","68","10:54 AM"

So do we all. Nancy Reagan's silly, ""Just say no!"" didn't work with drugs, and ""Just say no to sex"" will not accomplish what all of us want. Only comprehensive sex education, with abortion as a safe, legal, and rare alternative procedure will bring it about","abortion-self-defense","abortion-debates","70","12:15 PM"

But look at what it has become, another form of defacto birth control. LIES!! If someone will take the time to read ROE to you, you will find nothing of the sort in the decision. In fact, Justice Blackmun made it clear that in the first trimester, neither the state nor anyone else had an interest in the choice a pregnant woman made. Further, so what if it is another method of birth control to you? Don't you get that it is none of your business what any woman does regarding the future of her pregnancy?","abortion-self-defense","abortion-debates","73","11:40 AM"

Thus, it seems, that your ""God"" determined BIRTH to be the beginning of human life. Now, will you please stop bloviating about the evil of abortion. It's a nothing until it's born, according to the words you have quoted.","abortion-self-defense","abortion-debates","75","12:16 PM"

Do you even know that is nothing more than a proposal placed out as food for thought and consideration? Do you know that it did not then and does not today have the force of law anywhere, as it was never adopted in any jurisdiction? In my, and apparently your, opinion, however, it did not go far enough. I seem to remember that you quoted approvingly that Ole' Adam did not become human until ""God"" breathed the Breath of Life"" into him. Thanks for the ""Biblical"" support of what I have been saying all along, that personhood begins with the first breath.","abortion-self-defense","abortion-debates","84","12:33 PM"

BTW, I don't care who leaped where? Maybe it was the nine lords a'leaping during the 12 days. I also don't care what the women in your family choose to do about the future of their pregnancies. What I DO care about is your silly attempt to set yourself up as the Chief of the Pregnancy Police and to attempt to tell the women in my family that you are better able to determine the future of their pregnancies than they are. BTW, when ""God"" formed Adam and breathed the breath of life into him, did he equip the said Adam with a bellybutton? Also, since Genesis tells us that Adam had sons but is silent on the subject of daughters, do you suppose old Shem, Ham, and Japeth were martyrfrockers all on a summer's EVE ?","abortion-self-defense","abortion-debates","91","12:37 PM"
