Kathleen McChesney, executive director of the Office of Child and Youth Protection of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the overwhelming majority of the accusations, which were made against 756 priests, concerned incidents that took place about 30 years ago. Twenty-two accusations of abuse were made by children in 2004, and they were all turned over to the police, Dr. McChesney said. The findings were released on Friday by the national conference, which has hired independent auditors to assess the church's response to the sex abuse scandals that exploded in 2002. Dr. McChesney said the costs to the church had exceeded $800 million since 1950. Last year alone the costs from settlements, therapy for victims and offenders, and lawyers' fees came to about $139.6 million, according to the report. The 1,092 new accusations of abuse were made by 1,083 people, mostly men. Last year the bishops released an analysis conducted by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, based on figures from bishops and religious orders, that found 10,667 minors had allegedly been abused from 1950 to 2002. The actual number of victims will probably remain unknown because many people never come forward, Dr. McChesney said.

The whole point is that he is the pope . We look to the pope to be the messenger of Christ and thus an authority on faith and morals. (By the way he's 84 years old and I think he gives a powerful message about the value of life and purpose in the elderly.) So we don't just follow any 74 year old with parkinson's. We follow the one who is the 264th successor of Peter who was appointed by Christ to lead his Church. But to address your assertion on the bible and abortion: Nowhere in the Bible is abortion specifically prohibited but the foundation of Christian argument from a biblical perspective is the fact that the unborn being is established as a person from the moment of creation. The unborn being is considered a child. Thus the commandment, ""Thou shalt not kill"" applies. Check out some of these verses as a start: Exodus 21:22-25, Psalm 139:13-16, Psalm 71:6, Deutoronomy 30:19, Luke 1:15 and 1:41, Isaiah 49:1, Jeremiah1:5, 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 It is also of note that it was, in a sense, a curse to be barren in the Jewish/Christian community. Children were thought of as a blessing from God Psalm 127:3-5, Matthew 18:10 (there are many other indications of this as well). An attempt at abortion would go against the prevailing culture and mindset. The early Church also spoke out against abortion. Look at this link to see excerpts of the Church Fathers on the subject: http://www.catholic.com/library/Abortion.asp Keep in mind that not all Christian practices and beliefs are explicity spelled out in scripture. In discussing abortion in the light of Christianity (including scripture), there are some essentials that must be noticed. The Bible unequivocally ""tells"" us that abortion is wrong and in stark contrast to the Christian message. It does that in the nativity of the Gospel of Luke and it does that in the Passion narratives of the four Gospels. The Christian story is about birth, creation, joy, and perseverance. It is also about sacrifice for others and giving life. Father Frank Pavone illustrates this by describing a remarkable contrast in thought on abortion between abortion supporters and Christ. Abortion supporters say, ""This is my body, I can do with it what I want. I can destroy others to preserve my life. I can destroy others so that I may live as I want. Do not interfere with me."" Whereas, Christ says, ""This is my body, which is given up for you."" ""This is my body""--same words but much different in intent, in action, in charity, in love, in faith, in hope... Jesus gives his body away so that others live. Abortion proponents cling to their own bodies so that others die.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","08:23 PM","abortion-debates","10"

But if you can find in reading chicken guts, the richness and depth of thought that you find in the Catholic Church, then you are indeed a powerful mystic and soothsayer. The Church and its priests do not seek to erase the love and sexual feelings that men naturally have toward women (in your words they do not seek to act like they don't ""want some""). They seek to control them and sacrifice them for a higher love. They are not pretending that they do not exist. If they don't then you are probably dealing with an unhealthy individual who may not be fit for the priesthood. Secondly, there is much basis to the Catholic Church's teachings on celibacy. It is not without foundation. These are not made up laws with made up enforcement. Thirdly, if you believe celibacy to be related to the perversion of pedophilia then I have a few questions for you: Have you ever had thoughts of having sex with a child when you were in a celibate period in your life? Would being in close proximity to children in a position of authority instigate in you inclinations to molest children? If for some reason, your significant other died or lived but for health reasons could no longer have sex would you consider pedophilia as a normal sexual outlet/interaction? If you were required to be celibate your entire life do you think that you would be attracted to children? And if celibacy is the problem then why does pedophilia occur in Protestant congregations at a similar rate when the pastor is not required to be celibate? Pedophilia is a perversion, a sickness, a disorder. It has little to do with celibacy.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","09:55 PM","abortion-debates","14"
