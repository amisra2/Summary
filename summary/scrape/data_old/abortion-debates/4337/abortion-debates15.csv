"04-25-2005","4337",15,"Duo_Maxwell","None","They aren't the same. the point is that a group that is fraught with immoral behavior has no crediblity or authority when it comes to dictating what people should or should not do on the basis of morality. Consider it this way: Bill Clinton speaking about how a boyfriend should act in accordance to fideilty. No one is going to believe him because has squandered all of his crediblitiy and authority. It's the same way with the Catholic Church.","JPSartre12","112326","So, by your logic, if there's a bad cop in New York, then all the cops in Boise, Idaho must be bad as well.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","09:47 PM","abortion-debates","212"

Period. Just kids. Sometimes boys, sometimes girls - but kids. They don't like grown ups at all. Both men and women can be pedophiles - but more often it's men. Some pedophiles go on to act on that attraction and molest children, but not all do. Men and women and gays and straights can and do molest children. Their sexual orientation isn't why. Not all people who molest children are pedophiles, usually they actually aren't as true pedophilia is extremely rare. This isn't my opinion - go ask a psychiatrist or psychologist. And it's all in the link I provided.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","10:11 PM","abortion-debates","215"

Molestation is the action that harms and usually doesn't have to have a thing to do with sexual attraction. I am sure plenty of people who molest children are married with kids, and quite possibly are even molesting their own kids. Doesn't mean they are attracted to kids though. And yes - all kinds of people molest children - I said as much in my post. You do all sexual assualt victims a disservice here. Rape and molestation are acts violence, not passion. It's not about not controlling one's desires, it's about hurting someone. The minute you dismiss that, you dismiss what the victim goes through. We revert back to the idea that victims are asking for it and the perps can't control themselves. I am not the one tied up in stereotypes. What stereotype would I be using? Do you know what a stereotype is? You make zero sense here. And you may have no use for shrinks (especially when they XXXX gaping holes in your false assumptions) however, I shall be taking my own experiences and the word of trained professionals over what the have-no-training-got-no personal-experience Voice of Reason says.

Not to mention they do bust their own and send them the jail. The Vatican doesn't do that. Also, the Cops don't shuffle around known law breakers and refuse to tell the public. Also, the cops don't glorify a known law breaker, they send the sucker to prison. While the cops do have their problems: they don't pretend like they don't exist.

But true pedophiles are rare. Most people who molest children aren't doing so because they are sexually attracted to them. In most sex crimes, the perp is into the power he/she gets from violating and hurting somebody. It has nothing to do with sexual attraction - hence so many pillars of society who mantain adult sexual relationships being child molestors. Part of this confusion comes from the fact the word ""pedophile"" is mis-used. It has come to mean anyone who sexually assualts children, when technically that is not the case. Pedophilia is a sexual orientation. Child molestation is a crime.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","02:53 PM","abortion-debates","222"

So two ""pro-abortion"" saints are named. But if you personally want proof, here. St. Augustine reversed centuries of Christian teaching in Western Europe, and returned to the Aristotelian concept of ""delayed ensoulment."" He wrote that a human soul cannot live in an unformed body. Thus the fetus wasn't alive before it had formed body. St. Jerome wrote, ""The seed gradually takes shape in the uterus, and it [abortion] does not count as killing until the individual elements have acquired their external appearance and their limbs"" St. Thomas Aquinas considered abortion of an ""animated"" fetus as murder. So before five months it was okay to have an abortion. http://www.religioustolerance.org/abo_hist.htm","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","05:45 PM","abortion-debates","225"
