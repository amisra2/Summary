Kathleen McChesney, executive director of the Office of Child and Youth Protection of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the overwhelming majority of the accusations, which were made against 756 priests, concerned incidents that took place about 30 years ago. Twenty-two accusations of abuse were made by children in 2004, and they were all turned over to the police, Dr. McChesney said. The findings were released on Friday by the national conference, which has hired independent auditors to assess the church's response to the sex abuse scandals that exploded in 2002. Dr. McChesney said the costs to the church had exceeded $800 million since 1950. Last year alone the costs from settlements, therapy for victims and offenders, and lawyers' fees came to about $139.6 million, according to the report. The 1,092 new accusations of abuse were made by 1,083 people, mostly men. Last year the bishops released an analysis conducted by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, based on figures from bishops and religious orders, that found 10,667 minors had allegedly been abused from 1950 to 2002. The actual number of victims will probably remain unknown because many people never come forward, Dr. McChesney said.

The whole point is that he is the pope . We look to the pope to be the messenger of Christ and thus an authority on faith and morals. (By the way he's 84 years old and I think he gives a powerful message about the value of life and purpose in the elderly.) So we don't just follow any 74 year old with parkinson's. We follow the one who is the 264th successor of Peter who was appointed by Christ to lead his Church. But to address your assertion on the bible and abortion: Nowhere in the Bible is abortion specifically prohibited but the foundation of Christian argument from a biblical perspective is the fact that the unborn being is established as a person from the moment of creation. The unborn being is considered a child. Thus the commandment, ""Thou shalt not kill"" applies. Check out some of these verses as a start: Exodus 21:22-25, Psalm 139:13-16, Psalm 71:6, Deutoronomy 30:19, Luke 1:15 and 1:41, Isaiah 49:1, Jeremiah1:5, 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 It is also of note that it was, in a sense, a curse to be barren in the Jewish/Christian community. Children were thought of as a blessing from God Psalm 127:3-5, Matthew 18:10 (there are many other indications of this as well). An attempt at abortion would go against the prevailing culture and mindset. The early Church also spoke out against abortion. Look at this link to see excerpts of the Church Fathers on the subject: http://www.catholic.com/library/Abortion.asp Keep in mind that not all Christian practices and beliefs are explicity spelled out in scripture. In discussing abortion in the light of Christianity (including scripture), there are some essentials that must be noticed. The Bible unequivocally ""tells"" us that abortion is wrong and in stark contrast to the Christian message. It does that in the nativity of the Gospel of Luke and it does that in the Passion narratives of the four Gospels. The Christian story is about birth, creation, joy, and perseverance. It is also about sacrifice for others and giving life. Father Frank Pavone illustrates this by describing a remarkable contrast in thought on abortion between abortion supporters and Christ. Abortion supporters say, ""This is my body, I can do with it what I want. I can destroy others to preserve my life. I can destroy others so that I may live as I want. Do not interfere with me."" Whereas, Christ says, ""This is my body, which is given up for you."" ""This is my body""--same words but much different in intent, in action, in charity, in love, in faith, in hope... Jesus gives his body away so that others live. Abortion proponents cling to their own bodies so that others die.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","08:23 PM","abortion-debates","10"

But if you can find in reading chicken guts, the richness and depth of thought that you find in the Catholic Church, then you are indeed a powerful mystic and soothsayer. The Church and its priests do not seek to erase the love and sexual feelings that men naturally have toward women (in your words they do not seek to act like they don't ""want some""). They seek to control them and sacrifice them for a higher love. They are not pretending that they do not exist. If they don't then you are probably dealing with an unhealthy individual who may not be fit for the priesthood. Secondly, there is much basis to the Catholic Church's teachings on celibacy. It is not without foundation. These are not made up laws with made up enforcement. Thirdly, if you believe celibacy to be related to the perversion of pedophilia then I have a few questions for you: Have you ever had thoughts of having sex with a child when you were in a celibate period in your life? Would being in close proximity to children in a position of authority instigate in you inclinations to molest children? If for some reason, your significant other died or lived but for health reasons could no longer have sex would you consider pedophilia as a normal sexual outlet/interaction? If you were required to be celibate your entire life do you think that you would be attracted to children? And if celibacy is the problem then why does pedophilia occur in Protestant congregations at a similar rate when the pastor is not required to be celibate? Pedophilia is a perversion, a sickness, a disorder. It has little to do with celibacy.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","09:55 PM","abortion-debates","14"

"03-16-2005","4337",2,"Cahuella","None","The church is unfit to rule on abortion because it acts on what benefits them or they're ideas. Like what I quoted, saying that ""Thou shalt not kill."" Thousands of not millions of people are killed in wars. The Crusades is an example. It does not say ""Thou shalt not kill except when trying to claim territory or to land or if the person being killed disagrees with you religiously."" It doesn't say that. The church seems to decide when it will follow it's rules, and when not. Yes, war is sometimes a neccessary method of self defense, but the many of the Crusades were not neccessary. Most of them were failures, but Christianity is still the second biggest religion in the world (if not the first). The church can't be allowed to rule on abortion when they disregard their own laws. Like the above quote, why is the church trying to stop abortion when they would consider one to be alive after taking a breath. if you were to look at it from a scientific standpoint, the individual ovum and sperm are living cells, but they die all the time and no one cares. An embryo or fetus is something starting to develop into a human and that can't be stopped without killing it or injecting differnt DNA, but it's still not too different from sperm and ovum.

"03-17-2005","4337",3,"Parcum","None","Your thesis is full of errors, Sigma. As many people don't understand in modern time, you don't seem to understand the reality and nature of sex, and what it is. In addition, you don't seem to understand the Catholic Church; I don't claim to understand it fully either, neither do I claim that the church is perfect, but you're clearly in a very closed-minded state where you believe that the Catholic Church only can be evil, as you want to keep your anti-theistic views. The truth of the matter is, there is absolutely no evidence that celibacy causes pedophilia, and in addition no evidence that the Church is evil as you make it to be. First of all, celibacy is not dogma, but is practiced only by one branch of the Catholic Church, the Western (Roman) Rite, and even then allows some exceptions, though rare. In fact, celibacy is only a symbol of obedience and commitment to the Church, and not to the family life. If it were dogmatic, we would have biblical evidence requiring priests to live celibate lives, but the only biblical evidence we have is Paul saying it was a good thing for the religious to live celibate lives. The Western Rite has kept this tradition since the 900s, I believe, but many other Catholics (such as Byzantine, Russian, Ruthenian, Anglican-Converts, Melkite, Coptic, Ethiopian, Maronite, etc.) still follow the original church law that allowed priests to marry. The Catholic Church's view on sex is the following: Sex is to keep a marriage united, and for procreation. If you use sex in any other terms, it can be detrimental to a relationship. Sex is NOT to be used when two people simply ""love"" eachother, as it means a lot more than that. Sex means absolute commitment to a relationship and willingness to have what nature brings, children. As for celibacy in the priesthood, this has absolutely nothing to do with not being able to control sexual desires and using children to fulfill them. In fact, if celibacy caused priests to molest children, it would be much more common than it is- a very, very, small number of priests molest children. Priests can easily have sexual relationships with adults, more easily than having them with children. What the church is actually suffering from is a miscommunication with men and women suffering from the homosexual disorder. Many Catholics believe that homosexuals simply ""choose"" to be homosexual, and that they can easily have relationships with the opposite sex, but such events don't occur. Especially for homosexual women, relationships with the oppisate sex can be very difficult. Hence, homosexuals seek the religious life to stay away from sin and be accepted in the Catholic community- I know of a few priests who have done this. Though this can be a good thing, many homosexuals also have pedophile tendancies, and this is where we get that VERY SMALL portion of the population that molests children. About the Catholic Church being an ""evil business"", I can't help but think that you have been completely brianwashed by popular belief in society today among non-religious and many protestants alike. The Catholic Church is no business, and is certainly not inherently evil, although much evil is in the church (mainly because this is satan's biggest threat). 1) The Journal of Sex Research reported that 32% of pedophiles are homosexual men , even though homosexual men only make up 3-4% of the population. Archives of Sexual Behavior reported that 86% of 229 convicted child molesters identified themselves as homosexual or bisexual. 2) We're not talking about rape, but about molestation. The two are different. The cases in the Catholic church were unoften rape, but molestation.","Sigma","99214","Hardly a thesis, and not even an argument. It is a personal opinion, which requires neither logic nor reason. And, of course, the church knows I have a fair idea the reality and nature of sex, moreso than any religious teachings. I've never viewed it as evil, just as self-centered and lacking in any moral authority. It's a cult, and I view it as such. I never suggested celibacy causes pedophilia, I maintain that celibacy contributes to sexual immorality. I am curious how many of the priests who molest these children were celibate, whether or not it was part of the practice of their particular branch. Why don't these others agree with Paul that it is a good thing? I'll propose an alternative view. Sex, whether between Catholics, Hindus, Christians, Buddists, Jews or any other religion or lack thereof usually means that one or both parties were horny. Truly, I see so little use for the rules and restricts that the church places upon it's members. I can see no benefit to life, in fact I see a decrease in the joy and pleasure I take in life to be a part of that. More than that the entire premise seems ridiculous. And aren't there a very very small number of priests practising celibacy? That seems to match up. I wouldn't know. Your assertion that all these priests could ""easily"" have relationship with other adults and all of the molesting priests must have been homosexual is not something I believe. There is no way I can prove it, but neither can you. I don't think I said it was evil. I said sexual immorality is inherent or inevitable given the system in place. That doesn't seem to support your view. The majority of pedophiles are straight, according to this. Why 229? Where they taken from a specific place? That number seems awfully specific, so it implies that it was taken from a specific sample. Molestation also depends on availability.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","04:05 PM","abortion-debates","39"

Trust me, I learned more about the ghetto than I ever wanted to. I kept a baseball bat in my locker and a knife in my boot for survival, ALWAYS. Interracial fights were a daily, and I mean DAILY, occurance. And the bussed whites were typically easy targets, unless they adopted the same behaviors as the troublemaking blacks. We formed loose gangs that countered the gang mentality that prevailed in the black neighborhood that we were bussed to.

As such, it is rather hard to be PL and not a mysogynist, unless your PL leanings go towards reducing the need for abortions rather than restricting the access to abortion. Yes, it is entirely possible to be prolife by seeking to encourage the woman to not about through support and better prevention. However, most PL don't go that route and instead go the misogynistic route of trying to take the woman's rights away. Using the stick instead of the carrot is what makes so many PL into misoginists. Note that if you instead focused on reducing the NEED for an abortion through better prevention and more support of pregnant women, then you would have instant support from the prochoice community. IF PL had put energy into that direction instead of the misogynistic one of controlling women, the number of abortions today would be much, much less. However, the PL generally have gone the other way, to ward moralistic/theocratic punitive enslavement of women instead. They chose to be misogynists instead of supportive of the woman. hence, it is REALLY hard for PC to believe that PL is not about using abortion as a means of subjugating women. So how can we NOT see you as misogynists? If you truly wanted to reduce the number of abortions, you could have long ago. Instead, you have chosen the attempt at restricting women, and years of legal battles have done little to reduce the numbers.

And it also goes through a whole bunch f other stuff. perhaps if you read Section IX in its entitery, would you get a clue (findlaw, copyright 1994-2005): http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/script...=410&invol=113 IX The District Court held that the appellee failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that the Texas statute's infringement upon Roe's rights was necessary to support a compelling state interest, and that, although the appellee presented ""several compelling justifications for state presence in the area of abortions,"" the statutes outstripped these justifications and swept ""far beyond any areas of compelling state interest."" 314 F. Supp., at 1222-1223. Appellant and appellee both contest that holding. Appellant, as has been indicated, claims an absolute right that bars any state imposition of criminal penalties in the area. Appellee argues that the State's determination to recognize and protect prenatal life from and after conception constitutes a compelling state interest. As noted above, we do not agree fully with either formulation. A. The appellee and certain amici argue that the fetus is a ""person"" within the language and meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. In support of this, they outline at length and in detail the well-known facts of fetal development. If this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant's case, of course, collapses, [410 U.S. 113, 157] for the fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment. The appellant conceded as much on reargument. 51 On the other hand, the appellee conceded on reargument 52 that no case could be cited that holds that a fetus is a person within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Constitution does not define ""person"" in so many words. Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment contains three references to ""person."" The first, in defining ""citizens,"" speaks of ""persons born or naturalized in the United States."" The word also appears both in the Due Process Clause and in the Equal Protection Clause. ""Person"" is used in other places in the Constitution: in the listing of qualifications for Representatives and Senators, Art. I, 2, cl. 2, and 3, cl. 3; in the Apportionment Clause, Art. I, 2, cl. 3; 53 in the Migration and Importation provision, Art. I, 9, cl. 1; in the Emolument Clause, Art. I, 9, cl. 8; in the Electors provisions, Art. II, 1, cl. 2, and the superseded cl. 3; in the provision outlining qualifications for the office of President, Art. II, 1, cl. 5; in the Extradition provisions, Art. IV, 2, cl. 2, and the superseded Fugitive Slave Clause 3; and in the Fifth, Twelfth, and Twenty-second Amendments, as well as in 2 and 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment. But in nearly all these instances, the use of the word is such that it has application only postnatally. None indicates, with any assurance, that it has any possible pre-natal application. 54 [410 U.S. 113, 158] All this, together with our observation, supra, that throughout the major portion of the 19th century prevailing legal abortion practices were far freer than they are today, persuades us that the word ""person,"" as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not include the unborn. 55 This is in accord with the results reached in those few cases where the issue has been squarely presented. McGarvey v. Magee-Womens Hospital, 340 F. Supp. 751 (WD Pa. 1972); Byrn v. New York City Health & Hospitals Corp., 31 N. Y. 2d 194, 286 N. E. 2d 887 (1972), appeal docketed, No. 72-434; Abele v. Markle, 351 F. Supp. 224 (Conn. 1972), appeal docketed, No. 72-730. Cf. Cheaney v. State, ___ Ind., at ___, 285 N. E. 2d, at 270; Montana v. Rogers, 278 F.2d 68, 72 (CA7 1960), aff'd sub nom. Montana v. Kennedy, 366 U.S. 308 (1961); Keeler v. Superior Court, 2 Cal. 3d 619, 470 P.2d 617 (1970); State v. Dickinson, 28 [410 U.S. 113, 159] Ohio St. 2d 65, 275 N. E. 2d 599 (1971). Indeed, our decision in United States v. Vuitch, 402 U.S. 62 (1971), inferentially is to the same effect, for we there would not have indulged in statutory interpretation favorable to abortion in specified circumstances if the necessary consequence was the termination of life entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection. This conclusion, however, does not of itself fully answer the contentions raised by Texas, and we pass on to other considerations. B. The pregnant woman cannot be isolated in her privacy. She carries an embryo and, later, a fetus, if one accepts the medical definitions of the developing young in the human uterus. See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 478-479, 547 (24th ed. 1965). The situation therefore is inherently different from marital intimacy, or bedroom possession of obscene material, or marriage, or procreation, or education, with which Eisenstadt and Griswold, Stanley, Loving, Skinner, and Pierce and Meyer were respectively concerned. As we have intimated above, it is reasonable and appropriate for a State to decide that at some point in time another interest, that of health of the mother or that of potential human life, becomes significantly involved. The woman's privacy is no longer sole and any right of privacy she possesses must be measured accordingly. Texas urges that, apart from the Fourteenth Amendment, life begins at conception and is present throughout pregnancy, and that, therefore, the State has a compelling interest in protecting that life from and after conception. We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer. [410 U.S. 113, 160] It should be sufficient to note briefly the wide divergence of thinking on this most sensitive and difficult question. There has always been strong support for the view that life does not begin until live birth. This was the belief of the Stoics. 56 It appears to be the predominant, though not the unanimous, attitude of the Jewish faith. 57 It may be taken to represent also the position of a large segment of the Protestant community, insofar as that can be ascertained; organized groups that have taken a formal position on the abortion issue have generally regarded abortion as a matter for the conscience of the individual and her family. 58 As we have noted, the common law found greater significance in quickening. Physicians and their scientific colleagues have regarded that event with less interest and have tended to focus either upon conception, upon live birth, or upon the interim point at which the fetus becomes ""viable,"" that is, potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid. 59 Viability is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks. 60 The Aristotelian theory of ""mediate animation,"" that held sway throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance in Europe, continued to be official Roman Catholic dogma until the 19th century, despite opposition to this ""ensoulment"" theory from those in the Church who would recognize the existence of life from [410 U.S. 113, 161] the moment of conception. 61 The latter is now, of course, the official belief of the Catholic Church. As one brief amicus discloses, this is a view strongly held by many non-Catholics as well, and by many physicians. Substantial problems for precise definition of this view are posed, however, by new embryological data that purport to indicate that conception is a ""process"" over time, rather than an event, and by new medical techniques such as menstrual extraction, the ""morning-after"" pill, implantation of embryos, artificial insemination, and even artificial wombs. 62 In areas other than criminal abortion, the law has been reluctant to endorse any theory that life, as we recognize it, begins before live birth or to accord legal rights to the unborn except in narrowly defined situations and except when the rights are contingent upon live birth. For example, the traditional rule of tort law denied recovery for prenatal injuries even though the child was born alive. 63 That rule has been changed in almost every jurisdiction. In most States, recovery is said to be permitted only if the fetus was viable, or at least quick, when the injuries were sustained, though few [410 U.S. 113, 162] courts have squarely so held. 64 In a recent development, generally opposed by the commentators, some States permit the parents of a stillborn child to maintain an action for wrongful death because of prenatal injuries. 65 Such an action, however, would appear to be one to vindicate the parents' interest and is thus consistent with the view that the fetus, at most, represents only the potentiality of life. Similarly, unborn children have been recognized as acquiring rights or interests by way of inheritance or other devolution of property, and have been represented by guardians ad litem. 66 Perfection of the interests involved, again, has generally been contingent upon live birth. In short, the unborn have never been recognized in the law as persons in the whole sense.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","08:35 PM","abortion-debates","152"

Women becoming pregnant, in the vast majority of cases, engage willfully in an action that knowingly brings about their so called ""slavery."" They give informed consent, in effect, by engaging in an act that has known consequences. So it cannot be a slavery. It may be more aptly described as indentured servitude but even that is a poor description. 2.

Paul decrees, we must all obey, right or wrong.","maximus","112309","Simone, I would guess that you, like the others who cite only the ""submit"" sentence of Ephesians 5 might not have ever read it in its entirety. Let me post it for you so that you can see for yourself that Paul does not say an unsuitable man may be privileged enough to gain the submission of his wife. Nor does he say that she must obey him right or wrong. Ephesians 5 21 Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. 22Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. 23For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. 24Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. 25Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her 26to make her holy, cleansing[1] her by the washing with water through the word, 27and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. 28In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies . He who loves his wife loves himself. 29After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church-- 30for we are members of his body. 31""For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.""[2] 32This is a profound mystery--but I am talking about Christ and the church. 33However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself , and the wife must respect her husband. Submit to one another ? What does that mean? You mean the wife isn't the only one to have to submit? How much did Christ love the Church? He died for it. So Paul tells men that they must love their wives enough to die for her . (There is no greater love than this, that a man lay down his life for one he loves). Paul then tells men to love their wives as their own bodies . So if a man is not acting Christlike --if he is acting in an abusive, immoral, wrong way then there is no obligation for his wife to submit to him. Out of time. More on your other post later. I do wonder why you now say you don't consider yourself morally superior though when in the previous post you declared yourself to be morally superior.

Abandonment of a pregnant woman is so common throughout the world that we have not begun in the slightest degree to acquaint men with their responsibilities in regard to their sexuality. Men are empowered by patriarchal religions to have sexual access to as many women as they can seduce, rape, kidnap or otherwise secure with very few consequences, in most cases the victims, the women themselves, are punished for the transgressions of the men as if they were the criminal. This has been the case until very recently in most of the Christian world.

It is still a living organism which is being killed through the actions of others, regardless of whether it's viable or not at the time the ""procedure"" is performed.

Wednesday, March 30, 2005 Teen: Girl consented to abortion with bat Lawyer asks judge to dismiss charge against 16-year-old Richmond boy. By Jim Lynch / The Detroit News A 16-year-old Richmond boy could not have assaulted his girlfriend because she consented to being beaten with a miniature baseball bat to induce her miscarriage, his attorney argued Tuesday. The boy faces a felony charge of intentional conduct against a pregnant individual resulting in miscarriage or stillbirth, which could result in his remaining in custody until age 21. He is alleged to have struck his 16-year-old Armada Township girlfriend in the stomach over three weeks. Defense attorney Miranda Massie made arguments to support her request for a dismissal in the case. Judge Matt Switalski is expected to rule later on the argument. ""If you consent, there is no assault, plain and simple,"" she said, adding, ""there is no Michigan law to the contrary."" By asking her ""best friend and boyfriend"" to hit her with the bat, Massie argued the girl, now 17, was exercising her right to have an abortion. Therese Tobin, chief trial attorney for the Macomb Prosecutor's Office, said there is no state law that says a person can consent to battery. And she added, ""a person is not free to get an abortion at certain stages without public intervention."" The judge questioned whether the girl, at 16, was in a position to offer her consent. ""Did she enter into a valid contract?"" he asked. ""... In essence, she's getting herself an abortion without availing herself of what the Legislature says she has to do."" Switalski asked the defense to submit answers to a series of questions concerning the consent argument by April 8. Defense attorneys also plan to use the cause of death as a basis for dismissing the charges. Switalski did not hear arguments on that issue Tuesday. In January, Macomb County Medical Examiner Dr. Daniel Spitz ruled the fetus died of premature birth associated with trauma to the mother. In a brief filed earlier this month, Massie argued that there is no scientific way to determine exactly what caused the miscarriage in this case. ""Causation of miscarriage and fetal death defies scientific determination more than 50 percent of the time,"" she wrote. ""In this case, there was no prenatal medical care or observation and no medical care or observation at the time of the miscarriage, making reliable assessment of the cause of (the girl's) miscarriage impossible."" http://www.detnews.com/2005/macomb/0...C05-133229.htm","JPSartre12","120840","Huh?

Simply type "" bad priests "" on google search engines. ========================= We are the victims harmed by the Catholic priests in Rome at a top Catholic university ( Priest university). We lived with the priests(top priests from every country)in Rome, Italy. Inside the priests place, priests lived opposite to what they told to the public. They are living in luxury with unlimited good wine and good foods every meals. Inside priests talked about sex, their stealing stories and all the bad things without fear. I stayed there, priests telephoned and talked with me to request me to have sex with them openly. Priests intruded my bedroom and stole things and money from us. Priests used a lot of dirty tricks to get me into bed with them. Priests slience for what they did and protected each other after crime happening. Listen, those Roman Catholic priests who harmed us are still in and out of America as a good Catholic university professors, director, and spiritual director. One of them is the well-known book author and poet for Catholic studies. ===================================== I am writing to let the world know about how do the bad priests live in Rome,Italy. In a place call Convitto S. Tommaso (Via Degli Ibernesi 20, 00184 Rome, Italy Tel: 0669791601) The bad priests team up and cover up for one another. Here are what bad things they did to the general publics and against the general law and orders: 1. The Philippine Sister sleeps with the Fathers in Convitto S Tommaso in order to keep her job to stay in Rome not return to Philippine. 2. The head of the Father ( Father Luke) regularly calls the Sister to sleep with him in his room at night. 3. The head of the Father (Irish Fahter Luke) also lead every priest in Convitto S Tommasso drink. Every priests enjoy drinking unlimited supply of both white and red wine during their lunch and dinner time with plentiful and luxury supply of foods served by Philippine servant. Fathers are chatting women issue, travel Europe issues, and eating issues during their meals time with laughters. 4. Those Bad Fathers team up to cheat the tourists and innocent youngests money, valuable possession in Rome. You can find those bad fathers hide those cheating and stolen GOLD AND JEWEL somewhere in Convitto S Tommasso. 5. The bad Fathers against the Italian Law without feeling guilty - the walk into the public transportation often without paying ticket. 6. They use dirty tricks to decieve teenagers and kids to have fun sex with them. Those bad priests students from Convitto S Tommasso have learned that committing a crime is okay in Rome and the other Fathers will help them to cover up. Therefore,when they return to their own country, they just go on what they did in Rome - continuous to do bad things to harm to the general public and the society!","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","03:10 AM","abortion-debates","241"

I found that the followers were blind. That may be a harsh word, but the fact of the matter is, they want to believe in a God. A higher power. It consoles them, it makes them feel better. It also answers their questions about life. I've studied some of Einstein's theories, and I still cant understand half of it. However, for less intelligent people who can't understand almost all of it, resort to a blind belief dogma. It makes them feel better, and they now understand how things work. Its the lazy way out, and they become so immersed in it that soon they can't get out. There is no question about ""life"" in the womb, as ""life"" has been in the womb before the baby got in there.

Suddenly and without warning the teacher (who happened to be a very strong and fit fellow) grabbed the disciple by the hair and forced him under the water.

After all, I can imagine that it can be a sattisfying belief to think that there is someone watching over one, that one's existence does not end when one's body dies, or that there is a stated moral code one can follow and know with confidence that one is right. I can imagine that all of these aspects and many others make belief in God and the divinity of Jesus, along with the rest of Christian theology, seem ""right"". In this way, someone who becomes open-minded to these beliefs might find their belief reinforced by the emotional sattisfaction it gives them. That doesn't make the belief true. Budhists get much emotional sattisfaction from their beliefs despite the fact that they are entirely different from those of Christianity. Other religions also keep their adherents because of the sattisfaction that those adherence gain from those beliefs. All of these religions can't be right so the fact that a religious belief ""feels right"" is no evidence of it being right. That is why objective evidence is so important - and science is a systematic investigation and analysis of objective evidence. I would agree with you that there seems to be some objective evidence of Jesus' existence. However, there is no objective evidence of his divinity. Indeed, even among the earliest Christians, there was quite a wide range of belief about the divinity or role of Jesus.

What do you claim that all religions have in common outside of the idea that our existence might transcend the physical? Even if you were to claim only that - i.e. all religions (that I can think of) believe that our existence can somehow transcend the physical - then how can one actually address the question of what is it that exists external to that physical self? One would think that, with 6 billion people on this planet, some evidence would show itself in a way that is observable by critical skeptics. I personally would love it if such evidence showed itself ... so far I haven't heard about any.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","12:08 PM","abortion-debates","280"

As I said in my first reply in this thread, ""A person can't find God for the same reason a thief can't find a policeman; it's because that person isn't looking for him."" Here's a really neat story: Once upon a time there was a teacher and his disciple. Early every morning they would go down to the river to bathe. One morning, as they were walking to the river, the disciple asked the teacher a most profound question, ""teacher, why have I been unable to find God?"" but the teacher did not say a single word. When they arrived at the river they both waded up to their chests. Suddenly and without warning the teacher (who happened to be a very strong and fit fellow) grabbed the disciple by the hair and forced him under the water. The disciple struggled to get free but couldn't. Just moments before the disciple opened his mouth to take in water the teacher pulled him to the surface. Upon breaking the water's surface the disciple began gasping for air. Yelling at the teacher he said, ""why did you do that for?"" The teacher replied, ""when you were under the water, what was the one thing you wanted more than anything else in the world?"" and the disciple said, ""Why, a breath of air"" to which the teacher replied, ""when you want God as much as you wanted that breath of air - then you will find Him.""","Shooterandproud","249001","Thats darling and all, but what happens when you're not really under water? What if you're just closing your eyes and holding your breath, thinking that you were underwater? But when you finally open your eyes, there is no river or water anywhere in sight. One should keep an open mind about life and its meaning, and not keep it closed and narrow because you're afraid of ""losing god"" or ""going to hell"" or something of that sort.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","09:16 PM","abortion-debates","281"

Gods thinking is split by that prism into many colours. Which is the correct one ? How can there be any wrong ones ?"" Good question: Many religions teach that we are gods. Atheism says there is no God. Christianity (along with Judaism and Islam) teach that we are a creation of God and that God is the Creator of all things. Jesus claimed He was God in the flesh. He either was or He wasn't - it can't be both. There is a verse in the Bible that addresses your question, ""Which is the correct one ? How can there be any wrong ones?"" There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death. - Proverbs 14:12 I came here to give you solid, verifiable evidence that the Bible is, in fact, true. I'm not saying that I can prove by the use of physical evidence that Jesus was (and therefore still is) God (that takes saving faith) but I can prove to you that the Bible (in particular, the Old Testament) is historically accurate. But first, check this out ... Ever notice how logical and well ordered musical notes are? That music has an audible 'range' and that all the varieties of music we have come to know and enjoy all come from just 12 notes? And how there are harmonies, and how there can be only one musician or hundreds at a time and it all sounds good but in different ways? How it's a language unto itself that transends the barriers of different societies, customs and languages? And all the different instruments that work in harmony with each other? How can a single cell in a woman's womb grow, thru binary division, to become flesh, and bones, and organs, and hair and blood and my oh my how complex the human body is (and to think that our body is made of just water and dirt) - and all of it orchestrated to work in harmony together - like a symphony? And we haven't even touched on what the soul is, and personality and emotions and reasoning and the human mind ? Consider the earth, what makes it continue to turn on it's axis (after all, it turns in an environment that contains air so there is resistance to motion since it's not in the vacuum of space)? How can it be that the sun (a huge thermo-nuclear reactor) is perfectly placed at exactly the correct distance from the earth to ensure a very specific temperature range and to exert a pull to keep us from floating off into space? The earth turns on its axis at about 1000 mph while the earth travels through space (thereby meeting the definition of a spaceship - yes, we are space travellers) around the sun at about 67,000 mph while our solar system is in movement within the Milky Way galaxy which is in movement through space? Ever compare an aerial view of a hurricane with a photo of a galaxy (do an image search for hurricane Francis and M-51, the Whirlpool Galaxy). ""Who has put wisdom in the inward parts or given understanding to the mind?"" - Job 38:36 Did you know that it's a verifiable fact that there are more ancient manuscripts in existance for the books of the New Testament in the Holy Bible than any other historical document(s)? Ever heard of the Tell el-Amarna tablets, the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III of Assyria, the Moabite Stone (also called Stele of Mesha, king of Moab and last I heard it was on display at the Louvre in Paris) and don't pass this one by ... the terra cotta and baked clay cylinder of Sennacherib, king of Assyria - all which confirm the historical accuracy of recorded events in the Old Testament (names of Israelite King(s), places, events, wars with Israel, etc). You wanted proof that would show you whether or not the Bible was true, now you have some proof that is based on verifiable historical evidence.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","04:21 AM","abortion-debates","284"

Whenever I see a sentence begin with 'obviously' I say, ""ut oh"" (but I confess I sometimes do it too and when I catch it I say the same thing - ut oh). Let me see if I have the meaning of that sentence correct. It states that since the synagogue authorities allowed Jesus to preach, then Jesus couldn't possibly be a carpenter. Does that make any sense to any of you? I mean, I'm a janitor by trade and my pastor allows me to preach sometimes, yet I'm still a janitor by trade. Did the Jews have some kind of law forbidding a carpenter from preaching? Nope. Also, I do not recall Jesus needing anyone's permission to do anything. He was, after all, God. God doesn't need our permission, we need His. The only place I know of in the New Testament where someone commands Jesus was His mom Mary - when she said, ""there's no more wine."" and He said, ""woman, what's that to me?"" and she turns to the servant and says, ""do whatever He tells you to do."" And so began Jesus' ministry. But then God did say ""Honor your mother and your father."" and He sure did set a wonderful example. Mark 6:3 (KJV) Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him. "" And they were offended at Him."" they're not the only ones, hu? "" Is this not the carpenter, the son of Mary ..."" I see it's a very explicit sentence, it means what it says and it says what it means. Some folks say things like, ""there are books missing from the Bible"" or ""well, it could be that it was written like such and such ..."" one thing about opinions is, everyone has one. As I mentioned earlier, it's God's opinion I seek, not my own. Afterall, He's the one who invented opinons, and thinking and reasoning, the earth, all creation and the spirit realm .... Jesus is a very busy God.
