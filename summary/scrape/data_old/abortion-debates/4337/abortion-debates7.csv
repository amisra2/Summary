Sometimes they havent...sometimes they have...in either case no need to blame a sex as a whole or a race as a whole. It wasn't the Jews fault that Germany lost in WWI right? Seems to me instead of pointing fingers why doesn't one invite people into their homes and give a helping hand for a change?","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","11:47 AM","abortion-debates","91"

A true pro-lifer just doesn't say the women is wrong and the kid should live...they help out.","Steen","101627","Really? And you of course reported this to the police as killing kids is outright illegal. It, of course, has NOTHING to do with abortions. Well, that's nice. So you are saying that the absolute vast majority of those who call themselves prolife, they are not true prolife?","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","11:58 AM","abortion-debates","93"

"03-26-2005","4337",7,"Steeeeve","None","like I told you pro-life doesn't mean abortion only....it means we value life...a culture of life....this included helping people less fortunate then you or I.","Steen","101631","But you don't value the pregnant woman as an individual person similar to others; instead insisting that she can be forced to give off her bodily resources against her will, a duty you refuse on yourself. Once prolifers speak for forced blood and organ donation, THEN your argument has merit. Until then, it is simply whitewash of prolife desire to subjugate women and make them second-class citizens","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","12:01 PM","abortion-debates","96"
"03-26-2005","4337",7,"simone","None","jitobear, I am deeply sorry about the experiences you have had with men. Your experience is only too, too true. Men in our culture are worshipped as being next to God in the Christian religion and are not encouraged to grow up into responsible, real human beings with respect for women. I was fortunate to grow up in a relatively non-Christian culture where more was expected from men--and I never ran into any major problems of abuse and disrespect until I lived for a spell in very Roman Catholic Alburquerque, New Mexico.","JPSartre12","101633","The more that I read your posts, the more convinced that you have lived a rather sheltered life. First, there's no such thing as a monolithic Christian culture. There are shades of gray everywhere. In the North, two-income families with shared responsibilities, are the norm. I'm not seeing a lot of foot-kissing going on here. In the South, there are areas where more strict Christian beliefs are practiced, but I'd hardly say that the men aren't responsible. Quite the contrary, in many strict households, the husband is the sole breadwinner and may work multiple jobs to make ends meet. I'd hardly call that being worshipped and irresponsible. Where did you live that was relatively ""non-Christian"" in the US? I can't think of too many places other than nearby Dearborn, MI which has a very high Middle East population where women are certainly not treated as equals with men.

I am not forcing women to give up their resources but rather letting the unborn child live. When one sees it from that way one can see that the right to life would override any right to not give up body resources. The blood thing has been posted a million times. We don't support forced things like that in US. We support every person having their rights. Right to live is at the top of the list. There is no ""right to force to give blood""...this makes no sense. There is a right to life and that is what we are talking about.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","12:07 PM","abortion-debates","99"

As a matter of fact, a number of Christian groups created an underground to ensure that women could have access to safe abortion prior to the Roe v. Wade decision. You cite a great many instances of truth. Unfortunately, if a female is considered as having morally ""slipped"" under these strict rules she has lowered her status to that of a prostitute and is no longer respected and protected--in fact, her life may be subject to abuse and possible death--something like the Middle Eastern culture you cite in your next paragraph. I grew up in the very Christian American Midwest but I lived in a tribal Scandinavian family where we had our own rules of conduct, which rules were generally morally superior to the Christian culture surrounding us.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","12:14 PM","abortion-debates","100"

Just like I wouldn't force you to give your blood but rather letting the bleeding patient live. Or are you saying that a sentient person has LESS ""right to life"" than does an embryo? And we therefore can force a person to give blood against their will if it would save a life. And we could also force them to give the extra kidney they carry if it would save the life of a dialysis patient. That is guaranteed to save 50,000-60,000 lives in the US each year. So are you ready to be forced to give a kidney, even against your will? After all, it will save somebody's right to life and therefore override your right to not give up body resources. And after all, live kidney donation is even safer than giving birth, so you are even getting a good deal here. When should we send somebody to pick you up for your forced kidney removal? So you are NOT into forcing women to give of their bodily resources against their will. OK, that's great. You have just become prochoice Yes, the right to live by taking whatever resources from others that is needed to survive, right? So you are denying the bleeding patient's right to life because you don't want another person to be forced to give blood. Hmm, and yet you want to excert exactly such action on the pregnant woman. So either you are confused, or your point is hypocritical. Well, you claim so. But you are saying that it only applies to the embryo or fetus, not to the bleeder or the kidney patient; they somehow are lesser beings than the embryo? Ok, we got your position very clear now.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","12:27 PM","abortion-debates","102"

"03-26-2005","4337",7,"simone","None","Oh Blast! That tiresome old argument about ""bleeding heart liberals""! Give it a bloody rest!! That weary old argument has been beaten to death and needs a peaceful death--at long last. And, you are a pisspoor scholar of history if you think that our nation's heritage of slavery bears no consequences. How did these denizens of the ""inner city"" land upon our illustrious, blessed shores if not upon slave boats? How mightily our nation has prospered with the unpaid laborers, the fruits of which we still enjoy today--even if the denizens of the inner city have not been allowed that privilege. Well! Bully for all of your illustrious ancestors! Alas! Only if the grave mistakes of history could be written off in 7 generations or so. But, that is not the way of the real world.","JPSartre12","101660","How's your history? International slave trade ended in 1804, IIRC, so the last slave to hit the shore of the US did so 201 years ago. The illegitimacy rate amongst blacks in the 1940's was ~20%. After LBJ's War on Poverty and >$6Trillion dollars in social engineering spending, that rate is now over 70% in many inner cities. Is there a relationship between Welfare and illegitimacy? YOU BETCHA! And who controlled the Whitehouse, House of Representatives and Senate during the rise of the Welfare Nation? Bleeding heart liberals like LBJ, Ted Kennedy, Hubert Humphrey. Again, your history is shaky. The impact of slavery was far less than your mellifluous statement above implies. With the rise of the Industrial Revolution, slavery's economic impact was almost exclusively in the South and even there it was losing its benefit in the early 1800's when many slaves were being freed because it wasn't economically-sound to keep them. Do I detect a note of sarcasm? As I said above, the last international slave ship landed in 1804. The last slave was freed in 1865, 141 years ago. Affirmative Action, Welfare, quotas, set-asides, etc., have all been put in place to redress past discrimination. So, my question to you is ""how long does it take? 300 years? 500 years? a millenium?"" Japan and Germany went from burned out, bombed out countries to world powers in less than 1/4 of the time since slavery ended at a cost that was far less.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","12:31 PM","abortion-debates","104"

A person bleeding that needs blood has the right to life but no one can force the guy next to him to give his blood. We are assuming a right to do what you want with your own resources exists....How is not giving them blood the same thing as having an abortion? I guess a women could starve herself to not give the baby resources if she wanted. This would be the same act as not giving the blood. However, an abortion kills the kid. Right to life overrides this...but this is all assuming a right to ""not give up resources"".","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","12:34 PM","abortion-debates","105"
