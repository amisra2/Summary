"03-26-2005","4337",9,"Steen","None","Yes. lets That is a claim that there is a right to life for the bleeder. That is a claim that there is NOT a right to life for the bleeder. I wish you would make up your mind. Does the bleeder have the right to life, or only as long as it doesn't involve taking a person's bodily resources against their will? Yes, you can't be forced to give it against your will, even if it could save a life. In both cases, you are restricting the access to your bodily resources when it means that another ""life"" will not survive. As such, the ""right to life"" is not above the right to control your own bodily resources. She can not, actually, unless she starves herself to death. You are not saying that you have to die to not be forced to give blood, are you?","Steeeeve","101779","....Once again, THe bleeder has a right to life...I even said that when you said ""you claim he doesnt have a right to life""... In your bad example of the bleeder we have more than one issue...blood type might not even be the same...but you are referring to forcing people to go to a blood bank. I do think you are missing the point though. THe bleeder is not dieing as a result of something you did to harm it...it is a result of you not giving the blood (body resource)....so if you relate the same thing to the women then the women could only kill the baby by not giving it resources. No one is forcing you right? You can just stop eating. IF you use the example of the bleeder again...a women aborts the kid..this would be to compare the bleeder being shot in the face by the person that doesn't want to donate blood.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","08:21 PM","abortion-debates","121"
"03-26-2005","4337",9,"JPSartre12","None","Abortion isn't just a political issue. It's a moral issue, so why are you surprised that a Christian would take the moral, pro-life position?","Steen","101826","Actually, the prolife amoral position of enslaving women is not particularly Christian. The Christian prochoice position of seeing the woman as a person in her own rights, that is certainly moraly defensible.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","10:44 PM","abortion-debates","122"

I guess if you have no moral compass anything can be considered true north.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","11:42 PM","abortion-debates","123"

I am not surprised, as the PL rarrely see the woman as anything but a walking womb. Misogyny like that is rampant in the PL community.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","12:12 AM","abortion-debates","124"
"03-27-2005","4337",9,"Steeeeve","None","Since when are pro-lifers all men? I think we have more women at my pro-life group","jitobear","101922","So? There are plenty of mysoginistic women.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","12:16 PM","abortion-debates","125"

Pregnancy doesn't equal slavery. Nice try, though. Do play again.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","01:11 PM","abortion-debates","126"
"03-27-2005","4337",9,"JPSartre12","None","Pregnancy doesn't equal slavery.","Steen","101943","But forced pregnancy cerainly does.

LOL","simone","101965","OK, so you absolutely, positively, keep your word 100% of the time, no matter what the circumstances, like even if you had to chop an arm off to keep your word. I'm not claiming to be a perfect human being who is godlike and always able to keep my word. I'm afraid that I would be a liar if I made such a claim.

But to the topic. I don't think every pro-life woman is a misogynist. I don't think every pro-choice woman isn't. It's about the value you place on women and their life experiences. I think your views are misogynistic - although I acknowledge I don't believe it is your intent to be. Your idealistic haze about babies has the realities of women lost in its mist.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","03:00 PM","abortion-debates","131"
