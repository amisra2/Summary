The fact that they aren't in the constitution doesn't mean they are not people. nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. By person they mean human life...don't agree? We could then say a slave is not a person.....so while life might not mean person...human life does. The Constitution does not define ""person"" in so many words. Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment contains three references to ""person."" The first, in defining ""citizens,"" speaks of ""persons born or naturalized in the United States."" in nearly all these instances, the use of the word is such that it has application only postnatally. None indicates, with any assurance, that it has any possible pre-natal application In areas other than criminal abortion, the law has been reluctant to endorse any theory that life, as we recognize it, begins before live birth or to accord legal rights to the unborn except in narrowly defined situations and except when the rights are contingent upon live birth","Sigma","102600","You have that backwards. The fact that they are not people means they are not covered by the Constitution. You said: I am going to give you a chance to correct that before I post this... That's quite arrogant of you. I care nothing for your approval, so your implied threat is laughable. I bolded the important bit. Like I said, it refers to ""persons"" No, they do not mean human life. and and","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","04:24 PM","abortion-debates","166"

The comparison breaks down on two important points that come to mind: 1. Slaves did not initiate their slavery of their own volition. They were mislead or forcibly bound and abducted. Women becoming pregnant, in the vast majority of cases, engage willfully in an action that knowingly brings about their so called ""slavery."" They give informed consent, in effect, by engaging in an act that has known consequences. So it cannot be a slavery. It may be more aptly described as indentured servitude but even that is a poor description. 2. I would guess that most slaves, even in the midst of the dire and dreadful circumstances in which they existed, would still choose slavery to save their children. They would choose to bind themselves and their children rather than kill them. I do not believe many would sacrifice their children for freedom. Although many might sacrifice themselves for their children's freedom. It seems that most even endured a life of misery for themselves rather than suicide.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","04:14 PM","abortion-debates","172"
"04-24-2005","4337",12,"maximus","None","Simone, Although disrespect of women may be a behavior of Christian men, I do not believe you would find it the norm. When it occurs, it is not an upholding of Christian doctrine but rather a contradiction of it. One need only read Ephesians 5:21-33 to see the teaching of Christianity on this subject in its very beginning.","simone","111608","Ah, yes, Paul's text where he puts down exacly what the position of women are to be in relationship to men, subject to their leadership, Christlike, to be the head of the wife as Christ is head of the church, whether or not a man may be suitable for such a position. Paul decrees, we must all obey, right or wrong.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","04:17 PM","abortion-debates","173"
"04-24-2005","4337",12,"maximus","None","Simone, 1. How have you judged moral superiority--what is your source and foundation for judgement? How can one morality be superior to another? Does this imply an objective standard of morality? How does this gel with the tradtional pro-choice position that morality is relative to situation of the mother, etc. 2. Why is it good, in your opinion, to have life-long marriages without infidelity? What does it mean to honor a vow? Does one honor it because it is worthy of honor? Is a marriage that is honored much different than one that is sanctified? 3. Why were those that did not uphold their marriage vows thought of badly? How is this thinking badly by those who were upholding their vows different then being ""hypocritical about the sanctity of marriage?"" 4. How are your rules of conduct superior to the Christian rules of conduct surrounding marriage when they sound like they are the same rules?","simone","111614","I do not judge myself to have moral superiority. I just live by what I judge to be the right way. Furthermore, I do not see what abortion has to do with morality. Abortion is not something that is subject to a moral judgment. It is a private decision between a woman and her physician and anyone who intrudes into that intimate and privileged discussion betwen a woman and her physician is practicing medicine without a license and is imposing his or her medical misjudgments upon another without having the qualifications to do so. I am not saying that I believe it to be good. I am merely saying that was the custom within my family, that family members felt it had great value in stabilizing the family and that we are stong believers in real family values. OK, they were snotty about people who did not honor the vows of their marital contracts so they were guilty of judgment in that regard. We kept our snotty thoughts and statements to ourselves and did not go around intruding into the marriages of others who did not follow our customs and tell them they had to do it our way. OK, it was bad to have snotty thoughts and to gossip about marital dereliction but, geeze, the gossip was so witty. I'm saying that probably my family has been observing these rules for generations and generations and may have even been doing so before the advent of Christianity. It was just the decent thing to do. Christianity had nothing at all to do with it.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","04:30 PM","abortion-debates","174"
