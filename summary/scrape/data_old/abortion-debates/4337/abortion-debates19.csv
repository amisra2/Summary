His name is Jesus and even though he walked among people, most all folks didn't know who He was. If you're waiting for God to show up before you'll sign on, well, I believe He will be coming very soon but why wait when you can have forgiveness, soul-peace and joy now?","Shooterandproud","248869","Jesus never showed up.

So, if what I just said here is in fact true, then the real questions becomes - do you really want to know God? As I said in my first reply in this thread, ""A person can't find God for the same reason a thief can't find a policeman; it's because that person isn't looking for him."" Here's a really neat story: Once upon a time there was a teacher and his disciple. Early every morning they would go down to the river to bathe. One morning, as they were walking to the river, the disciple asked the teacher a most profound question, ""teacher, why have I been unable to find God?"" but the teacher did not say a single word. When they arrived at the river they both waded up to their chests. Suddenly and without warning the teacher (who happened to be a very strong and fit fellow) grabbed the disciple by the hair and forced him under the water. The disciple struggled to get free but couldn't. Just moments before the disciple opened his mouth to take in water the teacher pulled him to the surface. Upon breaking the water's surface the disciple began gasping for air. Yelling at the teacher he said, ""why did you do that for?"" The teacher replied, ""when you were under the water, what was the one thing you wanted more than anything else in the world?"" and the disciple said, ""Why, a breath of air"" to which the teacher replied, ""when you want God as much as you wanted that breath of air - then you will find Him.""","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","01:36 AM","abortion-debates","272"

"01-30-2007","4337",19,"Another opinion","248910","I have not doubt that those who believe in God and the divinity of Jesus can gain much emotional sattisfaction from such belief. After all, I can imagine that it can be a sattisfying belief to think that there is someone watching over one, that one's existence does not end when one's body dies, or that there is a stated moral code one can follow and know with confidence that one is right. I can imagine that all of these aspects and many others make belief in God and the divinity of Jesus, along with the rest of Christian theology, seem ""right"". In this way, someone who becomes open-minded to these beliefs might find their belief reinforced by the emotional sattisfaction it gives them. That doesn't make the belief true. Budhists get much emotional sattisfaction from their beliefs despite the fact that they are entirely different from those of Christianity. Other religions also keep their adherents because of the sattisfaction that those adherence gain from those beliefs. All of these religions can't be right so the fact that a religious belief ""feels right"" is no evidence of it being right. That is why objective evidence is so important - and science is a systematic investigation and analysis of objective evidence. I would agree with you that there seems to be some objective evidence of Jesus' existence. However, there is no objective evidence of his divinity. Indeed, even among the earliest Christians, there was quite a wide range of belief about the divinity or role of Jesus. Many early Christians did not believe that Jesus was divine.","peteratwar","248921","Interesting idea that all religions cannot be right. Why not. I have used the following analogy before.

What do you claim that all religions have in common outside of the idea that our existence might transcend the physical? Even if you were to claim only that - i.e. all religions (that I can think of) believe that our existence can somehow transcend the physical - then how can one actually address the question of what is it that exists external to that physical self? One would think that, with 6 billion people on this planet, some evidence would show itself in a way that is observable by critical skeptics. I personally would love it if such evidence showed itself ... so far I haven't heard about any.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","12:08 PM","abortion-debates","280"

What if you're just closing your eyes and holding your breath, thinking that you were underwater? But when you finally open your eyes, there is no river or water anywhere in sight. One should keep an open mind about life and its meaning, and not keep it closed and narrow because you're afraid of ""losing god"" or ""going to hell"" or something of that sort.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","09:16 PM","abortion-debates","281"

Gods thinking is split by that prism into many colours. Which is the correct one ? How can there be any wrong ones ?"" Good question: Many religions teach that we are gods. Atheism says there is no God. Christianity (along with Judaism and Islam) teach that we are a creation of God and that God is the Creator of all things. Jesus claimed He was God in the flesh. He either was or He wasn't - it can't be both. There is a verse in the Bible that addresses your question, ""Which is the correct one ? How can there be any wrong ones?"" There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death. - Proverbs 14:12 I came here to give you solid, verifiable evidence that the Bible is, in fact, true. I'm not saying that I can prove by the use of physical evidence that Jesus was (and therefore still is) God (that takes saving faith) but I can prove to you that the Bible (in particular, the Old Testament) is historically accurate. But first, check this out ... Ever notice how logical and well ordered musical notes are? That music has an audible 'range' and that all the varieties of music we have come to know and enjoy all come from just 12 notes? And how there are harmonies, and how there can be only one musician or hundreds at a time and it all sounds good but in different ways? How it's a language unto itself that transends the barriers of different societies, customs and languages? And all the different instruments that work in harmony with each other? How can a single cell in a woman's womb grow, thru binary division, to become flesh, and bones, and organs, and hair and blood and my oh my how complex the human body is (and to think that our body is made of just water and dirt) - and all of it orchestrated to work in harmony together - like a symphony? And we haven't even touched on what the soul is, and personality and emotions and reasoning and the human mind ? Consider the earth, what makes it continue to turn on it's axis (after all, it turns in an environment that contains air so there is resistance to motion since it's not in the vacuum of space)? How can it be that the sun (a huge thermo-nuclear reactor) is perfectly placed at exactly the correct distance from the earth to ensure a very specific temperature range and to exert a pull to keep us from floating off into space? The earth turns on its axis at about 1000 mph while the earth travels through space (thereby meeting the definition of a spaceship - yes, we are space travellers) around the sun at about 67,000 mph while our solar system is in movement within the Milky Way galaxy which is in movement through space? Ever compare an aerial view of a hurricane with a photo of a galaxy (do an image search for hurricane Francis and M-51, the Whirlpool Galaxy). ""Who has put wisdom in the inward parts or given understanding to the mind?"" - Job 38:36 Did you know that it's a verifiable fact that there are more ancient manuscripts in existance for the books of the New Testament in the Holy Bible than any other historical document(s)? Ever heard of the Tell el-Amarna tablets, the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III of Assyria, the Moabite Stone (also called Stele of Mesha, king of Moab and last I heard it was on display at the Louvre in Paris) and don't pass this one by ... the terra cotta and baked clay cylinder of Sennacherib, king of Assyria - all which confirm the historical accuracy of recorded events in the Old Testament (names of Israelite King(s), places, events, wars with Israel, etc). You wanted proof that would show you whether or not the Bible was true, now you have some proof that is based on verifiable historical evidence.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","04:21 AM","abortion-debates","284"
