"03-21-2005","4337",6,"JPSartre12","None","Single Moms raising innercity kids is a recipe for disaster. THERE IS NO CONTROLLING THEM unless you're physically bigger than them. One cavaet. The above is a generalization, and as such, excludes those cases to the contrary. I did know some kids living in the ghetto and raised by their moms that would never consider acting violent towards them. Unfortunately, I've found them to be the true minority.","simone","100137","Sartre, I agree with you totally in this instance. You have cited something that certainly appears to be widely true. And, this is the price our nation must pay for our history of slavery, of destroying African slave families by selling mothers and/or fathers away from children, from selling children away from parents. We are being punished for our unChristian cruelty. We are being punished for denying education and the other tools for rising above the debased state they had been reduced to by slavery. And, I will agree that you, Sartre, have been an innocent victim of this evil past of the United States--I am presuming that your family migrated to the U.S. after slavery had been abolished and that within your particular lineage there have been no historically recent slaveholders.

"03-21-2005","4337",6,"JPSartre12","None","A single mother is still NOT a father. Why do you think that we have a Lord of the Flies mentality in inner cities? It is because there isn't a strong male role model AND enforcer. The enforcer part is the most difficult for moms. They tend to be less strict than dads and lack the ""muscle"" to insure compliance. Pregnancy --------> fatherhood. I don't agree with the distinction. Actually, a high percentage of abortions are performed on women with kids already. I don't recall the % that are married though. Great, so if both agree to kill a child, it's OK? IMO, when the fetus is developed, I'd call it a conspiracy in that instance. Your justification for not allowing men to have any input on abortion law can be expanded to rationalize just about any position on any topic. Beastiality, pedophilia, etc., don't have any direct impact on me, either. Should I sit back and allow them as well?","jitobear","100160","I LIVE in the inner city. The brats that don't respect mom, don't because mom never demanded it. Growing up my dad was 6' ft and solid, my mom - 4'11"" - but she was the one I ran from..... Yes, but not automatically. Men, like women, choose to be parents - and there are plenty of men who choose to walk. I believe that. Current ratio of kids would definately impact whether you are able to provide for another, and I think adoption is harder in those cases - how do you explain that to the kids? How to you justify keeping some, but not the others? Plus the older a woman gets, the more likely there are to be medical risks. Okey dokey - call it what you like. I am just saying that it isn't likely going on behind the backs of a line-up of loving fathers. What are you talking about???!!!! Where did I say that men can't have any input? As I recall I said the opposite of that. What I did say is, whatever laws there are regarding abortion, they will not come close to impacting the lives of men as much as they will women. That's because women get pregnant. Those are just the facts. Why is this offensive or hard to grasp???","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","02:03 PM","abortion-debates","79"

Not one ounce of your health and life changes whether abortion is legal or not - it does with women. Those are just the plain old bilogical facts. and Originally Posted by jitobear Of course men can, do, and should have opinions and feelings about abortion, but to say that your interest is equal to that as a woman is silly. Men will never be pregnant, regardless of what laws stand, they impact men very little in any real way.","JPSartre12","101505","Ah, your Dad was present, though, correct? That's not the case with most inner city kids now. I Agree, sadly. The sad fact is that many married women have been using abortion as a means of birth control. That's why the number is high. I find that morally repulsive. Agreed, nor are they likely loving mothers themselves to be fair. Here's your statement that I was responding to: You were arguing that men shouldn't have an equal voice in abortion legislation because it didn't impact them. I just applied your ""logic"" to other situations to demonstrate how absurd it was.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","09:26 PM","abortion-debates","82"

I mostly avoided him, but I never feared him. But that's short sighted. If it's true we need to find out why and address that . Simply making it illegal won't do that. It's so ****ing hard to be pregnant - and so many women face it alone, regardless of the physical presence of men. I am not trying to be a bitch here, JP - but I have spent my whole life watching men hurt women, and pro-life people turn around and hurt women more. That isn't speculation. It's my reality. It's what I see everywhere I turn. My dad left. My son's dad does not care about him. I don't get child support. My friend only gets it if he decides to bother to work. My sister in law gets less and less support from her ex for his daughter even tho his income goes up and her's goes down. One in three women gets raped. Most violence visited upon women is perpetrated by people they know and are supposed to be able to trust. Not one of these men is demonized the way a woman faced with the hard choice of unplanned pregnancy is. Not one them gets a fraction of the derision. Not one. Not even all of them combined. And none of them will see legislation visited upon their very bodies. Despite all this I know there are good men and I searched for one for my son. The Catholics just tell me how every choice I make is evil - from divorce to birth control to getting my tubes tied. The Witnesses lost interest the minute I had any questions about what they believe. The Pentacostals had no time. When I finally did find someone who actually really did want to be a father to my son and who really loves him, they all came out of the woodwork telling me how I had done my son a disservice because this man is gay. I have seen you support that he is less worthy, less deserving. Conservative men aren't interested in the plight of me or my son - or any woman in a hard place, really - until we break your rules, and then suddenly the finger points at us and we are morally reprehensible??? This is what I have seen - from my father, to my son's father and on down. I am sorry if that is how you read it. It wasn't what I intended. They should have a voice - an equal one, possibly not, for pregnancy does not impact men and women equally - that's just reality.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","01:55 AM","abortion-debates","83"
