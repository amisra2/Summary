Men will never be pregnant, regardless of what laws stand, they impact men very little in any real way.","JPSartre12","99896","Pure conjecture on your part. As a father of three, I have as much vested interest in my kids as my wife has. To suggest otherwise is BS.

It was only three years ago that a my son's mentor came into ur lives as a co-parent. My son is nearly 11. And I once again - not talking about parenting, but rather pregnancy. I really don't think we have rapant abortions by women in loving relationships with men who are going to take care of their kids anyway. Are you really worried that your wife is going to have an abortion behind your back? Most women having an abortion are doing so with the guy's blessing, if he cares at all. And non of this changes the fact that it doesn't impact men in any real way. Not one ounce of your health and life changes whether abortion is legal or not - it does with women. Those are just the plain old bilogical facts.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","05:39 PM","abortion-debates","67"

I insist upon my right to my own moral and religious freedom, I will not be subject to a foreign entity that does not view women with respect.","maximus","99995","Can you tell me how, in your view, the Catholic Church does not view women with respect?

"03-20-2005","4337",5,"simone","None","Again, I salute you, Maximus, the Jesuitical application of the word ""ephebophilia,"" which I have also seen used by a high official in the Roman Catholic Church hoping to triviliaze pedophilia in the Church by calling it ""ephebophilia,"" and urging that this be considered a lesser crime--if, indeed, a crime at all.","maximus","99996","Simone, I salute you in knowing what a Jesuit is.

It is because there isn't a strong male role model AND enforcer. The enforcer part is the most difficult for moms. They tend to be less strict than dads and lack the ""muscle"" to insure compliance. Pregnancy --------> fatherhood. I don't agree with the distinction. Actually, a high percentage of abortions are performed on women with kids already. I don't recall the % that are married though. Great, so if both agree to kill a child, it's OK? IMO, when the fetus is developed, I'd call it a conspiracy in that instance. Your justification for not allowing men to have any input on abortion law can be expanded to rationalize just about any position on any topic. Beastiality, pedophilia, etc., don't have any direct impact on me, either. Should I sit back and allow them as well?","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","10:13 AM","abortion-debates","70"

Why the devil do ""enforcers"" as you call them have to be large and muscular? People like you damn women for being large and muscular, like men, in your opinion, then you damn women for not being large and muscular. Furthermore, in my family the women can enforce with their little finger and by God you'd better do what they say, and some of them are a tad tiny and scrawny.

I grew up in a middle class neighborhood in a very small town in NJ. As a result, we didn't have our own high school and were bussed to a nearby high school in a predominantly poor black ghetto neighborhood. Trust me, I learned more about the ghetto than I ever wanted to. I kept a baseball bat in my locker and a knife in my boot for survival, ALWAYS. Interracial fights were a daily, and I mean DAILY, occurance. And the bussed whites were typically easy targets, unless they adopted the same behaviors as the troublemaking blacks. We formed loose gangs that countered the gang mentality that prevailed in the black neighborhood that we were bussed to. Now, with that background, I can assure you that single, poor black women have ZERO control over many of their sons once their sons are physically big enough to drop Mom in a heartbeat (and by ""drop"", I mean physically knock her on her XXX). While you may have been raised in a middle-class white neighborhood in which kids didn't challenge their ""scrawny"" moms, in ""the hood"", it's a constant occurance and many single Moms live in fear from their kids who are twice their size and angry. Hence, when I speak about the Lord of the Flies mentality, I've seen it up close and personal. I've also seen it more recently living in the Detroit suburbs. Single Moms raising innercity kids is a recipe for disaster. THERE IS NO CONTROLLING THEM unless you're physically bigger than them. One cavaet. The above is a generalization, and as such, excludes those cases to the contrary. I did know some kids living in the ghetto and raised by their moms that would never consider acting violent towards them. Unfortunately, I've found them to be the true minority.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","12:28 PM","abortion-debates","75"
