Most of the cases of the scandal were ephebophilia. . . .","simone","99675","Again, I salute you, Maximus, the Jesuitical application of the word ""ephebophilia,"" which I have also seen used by a high official in the Roman Catholic Church hoping to triviliaze pedophilia in the Church by calling it ""ephebophilia,"" and urging that this be considered a lesser crime--if, indeed, a crime at all.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","11:11 AM","abortion-debates","48"
"03-19-2005","4337",4,"None","None","None","CCR1994","99679","Just out of curiosity, on what issue is the Catholic Church not unfit to rule on? The Catholic Church provides plenty of rules on all sorts of behavior as well as position statements on all kinds of political and social issues ranging from poverty to war to the death penalty and the church has certainly sided with the political left as well as the political right depending on the issue. So I would ask those of you who support a woman's right to choose the following questions: a) Would it make any difference to you if the Catholic Church's record on pedophilia was 100% clean and b) Would it make a difference to you if the Church's stated position was more favorable to your own?","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","11:44 AM","abortion-debates","49"

I don't expect that the Church should have a stated position that is more favorable to my own--at least not at the present time. The Church has historically vacillated on the issue of abortion, which is to be expected in any human institution. I do expect, however, in future times, that when the Church has made priesthood available to the female sex and leadership roles in the Church are assumed by women, that the Church's stance on abortion will change. Such affairs are not within my province. I will only have difficulties with the Church when it intrudes into the private business and sexual lives of women who are not Roman Catholics--as it presently does.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","12:57 PM","abortion-debates","50"

Vacillated on abortion? Don't hold your breath waiting for the Catholic Church to change its mind on abortion. You may see some changes towards more females occupying traditional male roles within the Church, though. I don't think that the Catholic Church views morality as strictly a Catholic responsibility.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","03:39 PM","abortion-debates","52"
