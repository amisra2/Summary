Its not that way.","simone","101670","Ah, but I'm afraid that's what it truly is, male vs female--the overweening male fear that females shall have control over their own lives instead of submitting to male ""authority.""","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","12:39 PM","abortion-debates","107"

"03-26-2005","4337",8,"simone","None","I quite agree, Sartre, not all Christians are alike. As a matter of fact, a number of Christian groups created an underground to ensure that women could have access to safe abortion prior to the Roe v. Wade decision. You cite a great many instances of truth. Unfortunately, if a female is considered as having morally ""slipped"" under these strict rules she has lowered her status to that of a prostitute and is no longer respected and protected--in fact, her life may be subject to abuse and possible death--something like the Middle Eastern culture you cite in your next paragraph. I grew up in the very Christian American Midwest but I lived in a tribal Scandinavian family where we had our own rules of conduct, which rules were generally morally superior to the Christian culture surrounding us.","JPSartre12","101676","And I would say that they must not be very Christian to do so. Now, your credibility is really taking a hit. We don't live in the age of the Scarlet Letter. No women are ostricized or banished because they have morally slipped. Where do you get these absurd ideas? How about some examples that demonstrate the differences? I don't know anything about tribal Scandanavian rules of conduct and would like to hear about them.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","12:53 PM","abortion-debates","109"

Guess you can hear the N-word uttered in a number of places still--by white folks. This refers to my own tribal family only. We just liked making our own rules and we were not hypocritical about them. In general, marriages were love matches and life-long without infidelities. Some individuals did not adhere to these rules and they were not well thought of. But we didn't go around being hypocritical about the ""sanctity of the marriage,"" and yammering on and on about it, we just honored the vows. We flat out speak the truth and are not liked for being so ruthlessly honest. We have little tolerance for BS meant to deceive and mislead honest folk. If we say we're going to do something, we can be expected to do it most of the time. We don't try to be liked, we try to be the sort that we in our family respect and do not feel pressured by society to conform to stupid fads and rules that don't make sense.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","02:01 PM","abortion-debates","112"

Most of the time people don't want to be ""helped"" out unless they are really desperate. If people don't want to be ""helped"" out it sounds like it could be interfering in other people's lives. Especially women who want to make their own decisions about their lives.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","04:55 PM","abortion-debates","114"

Nice attempt to steer the topic away from your silly assertion. So far, it sounds like MY religion. Oh, so you're not hypocritical about the sanctity of marriage, you just think poorly about people who don't adhere to your rules, which include the sanctity of marriage? Somehow that sounds hypocritical to me. You're cracking me up with statements like the one highlighted above. It's like saying ""we're honest....well most of the time.""

"03-26-2005","4337",8,"Steeeeve","None","Once more.... If one has the right to life..this can't be denied by anyone. A person bleeding that needs blood has the right to life but no one can force the guy next to him to give his blood. We are assuming a right to do what you want with your own resources exists.... How is not giving them blood the same thing as having an abortion? I guess a women could starve herself to not give the baby resources if she wanted.","Steen","101747","Yes. lets That is a claim that there is a right to life for the bleeder. That is a claim that there is NOT a right to life for the bleeder. I wish you would make up your mind. Does the bleeder have the right to life, or only as long as it doesn't involve taking a person's bodily resources against their will? Yes, you can't be forced to give it against your will, even if it could save a life. In both cases, you are restricting the access to your bodily resources when it means that another ""life"" will not survive. As such, the ""right to life"" is not above the right to control your own bodily resources. She can not, actually, unless she starves herself to death. You are not saying that you have to die to not be forced to give blood, are you?","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","06:16 PM","abortion-debates","117"
