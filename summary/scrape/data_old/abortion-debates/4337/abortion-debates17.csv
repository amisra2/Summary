Simply type "" bad priests "" on google search engines. ========================= We are the victims harmed by the Catholic priests in Rome at a top Catholic university ( Priest university). We lived with the priests(top priests from every country)in Rome, Italy. Inside the priests place, priests lived opposite to what they told to the public. They are living in luxury with unlimited good wine and good foods every meals. Inside priests talked about sex, their stealing stories and all the bad things without fear. I stayed there, priests telephoned and talked with me to request me to have sex with them openly. Priests intruded my bedroom and stole things and money from us. Priests used a lot of dirty tricks to get me into bed with them. Priests slience for what they did and protected each other after crime happening. Listen, those Roman Catholic priests who harmed us are still in and out of America as a good Catholic university professors, director, and spiritual director. One of them is the well-known book author and poet for Catholic studies. ===================================== I am writing to let the world know about how do the bad priests live in Rome,Italy. In a place call Convitto S. Tommaso (Via Degli Ibernesi 20, 00184 Rome, Italy Tel: 0669791601) The bad priests team up and cover up for one another. Here are what bad things they did to the general publics and against the general law and orders: 1. The Philippine Sister sleeps with the Fathers in Convitto S Tommaso in order to keep her job to stay in Rome not return to Philippine. 2. The head of the Father ( Father Luke) regularly calls the Sister to sleep with him in his room at night. 3. The head of the Father (Irish Fahter Luke) also lead every priest in Convitto S Tommasso drink. Every priests enjoy drinking unlimited supply of both white and red wine during their lunch and dinner time with plentiful and luxury supply of foods served by Philippine servant. Fathers are chatting women issue, travel Europe issues, and eating issues during their meals time with laughters. 4. Those Bad Fathers team up to cheat the tourists and innocent youngests money, valuable possession in Rome. You can find those bad fathers hide those cheating and stolen GOLD AND JEWEL somewhere in Convitto S Tommasso. 5. The bad Fathers against the Italian Law without feeling guilty - the walk into the public transportation often without paying ticket. 6. They use dirty tricks to decieve teenagers and kids to have fun sex with them. Those bad priests students from Convitto S Tommasso have learned that committing a crime is okay in Rome and the other Fathers will help them to cover up. Therefore,when they return to their own country, they just go on what they did in Rome - continuous to do bad things to harm to the general public and the society!","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","03:10 AM","abortion-debates","241"

"01-22-2007","4337",17,"maximus","119778","Simone, You do not believe abortion to be a moral question? I assume with this statement that you believe in allowing abortion up to the point of birth. If so, then you are one of the most extreme pro-choicers around. If you do believe this being in the womb is worthy of protection at some point--any point along the way--then you have given it some sort of right as a person. If that enters in then this is a moral question. Do you believe abandonment of a pregnant mother by the father a moral issue? Or is it simply a legal, financial, or medical decision? Do you believe an assault on a pregnant mother that results in injury to the zygote/fetus/embryo to be a moral issue or something other? I am trying to understand now why you say you don't believe a life long marriage to be ""good"" yet those who did not adhere to this mode were badly thought of. I'm trying to understand why a life-long marriage is not necessarily a ""good"" thing in your opinion yet it involved love, fidelity, and honor. These things are not good? So you said what you thought and spoke the truth but you didn't say what you thought or speak the truth in relation to marriage? You thought about the ideas that life-long, love-match, loyal marriages were good yet you didn't speak about it? And when one speaks about it as Christians generally do then that is ""intruding into the marriages of others?"" and not simply speaking the truth about one's beliefs? I need a break. I'm a bit dizzy. I'm glad that you are finally admitting that you agree with Christianity so much.","simone","248076","To which I replied in the following post.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","08:56 AM","abortion-debates","243"
"01-22-2007","4337",17,"simone","120026","Maximus, would you be so kind as to point out to me where I stated that abortion should be allowed to the point of birth. I hold views in accord with United States law in this regard. When a fetus reaches the point at which it is viable outside of the womb abortion is strictly controlled (as it should be) and allowable only in cases of possible death to the pregnant woman or of extreme health hazard to her. As long as a fertized egg, zygote, embryo, fetus is dependent upon a woman's body for continued life it is a woman's choice to decree whether or not she yields her body to the welfare of the aforesaid entities. I do believe that women should, whenever possible, decide to terminate as early as possible in the course of the pregnancy as this is the medically safest time for abortion. Maximus, you are welcome at any time to cede ownership of your body to a fertilized egg, zygote, embryo, fetus, etc., with my good wishes. It is your body after all and it is not my responsibility to dictate to you what you do with it--as long as you are not harming yourself or others. Abandonment of a pregnant woman is so common throughout the world that we have not begun in the slightest degree to acquaint men with their responsibilities in regard to their sexuality. Men are empowered by patriarchal religions to have sexual access to as many women as they can seduce, rape, kidnap or otherwise secure with very few consequences, in most cases the victims, the women themselves, are punished for the transgressions of the men as if they were the criminal. This has been the case until very recently in most of the Christian world. I am intimately acquainted with views on the issue of rape within the United States because I was part of a public relations campaign to educate Americans about the issue of rape--that a woman is not the cause of rape because she was ""slutty,"" ""dressed provocatively,"" ""was in the wrong place,"" ""because she wore trousers,"" ""because she was riding a bike,"" (I was kicked out of a courtroom over the last statement because I screamed in outrage at the stupid judge who made the last pronouncement in regard to a rape victim. I have had prominent men in the media industry tell me that the rape victim ""should just lean back and enjoy it."" Unfortunately, there are still a lot of people in America who still hold these views and a great many more in the rest of the world. An attack on a woman is an attack on a woman and should be punished by law. Are you assuming that a woman could be viciously attacked and only the fertilized egg, zygote, embryo, fetus would suffer injury? Um, Maximus, would you be so kind as to point out precisely where I stated that life-long marriage is not good, I am trying to understand your muddled statement also. Maximus, what are you trying to say? I happen to espouse a great many beliefs about what morality is but I do not burden others with the weight of my various beliefs. What is your point? No, it's not that I agree with Christianity, it's that much of Christianity agrees with me. After all, the views of my honorable ancestors were around long before the advent of Christianity and if Christians chose to adopt many of our values, excellent!","simone","248077","And a bit of disagreement followed.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","08:58 AM","abortion-debates","244"
"01-25-2007","4337",17,"JPSartre12","98630","I chose not to participate in this thread previously because Simone's initial anti-Catholic troll was beneath acknowledgement. It's nice to see that someone moved the thread to a more reasonable stage. With 1 Billion Catholics in the world, there are bound to be some bad apples. I think that we should identify them, remove them from the basket and go about doing what is right. Two wrongs don't make a right, except in Simone's mind. Just because there are some bad priests is no reason to condemn the whole Church, IMO.","Shooterandproud","248388","I'll bet they said the same thing about greek mythology.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","12:00 AM","abortion-debates","245"
