"07-27-2006","8509",4,"Steeeeve","None","mental existence varies and has no set definition. Does one have to know they exist to have mental existence? Is mental existence only limited to humans? I always enjoy your thoughts on this Another Opinion existing outside a womb is not a human only trait. A cat can live outside a womb. You could say human womb but you still come back to the qualifier being ""human"" which is the one unique aspect which differs us from everything else. But one has to be human for this ""right"" to exist. You wouldn't say a being with non-human DNA and is alive and have minimal functionality of the mind has a right to life. The one consistent 100% unique trait is being ""human"". Human with __________ is a series of traits but they all need the ""human"" part.","Another opinion","224995","To answer a few of these questions:No, one does not have to know one exists to have a mental existence. As I had mentioned in our previous discussions, I take the minimalist view of a mind in that it need not even be conscious, just present in terms of the first hints of thoughts of any sort - i.e. mental activity - as indicated by the start of those organized brain patterns. That means that even severely mentally handicapped people still have that rudimentary mind, as do Alzheimer's patients, as do almost all people in comas (unless there are people whose bodies are being artificially kept alive once their minds are long gone). Mental existence is not limited to humans, but I guess I can be called prejudiced by favoring the rights of humans over those of animals. Animal, or generally non-human, rights can be an interesting discussion, though. I would like to grant animals some more rights than they currently have (i.e. through animal cruelty laws) - especially those animals that are capable of fealing fear, pain and mentally suffering. In the future, one might imagine the possibility of human-animal hybrids. I hear that there is a company trying to patent a human-chimp hybrid in order to get that discussion going. Anyway, these type of challenges to our system of morality are quite interesting. How should we treat the general question of rights of sensient species? Where should one draw the line? For example, is mass killing of pest species such as rats immoral? Should rights be determined on an individual basis or on a species basis? For ex., should a super-intelligent chimp get the same rights as an extremely mentally incapacitated human or should it be grouped with all chimps as all having lower rights? Interesting questions to ponder. We almost never think about animal rights - including myself. Perhaps we should. What are your views on animal rights? Being ""human"" is only one of the critical conditions that we currently set for giving the right to life. However, it is not a sufficient condition, as shown by the fact that, once brain activity sufficiently stops, we can automatically pull the plug, and by the fact that zygotes are not automatically given a right to life. For me, and for many others, the issue of an existence of a mind is critically important. Why do you think people hesitate in pulling the plug on a loved one who has lost all higher brain function? I know that the only reason that I would be hesitant is in holding on to desperate hopes that that person could still recover or that that person is still present mentally - i.e. delusions that would have no basis in reality.","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","02:54 PM","abortion-debates","46"
"07-28-2006","8509",4,"Caprii","None","No your question isn't about ""right to life"", but more appropriate your questioned should be ""do they have a right to CONTINUE life""? And my answer is absolutely YES! At the living single cell, when the unique properties of a complete human being is created, it is LIVING, not dead. Who has a right to kill another human being's living existance? No one has that right in a civil society, but we haven't reached that society yet, but one day maybe.","happygrl35","225114","No my question isn't about ""does a fetus have a right to continue life"" but does a fetus have the right to substain life as a parasite without consent?. A civil society does not force people to give up bodily rights to substain parasitic life of another,no matter how precious they believe that parasitic life to be.","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","12:21 PM","abortion-debates","47"
"07-28-2006","8509",4,"Steeeeve","None","biologically human = right to life. The only 100% exact trait between all of us is that we are all human (as defined by any dictionary). Even the ability to think and reason is not equal among all humans.","happygrl35","225117","Prove that merely being biologically human automatically equals a right to life?

"07-28-2006","8509",4,"chloe","None","Wow, once a human develops into a certain arbitrary ""criteria"" then they can be afforded a right to live. A worldview of random relativity at its best. By contrast a pro-life view is an extension of a higher respect for the dignity of human life. When one recognizes that human life by definition has an inherent dignity and value which distinguishes it from animals, plants, and dirt, this person recognizes that human life in all of its forms and stages of development deserves respect and deserves to live.","happygrl35","225120","So being human ISN'T arbitrary criteria? I can think of hypothetical and non-humans persons that should be afforded the right to life. Why does human life by *definition* have inherent dignity and value?

People under X IQ should be killed. How is that ranking any different in reasoning? I don't think mental existence is important but the fact that a mental existence is developing should concern you as one that lost mental existence at age 40 but could get it back in 9 months would not be killed. But I agree that your stance has limit abortion to around 4 months (assuming you agree on mental existence) and anything beyond that shouldn't matter..such as the baby will have some kind of disease.","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","01:05 PM","abortion-debates","58"

I could just as easily say that you rank humans based on the random criteria of having a complete set of DNA - sperm and eggs, after all, are also human. In both our cases, we have specific reasons for those criteria. You can challenge those reasons but to say that the criteria is arbitrary is an illogical statement. Any criteria one sets has to have a logical basis behind it. In the past, and still, in some isolated areas, in the present, there was significant discrimination against minority races and women. However, this discrimination was based on false assumptions which were easily disproven as soon as people bothered to look. An assumption was made that women and minorities were incapable of directing their own lives, that they were helpless, ignorant and required supervision. Reality, once they bothered to look, proved otherwise. However, that assumption is true in reality for actual young children, which is why children do not have the same rights as adults. Where IQ is concerned, then I can't think of too many areas where IQ would be a requirement for rights, unless it was so very low that, as with young children, they would be incapable of taking care of themselves. Bottom line - if there are no sound reasons behind excluding someone from rights, then that exclusion can be called arbitrary. However, when there are sound reasons (as in limiting the rights of small children), then that exclusion is not arbitrary. If I understand you correctly, you are suggesting a hypothetical situation of a 40 year old that lost all mental existence (no higher brain function - i.e. no thoughts or emotions) but could get it back in 9 months. Since that is not a real situation, it never has to be faced, but I will take it on anyway. During the period of disappearance of mental existence, the 40 year old would go back to being a ""potential"" person, with a twist. The twist would be that they ALREADY existed, which bears much more weight, in my view, than the potential personhood of one who never existed. After all, all eggs and sperm could become people if they were only matched with the second set of DNA. Basically, my view is: 1) Eggs and Sperm: Potential people which need a critical step to even get started in growth into a real person. 2) Early fetus: Potential people who have started the growth process into real people. 3) Roughly third trimester fetus to end of mental existence: Real people 4) That 40 year old in temporary non-mental-existence: Potential person who already was a real person. So, following the general rule of ""do unto others..."", I think that the potential person who already existed should have higher consideration thatn a potential person who never yet existed but lower than a real person. So, if that 40 year old's continued existence would adversely affect a real person, who didn't agree to sustain that 40 year old, then that 40 year old in mental non-existence forfeits their life. If no one is hurt by their continued existence, then, by all means, continue that life. Note that most pro-choice people would agree that if the non-mentally-existing early fetus is not adversely affecting any real person's life (in most cases, the mother), then no one I know is advocating for killing it.","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","01:54 PM","abortion-debates","59"
