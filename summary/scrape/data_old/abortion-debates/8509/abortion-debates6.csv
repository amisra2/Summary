You keep on saying ""mind"" but you really don't mean ""mind"" because pain is mental comprehension to a degree, otherwise it wouldn't be pain. If pain exist in the 2nd trimester, then mental comprehension exist. PERIOD. Now let me get some clarification, when you say ""mind"" are you assuming ""thought"" because there is no study I'm aware of that shows a fetus thinking. What in the heck is it thinking? Whats for dinner! The mind is all about mental comprehension, not how much or how little but if it exist (isn't that what YOU said), and if pain exist then mental comprehension exist. Take the neurological view, or take the orthopedic view, because it is the skeletal system that seperates us from the rest, take any view you want, but be consistent.","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","07:03 PM","abortion-debates","76"
"08-02-2006","8509",6,"Another opinion","None","Well, the dictionary definition spoke of ""distress"" of the other being to whom one has compassion. It does not have to be a heavy strong suffering, it may be a lighter psychological issue that they are dealing with - i.e. there are many levels of ""distress"" but that word ""distress"" automaticall assumes a mental existence. There are times where we may anthropomorphise and think a thing is feeling distress when it can't possibly, but that is another matter. I would indeed be curious, what examples would you give for compassion for something that has no mental existence? This has come up in our previous discussions and my answer is pretty much the same. I would then restrict very early abortions as well (minus the usual exceptions of woman's life, rape, insect, etc.) but very strongly support development of a universal contraceptive program, tube tying, etc. that all would have access to and afford (or have it donated) - everything possible to prevent the unwanted pregnancies to begin with. For example, I would support automatically giving all teenage girls long term contraceptives (ex. the patch kind) unless they openly refuse it. However, I must note that now I am erring on the side of fetal rights in saying that the limit should be placed at the beginning of the third trimester since that is when a mind MIGHT first start existing. If new research would point to the mind existing very early on (highly unlikely but we are arguing hypotheticals), then I no longer would be that generous and would require strong evidence of such existence of the early fetal mind before I would support restricting abortion accordingly. I wonder, then, if there is a sense of obligation to God or a sense of guilt that factors into all of this. Namely, if God came down and said that abortion of first trimester fetus's was ok, then would that change the minds of most pro-life people?","Steeeeve","226062","Well besides the dead guy...you can have compassion for a tree like you said. I am not all certain that compassion is what makes something else what it is as compassion is related to the object that is delivering the compassion...""I have compassion for people in Iraq""...Here you want to end suffering to people because they can suffer. What about one who is not able to suffer or does not even feel that are harmed? Maybe..""I have compassion for that prostitute"". The women may like being a hooker but one could still want have compassion. I'm just not sure that being able to suffer is needed in order to have compassion. (if this doesn't make sense right now then please say so..I'm a little exhausted haha) I thought you did. Sorry for asking again I'm sure many pro-lifers base their moral beliefs on a God. This is not wrong as everyone has to have some basis for a belief system (even if it is themself). Guilt is a bad term though...although some might feel that way for guilt. I think that a love or respect for God is why one should obey His wishes. If God said ""1st trimester abortions are ok"" then I think everyone would agree with that...unless only a few saw God haha. I think we have hit the main and only root of the abortion debate. To me, all arguments about ""women rights"" or whatever are almost irrelevant and hold no water when you get to the main issue of when a human is worth not killing. This is not to say women are slaves or below a fetus but to give them equal access to a life which the women currently has. To say the fetus is ""intruding"" implies a willful entry when their was no entry as the womb was the first place of existence. Anyway, when you scrap away all the other baseless arguments (on both sides) you get down to when does a human have the right to live. We have ""mental existence"" as an option, ""independence"" as one (not feeding off another), start of existence, and a million other ideas.

Just because the pain receptors are sufficiently developed doesn't mean that those electro-chemical messages get registered as pain in an existing mind. Mind can include something as simple as a sense of self, a realisation that one is feeling hunger or cold or motion, and, yes, it could also include thoughts and emotions. The neurological understanding is that such thoughts, emotions, or percieved sensations could not happen before the third trimesteer. I am being consistent in taking the neurological view that the mind cannot exist before the third trimester. I simply disagree with you. Your point of a perception of pain existing before the third trimester is very far from proven - indeed, most studies I have read suggest otherwise.","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","10:47 PM","abortion-debates","79"
"08-02-2006","8509",6,"thelmoose","None","I don't know if this is relevant to the conversation, I came in late. In case you were discussing fetal pain, this is an excellent review of the topic, and a recent publication. This is just the abstract, but there is access to the full-text article online at pubmed. It addresses the issue of pain at something that is perceived in the human cortex; there is no way to understand the quality or content of a ""thought"", of course. Lee SJ, Ralston HJP, Drey EA, Partridge JC, Rosen MA. Fetal Pain: A Systematic Multidisciplinary Review of the Evidence. JAMA, 2005; 294(8): 947-54.","Caprii","226066","Conclusion: People even ""experts"" will not agree even when presented with the SAME data. So therefore, the questions is should we err on the side of caution or should we throw caution to the wind. Throughout history certain people in this world believed they can kill life without pause, and did so, then the ""civilized and educated"" came along and empowered women to kill their own unborn babies, and women do so, but it's not for the lack of understanding when life begins, but masking the real unknown; the unknow in how to make women equal. Equal in society where they don't have to rely on a man to support herself and child. The unknown on how to make men share in the living standard a woman will live raising her child. To this day (in NY), all a man has to give a woman for child support is 17% of his gross salary. Let's do the math shall we. A man's gross salary is $100,000 so all he has to give to support his child is 17,000. Hmmm, rent, food, daycare all for $17,000. Can you see the BALANCE HERE 17% her to 83% HIM. I see the root of the UNKNOW, its called equality for women. Pro-choicers undermine the women's movement, they undermine womens equality, they undermine womens intelligence, and perhaps the most important thing they undermine is the essence of the woman herself; her kind, nurturing nature. Weve turned moms against their babies and weve turned women into takers instead of givers. Why? Why, because its not that we dont know when life begins, thats just a smoke screen. Why? Why, because, women dont stand a chance of raising her own child because the odds are financially stacked against her. Remember the 17% to 83% imbalance, well, isnt this the ROOT of why women kill their own babies. Pro-choicers, if you really love women, like I do. Then stand up for them. Demand women get more financial support. Lets turn the table on men, lets make the balance 83% for women and 17% for men, and see how long that last. Pro-choicers need to fight the RIGHT cause, the RIGHT FOR EQUALITY, not the RIGHT to defeat women.","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","11:04 PM","abortion-debates","80"

Is that a basic sum up of where we are at and where we tend to agree (for the most part)?","Another opinion","226068","I might feel compassion for a favorite tree when it would be threatened with being cut down, but when I analyze why I would feel compassion, I would have to admit that I was anthropomorphising it (this is my favorite word for the day ). I suspect that, in your compassion for the tree, you would be anthropomorphising it also. All the other examples you gave dealt with real people. One can have compassion for someone who is long dead by imagining what they must have felt or wanted. As for your point about the prostitute, if she actually enjoyed that profession, then any compassion I would feel is in thinking that she may not know what she is missing by having a more normal profession and relationship and she may not know what dangers she is facing. I guess it is a compassion for what she will likely face in the future. For someone with religious views about her bad fate in an afterlife, they might have compassion because she will meet that bad fate. Either way, it clearly is a mentally existing being one is having compassion for. Well, I did elaborate more in this response than in the original response and the question did set me to thinking more about the issue. It brought up an interesting point, though. Namely, how is the pro-life camp split in terms of distributing contraception? After all, if something like my idea of automatically giving teenage girls patch-type contraceptives were implemented then there would be far fewer unwanted teenage pregnancies and, therefore, also fewer abortions. If contraceptives were cheap, easy to get, and strongly advertised and pushed in large segments of society, then one could imagine that the number of abortions could be reduced substantially. I know that there are people in the religious right that are against contraceptive use and certainly against its free distribution. Is the pro-life camp split on this or is such a split avoided by not taking any stance on the issue? I simply think that that would be a great way to approach the ultimate goal of eliminating abortions. I guess I can understand that people might hold that view. In some ways, it might be a more comfortable view to take - letting ones religious beliefs dictate ones moral positions is in some ways easier than forcing oneself to think through all moral questions in terms of reprecussions, etc. For myself and my wavering religious views (varying between agnosticism and some version of Christianity), if there is a God, I would view Him as more of a teacher or a parent sending His children out into the world. I would hope that a parent would want its child to have a moral system based on sound, well thought out moral judgements - not just because Mom or Dad told them so. I think that is mostly there but I would add one point in that often moral questions are not cut and dry - as in the lifeboat scenario that came up in another thread. In the case of abortion, one has a scale where, on one side are the fetal rights and on the other side are the mother's rights. What one places on either side and which rights win out depends on one's beliefs and priorities. As you say, some prioritize ""mental existence"", others independence, others the fact that it is a human life and will develop into us, etc. For example, even most pro-life people seem to wrestle with the moral dilema of whether to allow abortions in the case of rape or incest. It isn't always cut and dry.","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","12:01 AM","abortion-debates","81"

The part that you posted was my comment ""It addresses the issue of pain at something that is perceived in the human cortex; there is no way to understand the quality or content of a ""thought"", of course."" That does not mean that a thought doesn't occur. TO have a thought you need a cortex. To feel something you need a thalamus. The absolute earliest these two structures seem to be functioning is the 28th or so week, the third trimester. I am always amazed at people throwing out opinions about topics they don't understand.

Conclusions Evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester. They use the word ""unlikely"" because these DON'T KNOW. If the sensory processing is beginning in the second trimester obviously it is LIMITED to what has developed, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Well, the most recent article I provided concludes pain is happening in the 2nd trimester. http://www.iasp-pain.org/PCU06-2.pdf Well, I see now, its not about ""mind perception"", because even all of you change the definintion of what having a mind is. Clarification to all of you that can't comprehend. Pain is mental comprehension and ""mental comprehnsion"" means an existance of the ""mind"". Come on people, let's stop dodging the real answer why abortion exist. Remember those statistic people keep talking about 90% happen in the 1st trimester, well that's only half the story, they forgot to tell you that most abortion happen to women who are young, under-educated, with financial instability. So pro-choicers be proud of your misleading logo. It's not about choice. Abortion forces women to have one or suffer the financial consequences. Yeah, real choice! I wonder if our government paid $75,000.00 for every baby born, even if its adopted, that they would give that money to the birth mom. I wonder if abortion's would decrease. Ummm, yeah.

"08-04-2006","8509",6,"Steeeeve","None","Well, like many things, abortion is not the only issue on which someone has a stance. I wouldn't say pro-lifers are ""split"" because there is fairly universal belief that a right to life begins right away...with some varying thoughts. Pro-choice has a wider spectrum (not that this is bad) with some going by the trimester system, some going by birth, some just go my mothers whim, some by mental existence...etc. This is the issue of abortion. Contraception, while related to abortion, may get into a different belief altogether for someone. So I don't think you can really relate the two issues anymore then saying their is a split in pro-life with who likes ham and who likes chicken.","Another opinion","226275","What are the views of most pro-life people, then, when it comes to birth control? Are there differences of opinion about different methods of birth control - ex. biochemical methods that prevent an already fertilized egg from attaching itself and therefore stop its continued growth, vs. simple condoms that help prevent the fertilization to begin with? From what I've heard, even those with most far-right views at least advocate abstinence or for married couples to limit sex during fertile parts of the monthly cycle, but I have heard that even a simple ancient method such as coitus interruptus is objected to by certain people on the far-right. Do you know the range of reasons behind the range of views among pro-life people (a group that does generally does overlap strongly with the anti-birth-control group)? I know that this is slightly off topic, but I suspect that the views about contraception are related to those about abortion and do shed more light on the overall picture. I also wonder if another moral issue gets mixed in with the pro-life stance on abortion and birth control and that is the moral issue of sexual promiscuity. Women who suffer rape or incest obviously cannot be blamed for those sexual acts, which is why it seems the pro-life people have much more sympathy and often allow exceptions for abortions.

Pain Clinical Update looks like some free throwaway. It is not even listed in the Journal Citation Index. It is not peer reviewed, and the article was an editorial, the opinion of a single author.

Nontheless, addressing the article on its content's merit, the thrust of the article, is on the last page when it attempts to critique recent reviews. His argument rests on the idea that 1. it views the physiology of pain in a more modern paradigm,[but that really gives no insight into this topic] 2. that the fetal neurophysiology may not be like an adult [it well may be, but no one knows, and 3. that pain is perceived in sub-cortical regions, i.e. the thalamus [which is what the review I looked specifically addressed.] This article cites not a single piece of direct empirical evidence, but bases its conclusion on a different, theoretical point of view that as yet has not been tested. It's conclusion is, ""These subcortical structures, which develop much earlier than the cortex, may play a pivotal role in sensory perception."" I still stand by my original position. I believe I am keeping an open mind here. You are the one who is simply finding some article to back up the way you feel, without critically appraising it. By the way, the global warming comparison was whacked. I certainly understand wanting to ""err on the side of caution.""
