Those who choose not to use them would find themself at the mercy of the courts, just like with divorce. I have mixed feeling about this too. I do think that it would be only fair for there to be a possibility for men to opt-out, but I think maybe it should be decided on a case by case basis as there are too many possible variables at play.","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","10:18 AM","abortion-debates","91"
"08-21-2006","8509",7,"Caprii","226066","To this day (in NY), all a man has to give a woman for child support is 17% of his gross salary. Let's do the math shall we. A man's gross salary is $100,000 so all he has to give to support his child is 17,000. Hmmm, rent, food, daycare all for $17,000. Can you see the BALANCE HERE 17% her to 83% HIM. I see the root of the UNKNOW, its called equality for women.","somnolence","228323","Ok, firstly no woman should expect to be able to raise a child on 17% of the father's gross income without also working herself (and if she isn't working then what does she need child care for?). If she can and she wants to, fine, but how does it promote equality for the father to have to support the baby AND the mother 100%? Second, I find the figure to be very fair, as the mother is expected to contribute to the costs of raising a child also, and were the child not in the picture the mother would have to at least support herself and thus have many of the same expenses anyway. I say this as a single mother who does recieve child support too. My daughter stays with her dad for three months during the summer, and during those three months my expenses do not really go down all that much. My daughter's father may have an obligation to pay for half of her support, but he's under no obligation to pay for MY support too. Third, if a woman finds the task of raising a child on this amount of child support to be burdensome, she can always award primary or full custody to the father. There's no reason the woman has to be the custodial parent.","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","10:57 AM","abortion-debates","92"

I can understand that there are men who would think it unfair that women have a choice to abort while they have no choice in fatherhood responsibilities. From a pro-choice perspective, I would think that they should indeed have the right to opt-out of fatherhood responsibilities. My estimate was that the end of the fourth month might be a good cut-off date, but I hadn't put much thought into that cut-off time. Perhaps late second term abortions might be more dangerous to the mother as well, so an earlier cut-off time might be better. Something to think about. However, it is certainly clear that there are quite a few women out there who are pro-life and, even among those who are pro-choice, many, if not most, might be very uncomfortable getting an abortion themselves when faced with that decision. I think you are right that many might take advantage of a potential legal pre-consumate agreement that essentially says that they wave their rights to an abortion, while the man would have to wave his rights to opting out of fatherhood. I was mainly thinking that it would be impractical from the social interaction point of view but I suppose that, if it were important enough to them, such women would be willing to overcome the ackwardness of the situation to get such a pre-consumate agreement signed.","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","11:24 AM","abortion-debates","93"

Men should be able to use them too. There could be many different types of pre-consumate agreements, and they could be as many and varied as pre-nuptual agreements. Either a man or a women could decide exactly what it is they would want in the event of a pregnancy and could even carry around a ""standard form"" to be agreed to by anyone they sleep with if they wanted. There would still be some issues that come up regarding the enforcability of the document from time to time, but at least no-one would have the excuse of not knowing what they were getting into beforehand, and no one would be able to lie about their intentions before the fact then ""change their mind"" later on. As far as putting time limits on opting out of parenthood, I think it would have to be before the end of the first trimester, as those are both the safest and the least expensive abortions. The problem with that though is that all a woman would have to do is hide the fact she is pregnant from the man until after the cut-off. That's why I think it would have to be decided on a case by case basis. Certain things would need to be taken into account such as whether or not there was any deception on the part of either party, how long the pregnancy has been known about by either party, whether or not there was a verbal agreement beforehand, whether they are married and if so whether they are currently seeking divorce, etc.","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","11:43 AM","abortion-debates","94"
