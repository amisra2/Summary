It's all about choice, right? http://www.renewamerica.us/columns/kellmeyer/060317 Think about it. America is all about equality for man and woman. If the law of the land is abortion is legal because its not a significant being for a lack of better words and only a mass of tissue, then why can't a man opt out of fatherhood when a mass of tissue is just that a mass a tissue. Pro-choicers seem never to be about equal rights, so I'm pretty sure most of you pro-choicers will disagree with Matt, but to do so would make you a big hypocrite, do what I say, not what I do. Afterall, to pro-choicers life doesn't start at conception, in their mind, it doesn't start at anytime during the pregnancy. So really all matt wants to do is have equal say when a mass of tissue is at stake, he too should be able to execute his wishes or choice, like the woman can exercise her wishes or choice. Now that's is equality.","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","10:17 PM","abortion-debates","1"

But I think the better argument is since a woman can have an abortion without the father's permission, why can't the father opt out of having the baby? As long as it's early enough to have the abortion, the father can remove all responsibility to the baby. In doing so he also removes all rights to the baby if it is born because it is not legally his. Do people agree with this?","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","11:46 PM","abortion-debates","2"

According to pro-choicers, life isn't conceived at conception, so if I man after having sex with a woman and the woman becomes pregnant, she is not pregnant with a baby, she is pregnant with a cell that can ""develop"" into a baby. If a man say's I opt out of fatherhood prior to the development of a human being, then he too like the woman already has, should have the opt-out option. A woman can do with her body what she so chooses, like she does, however, everyone including women must mitigate their own damages. If a woman who is pregnant with a few ""cell clusters"" and she so chooses to let the pregnancy of cells develop into a human being, she is allowed to do so, but she caused the development of a human baby not the man, and should be solely liable for such creation. Remember, when the man left after having sex, he did not create a human being according to pro-choicers, if at most he created a ""cell"". According to pro-choicers, cells do not translate into a human life. A male should have an opt-out period just like the woman, before the cells become a HUMAN BEING. God, I love it. Pro-choicers don't even want to live by their own words. I'm trying to understand their position. Its a ""cluster of cells"", ""a mass of tissue"", ""not a human being"", ""no heartbeat"" ""no brainwave therefore, not a human being yet"", so if a man say's I opt out of fatherhood prior to the creation of a human being then, like his female counterpart, should be able terminate his parental duty, that he never created, she did.

Seems you are downplaying the role of a man in a childs life. For shame! I don't know how you could say the two aren't comparable. You argument is that the mother shouldn't have to support someone that she doesn't wish to support. You are now trying to qualify it by saying a mothers health is the main concern because health is more important than money. So your standard seems to be ""If the human is being supported by another and may adversly hurt someones health than there should be a choice. Otherwise we can restrict choice. Ok, what if child support will cause the man to have to eat worse or work more and thus hurting his health? Does this not qualify now? The man 1) didn't have a choice and 2) has his health adversly affected. Looks to me like you just have a double standard.","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","05:17 PM","abortion-debates","9"

No one should be forced to become a parent. Just how to legislate this, I don't know. There's so many different scenarios to consider. Like if it's a married couple, if the man didn't think she could get pregnant (she told him she was sterile, whatever), if the birth control failed, the father is a child under 18, etc. I know father's can relinquish their parental rights, but is that only if the mother allows it?
