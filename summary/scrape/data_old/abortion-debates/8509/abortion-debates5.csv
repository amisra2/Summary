"08-01-2006","8509",5,"Steeeeve","None","But they are not human. They are part of a human. I was under the assumption that we were using the ""human"" definition provided by the dictionary....but assumptions always get us in trouble So we are looking at ranking humans...not what is or isn't a human. I said ""no ranks"" you are saying ""rank based on whether or not they have mental existence""..perhaps categorize is better because you only have an either or. One could argue that a person...say age 16...that has a low IQ is a burden on society and thus should not be here. Mentally handicapped people are a burden on society and suck up a lot of resources that we provide. One could say this is unfair and they should be terminated. I think we probably agree this is not a good thing to do but it has a rational basis and would not be arbitrary. Ok, but that once again is just a thought not based on much. I don't understand by ""was a person"" really matters...what difference does it make? Would it change if the person that ""emerges"" 9 months later is different (as in their memory was erased and they are almost starting over)?","Another opinion","225806","Definitions are tricky since they carry connotations. In scientific usage, someone being ""a human"" simply means being alive with a particular set of human DNA - a dry, emotionless definition with no connotations. Imagine trying to draw sympathy by referring to people as ""living bodies with human DNA"". In common useage, human being, wherever I have heard it used, implies not just a body but a mental being as well. It is that connotation of mental being that draws sympathy to the term ""human being"". We do not sympathize with mere bodies. From the common useage point of view, then, an early fetus is not a ""human being"" since it does not yet have a mental existence. As for what is ""human"" - all the cells in our body are ""human"". It all comes down to what you actually mean by a definition - the common useage with all of its connotations. Since I view your definition of human as composing only the dry scientific facts of 1) being alive and 2) having human DNA, then I have no problem categorizing what you call ""a human"". However, I view the term 'person"" very differently since people have to have a mental existence to be people. I do not categorize people in terms of right to life (except for those that loose it through their actions - ex. killing people in self-defense). Someone could make that arguement and there have been societies that have implemented that (Naziism comes to mind) but a very compelling arguement could be made against such actions that appeals to our human sense of compassion and the general moral principles that guide most people in not mistreating others in a way that we would not want/expect to be mistreated. The counter-arguement is based on reason as well and the society would have to decide which one wins out. Since compassion is a strong driving force in people, the society would have to be conditioned against compassion to allow such a rule to be introduced. Where abortion of early fetuses is concerned, where there is no mental existence, your appeal to that human compassion is false since there is no ""someone"" present yet for whom one can have compassion. The pro-life side simply lacks any compelling arguement against aborting early fetuses without resorting to distortions. The bottom line for me is the general moral code of treating others as you would be treated. I am glad that I was given a chance to be born but that does not mean that I think my mother should have had no other choice but to bear me, or that I think that they could not have used contraceptives, etc. Before I started to exist mentally, my body was just a thing with no rights. I don't think I deserved rights until after I started to mentally exist. I view all others the same way. If, in your 40-year old scenario, I existed and was going to go into temporary mental non-existence, then I would have no right to expect anyone to suffer to maintain me. If no-one would suffer to maintain me, then I would hope that I would be kept alive in that situation.","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","05:51 PM","abortion-debates","61"

But as I have been saying, mental existence is just an aribitrary bar to place. Why not set the bar to ""when the human looks like a human"" or around 7-9 weeks. Or maybe mental competence as exampled earlier. If you look at the pro-life stance that all humans are equal (and yes, we use the cut and dry definition) than there is a extreme argument for not aborting with no distortions. I don't see how ""sympathy"" comes into play because pro-lifers obviously have sympathy for the young fetus/embryo and some people don't have sympathy for a 15yr old. In other words, saying mental existence is required for sympathy is yet another arbitary bar to place. In conclusion you base all your thoughts on mental existence but you can't refute anyone based on this as it is a random (yet consistent) point you picked and any other random point would have just as much backing. If you agree with this then we can move on to the next phase which is why picking a random point is no good.

It is no less arbitrary than setting the point at conception. Conception is when the growth process starts and when there is a complete set of DNA. Why should that be an all-important point? It seems arbitrary to me, just like my point of the beginning of mental existence might seem arbitrary to you. Without a mental existence, the body is just a thing. What exactly is it that you would have sympathy with if there was a human body with no mind? I can understand a respect for a potential of the early fetus but what is it exactly that you would have sympathy for in what it is *at that moment*? As a point of arguement, if an early fetus would exist that would never develop a mental existence - ex. it would stagnate in growth at, say, one month - and there would be no hope of further development, then what is the point of keeping it alive - especially if it would be interfering with the life of a real person who can suffer, feel and think? What exactly is it that you think you would be keeping alive?","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","09:02 PM","abortion-debates","63"
"08-02-2006","8509",5,"Steeeeve","None","I tried to explain this earlier...and I might be doing a poor job...I don't mean random in the grand skeme of things, just random in the sense of classifying humans as you could easily do it some other way. I don't mean to imply you just pulled a number out of a hat and went with that Obviously my point is just as random in the grand look as it is based on a definition developed by man. I guess at this point you get into debating God and where rights are granted. Well, I have sympathy for a being....Kind of odd how a persons emotions work I guess. As I said, some have no sympathy for a 15yr old dieing. Maybe sympathy since you know you were once the same. You mean like the fetus just stopped and stay put in the woman? Keeping in mind this would never happen (even more scenario is more likely ) I think you can't kill the human inside.","Another opinion","225925","I guess I don't understand why you think one classification is equivalent to another. Do you think that limiting the rights of young children is equivalent to limiting the rights of African Americans or women? There are classifications that make sense, once all arguements are presented. These include the limits on the rights of children or the extremely mentally disabled. These make sense because those groups ARE incapable of taking care of themselves. Does that make that classification random - i.e. equivalent to restricting rights based on race or sex? I just don't understand this argument of yours. Well, I would mention two points. One is that we often have a tendency to anthropomorphise (i.e. unintentionally attach a personality where there is none). I do it myself as well. It is illogical but there is something in our natures that has that tendency. It can cover a wide range of reactions - from having an irrational sympathetic reaction when seeing human manicans or dolls mangled, to feeling somewhat sorry for an old familiar tree being cut down, etc. Feelings that our intellects might immediately suppress but which crop up on occasion anyway. I suspect that a lot of the sympathy for that early fetus or even zygote is anthropomorphic. The second point is that, yes, we were once the same, but we were also once human eggs waiting for sperm to set the growth process going. But that human inside will never mentally exist. It is ONLY a body - no thoughts, emotions, sense of pain, suffering - nothing. There is NOBODY inside that body and never will be. Who exactly is it that you would be protecting?","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","09:56 AM","abortion-debates","65"

"08-02-2006","8509",5,"Steeeeve","None","Well any classification of humans doesn't make sense to me. Some used to think blacks were inferior, some thought jews were, some thought mentally retarded were...the list goes on. I just take the stance that no classification along the spectrum on ""human"" should be above or below the next because 1) I dont' get to make that call and 2) because classifying one way allows for the classifying of it another way...even if it doesn't make sense to you (because it might make sense to another). So limiting rights for women or african americans (a bad term ) is just as bad to me as in other limit to any other group of humans. This in no way proves you are wrong...just establishes my position . Just look at cats and dogs...they are animals like a chicken but we eat the chicken and think the cat and dog cant be eaten. Kind of a weird human trait don't you think Well that sperm alone was not ""you"" though. I think that my be the difference in a mind. And you might be right about the feelings but having emotions for a non-personality is no less valid than having emotions for someone with personality (by the way...I learned something new today with that word!). I think you could get into a spiritual look at it but for the sake of our agrument I will assume that our emotions are founded somehow. the human inside is who you are protecting. I think one could also argue (although I will not) that this would be different because a fetus is and will develop into a being with emotion, sense or pain, suffering, and other thoughts. I think one could say that since it is impossible to pinpoint exactly when this happens the best thing to do is assume it already has as you know it will happen. This is not my line of thinking but one that maybe someone could take? It is always fun to explorer what someone might think","Another opinion","225954","Let me ask you a question then. Do you think that young children should have the same rights as adults? This includes the right to wander wherever you want (outside of military restricted areas, etc.), the right to drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, vote, etc. If not, then you are classifying humans based on age. How we direct our compassion doesn't always make sense. As with food animals, we often don't think about those things that would make us uncomfortable since, if we really got a chance to follow the life of a particular chicken and see its emotions, we might feel too guilty to eat it. People who owned slaves in the past probably didn't care to consider the emotions or capabilities of those they were oppressing. I hear that even someone as awful as Hitler got very uncomfortable and angry when a woman in one of his dinner parties started speaking of the hardships that the Jews were facing under his programs. Basically, immorality can happen when we unintentionally or intentionally avoid looking open-mindedly at the needs, emotions, capabilities, etc. of beings for whom, with objective reasoning, we might otherwise feel compassion. That is not the case for early fetuses. Those of us thinking about the needs, emotions, capabilities of early fetuses see nobody even existing yet for whom we can have compassion. You have made no arguements which suggest that there is someone there with whom one can have compassion, except for your earlier arguement of essentially ""better safer than sorry"". If you have emotions toward, say, an old favorite tree that is alive but has no personality, then those are real emotions (as all emotions are real), but either you are anthropomorphising that tree and feeling sorry for it or it is a selfish desire that you are attached to that tree (you like looking at it, it decorates your yard, you planted it as a kid, etc.) and you view that your rights are being trampled on if someone cuts it - not the trees rights since that tree does not have rights. If we accept the fact that the tree has no mental existence, then why would the tree have rights? What do you mean by the human inside in that case? In that case, it would only be a body with no mental existence - a bunch of human cells that has stopped growth and has nothing more than their biochemical function - no thoughts, emotions, fears, wants, pain or sensations, etc. I still suspect that you are anthropomorphising that stagnated early fetus. As you say, you think that one cannot say when that being develops emotions, sense of pain, suffering, etch so you assume it already has happened. So, you think it might have that rudimentary mental existence and that is what you are sympathizing with. What if you knew for sure - ex. God came down and said that this fetus has no mind and never will. Then what?","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","11:31 AM","abortion-debates","68"

You appeal to your conclusion here though. When you say you can only have real compassion for a being with mental existence you already assume your conclusion to be true in order to make this argument.

The Merriam-Webster on-line dictionary's definition of compassion is ""sympathetic consciousness of others' distress together with a desire to alleviate it"" (from http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/compassion) . Perhaps you might be confusing the emotion of ""compassion"" with simply having any emotions toward someone/something. I can certainly have strong attachments to favorite personal items and don't want them destroyed, but that does not mean I have compassion for them. Where compassion toward the dead is concerned, then either one believes that the mental existence of the dead continues in some version of an afterlife and one has actual compassion because you think that the soul of that person would be dismayed at, say, someone disrupting their grave. Otherwise, it is a respect for the memory and wishes of that person who you knew and loved. Part of that is the idea that you wouldn't want your grave disrupted since it affects people's future memory of you and you want people to remember you well so you respect the wishes of the dead person in promoting a good memory of them. I guess we might just have to agree to disagree here then. Mental existence apparently does not matter to you (though I still suspect you might be anthropomorphising) but it does matter for a very large number of people. That is a choice that our society has to make and is trying to make. My main concern is that the issue doesn't get distorted - ex. that people don't get away with claiming that a zygote has a mental existence, or that pro-choice people are advocating that women SHOULD get abortions, etc. Sorry about that - I didn't read it carefully enough. Lets say God wouldn't say anything in that case and let you decide.

"08-02-2006","8509",5,"None","None","None","Caprii","226034","Another opinon, I've read many of your abortion responses and to you the mind is the universe of man, and you hold the same position as the neurologist's view, if that view exist. Please direct me to a competent neurological society that has stated in so many words, the termination of a living human being's life, isn't the killing of a living human being's life until the living human being reaches the stage of ???. In fact, I read an article of a neurologist, who believes killing a fetus at any stage is killing a human life and further goes on to say when people compare a fetus ,prior to the development of the brain, to a ""brain-dead"" adult, that the two are not even comparable. On the ""brain dead"" adult/child position, the adult/child, being held alive by machine, has no EXPECTATION of returning to what the person was and really is a collection of ""parts"" so to speak, parts not communicatiing with the others. On the other hand a fetus, with all the parts acting as one, communicating with other parts, has a full expectation of development, and is on the opposite end of the ""brain dead"" adult with no expectation of recovery. In another one of your post, you said you don't mind abortions in the 3rd trimester, as you say its all mental perception that makes us human beings, and if that is your stance, then I want pro-choicers, who like you believe in this ideology to argue with your own kind (the pro-choice side) and demand a more structured deadline when abortion is no longer humane. Tell me, about the article below. Do you believe the article, or are they a bunch of quacks. If you believe them, then it is apparent to them that pain exist well in the second trimester. If you are a person of your word and you believe what you say, then doesn't it offend YOU, knowing that our unborn children in the second and third trimester feel pain their last moments of their life? Why don't you question the pro-choice side? Ask them why the pro-choice movement arbitrarily picked the 24th week? Ask the pro-choice side, what deadly condition is there, where it endangers the life of the mother, after the 24th weeks where a fetus has to be dismembered as opposed to taken out whole and alive? So if you are a responsible pro-choicers, you shouldn't sit silently by and let the pro-choice movement literally get away with murder, and kill another human being, in the second or third trimester. Make a fuss, and demand real answers from the pro-choice side. Also, let us not forget, our knowledge is only as good as our technology. With great certainty, we now believe pain can be detected in the 2nd trimester, however that doesn't say pain or fear doesn't happen in the 1st trimester, but until we have better studies and technology, we have what we have. So until more technology comes along, I request that responsible pro-choicers like yourself demand logical answers from your pro-choice movement that actually makes sense and is consistent. So, I apologize for the long post, however, the most important answer I want from you is that link to a neurological society stating terminating the living existance of human life is not the killing of a living human life.

It does not have to be a heavy strong suffering, it may be a lighter psychological issue that they are dealing with - i.e. there are many levels of ""distress"" but that word ""distress"" automaticall assumes a mental existence. There are times where we may anthropomorphise and think a thing is feeling distress when it can't possibly, but that is another matter. I would indeed be curious, what examples would you give for compassion for something that has no mental existence? This has come up in our previous discussions and my answer is pretty much the same. I would then restrict very early abortions as well (minus the usual exceptions of woman's life, rape, insect, etc.) but very strongly support development of a universal contraceptive program, tube tying, etc. that all would have access to and afford (or have it donated) - everything possible to prevent the unwanted pregnancies to begin with. For example, I would support automatically giving all teenage girls long term contraceptives (ex. the patch kind) unless they openly refuse it. However, I must note that now I am erring on the side of fetal rights in saying that the limit should be placed at the beginning of the third trimester since that is when a mind MIGHT first start existing. If new research would point to the mind existing very early on (highly unlikely but we are arguing hypotheticals), then I no longer would be that generous and would require strong evidence of such existence of the early fetal mind before I would support restricting abortion accordingly. I wonder, then, if there is a sense of obligation to God or a sense of guilt that factors into all of this. Namely, if God came down and said that abortion of first trimester fetus's was ok, then would that change the minds of most pro-life people? I continue to hope that even people who flame can eventually be turned into having a civil discussion if one continues to respond calmly, respectfully, and addresses their points rationally but without insult or incrimination.

On the ""brain dead"" adult/child position, the adult/child, being held alive by machine, has no EXPECTATION of returning to what the person was and really is a collection of ""parts"" so to speak, parts not communicatiing with the others. On the other hand a fetus, with all the parts acting as one, communicating with other parts, has a full expectation of development, and is on the opposite end of the ""brain dead"" adult with no expectation of recovery. In another one of your post, you said you don't mind abortions in the 3rd trimester, as you say its all mental perception that makes us human beings, and if that is your stance, then I want pro-choicers, who like you believe in this ideology to argue with your own kind (the pro-choice side) and demand a more structured deadline when abortion is no longer humane. Tell me, about the article below. Do you believe the article, or are they a bunch of quacks. If you believe them, then it is apparent to them that pain exist well in the second trimester. If you are a person of your word and you believe what you say, then doesn't it offend YOU, knowing that our unborn children in the second and third trimester feel pain their last moments of their life? Ask the pro-choice side, what deadly condition is there, where it endangers the life of the mother, after the 24th weeks where a fetus has to be dismembered as opposed to taken out whole and alive? So if you are a responsible pro-choicers, you shouldn't sit silently by and let the pro-choice movement literally get away with murder, and kill another human being, in the second or third trimester. Make a fuss, and demand real answers from the pro-choice side.","Another opinion","226040","You are missing the point of what I am saying. Yes, the early fetus is a human life and if you kill it you are killing a human life. That is not what is significant to me. The thing that is significant to me is whether or not you are killing a human being with a mind/soul since those are the ones that I can have sympathy for - I do not have sympathy to mere bodies. The neurological view is only one that states that that mind cannot start to exist before the third trimester. As I've said in other threads, I appreciate the fact that the fetus has the *potential* of becoming a real person with a mental existence and I would hope that women considering abortion would take that potential into consideration since I think it does deserve some respect. However, a *potential* person is certainly not yet a real person so I do not view that any hypothetical rights of a potential person should supercede those of a real personl. After all, eggs are also potential people that simply need more steps to even start the growth process. Assuming that,in this last paragraph, you meant to say that I do mind abortions in the 3rd trimester (since I have consistently stated that I do), then Roe vs. Wade already allows states to limit abortions in the third trimester so there is no need to overturn it or other legislation to allow for such restrictions. Indeed, as of April 2006, 36 states had bans on late-term abortions that were not facially unconstitutional (i.e. banning all abortions) or enjoined by court order. (fact from Wikipedia.com). In older posts, I have had discussions with people on the pro-choice side who would keep third trimester abortions completely open out of fear of the slippery slope. I have not had those discussions recently since no one on the pro-choice side has challenged my stance of restricted third-trimester abortions. It should be noted that, from polls I have seen, it seems that even most pro-choice people would restrict abortion in the third trimester. The pain receptors are there in the second trimester but it doesn't register as suffering until later in the pregnancy - there are different levels of brain development necessary to fully register pain. For example, if you accidentally touch a hot grill, you will react to that heat before you feel the pain of it. That initial reaction is governed by a lower level of brain and reacts faster. The feeling of pain registers in higher levels of the brain. Those levels are not yet developed enough in a second trimester fetus, from what I have read. I would hope that any necessary third trimester abortion (ex. to save the life of the mother) would be done as humanely as possible. To answer your question, I don't know of any such condition but neither am I familiar with this procedure and why people choose it. That is a side issue to the main issue of whether abortions should be allowed in the first and second trimester. I don't have an issue with the second trimester and Roe vs. Wade already allows restrictions on abortion in the third trimester so there is not much to argue there. Only about 1% of abortions are performed in the third trimester anyway, and most of those are for the generally accepted reasons of being a threat to the mother's life. Lastly, when an earlier poster did once suggest that third trimester abortions should not be restricted, I did indeed argue against that.","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","05:57 PM","abortion-debates","75"
