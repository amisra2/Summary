I read your post and can see that you are consistant and fair. You being a pro-choicer, I'm pleased that you see the fairness that men should have an opt-out period, like the woman. If under our laws we've concluded that the newly formed single cell or cells is just that a single cell(s) not yet of significant human developmental, and women can dispose of it at anytime, then men too should have the ability to dispose of it by terminating all of their responsiblity in the same time frame women have. Laws should never be crafted to suit certain individual or group interests. Laws should be crafted as if we all were the same, human beings! Race and gender should never be a factor in writing laws. People have to understand, when we read history, we read it and say, ""how barberic"" ""how ignorant those people were"". Well, I'm sorry to say, we too are barberic and ignorant if our laws and the definitions we create are only suited for a certain group of the population. We must understand that in the future, we will be enlightend with new technology and laws will be created due to new information. For example by what I mean, the artificial womb, I do believe, will be available for that single cell to develop completely. Then what? Laws will be re-visited and possibly changed to re-define that human being single cell. Many women won't want that single cell and for the first time in history men can actually have the means to develop a human being via the artificial womb. Let us define that living human-being single cell accurately today. If we don't, our future generations will look back upon us and say, ""Their ignorance made them barbaric; a mass genocide of human life in the billions"". Realize that the location of the living human-being single cell doesn't give the host (mother) full and complete ownership to do with whatever she so pleases. It will take technology in the future, for us to see, that the living, human-being single cell has two creators both equal in custody rights of that cell, regardless of location. Abortion in the future will have different liability to women. Killing a living human-being single cell without the consent of the male partner, knowing the partner wanted it and has the means to develop it via artificial womb, will have women in civil and criminal lawsuits, and losing! When the artificial womb is created, pro-lifers will still hold steady that life begins at the conception, and pro-choicers will finally have to commit to a time when life begins, no longer can they say, it depends on the situation. If a couple places a single cell in an artificial womb, and the man and woman die in a car crash four months later, that fetus must be addressed. Is it private property? Whose estate, the mother or father, or is this human being four months along an independent individual with civil rights like everyone else. In the future, in my heart I believe, a four month fetus will be classified a human being with the same inalienable rights as you and I. So what gives? Why would a fetus in the future be finally recognized as a human being with rights, as opposed to a fetus of yesterday and today who have no recognition of being a human being with rights? What will give way is our ignorance through technology and science. In the name of equality, when doing the right and fair thing was more important than fulfilling our greedy self-interests, slavery came to an end, and women suffurage prevailed. I too believe a sector of the human population (in utero) who have been denied their civil right, the basic right to continue life, will prevail, due to technology and science.","Bell","224589","I want to thank you for this insightful post filled with substance and a lack of slander. So rare, and so very appreciated. Although I doubt that any of this will happen in my lifetime, as it is extremely controversial, I do agree with you and think it's possible one day. When technology creates viable artificial wombs, then the need for abortion will be practically eliminated, and we will come a step closer to gender equality. I am also certain our practices today will undeniably be looked upon by future generations as ignorant and thus barbaric. I also believe that future generations will also see how we treated pregnant women (or rather, how we didn't treat them) and see that as barbaric, too. In today's times, a four month old fetus (IMO) isn't recognized as a ""human being with rights"" because they are not able to live outside the womb. (As far as I know-there may be exceptions?) As science learns more about sustaining and continuing life at this age of development, we may see tighter reins on abortion in the second trimester. Which I am all for, anyways. Pro-choice, to a point.","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","03:45 PM","abortion-debates","31"

Trust me, I'm a pessimistically Optimistic. I read about the womb in Popular Science about Dr. Liu, and since later read about a pair of researchers in Japan working on the same concept. Dr. Liu if I recall said she believe she can have one created in about 10 years the ones in Japan said perhaps 6 years for them. In any event, even if we doubled these estimates we are talking 12 to 20 years away. I know it sounds far fetched for us, but if they are optimistic then so am I. Are you going to be dead in 20 years? If not, and this actually comes about in our lifetime, I think we should find the closest pub between each other, meet halfway, and celebrate all night long. http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0117-05.htm http://www.popsci.com/popsci/futureb...cbccdrcrd.html","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","05:54 PM","abortion-debates","33"

Many people will likely say, why worry? Surely the artificial womb is far off on the horizon. Five years ago,we thought the same thing about human cloning and using stem cells to produce body parts.","Bell","224646","From Common Dreams: Holy cow chips, Batman!

The 100% exact trait that exist behind all people that currently have a universally acknowledged right to life is not only that we have human DNA and are alive, but that we also have at least a minimally functioning mind, as determined by brain wave test.

"07-26-2006","8509",3,"None","None","None","Another opinion","224827","Regarding the main subject of this thread - the rights of the father to back off from fatherhood responsibilities early on, I have mixed feelings. I would like to say that all men should have the opportunity to reject their fatherhood responsibilities until, say, the end of the fourth month (thus leaving time for the woman to have a safe abortion before the third trimester). In that case, if they reject fatherhood responsibilities, then they can never again claim fatherhood rights (custody, etc.) if that fetus is taken to term and becomes a child, without specific permission from the mother. The reason I have mixed feelings is that there are a large number of women whose belief system makes it impossible for them psychologically to have an abortion, in which case, she would essentially feel as if she has no choice, while the father would still have a choice - an unfair inbalance. I don't know how this could be legally determined, though, since I can't imagine that it would be in the least bit practical to legally set a special status before sexual acts that could results in an unwanted pregnancy.","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","03:58 PM","abortion-debates","38"

And my answer is absolutely YES! At the living single cell, when the unique properties of a complete human being is created, it is LIVING, not dead. Who has a right to kill another human being's living existance? No one has that right in a civil society, but we haven't reached that society yet, but one day maybe.","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","09:55 PM","abortion-debates","39"

Does one have to know they exist to have mental existence? Is mental existence only limited to humans? I always enjoy your thoughts on this Another Opinion existing outside a womb is not a human only trait. A cat can live outside a womb. You could say human womb but you still come back to the qualifier being ""human"" which is the one unique aspect which differs us from everything else. But one has to be human for this ""right"" to exist. You wouldn't say a being with non-human DNA and is alive and have minimal functionality of the mind has a right to life.
