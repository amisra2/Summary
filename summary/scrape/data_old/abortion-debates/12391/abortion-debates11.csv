"03-07-2009","12391",11,"chester","346301","Not quite. When I coached debate, the rule was that the party seeking change had to prove that the change was necessary, desirable, and practical. Of course, by his handle, chuz has made it clear that choice is the operative word and that (s)he is in favor of one choice. If that be the case, then there is nothing to debate as (s)he has made it clear that (s)he supports my basic premise.","Chuz Life","346307","It's time to step up. But this issue between us will not be settled to any degree of certainty on ""the playground."" This one belongs in a moderated debate. I have already send a request to Admin for a ""debate tournament"" on the abortion issue. (so far no response so I'm not sure it was received) I personally don't think debates are typically effective in changing many of those in a debate's positions. If anything, they tend to either solidify the existing points of views of the participants,... or they result in some leaving out of frustration. The real benefit to having open debates (maybe a tournament) is that those who read the debate who may be sitting on the fence will gain enough knowledge to choose one side or the other. Winston's comment (that I won) and his subsequent answer to the poll question is extremely rare in my experience. I'm sure we won't agree on every other aspect of the issue,... but it's good to see a new face in the debate once in a while.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","08:21 AM","abortion-debates","151"

You just restated your initial position without addressing any of the relevant arguments we had made - switching adjective to noun is not allowed and 'individuality' as we are using it does not convey personhood! With that said, I'm still to be convinced that you classify a zygote as something which can 'exist independently'. A zygote is dependent on others for it's existence - to say otherwise is to say that (for example) my left arm is an individual, because if you cut it off, it would still be there.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","03:25 PM","abortion-debates","152"

"03-08-2009","12391",11,"JakeCJB","346435","...That life is always occuring, and moving through different processes, changes. The zygote and the fetus in the early stages of development, is life, as life is everything we perceive. It has not yet become what is generally thought to be a human person. It has gone through other stages of what constitutes a life, granted. No one is arguing that. ...","Chuz Life","346439","Again, there are many people here that are still denying the biological fact that a human individual's life ""biologically"" begins at and by their conception. So that portion of your premise is wrong. Many people are ""arguing that."" Secondly, your comment about ""general thought."" It was once ""generally thought"" that blacks were less than full person's too. They were considered savages and enslaved for generations, by societies who ""generally thought"" them to be less than equal ""persons"" and deserving of Constitutional protections of their rights. It's the very same kind of denialability that's taking place in the abortion issue today. A person's life begins when it begins,... not just when it convienient to the rest of society and not just when we can't justify our denial of it any more.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","09:45 AM","abortion-debates","161"

So I claim that the zygote is not an individual, and you claim that I am saying that it is not ""a life"" (with ""an individual"" stuck in the middle). You really ought to try that honesty thing. An you quoted him, why? Are you now saying he supports you, having just insulted him? However, I agree that it is a deep philosophical question. Explain. Well, let's take a look at the bit you quoted. You highlighted the bit that said ""human being"", thinking that this alone would back up your argument, but you failed to notice the words ""the process that begins to make a"" in front of it. So, if Clinton is saying that the ""cells join in the process that begins to make a human being"", then they cannot yet be a human being. So, he certainly does not support your argument. I am still amazed that you would use this quote to support your argument, when it clearly does not.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","11:14 AM","abortion-debates","164"
