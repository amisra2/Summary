This is why this thread was supposed to only be about the biological beginnings of a human individual's life. It's not about me. It's not about semantics or tactics or any of that other stuff. I'm trying to compile some references and links together to provide the biological definitions of ""humans"", ""organisms"", etc. so that if you have a disagreement,... it won't be with me. but with the scientific community. And I'm not about to lose my job doing it,... so slooowing down for now!","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","02:36 PM","abortion-debates","46"
"02-27-2009","12391",4,"Chuz Life","345258","WE? How many posts do you want me to cite where I specifically said I am ONLY asking about the BIOLOGICAL aspects, AO? You even participated in helping me prove that aspect using horses instead of humans.","Another opinion","345267","But the topic under discussion is clearly abortion. We are not about to discuss whether humans have gills. It is obvious that one uses the definition that is most relevant to the topic. Even if you start speaking biologically and then change to social, then you cannot logically use any conclusions drawn from the purely biological discussion since any terminology used in biological discussions only would have to be reworded once you change to a social context. I have no doubt that you would then distort our views by quoting us from the biological discussion without taking that change of definitions into account. I will play no part in such a dishonest debate. So, stick to the relevant definition (i.e. person) or you lose me as a debater on this thread. Yes, I do mean that as a threat. You can go ahead and keep going with the other debaters and I will just watch with amusement as you try to force a dishonest debate on the others while they, hopefully, continue to foil your efforts.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","03:43 PM","abortion-debates","47"
"02-27-2009","12391",4,"Another opinion","345250","I'm glad you do. I was starting to wonder... I can agree with 2 and 3, but 1 needs to have a very important condition. Namely, as it stands, the statement would be interpreted in the way that all it takes to be a human being is for the thing to be a biological organism. I would strongly disagree with that. That may be true for mammals, where I would probably even still use the term ""horse"" for a living horse body with no brain (perhaps others interpret more meaning into the word ""horse"" but I did not get that general impression). So, I would split 1 into two parts (and please pay attention to the wording this time): 1a: That mammals (excluding human beings) are biological ""organisms"" and can be defined purely on those terms. 1b: That human beings are biological ""organisms"" but also contain the critical aspect of a mental existence.","Archangel","345269","Your 1a and 1b are so contradictory I almost don't know how to respond to them. But I understand why you must believe as you do or else you would be a complete hypocrite for condoning the butchering of lower life forms for the sake of food consumption. But your compromise is completely irrational just as your insistence that lacking mental awareness/existence is relevant in regards to your justification for abortion. Every argument you forward in your attempt to maintain what you hold as personal principles/standards of rationality just XXXX more holes in your perceived world view as inconsistent and shallow in that they are contrived and forced in order to fit with what you know to be true in reality. For example, your 1a will accept that animals are biological ""organisms"" and can be defined purely on those terms while humans must possess the caveat of mental existence. You say this purely in order to appease any guilt from knowing that we kill, butcher and consume hundreds of millions of animals per year for food. But you must know, unless I have thought much more of your intellect than I ought to have, that the lower animals are no different than human beings in that at that certain stage of their development in the womb, they too become mentally aware that they are alive, feel pain, see, and perceive the coming world they will enter; on the level of their respective species of course, but they to attain self awareness. Of course they will never perceive it as humans do, but they are all born with brains and those brains serve a very real and distinct function. As distinct a function for them as the type of animal they are, as ours do in relation to how our brain works for us. Your ability and need to classify, categorize and compartmentalize us is nothing more than a game of semantics in order to attempt to keep your very ""inconsistent"" world view consistent. And you are failing miserably at it AO.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","03:51 PM","abortion-debates","48"
"02-27-2009","12391",4,"Another opinion","345271","It is a matter of language, not of whether or not I support animal rights. The term ""horse"" is used generally for the species. Animal rights discussions have only come up recently in human history so our use of terminology such as ""horse"" has not had enough time to change to automatically include the notion of horse-person. This is very different from the historical discussions about people / human beings / humans which are rife with terms such as ""human rights"" that are well stabilized in our cultural heritage. That is why ""horse"" can remain a neutral term while ""a human"" is not - there is too much social baggage attached to the term ""a human"" to leave it purely defined biologically. Also, I support animal rights. I don't need to define ""horse"" as ""horse-person"" to be able to do so.","Chuz Life","345276","Question, Another Opinion...

Thank you! And again, I completely understand your reluctance to agree with me on anything at all. But! If we (collective we) are ever to bridge the elective abortion divide that we have in this country, we are all going to have to find some common ground on the issue. Aren't we? In my opinion, that common ground must be found in the biological facts and a secular line of reasoning. I would like to move this discussion to the next aspect with you, A-O. But first, I would like to know how many others on your side of the issue (pro-choicers) agree with us that a human embryo is in fact (biologically speaking) a human organism.

I suspect that you will try to keep the discussion purely about biology for later stages of fetal development but, there, that approach will not be acceptable by me since I view there to be a truly fundamental change that happens around the beginning of the third trimester that changes a purely biological human organism into one with a mind - the world of difference. At that stage, it no longer stays purely a biological organism, but attains a critical development that now defines it as a person. I don't see how you will ever be able to get around the fundamental view that bodies alone don't have rights but bodies with minds do. Either way, I am willing to wait and see where you take this...","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","11:58 AM","abortion-debates","53"

We are here (conceivably) to debate our positions on the Constitutionality and legality of elective abortions. I come down on one side of the issue and you come down on the other. Subsequently, my line of questioning will be focused on getting you to understand (if not adopt) my point of view. And you are likewise expected to do the same for your point of view. If, in the end all we have is a better understanding of each others points of view, so be it. There are many readers who don't even take the time to post anything. They two may be pursuaded by one of our exchanges. Who knows? I've even considered (just for fun) a ""reverse role"" type debate/ thread where I could play the ""pro-choicer"" and you or someone on your side of the issue could be the ""anti-abort"" or ""pro-lifer."" Interested? Anyway, I'll get to the ""personhood begins at conception"" part of my arguments soon enough. Right now I just want to get as many as possible to agree that a human being's life ""biologically speaking"" begins at and by their ""conception."" (twins as someone pointed out are somewhat of an exception but we can discuss that later- let's keep things simple as possible for now) Here are a couple of links to help those who are reluctant to agree that human embryos are in fact human organisms and alive. (like anyone really needs proof to know that) ""One is the biological question: Is a cell a living thing? Answer? If two cells join in the process that begins to make a human being , are they living? Answer? No one disputes that. That's not the issue."" -- Bill Clinton "" Pre-Embryo The organism that starts developing at fertilization when the zygote is formed by the joining of an egg and a sperm. It attaches to the lining of the uterus after about seven days. It continues to develop until it forms an embryo, 9 to 11 days later. Up to 50 percent of all pre-embryos pass out of a womans body before a pregnancy is established."" -- Planned Parenthood "" Embryo The organism that develops from the pre-embryo and begins to share the womans blood supply about 1618 days after fertilization (seven to eight days after implantation)."" -- Planned Parenthood "" Fetus The organism that develops from the embryo at the end of about eight weeks of pregnancy (10 weeks since a womans last menstrual period) and receives nourishment through the placenta."" -- Planned Parenthood If anyone still has doubts?
