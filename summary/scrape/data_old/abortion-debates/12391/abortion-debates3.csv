Ok, I thought this was a debate forum where we could invite one another to debate specific issues. You participated in my poll, so I invited you to expound upon your presented position. No offense was intended so, I'm not sure where you are getting the feeling that anyone is looking down on you. I really am only interested in the topic of the thread here. Can we please stay focused on that?","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","01:01 PM","abortion-debates","36"
"02-27-2009","12391",3,"Chuz Life","345227","You can't have it both ways AO. Like you said, (to summarize) a horse, a human, a pig, a cow... the lives of Individual mammals (in general) begin at each their individual biological ""conceptions.""","Another opinion","345244","There is no inconsistency. As you quoted from me, I said: """"A future but not yet existing human being's living body begins at and by their conception, ...."" That means that their body - i.e. the body that will eventually become them - starts at conception but the human being only comes into existence later. How else did you interpret ""future but not yet existing""? Therefore, your rephrasing of my views: was misleading since, in my view, it is not the life of a human (i.e. person) that starts at conception but the life of the body that will become them but is not them yet - big difference. Don't blame me if you are misinterpreting my stance. Please do read my wording and understand it - do not ignore it.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","01:22 PM","abortion-debates","37"

Please do read my wording and understand it - do not ignore it.","Chuz Life","345246","Ok, AO, we seem to be chasing each other around in circles... let me try another approach. I know and have known all along that you do not agree that a ""person's"" life begins at and by their conception. As, it's clear from your posts that you see a ""person"" as something more than just an organism that just happens to be of the ""human"" species. I get it. But my questions are not about trying to convince you (yet) that a human zygote, embryo, fetus is a ""person."" My goal here is really simple. I am trying to get everyone (as many people as possible) to agree on three things. 1: That mammals (including human beings) are biological ""organisms."" 2: That the point of which said organisms become uniquely identifiable (the point of which their biological life begins) (as you indicated it is with horses) is in fact the moment of ""conception."" 3: That religion, ""souls"" and all that other hocus pocus has nothing to do with it. Can we or can we not agree on those three things?","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","01:37 PM","abortion-debates","39"
"02-27-2009","12391",3,"Another opinion","345250","1b: That human beings are biological ""organisms"" but also contain the critical aspect of a mental existence.","Chuz Life","345253","Before I attempt a lengthy post addressing this issue once again,... let me ask. ""Does it matter to you that the scientific community defines ""human beings"" differently than you do AO?""","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","02:12 PM","abortion-debates","42"

""Does it matter to you that the scientific community defines ""human beings"" differently than you do AO?"" human being noun 1. any individual of the genus Homo, esp. a member of the species Homo sapiens. 2. a person, esp. as distinguished from other animals or as representing the human species: living conditions not fit for human beings; a very generous human being.","Another opinion","345257","The very website that you used to define your terms in your opening post defines human being as the following (from http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/human%20being ): The first purely biological definition pertains only in the context of purely biological discussions of humans (ex. the biological differences between humans and animals), not in the social context we are discussing. The second definition is far more relevant to the abortion debate and that definition defines human being as person - just as I have been using it.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","02:20 PM","abortion-debates","44"

How many posts do you want me to cite where I specifically said I am ONLY asking about the BIOLOGICAL aspects, AO?
