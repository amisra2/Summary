Else a kidney would be a human being or the cells that run our body (red blood cells, macrophages, etc.) would be human beings. Or recently dead human in which activity is still occuring (various cells still doing things, etc.) would be a human being.","Chuz Life","345445","Well thanks for stating that for me, Shadow. Because it is exactly the sense that I was referring to a human embryo as a ""human being."" Namely; 1: A human embryo is human, it is a living human organism, it has it's own unique identity (DNA, genotype, etc.) and it's a product of human sexual reproduction. It's not only human,... it is (in the most strictest biological sense) also an ""individual."" 2: A living human embryo is as described above ""exists."" It's tangible. Is not a mere ""potential"" human organism. In more senses of the word ""being"" than a sperm cell or kidney or a skin cell,... a human embryo is ""biologically speaking"" a ""human being."" If you disagree with me fine. But you are also disagreeing with the scientific community who played a role in writing definitions such as this one. human being noun 1. any individual of the genus Homo, esp. a member of the species Homo sapiens. FYI, a kidney, skin cell or sperm cell? Are not by definition ""individual organisms of the genus Homo"" But even if you insist that they are (semantically),... that wouldn't mean that a human embryo would not be as well. To the contrary, it would just further show that they are. And note; To this point, I have only been arguing that a human individual's life begins at and by their conception. That they are genetically unique (DNA) and that they are existing organisms. I have yet to claim that a human embryo is a ""person."" Although I sense you are starting to see (as I do) how the case can be made. Another Opinion, if you want to cut and run,... that's fine with me. I'm disappointed but I half expected it. Hopefully someone more confident in their views will step up and actually recognize the biological definitions for what they are and not let their emotions or political agenda taint them in any way. Until then!","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","04:42 PM","abortion-debates","61"

Here is your definition of a human embryo (at least the one you used a few posts ago). This definition would certainly apply to an embryo that had just begun to divide (say 2 or 4 cells). But is this group of 4 cells an individual? Does an individual have, at least to some degree, to fend for itself, think for itself, be separate from other individuals? This young 4-celled embryo does none of those things. Just a thought.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","05:55 PM","abortion-debates","64"

I think describing it as an individual might be a bit of a stretch.

Besides that, Simley... you might also consider that embryos do (in a biological sense) ""fend for themselves."" by drawing nourishment, eliminating waste, and even by breathing (intracellular respiration).

""Pre-Embryo The organism that starts developing at fertilization when the zygote is formed by the joining of an egg and a sperm. It attaches to the lining of the uterus after about seven days.

They just sounded right to me. I'm sure, if I thought about it, I could come up with some more. It certainly would have supported your position if any of the definitions you provided earlier had even mentioned the phrase ""human being"". I'll answer for Simley too. If you're going to say that embryos fend for themselves, you might say the same of amoeba, which would mean they fulfil 2 of my 3 arbitrary criteria. Now who's the individual? Incidentally, the 2 or 4 cell embryo that I mentioned earlier is not even that, it's a pre-embryo (my bad), so does not do all those things that an embryo does. Yet again, I have not argued that embryos are not individual living organisms. Why do you keep implying that? I just think it is a stretch to refer to them as individuals. I have given my reasons. And using the old emotive ""you used to be one too"" argument does nothing for your position.

So, when the individual has developed then it will be "" the combination of genes that will determine all the bodily characteristics "". Case 2 See how the zygote and the resulting individual are listed separately. Perhaps this is because they are separate, different, not the same thing.

"02-28-2009","12391",5,"smiley","345482","In addendum to my previous post. Here is the Wiki page on the word 'Individual'. Not a brilliant choice for support, but you did ask. Let's dip in. This would suggest a need to be separate from others, and the possession of goals and desires would suggest some level of thought. It's a start. There's the idea of thought again, and separateness too. Here we go again with the thought, and throw in some responsibility and free will too. Responsibity might, at a push, be something like fending for oneself, I suppose. So, there you go. The individual. The thinking, free-willing, responsible and separate individual.","Chuz Life","345486","Those were some great aspects to the definition of the word ""individual,"" Smiley. Unfortunately (for you) only one aspect of the definition of a word need apply for a word's requirments to be met. Not all of them or the most exclusive of them. Indeed, I find it to be pretty telling about the level of your desperation,.. that you would use silly things such as a play on semantics like this to DENY even the smallest biological facts that prove against your political agenda. Do you honestly believe you are providing a compelling case for why I should deny the biological fact that a human individual's life, aging, etc. begins at and by their conception,... with only a play on words and your incessant whining that (in your opinion) the definition doesn't fit?

Context is certainly important, Smiley. And what better way to put the author's comments into the proper context than to review the definition he was elaborating on, itself? Let's review. Shall we?

So, tell me, Smiley.
