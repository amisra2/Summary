You asked me to provide a definition of the word individual that supported my position. I did just that. Now you accuse me of playing on semantics. It is you that is desperate. Then you accuse me of incessant whining and claim to have provided multiple links to prove me wrong. You have provided links, but have not actually understood the meaning of any one of them. So, you have proven nothing. As to what kind of individual I am now, one that is mildly annoyed by your inability to understand basis english, and your insistance in twisting and misunderstanding honest answers, but that is not the question. What you should have asked is what kind of individual I was then, then still an embryo. I have already supplied the answer to that one. And then you revert to defining a zygote once more. I have no poblem with this definition of a zygote, but where does it state that this zygote is an INDIVIDUAL? You have yet to give an honest answer on that one. I am quickly coming to the same view, as 'Another Opinion'. You are not an honest debater. Unless you stop twisting my words and using schoolchild tactics in this debate I will be gone. I suggest you actually come up with some proof of your position rather than making smarmy comment about mine.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","08:46 AM","abortion-debates","76"

Your definitions that you provided so support your definitions for ""individuals"" and individualism and all that... Namely defining traits such as ""thought"" or living independently. However, what you ignore is the fact that the same references and definitions are INCLUSIVE enough to recognize the individuality of even the smallest and most vulnerable of organisms, too. You are attempting to use the higher standards for one definition of the word ""individual"" to exclude or denounce oranisms which meet the most basic standards for that definition. That is the classic definition of playing ""semantics."" I understand them perfectly well. Enough to know that it is you (not I) who is using the definitions to exclude ""individuality"" rather than to recognize it for what it is, given the particular stage of life the ""individual"" organism is in. Ok, so you were once an organism in the embryonic stage of your life. But you weren't at that time and ""individual"",.... you were just an ""individual organism?"" Riiiight. And and now you are an ""individual"" AND ""an ""individual organism!"" No play on semantics with that one, huh? Only you, Smiley.... So far, you are the only one who claims that an ""individual zygote"" is indeed an ""individual organism"" but can't be legitimately referred to as being an ""individual"" in this discussion Ok,... Buh Bye... I don't need you for these points to be made.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","11:41 AM","abortion-debates","77"

You see the words 'individual organism' and think this means that the organism is an individual. You have already demonstrated that you have difiiculty distinguishing nouns from adverbs, and this is where the problem lies. In the phrase 'individual organism', the word individual is an adjective. This does not mean that the individual organism meets the requirements to be an individual, where the word individual is a noun. You could equally use your position to argue that this individual cupcake is an individual. However it takes much more than being an individual something to actually be an individual .

They simply do not support your position. Let's start with the Bill Clinton quote and look at it closely. I realise that this will be the first time you have actually looked closely at it, so I'll take it slowly for you. ""One is the biological question: Is a cell a living thing? Answer? If two cells join in the process that begins to make a human being, are they living? Answer? No one disputes that. That's not the issue.""-- Bill Clinton Is a cell a living thing? Yes. Assuming that it is a living cell, of course. If two cells join in the process that begins to make a human being, are they living? Yes, they are living. But you jumped on the words human being and assumed that the full quote would support your position. However, if you look at the whole question, it asks if the two cells join in a process that begins to make a human being , are they living. It does not say that the two cells are a human being (which you wrongfully assumed), but that they are at the start of a process at the end of which they become a human being. So, I suggest you go away, learn to read, and then come back and use grown up debating methods to put forward a more carefully thought out argument. If not, I wish you luck in finding anyone who can be bothered to put up with debating you.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","07:48 PM","abortion-debates","80"

"03-02-2009","12391",6,"Another Opinion - e-mail","None","Chuz Life, a recent poster on this forum, has proven to be a dishonest poster in violating the following rule which you have all new registrees agree to: Do not exaggerate or misrepresent other user's post. This is the first time that I have reported another forum participant and it is mainly due to the danger posed to honest debate by the distortions of such a poster. I have never reported mere flamers since their posts are generally not taken seriously except by those who already hold their views. However, a poster such as Chuz Life is one that has the appearance of being a rational and logical poster but, because of their distortions, can mislead impressionable and less experienced readers through dishonest tactics - far more dangerous to genuine debate and, I would guess, the very reason why you posted these rules to begin with. One set of evidence of Chuz Life's violation of the rule of misrepresenting another user's post is in the four times in which Chuz Life misrepresented my posts in the thread ""When does a human individuals life begin? "" of the Abortion forum. Note, typically, Chuz Life correctly quotes the opponent, but then misrepresents the opponent's views by rewording them falsely. The three violations are as follows: Violation #1: In post # 6, Chuz Life quoted my views as ""To specify my own views, I think that the bodies of unique individuals / people start at conception but that body does not become a person / individual until the beginning of mental existence, which cannot start before roughly the third trimester."" He then misrepresented my views by saying : ""The second paragraph of your post is more in line with what I was looking for. It's clear that you agree that (at least) a person's living body (a living human individual's body) begins at and by their ""conception."""". At the time, I thought that this was an honest misunderstanding, and corrected him in my post #9: ""It is not the body of an individual until an individual comes into existence. Again, individual = person by the very definition which you linked. Before that body becomes an individual / person by gaining some mental existence, it is just a body with ""nobody home"" belonging to no one except the mother since she is the only individual in existence at that point in time who has any relevance."" Violation #2: Chuz Life then took my answer from post #9 and again misrepresented it in his post #10: "" But you have already addressed the aspect of my poll that i was seeking from you, AO... You stated that a human being's living body begins at and by their conception."" I responded to this misrepresentation in my post #12 : ""The wording is very important since it carries many meanings and possible misinterpretations. Therefore, I would reword your bolded statement as ""A future but not yet existing human being's living body begins at and by their conception, but the human being themselves does not come into existence until later on in pregnancy, once mental existence is gained."" or, simply, ""A future but not yet existing human being's living body begins at and by their conception"". It is very important, in my view, to differentiate between the body before it becomes a human being (= person = individual) and the body once it gains mental existence, at which point it is a human being. I will not agree to any statements of my opinion that do not make that point clear."" Violation #3: So, Chuz Life took another tactic and, in post #21, asked ""So, to take some of the emotions out of this thread,... please tell me when you believe an individual ""horse's"" life biologically begins?"" to which I answered, in post #22: ""I would think that the term ""horse"" is generally perceived to only be a technical term denoting that species and, for most of us, is not a term that carries any horse-equivalent sense of personhood and does not necessarily automatically bring to mind the personality of a horse (except for those people who work with horses or deal with animal rights). For most of us, it is a fairly neutral term - the equivalent of the ""individual human life form"" term I used in a previous post. So, given the neutrality of that term for most people, then I would agree that the life of a horse begins at conception."" Chuz Life then misrepresented this view in his post #30: ""Like you said, (to summarize) a horse, a human, a pig, a cow... the lives of every Individual mammal (in general) begins at each their individual biological ""conceptions."""" I responded to his mirepresentation in my post #31: ""Please stop trying to reword my views. I would agree with the view of most of that except for ""a human"". As I have said over and over, one has to be VERY careful which terms one uses for humans since words about humans are very loaded with meaning that words about mammals are not (at least as far as I can tell). A human also can be interpreted as ""a person"". You might call this quibling but it is a major point of contention that you just don't seem to understand. One cannot just take a word that carries the meaning of ""person"" and then pretend that it does not carry that meaning. As long as you use a word that carries that meaning, then you will get the same range of answers from us, depending on our personal definition of ""person"". Do you or do you not understand the concept that the terms one uses are important?"" Chuz Life contested whether or not this is a misrepresentation in his post #32 and I answered him in my post #37. He had no counter-response to those arguements. Meanwhile: From post #42 to post #47, we had a dispute about definitions where ""human being"" is, by the dictionary, defined in two ways - 1) biologically as the species and 2) as person, where Chuz Life insisted on using the biological definition but I insisted that I would not agree to using the biological definition but insisted on the definition as ""person"" and would walk out of the thread if he kept to that purely biological definition. Violation #4: So, Chuz Life tried yet another tactic. By asking, in post #50: ""Do you agree with me, that a human embryo is (for the sake of this discussion) a living human organism?"" to which I responded, in post #51: ""Yes, I agree that a human embryo is a living human organism and can be defined purely as that."" At which point, in post #54, he once again misrepresented my view as saying: ""Right now I just want to get as many as possible to agree that a human being's life ""biologically speaking"" begins at and by their ""conception."" "" - which obviously meant that he thought I had agreed to that statement. After that last violation, I gave up on the debate with Chuz Life and left the thread - stating, in post #59: ""NO NO NO NO NO! I never agreed that a human being's life begins at conception. I have made clear over and over that, since a human being is defined as a person, and since I view a person as starting at mental existence, then anything preceding that is not a human being. THerefore, the human embryo may be a human organism but it is NOT a human being. This is the third time now that you have distorted my views and I am getting very tired of the dishonesty and am very quickly losing patience with you."" ------------------------ I know this is a long e-mail, and I am grateful for your patience in reading through it, but it was necessary in order to outline the specifics in how Chuz Life distorts his opponent's views. He apparently similarly distorted smiley's views since, in post #76, he writes ""I am quickly coming to the same view, as 'Another Opinion'. You are not an honest debater. Unless you stop twisting my words and using schoolchild tactics in this debate I will be gone."" However, I will not detail those distortions in this e-mail. That is up to smiley. I hope that I have sufficiently proved my case and that you recognize that Chuz Life did indeed violate forum rules. So, please, let Chuz Life know that this is not acceptable and, if he continues to repeat such tactics after any warning on your part, consider banning him from the forum.
