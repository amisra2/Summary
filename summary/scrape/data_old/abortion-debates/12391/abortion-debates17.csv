"03-29-2009","12391",17,"Chuz Life","348222","I'm saying a little bit more than that. Yes, I agree that all people must be free to seek their own truths in life. But, no-one has the right to infringe upon the rights of others in their quests for their truth, convenience or anything else. So, it's not quite as simple as you would like it to be.","chester","348264","Since you said this, I can't see how you can help but agree with the concept that no one has an interest in a particular pregnancy OTHER THA N the woman herself. Then again, logical consistency does not seem to be a strong point with the profetallife crowd. Now, let's talk about when personhood, which is a legal concept, really does commence. Seems as though the only projectionist I know is the one at the local multiplex.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","06:06 PM","abortion-debates","243"

Finally, however, at least you had the forthrightness to answer the question that so many of your ilk refuse to deal with. You DO think that the government is better equipped to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is. That's a scary thought, as you would make the woman a slave to her fetus. Now, tell us, does this attitude of yours stem from a fear of women or from a hatred of them? I, on the other hand, have enough confidence in each woman that I will support whatever choice she makes. Come back when you understand the difference between an egg and a chicken, an acorn and an oak tree, a fetus and a child (and not definition #4).","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","07:37 PM","abortion-debates","245"

Wade declared it so. But I won't hold my breath waiting for you to retract this claim. Actually, I think that medical doctors are the ones best equipped to make those decisions. To the extent that any parent is a slave to their child (as I am a slave to my own) it is the consequence of creating that child in the first place. You don't want the responsibility of caring for a child? Don't create one. I love women,.. and I believe their rights (life liberty and due process) begin at their biological conceptions. Rights that you consistantly deny,... yet you claim that it is I who hates women? You even deny them their personhood. Yeah,.. including the choice to kill her child or to pay someone else to kill it... We know.

An embryo is less developed than a baby, but a baby is also less developed than an adult. Should the baby have less life than the adult because it has not developed entirely? No. And a fetus should have no less life than a baby for the same reason.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","08:22 PM","abortion-debates","247"

In response to your #1 and #3, I seem to remember Someone saying, ""No greater love hath no man than that he lay down his life for his brother."" Many a Medal of Honor has been given posthumously to the serviceman who threw his body on a grenade to save his fellow platoon members. Was the military foolish to make these awards, or were they recognizing true acts of self-sacrifice and heroism? As to #2, one more time <sigh!> . I have no position. No man is entitled to an opinion on the topic of whether a particular pregnant woman chooses to carry her pregnancy to term or ends it. It is the SOLE province of the woman involved to make that choice.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","06:32 PM","abortion-debates","254"

There is a difference between sacrificing yourself for someone else and sacrificing someone else for yourself. Abortion is the latter of the two. That is your position right there. It is ridiculous to say you have no position. If you had no position you couldn't be arguing with me right now.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","06:56 PM","abortion-debates","255"
