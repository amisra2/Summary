Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that it was I who used the word ""always"". To paraphrase Tricky Dickie Nixon, which is the operative statement, 253 or 255? Don't trip over your pant cuffs as you backpedal. Care for another go at it, Mr. LaMotta?","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","08:10 PM","abortion-debates","256"
"03-30-2009","12391",18,"Lakrite","348405","That is your position right there. It is ridiculous to say you have no position. If you had no position you couldn't be arguing with me right now.","chester","348416","Not arguing at all. All that I am saying is that yours is a subjective opinion on a metaphysical issue, and it is no more or no less valid than every other subjective opinion on the same metaphysical issue. Sorry, but last time I checked, your subjective opinion was not written on a tablet of stone to the exclusion of all others. In fact, I would give the subjective opinion of any particular pregnant woman far more credence than yours. She's there; you're not. BTW, a REAL ""True Conservative"", Barry Goldwater, told us that the government had no business dealing with or interest in a woman's pregnancy. Since I agree with that great American, I suppose I am more conservative than you. Conservative? Yes! Neocon? Never!","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","08:14 PM","abortion-debates","257"
