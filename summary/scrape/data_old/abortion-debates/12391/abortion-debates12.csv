"03-08-2009","12391",12,"smiley","346449","Are you now saying he supports you, having just insulted him? However, I agree that it is a deep philosophical question. ,...let's take a look at the bit you quoted. You highlighted the bit that said ""human being"", thinking that this alone would back up your argument, but you failed to notice the words ""the process that begins to make a"" in front of it. So, if Clinton is saying that the ""cells join in the process that begins to make a human being"", then they cannot yet be a human being. So, he certainly does not support your argument. I am still amazed that you would use this quote to support your argument, when it clearly does not.","Chuz Life","346452","An you quoted him, why?[/QUOTE] I quoted Clinton because you claimed he supports your views on when an individual life begins. Hell no. And how have I insulted him? Perhaps for some it is. But for those who have a basic understanding of the biologiocal facts, and an acceptence for what those facts indicate,... it's really quite basic and simple. I don't need Bill Clinton's remarks for support in any way. It is you who envoked his name in your (appeal to authority) attempt to bolster your position. Not me.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","11:59 AM","abortion-debates","167"
"03-08-2009","12391",12,"JakeCJB","346465","It depends on how you define a ""human individual"". We can define it by biology, that's obvious. But it hasn't yet reached the point where this individual life , is a sentient human person. This general thought about when the human person begins is based on evidence and reason, however. In the early stages of development, the thalamus is not connected to the cerebral cortex by nerve cell circuits, so logically, based on evidence, there is no sentience. It hasn't reached this stage as yet, as much as you can correctly and biologically call it an individual life . It's not a human person."" You're defining a person by a simple biological and genetic truism.","Chuz Life","346471","I agree, Jake. And I never claimed a zygote, embryo or even a fetus to be ""sentient."" But besides that point, the poll for this thread and the comments from many of those on your side of the issue come up a little short on forming a concensus on what you just indicated. (that it's obvious that a human individual's life ""biologically"" begins at conception. I'll gladly debate and discuss all the other aspects to a human individual (sentience, brain waves, ability to feel pain and all that),... but not until we all agree that their individual biological life begins at conception. Again, I would love to debate you on whether or not it can be a ""person"" when it clearly has no ""sentience."" But not until we have a significant number agree that their individual life biologically begins at conception. I'm not defining anything, Jake. The definitions say what they say. They were written by people much more versed on these issues than I am. What we have is a difference of how we shose to acknowledge and apply those definitions. (do we use them to include what could be a new (class of) human individual(s) or do we use those definitions to ex clude them?) I believe things (especially things like human beings) should be defined by the human attributes they have,... and not by the ones they may temporarily lack. It really is as simple as that.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","03:06 PM","abortion-debates","169"

"03-09-2009","12391",12,"Another opinion","346575","The term ""individual"" as used as an adjective does indeed carry the world of difference than the term ""individual"" used as a noun - by the very same dictionaries that you quote.","Chuz Life","346576","Right, so biologically speaking a chicken embryo for example would be an ""individual life"" even an ""individual chicken life"" but it wouldn't be an ""individual chicken"" because ""individual"" chickens have feathers and cluck and stuf like that? Is that right?","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","02:58 PM","abortion-debates","179"

Is that right?","Another opinion","346587","We covered this direction in an earlier discussion when you chose to speak of the beginning of the life of horses. As I said then and I repeat now, the term ""horse"" (or, in this case, ""chicken"") do not carry any conotation of person, as do the terms a ""human"" or ""individual"" or ""human being"". As such, one can define them purely biologically - which is something one cannot do if one speaks of ""humans"", ""individuals"" or ""human beings"". You are trying to fit a square peg in a round hole - i.e. trying to adapt the concept of humans/individuals/human beings into purely biological meanings that do not take their dictionary definitions as ""person"" into account. If you want to describe that human life form that is the embryo, then you need to choose a term that does not carry that definition of ""person"" along with it. This has been and continues to be the main point of contention between yourself and most of the posters here.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","04:33 PM","abortion-debates","180"
