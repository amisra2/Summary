NOT about when their ""person-hood"" begins. READ IT CLOSELY.","iangb","345785","I think this is a perfect quote to use as an example, Chuz, as to why you are seen as being massively inconsistent. You claim that you are looking at 'when a persons ageing process begins' without addressing the extra topic of 'personhood'. However, this is not seen to be the case (or even to be possible), because by calling a zygote a 'person' you have already implicitly defined a zygote has 'personhood' - that's what a 'person' is. So when you try and claim that A_O has said that 'a human beings life starts at conception', or 'an individuals life starts at 'conception', or 'a persons life starts at conception', he disagrees with you - because in each of those cases the language you use to describe an unintelligent, unaware, unconscious collection of cells implies that 'personhood' has already been bestowed upon it, which is not the case. A_O has said* that the life of an organism with unique human DNA starts at conception. I wouldn't even go that far - I'd say that the 'existence' of an organism with unique human DNA starts at conception. Neither of us has said that the organism is an 'individual', a 'person' or a 'human being' - and when you insist on pretending that we have used those terms, we (quite understandably, IMO) call you out on 'playing semantics' - because the language you are using includes implications which we did not put there in the first place and which (we suspect) will be vital in your later arguments**. *Feel free to correct me on this, AO **Largely due to ""The abortion debate is more of a concern for ""individual"" rights and not just rights in general,.... so the debate itself needs to be more focused on the ""individual"" aspects of a person's life, rights etc. (Namely,.. ""when does a human ""individual's"" life begin and what are their rights to the life they are living?"")"" ~Chuz Lite ( from here ). EDIT: Oh, and thanks for proving my own little prediction quite correct. I refer to "" If you are trying to get everyone to agree on an initial premise for a later argument, the way to do so is by argument of your own, not with thinly veiled insults or (as I suspect is coming) a flurry of arguments from authority. "" ~iangb, a few pages back . Got any arguments that are more than just other people's definitions?","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","08:53 PM","abortion-debates","121"
"03-02-2009","12391",9,"Another opinion","345782","First of all, it is the responsibility of the agreived party to make the complaint. In other words, if you are the one against whom someone is using illegal debate tactics, then you should be the one to complain. I am not the forum police that goes around complaining about anyone who violates rules. I complained because rules were violated against ME. Secondly, you have been unable to support any logical arguement about any claimed logical fallacies on my part. I challenge you to actually explain the logical fallacies you claim I make and not run away, like you usually do, as soon as I make a point that you cannot counter.","Archangel","345786","Your logical fallacy is your oft repeated arbitrary opinion that mental existence is the criteria by which the unborn deserve the right to complete their natural gestation period. You think you are qualified to disregard them as so many disposable cells when you know all too well that they are growing and developing in the normal and expected way that the rest of us did. And I have never run away from a debate with you or anyone else. I simply state my case a couple of different ways over multiple posts and when I get the same exact repeated lip service which claims that I don't get it, when I get your game of semantics with human life perfectly, I just walk away and leave you to your own hypocritical devices. I wish I could place you so called pro-choicers in the position to reverse engineer you into an embryo back in the womb of an unknown woman. We could call it the #### shoot of life or death, but before doing it you had the option to vote on the legalization and morality of abortion. And knowing what you know with your intellectual mind about what abortion entails, and knowing how easily you leftists will sell out others until it costs you personally, I'd bet dollars to donuts if you knew you were destined to be in the same position you so easily commit the unborn to, you would all of a sudden become pro-lifers in a heart beat. How easily and cowardly you proponents of death will arbitrarily choose for them when they can feel. But if it was you who was in that position, how quickly you would value life.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","08:53 PM","abortion-debates","122"

The real topic was, is, and always will be the question of who gets to make the choice of whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term. For the profetallifers here, that choice is taken from the one best suited to make the choice - the pregnant woman - and is handed to some nameless, faceless bureaucrat representing the nanny state. For those of us in the pro-choice camp, the response is clear. We trust women enough that we say the woman involved has the right, duty, and obligation to be entrusted with the choice. Let us not get distracted by angels on the heads of pins discussions that take us away from the real topic.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","06:57 AM","abortion-debates","125"

"03-03-2009","12391",9,"iangb","345857","Yeah, I don't think we're that different here. I go for 'existence' because I don't think that, at that point, the organism is coherent enough to be described in an individualistic, 'it-will-be' term - regardless of the fact that it has unique DNA. For one thing, there is all the potential twin issues - monozygotic/identical twins, and most of the 'complications of twin pregnancy' section: what, I wonder, does Chuz make of chimera twins? Can I have 'the life of my left arm originally started a few seconds before the life of my right leg'?. Meh: po-tay-toe/po-tah-toe. I've said before that 'life' is a subjective term.","Another opinion","345865","Granted, at that early stage right after conception, the fertilized egg can still split into two to make identical twins with identical DNA. However, one has to be careful. If someone takes a skin scraping from you, injects that DNA into an egg (as was done with Dolly the sheep) and clones you, does that mean that your body is not an organism with unique human DNA? For me, the important thing for the beginning of a human organism is that the DNA are in place which define it. I suppose that it is not as important that the DNA is unique except in the sense that it is unique from the life forms that spawned it (sperm and egg in this case) and is complete. Since we can all be cloned, one might say that none of our DNA are guaranteed to be unique. However, I do get your point that what ""it will be"" is not individualistic at the stage immediately after conception since one zygote can split into two twins so you can't say that the zygote was one that grew into Joe or that the zygote was one that grew into Fred (Joe and Fred being twins in this case) but that zygote grew into both Joe and Fred. That is not the case with cloning since you are still you both before and after you are cloned and the cloned being was never you. Though very few zygotes actually do split, this is not actually relevant for the great majority of zygotes but it IS potentially relevant for each zygote (you never know if it will split). Ok, then . You convinced me. When, then, would you say that what ""it will be"" is firmly established?","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","01:02 PM","abortion-debates","131"

I'm not sure it's possible to be much more specific! You haven't learnt here. Look at your own definition of 'individual'. You've specified 'biologically speaking', so the relevant section for 'individual' is the following: 5. Biology. a. a single organism capable of independent existence. b. a member of a compound organism or colony. Note the bolded. As such, I'd say that the 'life' of a 'human individual' commences at the point where they can survive outside of the womb - which is about the 25-week period. Coincidentally (or not!), 24 weeks is the UK limit.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","05:42 PM","abortion-debates","133"

I'm not english major myself,... but even I know that the word ""independence"" is used as an adjective in the definition you quoted. ""independent EXISTENCE."" Which begs the question; ""does a human zygote, embryo, fetus have an ""existence"" which is distinguishable from that of the mother's ""existence?"" The answer is yes. So you are wrong on your assertion. Additionally, you have failed to address the ""compound organism"" aspect of a ""mother, child"" relationship during pregnancy. So it isn't me, iangb who needs to brush up on your comprehension skills. It's you.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","10:24 PM","abortion-debates","135"
