"02-28-2009",3,"12391","62","Chuz Life","345445","Well thanks for stating that for me, Shadow. Because it is exactly the sense that I was referring to a human embryo as a ""human being."" Namely; 1: A human embryo is human, it is a living human organism, it has it's own unique identity (DNA, genotype, etc.) and it's a product of human sexual reproduction. It's not only human,... it is (in the most strictest biological sense) also an ""individual."" 2: A living human embryo is as described above ""exists."" It's tangible. Is not a mere ""potential"" human organism. In more senses of the word ""being"" than a sperm cell or kidney or a skin cell,... a human embryo is ""biologically speaking"" a ""human being."" If you disagree with me fine. But you are also disagreeing with the scientific community who played a role in writing definitions such as this one. human being noun 1. any individual of the genus Homo, esp. a member of the species Homo sapiens. FYI, a kidney, skin cell or sperm cell? Are not by definition "" individual organisms of the genus Homo"" But even if you insist that they are (semantically),... that wouldn't mean that a human enbryo would not be as well. And note; To this point, I have only been arguing that a human individual's life begins at and by their conception. That they are genetically unique (DNA) and that they are existing organisms. I have yet to claim that a human embryo is a ""person."" Although I sense you are starting to see (as I do) how the case can be made. Another Opinion, you want to cut and run,... fine with me. I'm disappointed but I half expected it. Hopefully someone more confident in their views will step up and actually recognize the biological definitions for what they are and not let their emotions or political agenda taint them in any way. Until then!","smiley","345447","Now all you have to do is decide whether "" individual "" and "" individual organism "" are the same thing.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","05:14 PM","abortion-debates","22"

Case 2 See how the zygote and the resulting individual are listed separately. Perhaps this is because they are separate, different, not the same thing. So, less of the over-dramatic sarcastic BS if you don't mind. And your thanks is noted. I hope I have clarified these aspects further for you.","Chuz Life","345488","Yes. Context is certainly important, Smiley. And what better way to put the author's comments into the proper context than to review the definition he was elaborating on, itself? Let's review. Shall we? The definition is; ZYGOTE; n. 1 The cell formed by the union of two gametes, especially a fertilized ovum before cleavage. 2 The organism that develops from a zygote. And the author's comments; "" a zygote is the cell that results from fertilization. It is the union of a spermatozoon and an ovum the mature germ cells, known also as the male and female gametes (from the Greek for husband and wife). Each of the two gametes is haploid, meaning that the nucleus has half the number of chromosomes of normal body cells. Their union results in the diploid zygote, with a full set of chromosomes, carrying the combination of genes that will determine all the bodily characteristics of the new individual. When, as a result of this union, matched genes (alleles) at particular sites on the newly paired chromosomes are different from each other, the zygote, and hence the resulting individual,.."" Now, What is the definition (#1 & #2) of a Zygote again? It's the single ""cell formed by the union of two gametes"" and it is also ""the organism that developes from a zygote"" Right? So, tell me, Smiley. What ""individual organism"" it is that you feel carries "" the combination of genes that will determine all the bodily characteristics of the new individual "" If it's not the same individual ""zygote,"" that is (in the NOW through the process of cell division) further developing those traits?","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","10:42 PM","abortion-debates","324"
