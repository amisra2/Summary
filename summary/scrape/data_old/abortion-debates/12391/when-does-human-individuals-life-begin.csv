It is not the body of an individual until an individual comes into existence. Again, individual = person by the very definition which you linked. Before that body becomes an individual / person by gaining some mental existence, it is just a body with ""nobody home"" belonging to no one except the mother since she is the only individual in existence at that point in time who has any relevance. Again, how can you claim that I am evasive if it is YOU who purposely made the post unclear. If you do not have specific challenges to the points I made, then the evasiveness is clearly on your side. Again, do you or don't you agree that individual = person and, therefore, your challenge to define the begining of life of an individual without considering that definition is a contradictary nonsensical challenge.

Unless you have enough intellectual courage to answer the challenges I posed to you about the contradictions in your presentation of your post / poll, then your claims of our weakness ring very hollow. The answer to the disagreement is simpler than you imagine. Either: 1) Use more neutral terms that don't introduce a contradiction. For example, you could phrase the question ""Biologically speaking, when does an individual human life form begin""? That ""human life form"" or other such neutral terms, do not carry with them the definition of personhood - at least none that I can detect.

Given that question, my answer would be - the biological life of an individual starts at the same time as the individual himself/herself starts - sometime during the third trimester when the previously existing mindless body gains a mental existence based on the biological development of cortical connections that allow that mental existence. The closest choice in the poll to that is ""immediately after the second trimester"". Though it is far from certain that mental existence starts at the very beginning of the third trimester, I am willing to give the fetus the benefit of the doubt and say that, if mental existence might be possible, then assume that it exists - making the fetus an individual (where ""individual"" = ""person"" by the dictionary definition). The biological life of a human body exists before that time, but it is not an ""individual"" yet nor can it belong to a not-yet-existing individual since, after all, the individual does not exist yet so how can any being that doesn't exist yet own or have any claim to anything - including a body.

For most of us, it is a fairly neutral term - the equivalent of the ""individual human life form"" term I used in a previous post.

That is when the mind finally develops and the foetus can finally have the ability to have a consciousness (unable without the mental function before this point).

"02-26-2009","12391",2,"Another opinion","345146","The life of an individual (= person) begins when the individual begins. Since I don't view any living body without a mentality as an individual (i.e.person), then, by my definition of individual/person, it can only come into any existence (biological or otherwise) once it does so mentally. Where, pray tell, is the inconsistency? What are you talking about?!?! I have no idea. First of all, my position is not pro abortion. I would be quite happy if there were no more abortions performed ever but not because of a law (which I would find unjust) but because of eliminated need for abortion through improved contraception, sex education, etc. I am not claiming that all biological life is measured by mental existence. I am claiming that biological life of INDIVIDUALS is measured by mental existence since, in my view, mental existence is what defines individuals. I am not the one who chose the term ""individual"", Chuz Life was. Blame him not me for the consequences of that choice of terms. On a last note, the bottom line is that, in my view: Individual = Person = human mind So, without a human mind, no individual / person can exist in any way, shape or form. Hypothetically, I would even say that a body is not necessary. If minds could be proven to exist without bodies - i.e. a soul - then I would call that body-less mind an ""individual"" or ""person"". In reality, there is no evidence whatsoever of souls, so this remains purely a hypothetical point.","Archangel","345160","But you know very well, or should that just because mammals develop in stages, it is ludicrous to deny ones biological existence simply because it hasn't developed the mental existence yet. It is still a TOTALLY unique individual which is evidenced by the number of individuals you have met in your lifetime; no two ever being identical in every way. Even identical twins who share DNA are unique in their own ways based on their personal experiences within the same family, and their personal interpretations of those experiences. But here you are saying that because a fetus hasn't yet developed a mental existence it is somehow sub-human and not deserving of rights. It is inconsistent by any rational thought process. I'm talking about defending the fact that even single celled creatures which have no mental existence and never will, are defended by you and your comrades as no doubt alive as biological organisms. It seems to me that since you intellectually and personally know that every single human being you have ever and will ever know was once a single celled creature with no mental existence also, that you could make the common sense leap that these fetuses have real and true value from the moment of conception. It's not as though there's a question as to what species they will grow into after all. Your rationale is contradictory and inconsistent at the most basic level of reasoning based on what you personally know about science and life. Of course your position is pro abortion. You just prefer to call it pro choice because you are still playing a game of semantics. You think that by defining the issue as you do that you somehow are relieved of the guilt for supporting a practice which leads to the death of 1.3 million babies each year in this country alone. You justify your pro abortion stance by making this about mental existence when you know darn well that if that child was just allowed to complete its normal and natural gestation period, that we have 7 BILLION living examples of real evidence on Earth as we speak of what it will grow into, which proves what those babies really are in truth and in fact if only allowed to develop normally rather than be snuffed out. The bolded exposes your erroneous position since you know all too well that people will design their views based on what they choose to believe according to their personal morality. You are attempting to justify abortion which you claim to find abhorrent by redefining what makes us human. You know that every single doctor on Earth today will tell you that a baby is alive at conception and immediately starts to grow and develop at that time. But like a slick lawyer who thinks you have found a loophole in the law, you proudly claim that because the fetus has no mental existence, it really isn't biologically alive yet. Talk about redefining words AO, you take first prize. You know what those babies are, even at conception. They are alive and developing. But you will actually justify their destruction since they haven't yet developed a mental existence yet. And you see that as a rational and moral position? I reject and pity such morality as found truly wanting. I don't even know where to start in critiquing this statement since I can't prove to you that the soul exists in any terms you would appreciate either, even though I know it does. So I will just say this, when a question like this which determines the life and death of perfectly innocent babies, how dare you not choose to ere on the side of caution and in favor of the baby since you have no evidence that the soul does not exist. What absolute arrogance and hubris to vote against preserving life when you admit that you have no evidence at all that human beings are soulless creatures. I also find it sad that since you have personally experienced love, joy, sympathy for others, compassion, ecstasy along with all of the other emotions and characteristics which make us human that you will just write these 1.3 million unborn human beings off each year due to a lack of evidence. Is that your idea of a moral and rational perspective? Would you vote for the defendant to be put to death if they aren't sure he's guilty of murder AO? Of course you wouldn't. Yet you will defend the murder of 1.3 million unborn babies per year because you have no evidence they have a soul. Do you see what I mean by inconsistent? And I must add contradictory based on what you know and have personally experienced in life about what makes us human. You're either the most morally compromised person I know (along with these other pro death advocates) or you are the most unobservant regarding your ability to judge and discern the value of our human natures.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","06:37 PM","abortion-debates","24"
"02-27-2009","12391",2,"None","None","None","iangb","345211","Loaded question. There are several possible answers to this question, so I'll include 'em as I go. It's worth noting that verifying your prediction, Chuz, is not evidence of 'weakness'. It's evidence that an organism does not immediately 'become alive'; it's an ongoing, subjective process - you may as well ask 'at what point does a painting become a work of art'? I'd start with a related question to you: at what point does a person become officially 'dead'? Medically, you die when your brain ceases to function . Going by this, you officially become 'alive' when your brain starts to work in the first place - which is usually about second-trimester. I would guess that this would be my main response. However, there are others... At what point do the cells in your body become 'alive'? Most of the cells that make up your body at the moment were not alive when you were born , so the question must be rephrased to 'at what point were any of the cells that once made up any part of your body alive'? This would be back before conception, when the relevant egg and sperm cells were created in the relevant parents. A third version: ""at which point were you an alive human individual ?"" Ignoring the personality-based semantics of the word 'individual' - until the umbilical cord is cut, a baby is at best a symbiote to it's mother, at worst a parasite (the only reason the mother's body does not attack the baby as a foreign intruder is that the foetus uses the same tactics (very similar proteins, even) to 'hide' from the mother's immune system). The answer (semantics aside) here would be - when the umbilical cord is cut. I could probably go on, but I think you've got my point. As a direct answer: you are alive when you become concious, because we define death as permanent loss of conciousness. However, the whole concept of 'life' as something with a definitive start and end is a false one.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","09:12 AM","abortion-debates","27"

Until you do so, you will not be taken seriously as a debater and threads you start will degenerate into flame wars. To try to explain my understanding of iagb's position along with my disagreement: No being suddenly spontaneously generates out of nothing. The human zygote, for example, was an unfertilized egg just moments prior to being fertilized by the sperm - where the egg and sperm were both alive and human. The egg and sperm themselves also did not spontaneously generate out of nothing but where produced by other living cells within the human body. Tracking backwards, this path of life can be traced back all the way to the beginning of life on Earth. So, if it is life itself that is in question, then I would agree with iagb that the issue is far more general. Iagb's also presents other interpretations. However, you questioned us about the life of a unique individual horse. The reason that I agreed that a particular horse's life starts at conception is not because there was not a horse life form alive before that but because the unfertilized horse egg could have been part of any infinite number of potential future horses and did not uniquely define that horse. Only once that unfertilized horse egg was fertilized did it gain the complete set of DNA that defined that PARTICULAR horse and set the process of growth going for that particular horse. This reasoning can also be applied to human life forms but, with humans, one has to be FAR more careful with the language that one uses since terms used for humans are far more loaded with meaning than terms used for horses.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","10:19 AM","abortion-debates","29"

The human zygote, for example, was an unfertilized egg just moments prior to being fertilized by the sperm - where the egg and sperm were both alive and human. The egg and sperm themselves also did not spontaneously generate out of nothing but where produced by other living cells within the human body. Tracking backwards, this path of life can be traced back all the way to the beginning of life on Earth. So, if it is life itself that is in question, then I would agree with iagb that the issue is far more general. Iagb's also presents other interpretations. However, you questioned us about the life of a unique individual horse. The reason that I agreed that a particular horse's life starts at conception is not because there was not a horse life form alive before that but because the unfertilized horse egg could have been part of any infinite number of potential future horses and did not uniquely define that horse. Only once that unfertilized horse egg was fertilized did it gain the complete set of DNA that defined that PARTICULAR horse and set the process of growth going for that particular horse. This reasoning can also be applied to human life forms but, with humans, one has to be FAR more careful with the language that one uses since terms used for humans are far more loaded with meaning than terms used for horses.","Chuz Life","345222","Absolutely not! However, I am only human and when I see something as irrational or illogical I tend to express my opinions about it. Believe me, the reaction you viewed was quite subdued when compared to my initial reaction. When someone expresses a comparable reaction to my opinions, I actually try to appreciate the feedback 9be it positive or negative.) But that's just me. I most certainly do understand where he is coming from. I used to be ""pro-choice"" on elective abortion myself. I used to hold many of the views that are now being used against me. That's precisely how I know where many of the weaknesses are and how to exploit them in such a way that actually gives the readers a clear picture as to which side is more logically sound in it's reasoning and which is not. AO,... I think you and I completely agree with this, (the biological aspect of the debate). And I'm grateful for your clarifications.

Namely, as it stands, the statement would be interpreted in the way that all it takes to be a human being is for the thing to be a biological organism. I would strongly disagree with that. That may be true for mammals, where I would probably even still use the term ""horse"" for a living horse body with no brain (perhaps others interpret more meaning into the word ""horse"" but I did not get that general impression). So, I would split 1 into two parts (and please pay attention to the wording this time): 1a: That mammals (excluding human beings) are biological ""organisms"" and can be defined purely on those terms. 1b: That human beings are biological ""organisms"" but also contain the critical aspect of a mental existence.","Archangel","345269","Your 1a and 1b are so contradictory I almost don't know how to respond to them.

But your compromise is completely irrational just as your insistence that lacking mental awareness/existence is relevant in regards to your justification for abortion. Every argument you forward in your attempt to maintain what you hold as personal principles/standards of rationality just XXXX more holes in your perceived world view as inconsistent and shallow in that they are contrived and forced in order to fit with what you know to be true in reality. For example, your 1a will accept that animals are biological ""organisms"" and can be defined purely on those terms while humans must possess the caveat of mental existence. You say this purely in order to appease any guilt from knowing that we kill, butcher and consume hundreds of millions of animals per year for food. But you must know, unless I have thought much more of your intellect than I ought to have, that the lower animals are no different than human beings in that at that certain stage of their development in the womb, they too become mentally aware that they are alive, feel pain, see, and perceive the coming world they will enter; on the level of their respective species of course, but they to attain self awareness. Of course they will never perceive it as humans do, but they are all born with brains and those brains serve a very real and distinct function. As distinct a function for them as the type of animal they are, as ours do in relation to how our brain works for us.

"02-27-2009","12391",4,"Another opinion","345271","It is a matter of language, not of whether or not I support animal rights. The term ""horse"" is used generally for the species. Animal rights discussions have only come up recently in human history so our use of terminology such as ""horse"" has not had enough time to change to automatically include the notion of horse-person. This is very different from the historical discussions about people / human beings / humans which are rife with terms such as ""human rights"" that are well stabilized in our cultural heritage. That is why ""horse"" can remain a neutral term while ""a human"" is not - there is too much social baggage attached to the term ""a human"" to leave it purely defined biologically. Also, I support animal rights. I don't need to define ""horse"" as ""horse-person"" to be able to do so.","Chuz Life","345276","Question, Another Opinion...

"03-02-2009","12391",6,"Another Opinion - e-mail","None","Chuz Life, a recent poster on this forum, has proven to be a dishonest poster in violating the following rule which you have all new registrees agree to: Do not exaggerate or misrepresent other user's post. This is the first time that I have reported another forum participant and it is mainly due to the danger posed to honest debate by the distortions of such a poster. I have never reported mere flamers since their posts are generally not taken seriously except by those who already hold their views. However, a poster such as Chuz Life is one that has the appearance of being a rational and logical poster but, because of their distortions, can mislead impressionable and less experienced readers through dishonest tactics - far more dangerous to genuine debate and, I would guess, the very reason why you posted these rules to begin with. One set of evidence of Chuz Life's violation of the rule of misrepresenting another user's post is in the four times in which Chuz Life misrepresented my posts in the thread ""When does a human individuals life begin? "" of the Abortion forum. Note, typically, Chuz Life correctly quotes the opponent, but then misrepresents the opponent's views by rewording them falsely. The three violations are as follows: Violation #1: In post # 6, Chuz Life quoted my views as ""To specify my own views, I think that the bodies of unique individuals / people start at conception but that body does not become a person / individual until the beginning of mental existence, which cannot start before roughly the third trimester."" He then misrepresented my views by saying : ""The second paragraph of your post is more in line with what I was looking for. It's clear that you agree that (at least) a person's living body (a living human individual's body) begins at and by their ""conception."""". At the time, I thought that this was an honest misunderstanding, and corrected him in my post #9: ""It is not the body of an individual until an individual comes into existence. Again, individual = person by the very definition which you linked. Before that body becomes an individual / person by gaining some mental existence, it is just a body with ""nobody home"" belonging to no one except the mother since she is the only individual in existence at that point in time who has any relevance."" Violation #2: Chuz Life then took my answer from post #9 and again misrepresented it in his post #10: "" But you have already addressed the aspect of my poll that i was seeking from you, AO... You stated that a human being's living body begins at and by their conception."" I responded to this misrepresentation in my post #12 : ""The wording is very important since it carries many meanings and possible misinterpretations. Therefore, I would reword your bolded statement as ""A future but not yet existing human being's living body begins at and by their conception, but the human being themselves does not come into existence until later on in pregnancy, once mental existence is gained."" or, simply, ""A future but not yet existing human being's living body begins at and by their conception"". It is very important, in my view, to differentiate between the body before it becomes a human being (= person = individual) and the body once it gains mental existence, at which point it is a human being. I will not agree to any statements of my opinion that do not make that point clear."" Violation #3: So, Chuz Life took another tactic and, in post #21, asked ""So, to take some of the emotions out of this thread,... please tell me when you believe an individual ""horse's"" life biologically begins?"" to which I answered, in post #22: ""I would think that the term ""horse"" is generally perceived to only be a technical term denoting that species and, for most of us, is not a term that carries any horse-equivalent sense of personhood and does not necessarily automatically bring to mind the personality of a horse (except for those people who work with horses or deal with animal rights). For most of us, it is a fairly neutral term - the equivalent of the ""individual human life form"" term I used in a previous post. So, given the neutrality of that term for most people, then I would agree that the life of a horse begins at conception."" Chuz Life then misrepresented this view in his post #30: ""Like you said, (to summarize) a horse, a human, a pig, a cow... the lives of every Individual mammal (in general) begins at each their individual biological ""conceptions."""" I responded to his mirepresentation in my post #31: ""Please stop trying to reword my views. I would agree with the view of most of that except for ""a human"". As I have said over and over, one has to be VERY careful which terms one uses for humans since words about humans are very loaded with meaning that words about mammals are not (at least as far as I can tell). A human also can be interpreted as ""a person"". You might call this quibling but it is a major point of contention that you just don't seem to understand. One cannot just take a word that carries the meaning of ""person"" and then pretend that it does not carry that meaning. As long as you use a word that carries that meaning, then you will get the same range of answers from us, depending on our personal definition of ""person"". Do you or do you not understand the concept that the terms one uses are important?"" Chuz Life contested whether or not this is a misrepresentation in his post #32 and I answered him in my post #37. He had no counter-response to those arguements. Meanwhile: From post #42 to post #47, we had a dispute about definitions where ""human being"" is, by the dictionary, defined in two ways - 1) biologically as the species and 2) as person, where Chuz Life insisted on using the biological definition but I insisted that I would not agree to using the biological definition but insisted on the definition as ""person"" and would walk out of the thread if he kept to that purely biological definition. Violation #4: So, Chuz Life tried yet another tactic. By asking, in post #50: ""Do you agree with me, that a human embryo is (for the sake of this discussion) a living human organism?"" to which I responded, in post #51: ""Yes, I agree that a human embryo is a living human organism and can be defined purely as that."" At which point, in post #54, he once again misrepresented my view as saying: ""Right now I just want to get as many as possible to agree that a human being's life ""biologically speaking"" begins at and by their ""conception."" "" - which obviously meant that he thought I had agreed to that statement. After that last violation, I gave up on the debate with Chuz Life and left the thread - stating, in post #59: ""NO NO NO NO NO! I never agreed that a human being's life begins at conception. I have made clear over and over that, since a human being is defined as a person, and since I view a person as starting at mental existence, then anything preceding that is not a human being. THerefore, the human embryo may be a human organism but it is NOT a human being. This is the third time now that you have distorted my views and I am getting very tired of the dishonesty and am very quickly losing patience with you."" ------------------------ I know this is a long e-mail, and I am grateful for your patience in reading through it, but it was necessary in order to outline the specifics in how Chuz Life distorts his opponent's views. He apparently similarly distorted smiley's views since, in post #76, he writes ""I am quickly coming to the same view, as 'Another Opinion'. You are not an honest debater. Unless you stop twisting my words and using schoolchild tactics in this debate I will be gone."" However, I will not detail those distortions in this e-mail. That is up to smiley. I hope that I have sufficiently proved my case and that you recognize that Chuz Life did indeed violate forum rules. So, please, let Chuz Life know that this is not acceptable and, if he continues to repeat such tactics after any warning on your part, consider banning him from the forum.

On the sixth day after fertilization, this hollow ball burrows into the wall of the mother's uterus, or womb.

You claim that you are looking at 'when a persons ageing process begins' without addressing the extra topic of 'personhood'. However, this is not seen to be the case (or even to be possible), because by calling a zygote a 'person' you have already implicitly defined a zygote has 'personhood' - that's what a 'person' is. So when you try and claim that A_O has said that 'a human beings life starts at conception', or 'an individuals life starts at 'conception', or 'a persons life starts at conception', he disagrees with you - because in each of those cases the language you use to describe an unintelligent, unaware, unconscious collection of cells implies that 'personhood' has already been bestowed upon it, which is not the case. A_O has said* that the life of an organism with unique human DNA starts at conception. I wouldn't even go that far - I'd say that the 'existence' of an organism with unique human DNA starts at conception. Neither of us has said that the organism is an 'individual', a 'person' or a 'human being' - and when you insist on pretending that we have used those terms, we (quite understandably, IMO) call you out on 'playing semantics' - because the language you are using includes implications which we did not put there in the first place and which (we suspect) will be vital in your later arguments**. *Feel free to correct me on this, AO **Largely due to ""The abortion debate is more of a concern for ""individual"" rights and not just rights in general,.... so the debate itself needs to be more focused on the ""individual"" aspects of a person's life, rights etc. (Namely,..

I go for 'existence' because I don't think that, at that point, the organism is coherent enough to be described in an individualistic, 'it-will-be' term - regardless of the fact that it has unique DNA. For one thing, there is all the potential twin issues - monozygotic/identical twins, and most of the 'complications of twin pregnancy' section: what, I wonder, does Chuz make of chimera twins? Can I have 'the life of my left arm originally started a few seconds before the life of my right leg'?. Meh: po-tay-toe/po-tah-toe. I've said before that 'life' is a subjective term.","Another opinion","345865","Granted, at that early stage right after conception, the fertilized egg can still split into two to make identical twins with identical DNA. However, one has to be careful. If someone takes a skin scraping from you, injects that DNA into an egg (as was done with Dolly the sheep) and clones you, does that mean that your body is not an organism with unique human DNA? For me, the important thing for the beginning of a human organism is that the DNA are in place which define it. I suppose that it is not as important that the DNA is unique except in the sense that it is unique from the life forms that spawned it (sperm and egg in this case) and is complete. Since we can all be cloned, one might say that none of our DNA are guaranteed to be unique. However, I do get your point that what ""it will be"" is not individualistic at the stage immediately after conception since one zygote can split into two twins so you can't say that the zygote was one that grew into Joe or that the zygote was one that grew into Fred (Joe and Fred being twins in this case) but that zygote grew into both Joe and Fred. That is not the case with cloning since you are still you both before and after you are cloned and the cloned being was never you. Though very few zygotes actually do split, this is not actually relevant for the great majority of zygotes but it IS potentially relevant for each zygote (you never know if it will split). Ok, then .

In the early stages of development, the thalamus is not connected to the cerebral cortex by nerve cell circuits, so logically, based on evidence, there is no sentience.

So you see, the picador's sole purpose for being there is to make as unfair and lopsided a fight as possible in the matadors favor who will then come out to a sufficiently weakened animal so he can then kill it for the entertainment of the bloodthirsty masses without actually risking his own life.

Have you ever searched for any references to support your claims that they do not? This search took me all of 1 minute. The reading of these threads would take hours,... but just from the text I see in the search, You should e able to see that your allegation above is not correct. Human's, ""persons"" if you will are biological creatures complete with a biological ""beginning"" to their uniquely individual life. Your desperate desire to deny that fact is completely understandable. But, I don't see how you can expect myself or others to share in your ignorance of the mounting pile of evidence that prove against your claims. Biologically speaking, a human individual (being's) life begins at and by their conception. It's a scientific fact. Whether you or I like it or not. It is what it is . Words also often have more than one meaning. Run, for example, generally means ""to move fast on foot"". However, that is not what we mean when we say ""the water is running."" Run can also mean ""to flow (said of liquids)"". Neither of these meanings apply to the use of run in ""John runs a small bookstore."" Here run means ""to manage"". Dictionaries usually list all the unrelated meanings, giving each a separate number. (You can confirm this by looking up run in any of the on-line dictionaries listed at the bottom of this page.)","Another opinion","346693","You are missing the point and always have been. Whether or not science defines an embryo or zygote as a ""human being"" when speaking in a scientific context is irrelevant to any debate that will eventually lead to discussion of social issues. That is why I have not engaged in such a debate - because of its irrelevancy. The definition of the word(s) ""human being"" or ""a human"" or ""an individual"" that are relevant to any social context is ""a person"" - by the very dictionaries that you quote. Do you or don't you understand the concept that words are used differently in different context and you cannot just switch back and forth between the definitions at your pleasure? That is how dictionaries work - you have to stick to the relevant definition. In this case, if and only if we were going to STAY in a biological discussion (ex. launch into a discussion of the physical traits of human beings as opposed to, say, chimpanzees), then using the words human being / human / individual might stay purely biological since their definition of ""person"" is relevant to the social issues more so than biological issues. You want to use definitions illegally by switching back and forth between them - clearly either a purposely dishonest tactic or a tactic that is a result of your ignorance of how dictionaries work. To demonstrate how dictionaries and their relevancy toward the use of words work, take an example: The word ""right"" can be defined in multiple ways: From dictionary.com : 1. in accordance with what is good, proper, or just: right conduct. 2. in conformity with fact, reason, truth, or some standard or principle; correct: the right solution; the right answer. 3. correct in judgment, opinion, or action. 4. fitting or appropriate; suitable: to say the right thing at the right time. ... 11. (often initial capital letter) of or pertaining to political conservatives or their beliefs. Using your use of words, that would mean that the Right (meaning conservative politics) is right (meaning good and truthful) because they both use the same words. Perhaps this wasn't the best example because you probably believe that Right is right but hopefully you are logical enough to get my point. Same word - different definitions for different contexts. That is something that I am seriously doubting that you understand. ---------------------------- On a last note, here is part of a description on how to use dictionaries from yourdictionary.com: http://www.yourdictionary.com/library/article003.html : Note that I bolded their term ""unrelated"". As with the multiple definitions of ""human being"", ""individual"", etc. - the biological definitions are UNRELATED to the definitions of these terms as ""person"".

Up to now, you have not showed that. It is supported by the fact that the dictionary defines ""individual"" or ""human being"" SEPARATELY in a biological context (ex. member of the species homo sapiens) and SEPARATELY in a social context (by defining it as ""person""). Those who know how to use definitions know that those are SEPARATE definitions Since ""person"" is largely a philosophical term about which there is no current consensus (as also stated by the Supreme Court in Roe vs Wade), then defining ""human being"" or ""individual"" within its definition of ""person"" as being purely biological is your one choice out of inumerable choices people could make in defining ""person""hood. It holds no authority. I will openly admit that my definition of person as starting at mental existence also has no global authority. That is what happens when a term remains unclearly defined by society. We debate what it SHOULD mean. You have your opinion, I have mine. Both of our philosophical views about personhood are equally supported by science since each of us scientifically pinpoints the point in time where the development relevant to how we define pershood starts - yours at the start of the individual human body, mine at the start of the individual human mind. You don't seem to get that there is no authority that says that personhood is defined purely as biological life. That is only YOUR OPINION. Well, it is clear that we are not going to stay only in the biological domain - ex. exploring the different physical traits between humans and apes. It is clear that the topic you are heading toward is abortion - a social context where the social definition of ""individual"" or ""human being"" as PERSON will apply, NOT the purely biological one. If you were in the least bit trustable a person, then we might allow such a debate in trust that definitions would be properly modified once the context was modified. You have shown yourself to be very untrustworthy in properly representing our opinions so it is clear that you will be taking the dishonest path of distorting our words. That is why nobody has fallen for your tricks yet. It is actually amuzing to watch you continue to try... It is not only MY desire. It is the use of the terms as dictated by the dictionary.

I have to say, that's remarkably ironic given that: you've repeatedly blurred the line between 'individual' (adjective) and 'individual' (noun) and you've relied heavily on your own 'cherry-picking' of definitions. ...so I've looked things up, I've formed my own conclusion. I've even presented my opinion to you with my reasoning - something which you have as yet failed (for the most part) to do. You still seem to have an issue, unfortunately. If you think you can find a counter-argument in alternate definitions, feel free... but I doubt that you can, else you would have used it by now rather than use a watered-down version of your original 'wow, your logic is inferior' line. So much for an open mind, alas... So... you have a quote from someone saying that cells age from conception, and the fact that an egg can be fertilised externally before it is replaced in the mother. Of these two, one is 'reality' (your quote is not free from semantics either...), and one is relevant (a zygote is still dependent on the mother after it is fertilised). Neither is both. You provide arguments that are largely semantic-driven. You refuse to address counter-arguments because ""it's too semantics-based"" - how chimeraism and identical twins are 'semantics' is something that I suspect you will refuse to justify. I suggest you take your own advice regarding 'intellectual honesty'. Either deal with semantic arguments - or don't use them yourself. Either let people make up their own mind - or don't mock them when they have without an argument of your own.

I don't have the time for an MD at present, sorry - but why the want, though, to make this 'official'? Very odd timing, given that you've just accused me of 'playing semantics'. Could it be that, when faced with a 'reality' you do not like (chimera organisms and identical twins), you revert to old habits? It's especially odd given this word, and what you've tried to imply it means. It's largely used by psychologists (see 'Jungian Psychology') - the 'biological' terminology refers, not to as DNA DNA ' organizer ', but to cell-cell interaction (amongst other things). You may want to read this for more info - ' In the embryonic development of a zygote, gradients of mRNAs and proteins, deposited in the egg by the mother as she formed it, give rise to cells of diverse fates despite their identical genomes. . None of this is particularly relevant, however - it's just satisfying intellectual curiosity. To get to the relevant stuff - you've mixed your definitions. 'Individuation' refers to ' regional differentiation along a primary embryonic axis ' - that is to say; the fact that cells in an embryo - all with identical DNA - end up as different types of cells depending on where they are within the embryo. It's cells becoming individualised -not the organism itself. Jung (and others) talk about 'individualisation' of personalities, but I really hope you're not going to try and play that off as anything like relevant - as it isn't linked to embryos and it isn't 'biological' individuality , so you would fail on both counts (I suppose you could argue than anything with social individuality is biologically an individual, but that's kinda tenuous (Siamese twins?) - and besides, social individuality cannot develop without a brain, so you would be doomed on that one). Note also that 'individualization' takes place in the embryo. The fertilised zygote does not begin individualization until it first divides and becomes an embryo - you can see that this is by necessity, because until the organism is composed of more than one cell, it cannot (by definition) be composed of different types of cells. As such, 'individualisation' (the process, you claim, by which individuals become as such), only even begins at the embryonic stage, not at conception. In order for an abortion to be 'killing', it must be first proven that a foetus is an individual - both biologically and (arguably) socially. Otherwise abortion kills nothing more than a collection of cells - just as the spermicide in a condom kills millions of cells.","Chuz Life","346749","If you don't have the time, who cares ""why the want."" A good reason would help you ""make the time?"" or what? Yeah,... that must be it. HUH,.. and if not conception,... when did that begin again? No, iangb... I didn't mix anything. The subject of this thread is ""when does a human individual's life biologically begin ."" This definition is but one of many that describe in the most intricate details ""how"" that life is began. With a single cell division that (through individuation) forms, grows, develops and further matures the new child until one day he or she reaches a point,... after which even you can't deny them their rights anymore. The key word in all of it is ""begin."" Again,... the key word is ""begin."" The new individual's unigue DNA is created when? The aging process ""begins"" when? Clearly, individualation begins when cell division does. But if conception had not taken place, there would be no cell division of the new individual's DNA. Would there. Arguably? If it's arguable, it's hardly an absolute. Consider the current legal definition for a ""person."" That's relevant, isn't it?

Now, tell us, does this attitude of yours stem from a fear of women or from a hatred of them? I, on the other hand, have enough confidence in each woman that I will support whatever choice she makes.","Chuz Life","348279","Elective abortion is not a right. Not even the supreme court in Roe v. Wade declared it so. But I won't hold my breath waiting for you to retract this claim. Actually, I think that medical doctors are the ones best equipped to make those decisions. To the extent that any parent is a slave to their child (as I am a slave to my own) it is the consequence of creating that child in the first place. You don't want the responsibility of caring for a child? Don't create one. I love women,.. and I believe their rights (life liberty and due process) begin at their biological conceptions. Rights that you consistantly deny,... yet you claim that it is I who hates women? You even deny them their personhood. Yeah,.. including the choice to kill her child or to pay someone else to kill it... We know. Come back when you understand the difference between an egg and a chicken, an acorn and an oak tree, a fetus and a child (and not definition #4).[/QUOTE]","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","07:47 PM","abortion-debates","246"

An embryo is less developed than a baby, but a baby is also less developed than an adult. Should the baby have less life than the adult because it has not developed entirely? No. And a fetus should have no less life than a baby for the same reason.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","08:22 PM","abortion-debates","247"

All that I am saying is that yours is a subjective opinion on a metaphysical issue, and it is no more or no less valid than every other subjective opinion on the same metaphysical issue. Sorry, but last time I checked, your subjective opinion was not written on a tablet of stone to the exclusion of all others. In fact, I would give the subjective opinion of any particular pregnant woman far more credence than yours. She's there; you're not.
