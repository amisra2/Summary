As I said, the dictionary is what it is...","ShadowPikachu","247530","You are denying the definition of homo sapiens, which you said yourself was the definition of human. Now that a definition is there that you disagree with, suddenly now the dictionary is ""flawed"" or whatever you are trying to say, when before you were chanting on and on about how people had to use the definition of the dictionary.

Even you should be able to understand that concept. If you feel that the dictionary.com source definition is the correct one then by all means use that one but tell me what classification a 1yr old would fall under.","why-pro-life","10:29 AM","abortion-debates","92"

Steeeeve has finally realised that the dictionary is limited and is not the be-all end-all for this debate, and it is really your views on a definition that matter, not a definition found in a dictionary. That's what we were trying to show you, but you were so stubborn it took a definition that contradicted your views to make you realize it.","why-pro-life","01:04 PM","abortion-debates","93"

Seems odd that you try to justify abortion by claiming a different species. I haven't changed anything I stated other than the ""homo sapiens"" comment I made earlier..odd fellow you are.","why-pro-life","01:08 PM","abortion-debates","94"
"01-17-2007","9391",7,"Steeeeve","247520","and no one claimed otherwise. That is not the question. Philosophy doesn't define terms. The fact that the fetus is a human is rather irrelevant but don't go around saying ""it isn't a human therefore ok"" because 1) it in fact is a human and 2) this doesn't prove or disprove anything. I feel it is very important as I don't say which characteristics are important to give it moral value I just say being a human gives you moral value in and of its self. I'll consider starting a new thread since you feel it is irrelevant to this one (although I disagree with this)","Sigma","247561","Then you really cannot claim the dictionary tells us who is or is not human, because the dictionary does not determine ones species. If you wish to claim the dictionary can tell us the criteria for being human then you would have to tell me on what basis you contend that dependence upon language and the creation and utilization of complex tools does not imply a mental existence. We define terms for use in philosophy. And that is indeed the question since it is assumed that those who qualify as a 'person' or 'human being' is worthy of moral consideration. But is is philosophically human? What does it mean to be human? That is a question the dictionary cannot answer. Hell, the dictionary cannot even tell us whether it is scientifically human. Your original statement was that mental existence made your cat human. Mental existence may give your cat moral value, but it cannot make it human. However, we are only discussing the moral value in humans . Your point here is off-topic. I cannot see any point in this one.","why-pro-life","02:18 PM","abortion-debates","95"

There ARE no contradictions. The one you quoted is just more detailed in providing a criteria, while the others are more vague. The only contradiction here is Steeeeve now trying to deny a definition, when before he treated them like his Bible.","why-pro-life","03:17 PM","abortion-debates","97"

You can have mental existence without having a language or ability to utilize complex tools. I claim that the dictionary tells us what we call certain things (atleast for nouns). Take the noun ""cheese"" for example. The definition does tell us how it has to be made but it does say qualify what ""cheese"" is and the certain things that fall under the definition of ""cheese"". Blue cheese is a cheese. What? You develop a different language for philosophy? Sounds like a way to justify something as opposed to make a real argument. I've never heard of creating words for use in philosophy....but whatever works for you I suppose, just let me know when you are using this ""language"" as opposed to English. What a dumb idea. Who thinks that way and who cares? the question is about moral value not how we define ""human"" in a new language called ""Philosophical English"". No, that is not what my statement was. My statement was ""my cat has mental existence""...If I implied my cat is human then I misspoke. My question was regards to what makes a ""human"" (in the English meaning of the word) significant. If ""mental existence"" is the test then species shouldn't matter....right?","why-pro-life","04:27 PM","abortion-debates","98"

Like I stated before, you seem to want to procedure to make cheese when the dictionary just defines what cheese is. So you don't want to call a fetus or embryo a human (for whatever reason) so what do you propose the species is of an embryo or fetus? Furthermore, what is a human?..enlighten me with your definition.","why-pro-life","04:31 PM","abortion-debates","99"

It is an authority on nothing but how people generally use words. As you yourself admit, the dictionary definitions do not necessarily have any scientific validity. Trying to claim something about the fetus' status within a species because of the dictionary is laughable. That is not the purpose of the dictionary. You want to say the fetus is human, but you do not come up with any criteria to objectively determine if this is so. The question is, though, whether one can use language, have an ability to utilize complex tools without a mental existence. No, it doesn't. It doesn't tell us what we call things. It tells us what those things are generally called, but it has no authority over what we call things. Apples and oranges, really. Let's take something living, like a dog. Dictionary says: Canis familiaris , which is (probably) the domesticated decendent of a wolf. How do we determine if something is decended from a wolf, Steve? Only you, Steve, would think that a different defintion would suddenly make a new language. We use different definitions for even common words than what any dictionary might put out to satisfy shadings of meaning that may be necessary for a certain discussion. It is assumed that we morally value those that we philosophically consider a 'person' or 'human being'. The question is whether the fetus would fall under these umbrellas. lol. Your statement was: My cat mentally lives...she must be a human . In regards to your question: The reason that human is significant in this discussion is that we are determing the moral value of something human. If you want to know why something human is morally more significant than animals (if they are), then start another thread.","why-pro-life","07:18 PM","abortion-debates","100"

Or: I'm looking at why something is called cheese to determine if something is cheese. I need objective criteria, Steve. I don't believe I ever said anything even similar to this. I'm just trying to find what objective criteria you are using to determine that the fetus is 'a human' in the noun sense of the word, since you don't want to accept the dictionary criteria. Oh, so now personal definitions are valid to you?","why-pro-life","07:24 PM","abortion-debates","101"

No has a certian level of development as the point where other definitions of homo sapiens suggest the modern human or ""the only surviving hominid"". The procedures for classifying are not in the dictionary..thus a biology book is what you need. Why is it called cheese? Because it is ""a solid food prepared from the pressed curd of milk "". Why is a fetus a human because ""it belongs to the species homo sapiens"". You have this idea of a new language for philosophy and I simply reject that. In the cheese example you would take ""milk"" and find a definition on that and then dig down some more until it makes no sense. Whatever happened to being reasonable? Irrelevant to what we are talking about. I reject the idea that criteria is needed in a definition (atleast to what we are referring to). no...but it would be interesting to see what you new language looks like.","why-pro-life","08:59 PM","abortion-debates","104"
"01-17-2007","9391",7,"Shooterandproud","247627","But milk is not a cheese. Just because it has the chance to become cheese, does not make milk cheese. Same goes with an embryo and a human.","Steeeeve","247636","yet an embryo is a human So in this case an aging cheese is still a cheese even if not aged enough to eat (for some cheeses).","why-pro-life","09:01 PM","abortion-debates","105"
