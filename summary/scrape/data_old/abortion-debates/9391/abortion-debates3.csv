Otherwise, by your definition, it is a murder everytime a male masturbates as sperm are made of living human cells. Boy, my fiance sure was a murderer before he met me .

You seem to refuse the idea that ""human"" as a noun is used to describe a human being meaning the entity as a whole and not the individual cells that make it up. I am sorry you don't understand this but the word means what it means. I find it odd that you even care what you call a fetus anyway. Your sperm is a human now?

"01-10-2007","9391",3,"None","None","None","Another opinion","246618","Steeeeve, dislexia, Shooterandproud, and ShadowPikachu : The four of you seem to be engaged in yet another unresolveable battle of semantics - in this case about the definition of the term ""a human"". The trouble is that there are really TWO definitions of the term ""a human"" - the official definition and the common-use definition. One can legitimately argue, as Steeeeve does, that the official definition of a human as a ""member of the species homo sapien"" would only require a complete set of human DNA and the beginning of the growth process - so a zygote would then qualify under the official definition. However, nearly all uses of the term ""a human"" in common discussion are on topics other than abortion, where ""a human"" is discusses as a born human and, at the very least, the assumption is made that the being in question possesses a mental existence. At least I assume that when I hear the term ""a human"" and I know that this is a very common assumption - as demonstrated by the frequent disputes about the use of this term. Therefore, the term ""a human"" automatically generates a certain amount of sympathy because of these unofficial conotations of mental existence that are added to the definition. Steeeeve: I know you might feel justified in using the term ""a human"" and trying to force pro-choice people to admit to discriminating against humans since you stand firm on the official definition. However, you have to admit that it is somewhat disingenuous of you to ignore the fact that this term has many unofficial conotations attached to it that do not apply to a zygote or embryo - mental existence being one of them. Since words, after all, are used for COMMUNICATION, the use of the word ""a human"" in this way is a purposeful distortion of the message. Can't you try to find some term that you can all agree on? Shooterandproud and ShadowPikachu: Since the official definition of ""a human"" probably does include a zygote, Steeeeve is technically right, but I fully sympathize with you that the term ""a human"" is loaded with meanings that are attached to it due to its common use. Since there exists this difference between common use and official definition, wouldn't it be better for you as well to find some term that you and Steeeeve (and other pro-life proponents) could agree on?","why-pro-life","10:28 AM","abortion-debates","35"

When I hear human I think of a scientific term for a certain king of being (unless otherwise stated). I'd venture a guess that prior to the abortion debate ""human"" could be applied to an unborn and no one thought anything of it. well, for communication to work you have to use the same meaning for words. I choose to use the dictionary as that is our English language and human is what it is and we shouldn't change the definition just to make us feel better about abortion...that's just stupid. I disagree that mental existence applies to the term human there is nothing to support that it did. I suppose it could mean ""has mental existence"" though just like the word ""baby"" can mean newborn or a fetus. As for saying that you ""discriminate"" against humans...this is just a fact pro-choice folks are going to have to admit. I don't say this is a bad thing as I too support some form of ""discrimination"" based on certain criteria. What I don't discriminate on is develop and size and pro-choice has to. A point in development will always be arbitrary and has no better reasoning than any other point someone might say which I feel is a dangerous precedent.","why-pro-life","11:25 AM","abortion-debates","36"

So, by the definition you seem to be going by, according to your responses, of a foetus being made of living human cells and thus it is a human, I'm pointing out that all of my organs are made of living human cells, so they should be considered human according to what you seem to be expressing. I know a sperm is not one, but again, going with what you are pushing, it would have to be included as one. (By the way, at what point of development do you consider it a human if you don't consider sperm a human by your standards? Just trying to find out how you stand.) Oh, and I'm not going to bother to continue arguing semantics, as another_opinion said, it's a waste of time to argue over dictionary definitions as there are ""official"" (also changeable) definitions and every-day definitions. It is the everyday that really matters when addressing people. I think that in the years to come, that ""official"" definition that you seem to hold so dear (which is in fact quite vague) will become much better defined. Here's an essay I found relating to that definition: http://home.att.net/~star_child/essay7.html I found it quite fascinating, and if things continue as they are with artificial intelligence, that definition might change sooner than you like. I'm not supplying it as any sort of ""proof"" or anything, but it really interested me.","why-pro-life","01:42 PM","abortion-debates","38"
"01-10-2007","9391",3,"Another opinion","246642","When you say a sentence ""I discriminate against certain humans"" that means one thing to you and another thing to many other people - there is miscommunication going on and I think you know this. To me, hearing that someone ""discriminates against certain humans"" automatically conjures up images of race and sex discrimination since I automatically equate ""a human"" with ""a person"" and I don't like the thought of discriminating unjustly against people because I have empathy and sympathy with people and since I wouldn't want to be discriminated against either. However, I have little problem ""discriminating"" against human life forms with no mental existence (as are zygotes and embryos) just as you have no problem ""discriminating"" against human life in the form of unfertilized eggs. I very much hesitate in saying that ""I discriminate against certain humans"" since some (who only think of the official definition) will read it one way but others read it as ""I discriminate against certain people"" and I don't want that message to be carried. Why not use a term that causes no confusion? ------- Just to add to the confusion about the noun ""human"", several sources quote two definitions for human: human 1. A member of the genus Homo and especially of the species H. sapiens. 2. A person: the extraordinary humans who explored Antarctica. These include: http://www.answers.com/topic/human-1 , http://www.bartleby.com/61/78/H0317800.html (from the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language), etc. Most on-line dictionaries defined human (noun) as human being, which doesn't help. Anyway, even the dictionaries aren't sticking to one definition so how can you expect this word to carry a fixed meaning in these discussions.","ShadowPikachu","246652","Yes, he does know the definition is different to many people than the ""official"" definition, and he and other anti-abortionists use it quite deliberately and insidiously.","why-pro-life","01:44 PM","abortion-debates","39"
"01-10-2007","9391",3,"Another opinion","246642","I can assure you that there are very many people who do not view a zygote or early embryo as ""a human"" unless you educate them on the official definition. I was surprised when I first recently read that official definition of ""a human"" since I always had equated the term ""a human"" with ""a person"". I am obviously far from being alone in this view. Even if people were all informed of the official definition of ""a human"", it would be very difficult to just drop the connotations that go along with the term ""a human"" - we are not robots that can automatically change definitions. If your purpose is communication and not distortion then use a term that we can all agree on that carries no unofficial unrelated emotional baggage. When you say a sentence ""I discriminate against certain humans"" that means one thing to you and another thing to many other people - there is miscommunication going on and I think you know this.

We have a dictionary and those that choose to use it will have the upper hand in a debate. Oddly enough, the word ""person"" also doesn't have to presuppose a mental existence. Person is often used (and thus is the first definition) as an informal way to say human being. Yet an unfertilized egg is not a human life by anyones definition. Either way, I fully admit that I discriminate anyway...why people get offended by that is beyond me Well many words have many meanings but dictionaries are listed in most common usage downward meaning number 1 is the most common meaning of the word. There should also be no question to what I mean by the word ""human"" as we have discussed it in great length.

Once again paying attention to word tense means a lot. The noun human can refer to a fetus (much like baby can too) but not to an organ. No a sperm doesn't meet my definition. Furthermore, I don't use development a standard classifying what is or isn't human. I don't hold on to the definition other than to use it in a proper fashion. Words are always changing meaning (take the word ""gay"" for example) and I will use the most current form of the word. It makes no difference to me whether you call a fetus a goat or a bus or a human but at the very least make sure the word you are using is the proper sense of the word.","why-pro-life","01:52 PM","abortion-debates","42"

I may know which definition you have in mind but readers of a thread with our discussion might not, so I will not say ""I discriminate against certain humans"" without it being clear what is meant. With multiple possible definitions, it is not clear what is meant. Shouldn't it be obvious that, in communication, it is not only important what a person meant to say but it is important how they said it so that it would be properly understood. Saying that a person discriminates against humans is insufficient and confusing if you are not clear which of the two definitions you are using. By the way, the term ""person"" also has multiple meanings (again from the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language via answers.com ): person (noun) 1. A living human. Often used in combination: chairperson; spokesperson; salesperson. 2. An individual of specified character: a person of importance. 3. The composite of characteristics that make up an individual personality; the self. ... and a few others that are less relevant... Anyway, the second and third definitions clearly imply mental existence. The first definition is unclear but, given the examples that they give, they seem to imply a mental existence as well. Bottom line, communication, to be effective, needs to be CLEAR and MUTUALLY understood (in this case by not only debaters but potential readers).","why-pro-life","02:00 PM","abortion-debates","44"

The ability to understand what a word means in context is something learned (hopefully). If I say ""the definition of the word desk is..."" I don't mean the sharpness of the word desk. Likewise when I say ""the fetus is a human"" you can gather that 1) I an using it as a noun and 2) the context of the word in order to choose the appropriate definition. It should be noted that human never has ""mental existence"" in the definition. Person goes the same way. To say ""you are a person"" you take the noun and view the context. The context rules out definitions 2 and 3 and thus we are left with 1 (the main entry) as the definition for that word. I know this conversation sounds petty but it is rather frustrating that people are manipulating words to support a cause and then claiming to not understand a basic language structure. If you want to say the fetus isn't worthy of life then so be it but don't start justifying this claim but changing the definitions of words such as ""person"" and ""human""...that is just stupid","why-pro-life","03:32 PM","abortion-debates","45"
