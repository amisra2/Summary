"01-21-2007","9391",9,"gman","247912","1. If I'm not mistaken, this is your thread. Was the subject tapeworms? 2. I'm not surprised that you don't follow the concept of trust a child automatically, by instinct, places in it's mom. You are assuming what an embryo can or can not feel. Due to it's inability to communicate. Are you stating that any being that can not communicate is expendable? I would bet that you would go to extremes to protect a baby seal about to get it's head bashed in by an eskimo hunter to sell it's coat. Regardless of it's inability to say I want to live. By the way, I support hunting. But I do not take killing lightly. 3. The subject of my topic is children. You are throwing others in as your argument is weak.","Shooterandproud","247997","Irrelevant. That was an analogy, oh logical one. I have the instinct to kill anyone that I don't like. Its a human trait that we've learned to control. Does that mean I should kill you because its my instict? I think humans have learned by now that instinct is not always the wisest thing to follow. What does communication have anything remotely to do with sentience? It is not self aware, it has no consciousness, and it has no intelligence. It is not sentient deserving of rights. Where in there is anything about communication? A baby seal has self awareness, consciousness, and intelligence. Nope, not expendable. It is a valued life form, that does deserve rights. I am a hunter too, but animals have feelings. That is why I do not take killing lightly. However, we, as humans, were designed to hunt and kill animals for food. I think hunting is wrong if you are not going to eat the animal, but if you are, then it is OK. Just like foxes hunt rabbits, or snakes hunt mice. We are no different. However, animals have self awareness, consciousness, and... oh brother, do I have to go over this every time? Do you get the point? What do you mean by throwing ""others"" in? We are not talking about children here, as children are fairly irrelevant to the abortion issue. However, if you are talking about embryos then why didn't you say so?","why-pro-life","02:51 PM","abortion-debates","122"
"01-21-2007","9391",9,"Shooterandproud","247995","Ya know, you always refer to ""biology"" and such and say were wrong because of it. Care to show me where biology says that? Care to show me how specifically an embryo differs from a sperm? I can show you many ways why an embryo is not a human, yet you only cite DNA and growth and say i'm discriminating. Sperm have DNA and can grow, so why is ejaculation not genocide? You really need to rethink your logic, that is, if you have any logic.","Steeeeve","248004","Of course you can show how an embryo differs from a human...you made up a definition for human! I think I'll make up a definition for human and make sure you are not included and that would make about as much sense. And then of course you resort to insulting my logic...I feel like we are having a debate from a recent southpark episode (for those that don't watch southpark it was a show about in the future where religion doesn't exist and they just argue about logic the whole time). Anyway, since you haven't taken a biology class and are not familiar with the way things are classified I will direct you this page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_classification While probably not 100% accurate it still gives you a somewhat good idea about how classification works. Furthermore, the only thing I said biology proves you wrong on is that a sperm is classified living organism as opposed to a part of. I also like how I'm the only one with a definition for a human that has any kind of backing. Everyone elses ""mental existence"" theory 1) has no backing for defintion and 2) is arbitrary in and of itself So someone enlighten the rest of us on the proper usage of the word ""human""...since there is obviously some mysterious language that I am not aware of that neatly defines all these terms. Please direct me to a source for this new language as well.","why-pro-life","03:44 PM","abortion-debates","123"

What if the embryo is female...does that still make one sexist? And people wonder why I place suspicion on those that are still in grade school and have not seen real life. Good to know that we can kill a fetus but not a baby seal....so these baby seals deserve all the rights as you do? If not then what rights? What criteria is there for those rights?","why-pro-life","03:47 PM","abortion-debates","124"

Here, let me post it again, so everybody can laugh. Complications of Termination Psychological effects: a small number of women experience regret or adverse psychological effects. Few experience any long-term, adverse psychological effects. Early distress is common and usually a continuation of symptons present before the abortion. However, long-lasting, negative effects on both mothers and their children are reported where abortion has been denied.

There are millions reasons for choosing to have an abortion and if a woman doesn't want to go through with a pregnancy, that is her decision as it's her body and her life that would be changing, and if she is unwilling to change her life she would hardly be an ideal person to become a fantastic mother. I wouldn't ever say abortion is a good thing, and in an ideal world it wouldn't be necessary, but people make mistakes and birth control is not 100% effective so it's always going to be needed.","why-pro-life","01:44 PM","abortion-debates","134"
