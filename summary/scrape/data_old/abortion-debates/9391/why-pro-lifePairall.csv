Were a dictionary definition used, it would be difficult to deny the dead equal protection based on your reasoning. The dictionary definition also does not make a distinction based on the number of chromosomes. A sperm is human in the same way the fetus is human: they both contain human DNA. However, this is all moot. The dictionary definition has no authority over how we use words. It simply records how words are generally used. In a philosophical debate such as this, shadings of meaning are used constantly that you will not find in any dictionary. It is up to the participants to agree to use a word in a certain way to avoid confusion between them. A philosophical argument is to argue concepts , not semantics. Non-human animals are usually not considered to posess consciousness as we know it.
