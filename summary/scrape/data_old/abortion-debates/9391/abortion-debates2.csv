"01-07-2007","9391",2,"jyoshu","246307","You'd definitely have at least one ""anti-choicer"" in the world if all men got pregnent too: my wife. She's had pregnancies and she's a lot more pro-life than most men you'll ever meet, including me. I also kindly ask that you please stick to the standard terms for people with this issue: 'pro-life' and 'pro-choice'. Rather than things like ""anti-choice"" or ""anti-life."" Theres really no need for it--it only serves to aggravate people when you do that. (If I call you ""anti-life"" instead of ""pro-choice"", you probably wouldn't like that, I suspect!) And surely you aren't just out to aggravate people.","Shooterandproud","246327","First of all, we didn't say that there would be no pro-lifers, we'd just say that there wouldn't be many. Kind of like the Nazis. Second, it would not be accurate to call us ""anti-life"" because we are not advocating the abortion of every fetus. However, it would be accurate to call you ""anti-choice"" because you do advocate force of the carrying out of unplanned pregnancies.","why-pro-life","07:33 PM","abortion-debates","16"
"01-07-2007","9391",2,"jyoshu","246324","Nope, sorry, you are indeed anti-life, because you are for killing the unborn, which is human life. You see? It is just as accurate to call you anti-life as it is for you to call pro-lifers anti-choice. The best way to approach it, IMO, is to use terms that don't intentionally make the other side out to look bad --it is also accurate to say that prolifers are pro-life, because they are against killing human life. Just as it is also accurate to call an anti-lifer ""pro-choice""-- they are indeed for freedom of choice to destroy human life. I believe constructive dialogue is best rather than intentionally using terms you know will put people off. Don't you agree? And really, there's no need to so easily getr defensive every time someone disagrees with you on something here. There's nothing wrong with saying ""ok, I'll consider that."" No one said you had to stop calling people anti-choice. But know that if you use terms like that, you're more likely to have the same tactics used against you and someone may call you an 'anti-lifer' --they'd be completely justified in doing so. So I merely suggest not using a tactic at all and use constructive terminolgy that you know won't aggravate others. Can't you agree that's the better way?","Shooterandproud","246330","Actually, we are not. We wouldn't care if a woman aborted or not, its her choice. We don't want the embryo to be aborted, however the anti-choicers do want her to carry through with an unplanned pregnancy. My kidney is human life. Please be more descriptive. Nope, sorry. You have the disadvantage here. I agree, however anti-choice is a 100% accurate way to describe pro-lifers, but anti-life is an inaccurate way to describe pro-choicers. Actually, thats not always so. Whether the embryo is an intelligent life form is still under debate, but I guess you can call them pro-life since scientifically it is made of organic material. Not so. Well, sort of. My fingernail is human life, and i've seen pro-lifers cut their fingernails, so i really don't think thats accurate. Actually, it would be accurate to call an anti-lifer ""pro-abortion"", because an anti-lifer would advocate the abortion of every embryo. Pro-lifers destroy human life all of the time, they cut their nails, donate blood, trim their hair, however if an embryo is an intelligent life is still under debate, therefore it would be inaccurate to call any pro-choicer a ""murderer"" etc. However, what is not under dispute is that pro-choicers advocate choice and civil rights for women, even pro-lifers agree with that part, therefore we are surely pro-choice. However, ""anti-choice"" actually can describe you more accurately that ""pro-life"", because ""pro-life"" is still under dispute, but ""anti-choice"" is a known fact, inflammatory connotations aside. I do, however don't get that mixed up with trying to credit non-factual inflammatory remarks with factual ones. Its not the fact that people disagree that sometimes can bother me, it is their ignorance to science or facts, and blindness by religion that can sometimes hit a nerve. Keep in mind that we have all considered out positions very carefully. I agree that we shouldn't be using those terms, but ""anti-lifer"" is just an inaccurate description, that carries no weight, unlike ""anti-choicer"". Agreed, we're just saying that ""anti-life"" makes no sense and is a completely false statement.","why-pro-life","08:03 PM","abortion-debates","17"

I'm for allowing women to have the option of terminating the development of a foetus, which is not a living human (once again, I support actually aborting a developed baby if the woman's life or health is at risk) So, it is not accurate to call me prolife. The way I see it, the medical requirement for death is when there is no brain activity. Therefore, the medical requirement for life would be when there IS brain activity (around the third trimester or so if I recall correctly). Although there is no OFFICIAL definition made yet, I have total faith that it will be defined in the next decade or so just like that. It is really the only logical definition (otherwise we might say a person is not dead until all of the cells in their body have died/decayed). However, your movement IS trying to take away that choice from the woman to have an abortion, hence anti-choice being accurate. Oh, and, even if your definition was correct (which I have proven it is not), it would still be inaccurate, as we are not making people have abortions, merely making sure they have a choice.","why-pro-life","12:06 AM","abortion-debates","18"

You can't have one without the other. Better to swallow that and go on, rather than trying to convince yourself otherwise. If you really believe in your cause, they you shouldn't be taking a statement like ""anti-lifer"" in a negative way to begin with. Brain activity as defined how? Certainly there is brain activity much earlier than the the 3rd trimester in terms of involuntary control of things like heart rate and synapses firing. My preferred way to think of it is viability outside the womb. At what point are premature babies viable? To me that's when the line should be drawn; What you call a fetus is in fact a premature baby. Just as your movement is for destroying unborn life in some situations. Still fits--it's IS 'anti-life.' Well you're certainly making it to where a lot of unborn babies will have to die rather than even factoring their viability and potential life ahead into the equation..","why-pro-life","09:14 AM","abortion-debates","19"

I would not care if you called me ""partially anti-life"". That would not bother me as it would be easy for me to say exactly how I am that (if the woman's life or health is in jeopardy). I'd have no problem with that, so go ahead, I would accept that use. That means, however, by your argument you are accepting the use of the term anti-choice (to describe those who want to ban abortions) And no, in the other cases it has nothing to do with unborn babies, it has to do with undeveloped foetuses that are not even alive or aware yet (mentally aware - as I know you will be nitpicky about awareness, and yes, it can be determined by brain activity). And as to your brain activity part, well, viability outside the womb usually includes brain activity, so it seems like YOUR definition would be a later term than mine.","why-pro-life","10:38 AM","abortion-debates","20"
"01-08-2007","9391",2,"Shooterandproud","245426","I've been thinking of the reasons people go pro-choice or pro-life, and to me it seems that the pro-choice stance has overwhelming proof on their side. Lets take a look: Reasons for Pro-life: 1)Protecting the ""innocent"" baby or embryo or whatever 2)Earining brownie points in heavan I can't think of anymore, please post and i'll add to the list. Reasons for pro-choice: 1)This is a woman's body, not yours, not mine, and certainly not the governments. 2)An embryo can not make a decision, but a mother knows her circumstances best, therefore she should choose for the both. 3)An Embryo is not a sentient life form, and does not posses self awareness or consciousness, or to quote Another Opinion: ""Mentally exist"". 4)The only thing an embryo and humans have in common is a strand of DNA. 5)Abortion has some positive effects on society, as in the book Freakonomics by um... forgot the guy, Steve something, the author cites that the legalization of abortions caused a rapid decrease in crime, which makes sense if you think about it. Unwanted children are 10X more likely to become criminals. 6)And embryo does not have a 100% possiblilty of growing into a human being. 20% of pregnancies end in a miscarrige. 7)Birth control is not 100% effective. As I have said before, my friend's mom had her sister on the pill. Even though this makes up a small percentage of abortion, it still makes up some percentage, which is reason enough. 8)Being forced to carry through and unwanted pregnancy can have devastating effects on a women, namely financially and emotionally.","Bell","246402","Here is another perspective for the prolife argument, from feministsforlife.org: ""Feminists for Life of America recognizes that abortion is a reflection that our society has failed to meet the needs of women."" Also, ""[We] believe no woman should be forced to choose between pursuing her education and career plans and ...her child"". I absolutely agree with these tenants, however I find it mildly ironic that a feminist organization wants to tell me what to do with my uterus. Plus, 'should be' reasoning isn't realistic.","why-pro-life","01:24 PM","abortion-debates","21"
