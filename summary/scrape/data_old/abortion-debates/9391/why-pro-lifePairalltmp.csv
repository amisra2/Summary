The dictionary definition also does not make a distinction based on the number of chromosomes. A sperm is human in the same way the fetus is human: they both contain human DNA. However, this is all moot. The dictionary definition has no authority over how we use words. It simply records how words are generally used. In a philosophical debate such as this, shadings of meaning are used constantly that you will not find in any dictionary.

Living language, Steve","Steeeeve","247769","""One has a certian level of development as the point the other definitions of homo sapiens suggest the modern human or ""the only surviving hominid"". So two different ideas. The dictionary tells us proper usage of words....such as cheese. The word human can be used to describe the fetus. To say the word human could not describe a fetus is inaccurate. Words don't make something what it is...it is what it is...words just describe. I can't believe you are really debating how language works...I thought they taught this stuff. DNA...consult a biology book for how they classify species. I actually an unwilling to accept one criteria as it conflicts with many others and the basic understanding of biology. You seem unwilling to accept everything but your own personal English language. Can you explain how you classify things in a species? It has to do with proper usage of words and playing around with them to justify abortion. This started by someone calling the fetus ""not human"". If I called you ""not a human"" and you said I was wrong would you call that debate about ""semantics""? Certainaly not. Seems you are just trying be annoying about the whole thing. I never claimed it to be an authority over anything other than defining word usage. The dictionary doesn't make something what it is. When did you get this idea. [/QUOTE]Then use it correctly. The fetus is a human...of the species homo sapien....my cat is black...my desk is made out of maple. I mean really, this shouldn't have been such a long conversation. Just don't justify abortion by saying the fetus is not a human...that is inaccurate.
