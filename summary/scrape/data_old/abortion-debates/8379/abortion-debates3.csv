"06-29-2006","8379",3,"Prototype","None","Pro-abortionists do not use the term fetus to be scientifically accurate. It's as clear as crystal that they use it to soothe their own consciences and to avoid the truth. Obviously the meaning has been altered in the abortion debate because if a pro-abortionist admited that the thing being aborted was a baby, they would have to admit that murder was being commited. That's why there are these squabbles over whether a fetus is a person or not. Pro-abortionists force themselves into this shell of belief to shield themselves from the truth that a baby is a person with the right to live. If they came out of there, they'd be left with no alternative to admitting that an un-born baby was just as worthy to live as any other human being. That's all the pro-abortionists have to fall back on really, and it's ridiculous how they'll go on about it.","GodIsDead","219958","you miss the point, if it soothes their conscience it dose so for legitimant reasons. the word fetus connotes a more acurate image. why? i am willing to accsept that a fetus is a form of a baby - but i am still pro-choice also, nobody is pro-abortion, its pro-choice, im sure you know that, but you proably think thats just another attempt to soothe the conscience - your wrong, they connote distinctly differant ideas. If the government wanted to implement a law requiering all women to have children, it wouldent be accurate to say that people who were pro-choice were anti-children. even if one accsepts that a baby is a living person with a right to live - its still a person without the ablity to exersize that right - that is, it is not phisicaly capeable of sustaining its own life. Dose the right to life garentee you help if cant keep alive on your own? A friend of mine's dad died reasently because he couldent afford the treatment he needed for the kind of cancer that he had - did the doctors who dident treat him violate his right to life?","rape-abortion","04:58 PM","abortion-debates","31"

It's only when this abortion thing came on that they changed their wording to make sure it didn't remind them of the true facts. Pro-choice, Pro-abortion, I've never seen anything that makes the choice better than than the abortion. Besides, you should really consider your position. If you are, in fact, pro-choice, and at the same time believe that a fetus is a baby, then how does your moral code work? A baby is being murdered, if I understand you're statement correctly, but you will allow that to happen in case somebody wants to do it? That doesn't seem very sound to me. It's my experience that a person labels themselves pro-choice because the connotations are consideration, allowance for other's freedoms and the respect of social liberties. There are only two sides to the abortion issue, and the pro-choicers know that. They use the term as a shield, not as a definition of sides. You see, those with a moral code who wish to compromise for abortion will not call themselves pro-abortionists because the name says pretty blatantly that they are in favor of allowing babies to be killed (regardless of whether they think a fetus is a baby or not) and they know that looks bad to other people. That's one of the reasons the media almost never uses the term pro-abortionist. So what if he/she can't exercise their right to live? I've never seen or heard of a baby who was just born sueing their parents because they decided to leave him on the sidewalk in the slums since they didn't want to take care of him. A 3 yr. old can't exercise the right to live anymore than a 2 yr. old, a 1 yr. old or a six week old. You couldn't have exercised you're right to live when you were 5 or 6 either. You still needed support and help and care. You needed somebody else for years and years after you were born to help you until you became independent.","rape-abortion","10:09 PM","abortion-debates","32"

So you support murdering babies? It most certainly is an attempt to soothe your conscience. What does the ""choice"" in pro-choice refer to? It refers to abortion. It's not like we are talking about choosing a pair of sneakers. You are supporting a woman's right to CHOOSE ABORTION, plain and simple. The example you gave is not the same as an abortion. An unborn baby is not a terminal disease. A parent has responsibility for their child until that child reaches 18 years of age. It is up to the parent to exercise that child's right to life. Therefore, having an abortion is in direct violation of that child's right to life.","rape-abortion","10:28 PM","abortion-debates","33"

I guess we should legalize killing 2 year olds. The funniest thing is you just said: ""why? i am willing to accsept that a fetus is a form of a baby - but i am still pro-choice "" Are you now refuting that you accept a fetus as a form of baby? Wouldn't being in favor of abortions in ALL pregnancies be an absolute? Anyway, I digress...If you are pro-choice, you support a woman's right to choose abortion. Therefore, you do not oppose abortion - you support it. Hence, the term ""pro-abortion"" is actually quite accurate.","rape-abortion","11:13 PM","abortion-debates","35"

Like I said before, it would make sense to speak of choice regarding a pair of sneakers. Calling abortion favortism ""pro-choice"" is dramatically downplaying the event you are speaking of (killing an unborn human).","rape-abortion","09:52 AM","abortion-debates","44"
