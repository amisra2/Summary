I do not subscribe to a moral code that requires me to look for my answers in a book written before modern medicine existed. To me pro-choice amounts to abstaining from offering a moral judgement in an instance where I cannot speak with assurance.","rape-abortion","11:28 AM","abortion-debates","46"

You meet and befriend someone and later find out that she is a grown ""child of rape."" Someone begins a discussion of abortion while both of you are present. How would you word your position when discussing it with her?","jim's trucking","220100","We all all products of choices. My parents chose to marry. They chose to have children. I am one of them. Your hypothetical ""child of rape"" is merely the result of another choice by her mother. Whether abortions are legal are not, they are generally chosen. I see no problem in discussing how we got here. Nobody asked to be born. Regardless of their source, all living people are here because of choices made by their parents.","rape-abortion","12:46 PM","abortion-debates","47"
"06-30-2006","8379",4,"GodIsDead","None","that would only be true if i was in favor of requiering abortion for all pregnacys. i am not in favor of that. this is very simple, the first part ""pro"" indicates that you are in favor of soemthing, the second part indicates what you are in favor of. in your case ""pro-life"" indicates that you are in favor of life - i could just as well say life? what do you mean pro-life? are pro-lifers anti war, anti deth pentalty, anti-nature? but i dont, because im not an idiot, and i know that what you are refering to is abortion. it is understood that pro-life and pro-choice refer to ones stance on abortion. if pro-life means one is in favor of requiering life, then pro-abortion would mean that one is in favor of requiering abortion, and therefore would be enterly confuseing and misleading to use. pro-choice is no more and no less than accurate. if you really feel as thoug you must include what is that one advocates choice about in the title of my possition, you may accurately do so by refering to my position as ""Pro-choice-when-it-comes-to-abortion""","DrNo","220115","Using your logic, both sides of this issue could be labeled as ""pro-choice."" After all, both sides are making a choice, right? One side is choosing to allow abortions, while the other side is choosing to not allow abortions. So this is my reasoning for saying that ""pro-choice"" is not as accurate a term as ""pro-abortion."" The idea that a pro-lifer should also be anti-war and anti-death penalty is idiotic. War and capital punishment are not morally equivalent to abortion. If you ask me, I would abolish both terms and use ""pro-abortion"" and ""anti-abortion.""","rape-abortion","02:28 PM","abortion-debates","48"
"06-30-2006","8379",4,"GodIsDead","None","you guys act like the differances between a baby and a fetus are enterly made up. look: this is a fetus http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/genome/...te_fetus_l.jpg this is a baby: http://baby-showers-hawaii.com/I%20l...%20Hawaii2.JPG can you find no differances between the things in those two pictures? are you blind? just in case you are, one of them is far less developed than the other mentaly and phisicaly. the fetus is closer by any mesurement to an unfertelized egg than it is to the baby depicted in the second link. By insisting that they are the same thing you are only denying that these are legitiment differances - if you think that they are not legeitiment differances then provide some justification for that. and also, you with no justification deny that the differance between pro-choice and pro-aborton. somebody who is pro-abortion is in favor of requiering abortion for all pregnacys, just like sombody who is pro-life is in favor of requiering life for all pregnacys. somebody who is pro-choice is in favor of a third, and distinctly differant systyem, in witch a baby is aborted in soem circumstances and helped to surive in other curcumstances. this is not a play on words or trick, it is a distinct and qualititaive differance","Prototype","220121","Now you're acting as though you don't understand what I meant. The differences do not ok abortion. I think you already know what we mean when we say there is no difference. There is a difference between a baby and a fetus physically. But they are both human beings and both are being killed, so both are being murdered. NO NO NO, that doesn't even make sense. A pro-abortionist is a person who wants abortion legal whenever somebody wants it. The label pro-choice was invented by somebody who wanted to look somewhat good and fair to both sides. Pro-abortionists use the exact same reasons to justify their view. Like I've already said, pro-choice is no different. Each person, choice or abortion, both use the same reasons in their views to keep abortion legal. They want the same thing, and those who think they're decent because they call themselves pro-choice need to discover where they really stand on the abortion issue. In favor, or not in favor? There aren't 3 sides, you have to pick one of two.","rape-abortion","02:40 PM","abortion-debates","49"

"06-30-2006","8379",4,"DrNo","None","Once again, this quote is in reference to the choice to have an abortion. You are the one navigating around the truth here. The way I understand the quote is that saying you are pro-choice basically ignores the fact that the choice is related to ending a life, and thus it is morally empty. Like I said before, it would make sense to speak of choice regarding a pair of sneakers. Calling abortion favortism ""pro-choice"" is dramatically downplaying the event you are speaking of (killing an unborn human).","Bell","220198","To me, pro-choice not only means supporting a woman's decision to have an abortion, but also supporting a woman's decision to continue a pregnancy. I have read that many men/families/others pressure women into their abortions, and I am apt to believe this. I would like pro-choice to include the concept of supportive families and a supportive society. I suppose we could expand the concept of ""pro-choice"" to include the choice of birth control, as I am reading more and more these days that access to b.c. is becoming more denied. I was speaking to a woman today who would like to get her tubes tied after two children, but she will have to leave this major urban area to do that b/c most hospitals here are Catholic, and refuse to perform this surgery.","rape-abortion","06:56 PM","abortion-debates","57"

Just the use of the term ""unborn"" is ridiculous. Are the rest of us the ""undead""?","DrNo","220215","I love how people in favor of abortion like to play the semantics game. If we call it a fetus, clump of DNA, or glob of cells instead of an unborn baby, then it's okay to end its life. What is your reasoning behind saying that the term ""unborn"" is ridiculous? What would you prefer it be called? How about a ""living human""? Oh wait, you won't agree to that...so, can you think of a more accurate term? The fact is, it doesn't really matter what you call it, because it will grow into a human being...that is, unless you abort it. Also, if you want to play semantics, you should rephrase your remark : ""A collection of human cells as yet not developed enough to have even the potential for consciousness a human being?"" If it is made up of human cells, wouldn't that make it a hmmmm, I don't know....HUMAN? What do you mean by potential for conciousness? Once the life is conceived, the potential for conciousness exists. The only thing that will prevent this development is a natural miscarriage or an abortion. In reality, every human being is just ""a collection of human cells."" In that case, I suppose we should legalize murder.","rape-abortion","09:39 PM","abortion-debates","58"
