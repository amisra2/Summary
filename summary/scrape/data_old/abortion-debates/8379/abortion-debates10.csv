"07-24-2006","8379",10,"Prototype","None","Wait a second, I think you're the one who thinks a pregnancy is a punishment . It is no crime to make woman stick with pregnancies they got themselves. They don't have anybody to blame but themselves, but when somebody says they can't get out of caring for the outcome of their sex, they scream persecution. Sex out of marriage is not even the issue. The thing I can't stand is that fetus's are being killed daily by people like you that think fetus's are parasites that need to be killed immediately for the sake of your freedom. Killing is murder to me, and killing a fetus early on is no less a crime than killing an already born human. This is what drives me crazy. I think a pregnancy is a great and wonderful thing for any woman, it is only a punishment to those who don't want it but won't abstance from the activities leading to it.","Bell","224376","So it is punishment for not ""abstancing"" [sic] from the activities leading to it. I'm glad that you think pregnancy is a great and wonderful thing for any woman. It sounds like you have seen your mother go through some trials, and everything is still okay. I am going to tell you now, actually say this to you, that your opinion, this ""thinking that pregnancy is a great and wonderful thing for any woman"" of yours is wrong. You may think this, and you may claim this is your opinion and you have a right to it, but here is an actual circumstance where your opinion is inaccurate. I am sure you do not want to go through life having opinions that directly contradict facts. The only fact here is that you think it , that is the fact. Whether or not it is actually true is a different story. [One last thing, Prototype, there is nothing to ""read into"" in this post. I am not being sarcastic nor nasty to you. I say this because you have the tendency to immediately jump to the conclusion that I am not being civil with you, which in fact I am being the opposite.]","rape-abortion","05:08 PM","abortion-debates","137"

Suppose, Steeeeve, that you wake up one morning, and I have surgically attached myself to you such that I subsist off of you. I do not eat, drink, or breathe, but I have tapped into your bloodstream to get the chemicals I need. My presence restricts your lifestyle; you can't go play tennis, or hang out in bars with your friends, or have a romantic dinner with candlelight and wine with your significant other. I continually make you sick, sore, and weak. You have to eat more, you have strange mood swings and desires, your skin stretches to accomodate me, and your body goes through numerous stressful other changes that you will dislike. (It is also quite possible that you will continue to need to provide for me for a long period of time.) Suffice it to say, I do not have your permission to do this, and you want me gone, but removing me from you would kill me. We assume merely for the sake of argument that I am ""alive"" such that I can be ""killed."" If ""the right to life"" exists, then you must allow me to continue, lest you be a murderer.
