"07-01-2006","8379",5,"GodIsDead","None","i dont understand what the point of your arguemtns are, DrNo. clearly you must know that people who disagree with you view the differances between a fetus and a developed baby as important and significant - but you just write this off as obviously and absolutly not so. I want to understand why you see it as the same thing, but you offer nothing to help me understand your point of view.","DrNo","220349","I am saying that the difference between a fetus and a developed baby IS NOT important. They are both made up of human cells. A 2 year old looks different that a 40 year old. A black is man looks different from a white man or an asian, or any other ""race."" The reality is, there is only one race...the human race. And a fetus is simply the human race in its earliest of stages. If you think that a fetus only becomes ""human"" when it gains a conciousness, then you must be in favor of executing Alzheimer's patients, because, if you've ever known one, they have clearly lost their minds. Abortions are performed with the knowledge that the ""clump of DNA"" that you are removing, if left alone, would have developed into a human. In my book, that qualifies it as a human.","rape-abortion","09:06 PM","abortion-debates","62"
"07-02-2006","8379",5,"None","None","None","GodIsDead","220371","Ah, I can understand that DrNo. But I dont think it works that way, and this is why: You claim that a fetus is no more different from a developed baby than a baby is from a 40 year old. This is legitimate indeed! The difference in both cases is mere degrees of physical and mental development. However, this is equally true of the difference between an unfertilized egg, and a fetus, or a sperm and a fetus for that mater, and it is furthermore equally true of the difference between the food I eat tomorrow morning, and the sperm I produce later that day and by hypothetical syllogism, the difference between that food and a 40 year old is a mere matter of physical and mental development as well. Some wish to draw a line at conception, some wish to draw a line at brain activity, some wish to draw a line a birth, all of these positions are based upon a persons interpretation of the matter-becoming-a-person at its various levels of development, witch essentially consists of how well the can relate to it, and how they feel about it as well as their need to draw a line. You for example, seem to need a line drawn at conception. It is your interpretation, that conception is a significant step in the transformation of disorganized matter into a human being. Believe it or not, that isnt my interpretation, I dont intuitively see that as being more significant than any other step. If you want to argue that position, you are going to have to do more than just insist that it is an objective fact that anybody could see If they looked its not. You are going to explain what it is about conception exactly that makes it wrong to end the creation of life after conception, but not before.","rape-abortion","02:00 AM","abortion-debates","63"

The reason I draw the line at conception is because that is the earliest stage where the genetic material you are dealing with will actually grow into a human, if the process is not interfered with. A sperm or egg on its own will not develop into a human, although the genetic materials may be somewhat equivalent. If you were to say that sperm qualifies as life, then using a condom is eqivalent to murder (along with any other activity that ejaculates sperm without the express purpose of reproduction). Also, if an undeveloped egg is equivalent to a living human, then a woman's monthly menstruation cycle would aslo be considered murder. I don't consider these types of actions to be murder. This is why I see conception, the sperms fertilization of the egg, as the logical moment to draw the so-called line.","rape-abortion","02:56 AM","abortion-debates","64"

While it is true that a fetus cannot develop without its mother, it's not as if the mother nurtures the fetus separately from herself. She eats and drinks and her body decides which nutrients to send to the developing baby. The mother would have to starve herself to stop the fetus from developing naturally. Also, your second point is not entirely correct. A newborn can technically survive without the mother, but not without human care at all. If left on its own, a newborn would quickly die.","rape-abortion","10:31 AM","abortion-debates","68"

I gather that from the fact that the significance of consepton that you claim is that before conseption action must be taken to continue development, whereas after conseption action must be taken to stop development.

If you are going to have recreational sex, be prepared to deal with a pregnancy. If you are going to play in traffic, don't be surprised when you get splattered by a car.

This is how I feel about the issue personally, but I would not support legislation to ban recreational sex. What two consenting adults do is their business. But abortion doesn't involve two consenting adults; the baby doesn't get a say in the matter. That is why I think it is wrong.","rape-abortion","11:46 PM","abortion-debates","71"

Is there really such thing as ""inaction""? I am saying that a woman would have to make a conscious decision to employ some type of method to end the development of the baby once it is conceived. In other words, once conception occurs, under normal circumstances, a baby will develop. Sperm ejaculated into a condom will not develop into a baby.

"07-03-2006","8379",5,"sinjin","None","Of course, how silly of me. Without religion stealing is fine, murder too. Your belief in the ""sanctity"" of life stems from your belief that God made it and who are we to destroy it. Right?","Prototype","220598","Let me tell you something. Stealing was a common way to obtain a horse in many early indian tribes her in america. It was not considered wrong, nor was the stealer deemed a theif. It was just bad luck for the person who had the horse originally. -- The Bible was the foundation for the laws prohibiting stealing for any reason. Murder and killing are two different things. In america, killing in any case is considered murder (Except self-defense). Killing for revenge is considered a right in some places, and even in the Israelite law it stated that killing for revenge was an alloted right. But they aren't allowed period now, and each one is considered murder. -- Killing is a sin, and was recognized as such when the first American laws were written. How about the way Justice is served in America? How our system allows any man to speak in a trial even if he is suspected? And things like Freedom of Speech? That isn't allowed in many countries, but look here, in the same Bible the made those other two laws. Deuteronomy 1:16-17 Look it up. I'm still not sure what the sanctity of life means yet. I've heard the term, but I don't know what it means. I'll study it later. But I do believe that God made life, including the feti, the babies and the children and the adults. And I believe God has made it clear that killing babies is wrong, regardless of age or developement.","rape-abortion","10:46 AM","abortion-debates","75"
