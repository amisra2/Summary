There is no rational argument for mental existence being the point of obtaining rights...no matter how hard any of us try","ShadowPikachu","246750","We're legally dead when we no longer mentally exist (hence the term ""brain-dead""), so there is no logical reason to set the beginning point as anything other than the start of the mental existence. Just as people who are dead and without mental existence do not have the ability to obtain rights, a collection of human cells without a mental existence cannot obtain rights. I also notice you have resorted to attacking other people's views rather than following the topic of the thread, which is to share YOUR views.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","11:28 AM","abortion-debates","99"

Even so, it proves nothing about when life begins. What says they have to be the same? This is a classic example of a conclusion not following from the premise. yeah, that is correct.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","12:07 PM","abortion-debates","52"

Because in medical definitions, the definition is exactly what I said (methinks you don't have an argument here). It might not prove it to you, but to most rational and logially thinking people it would. And this here shows exactly what type of a person you are. Why don't you post as to the topic of the thread instead of trying to start arguments? It's really sickening. ON the subject of your starting arguments, I notice you selectively ignored my view that I posted. Couldn't come up with an argument ?","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","02:03 PM","abortion-debates","116"

There is always the option not to respond to me. Actually I didn't even read it (and doubt I ever will). Don't get all worked up over it.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","02:22 PM","abortion-debates","88"

Besides, it doesn't even make logical sense. It is a rational as saying ""because the sky is blue people sing on Sunday"".

But then again, you aren't one for logic, especially when you bring this ridiculous ""quasianalogy"" into the discussion. What I am saying makes a hell of a lot more logical sense than your ""analogy. Mine actually has logic in it: If a person's mental existence ends (brain death - defined my the medical field) they are considered dead. It is logical that if mental existence begins (start of brain activity and consciousness) they are now alive. And again, I wouldn't expect you to understand logic if it hit you in the face.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","05:26 PM","abortion-debates","117"

I'm going to take a stab here and say you are probably in the 8 or 9th grade (not that this is a bad thing) because anyone who has taken a day of a logic class would understand how your statement makes no sense. If you finish at the finish line does that mean you start at the same line? In your world it always does...","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","12:28 PM","abortion-debates","106"

I didn't have time to bother with a spellchecker, I was just typing what formed in my mind. My apoligies to have upset you oh high and mighty one. I've noticed that when you don't have an argument you begin to quibble over some minor misspellings, or some dictionary definition (which you seem to hold as your Bible). Hm, well, sorry, you're stabbing rather wildly, in fact, you ended up stabbing yourself. I happen to be a twenty-year-old in my sophomore year of college at Colorado School of Mines (engineering and science school in case you haven't heard of it). I won't bother to hazard a guess at your age, as guesses base on internet discussion are notoriously inaccurate (as you just proved).","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","01:08 PM","abortion-debates","151"
