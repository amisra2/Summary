Pro-life proponents tend to ultimately have a morality based on moral proclamations - religious or otherwise - that cannot be questioned and need no supporting arguement. The proclamation ""All human life is sacred"" is the main one which leads to their pro-life stance. Pro-choice supporters tend not to think in terms of moral proclamations, so proclamations such as ""All human life is sacred"" mean little to them if not more fully supported by rational arguement. What is your general approach to morality and how has that affected your view of abortion rights? --------------- Starting with myself, my general approach to morality is one that tries to ""treat others as I would have myself be treated"" and involves empathizing with others to try to understand where they are coming from. I follow no fixed moral proclamations. I simply think it would be illogical for me to treat others with one set of moral rules but expect myself to be treated with another set of moral rules - moral rules should be universally applied for them to be self-consistent. Where abortion is concerned, ""I' did not start to exist before I did so mentally (which would have been sometime in the third trimester). For me, it would therefore have made no difference if I had been aborted in the first or second trimester or if I had never been conceived - either way, I never would have existed. So, I have no problem in general with abortions in the first and second trimester. However, I would strictly limit third trimester abortions since I can empathize with mentally existing beings and would not want them to be killed without very good reason, as I would not want to be killed without good reason. ----- So, what are your views on this issue or your own moral approaches?","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","10:10 AM","abortion-debates","1"

I really do try to treat others the way I want to be treated. I'm not sure what religion you follow (if any at all), but I am personally Christian, so I try to follow Jesus' teaching. My moral view is sort of expressed in these passages: Matthew 7 Do Not Judge Others Do not judge others, and you will not be judged. 2 For you will be treated as you treat others. The standard you use in judging is the standard by which you will be judged. 3 And why worry about a speck in your friends eye when you have a log in your own? 4 How can you think of saying to your friend, Let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye, when you cant see past the log in your own eye? 5 Hypocrite! First get rid of the log in your own eye; then you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friends eye. 6 Dont waste what is holy on people who are unholy. Dont throw your pearls to pigs! They will trample the pearls, then turn and attack you. and The Golden Rule 12 Do to others whatever you would like them to do to you. This is the essence of all that is taught in the law and the prophets. These are both from the Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, and that is pretty much what I follow. I also agree with you on abortion: before I existed mentally (around third trimester), I did not exist at all. I also agree that after mental existence comes into play (around third trimester), there must be a really good reason for abortion, such as the woman's life is at risk, or her health is severely threatened.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","10:48 AM","abortion-debates","2"

This is wrong. You yourself find ""mental existence"" to be ""sacred' in a way. There is no rational argument for mental existence being the point of obtaining rights...no matter how hard any of us try You just stated a moral proclamation...(underlined) This, in a way, is another moral proclamation. You feel mental existence is of importance for existing (or being of value). I'm not saying that is wrong or bad (well...I do say that but just not right now ) but it is a moral stance. It logically follows from the moral foundation set up but you made to important claims or ""proclamations"" as you called it. 1) Treat others as you wish to be treated (golden rule) and 2) Mental existence is required to have value My morality was already nicely summed up by you (atleast part of it)","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","11:21 AM","abortion-debates","3"

It is my understanding of myself that comes from self-observation, not from a proclamation. The ""treat others as I would have myself be treated"" is a statement but one which has rational reasons behind it and is, therefore, not merely a proclamation. I want to be treated in certain ways because being treated otherwise leads me to suffering, and I don't like to suffer (that is also not a proclamation, just an observation). It is illogical for me to propose a moral code that states that I should be treated one way and all others another way. Sure, I can propose that but it would be ludicrous - why would anyone accept that as a code? I would also laugh at someone who would present to me a moral code where I would treat them better than myself. Moral codes are codes which societies try to follow. Chaos would erupt if there were no moral codes. I choose a code that makes some logical sense by being at least self-consistent so that it has the least chance of being accepted by others as a universal code. The option is chaos, and I personally prefer to avoid chaos.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","12:04 PM","abortion-debates","5"

People sometimes to take a disposable view of things that they consider unimportant. To view humanity as sacred helps protect humanity.

I think you are getting hung up on the proclamation and not realizing that all the ""proclamation"" does is reflect the moral view behind it. It's no different than your proclamation that morality be based on reason. But pro-lifers often base the pro-life stance on preventing harm. Not just religion. (And in this case they are one-in-the-same anyway.) This isn't a case of harm-preventative-morality versus religious-morality ; it's a case of two harm-preventative moralities in conflict, due to each only focusing mostly on one aspect (either the mother or the unborn baby).","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","01:49 PM","abortion-debates","10"

""I"" for me means my mental self, with my physical self just tagging along. 2. I do not wish to suffer or to have those I care about suffer. 3. I feel empathy toward others and often feel sorry for the suffering of others. Those are observations, not proclamations. The way I choose a moral code to avoid the problem of suffering is to essentially make a theoretical deal with others to have a mutual moral code that we will all treat each other as we ourselves would be treated - in this way, all of us can win out and I solve my problem of points 2 and 3. Perhaps there are other better ways of finding a solution for societies to avoid suffering, but I haven't heard of one. I did not choose this solution arbitrarily.

US society once adopted the standard ""black people should be slaves to white people"" but any reasoning that was put behind that standard was based on faulty logic (ex. justifying slavery by assuming that black people where automatically inferior, without any evidence to support that claim).

"01-11-2007","9437",3,"Phyllis","246810","There is not a 100% guarantee. But a large percentage do. Enough of a percentage to make a moral difference. For example, a fetus has developed into a baby over 6 billion times in the last one-hundred years or so. I don't think that my overall point can be pooh-poohed by simply saying there is no guarantee that a fetus will develop into a baby. And I am suggesting that the definition of ""death"" would be different in Brainiac's case. Essentially, I am stating an assumed (but necessary) premise in your conclusion. You say that the end of mental activity is the definition of death. But it really should be more like the following: the end of mental activity with a low probability of recovery. This was what I was trying to point out. Intuitively, we would think very differently about someone being removed from life support who we knew had a good chance of recovering from brain-death than we would someone in the same scenario who we knew had no chance of recovering. Thus, my suggestion that your conclusion has a hidden, but very necessary premise: the premise that the patient will not recover. This is a very different justification for abortion. In the first scenario, I think it was being suggested that the embryo could ethically be killed simply because it did not have a mental existence. I.e., the embryo has no ethical value whatsoever. In this scenario, however, it is being suggested that whatever value the embryo has, a woman possesses the right to her own body. That is a very different claim, and does not erase the ethical concerns with respect to the embryo. It is akin to a caretaker that says, ""though Braniac has an outstanding chance to recover, it would cost way to much to see him through his recovery. Therefore, we shall pull the plug."" And besides that, the idea of ""potentiality"" applies also to third trimester pregnancies. The fetus, though now in possession of mental existence, is still only potentially a born baby. But you, as I understand it, do want the woman's choice taken away at the third trimester (with some rare exceptions, I believe).","ShadowPikachu","246831","I'm really not in the mood to argue with you on this. I stated my position, and what I beleive to be the most logical point of view, if you don't like it, I don't really care. You are correct in that a woman posesses the right to her own body. I did not say that the foetus had NO moral value, just that its value is so miniscule - the value that it has is it might maybe be a potential human some day, that a woman should not be denied the right to abort based on that. The potentiality applies to around after the beginning of hte third trimester when the foetus has mental consciousness. Yes, I do beleive abortion should not be allowed after that as the foetus has become an unborn baby with human consciousness, and therefore has equal moral value as the woman. I do, however, support late term abortions in cases where a woman's life is at risk, or her health will be severely affected, as in those cases, I beleive that the woman should not be forced to go through with it if it will harm her.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","05:36 PM","abortion-debates","31"
"01-12-2007","9437",3,"Another opinion","246825","Many of us view humanity with mental existence as important. The only ones you are protecting that our view does not are those human living entities with no mental existence. How can you even talk about ""harm"" to a living entity with no mental existence? The golden rule is not just one sided. It does not expect us to do all giving and no taking. I have expectations of how others should treat me (the taking part) but, to be consistent, I should realize that they have expectations of me (the giving part). Though people may want to win out in a job interview over someone more qualified, most don't morally expect that that should happen since they realize that that expectation would not be fair. They may make a buck off of a person but, unless they are con artists who lie to get that buck, most will do it in a way they consider fair, under laws they themselves would be willing to live under. What you are talking about here is the *potential* to exist being important. I would personally also thinking that potential existence is important, but not nearly as important as an existing person. After all, unfertilized eggs and sperm also have the *potential* to become full people but no one is concerned about their loss. For many of us it is the actual mentally-existing person that is most important. However, if there is a contest between the rights of a living, existing person and the rights of either *potential* person, then I think the rights of the living person win out.","jyoshu","246869","Well, to say it has no mental existence doesn't really tell the whole story. The fetus WILL have (more than likely) full mental existence in a very short time. It seems to me that if you ""view humanity with mental existance as important"" you'd also view as important that the unborn baby WILL indeed reach that point, in all likelihood. Upon reviewing the golden rule ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you"" I see nothing of any other 'side.' It's very clear--treat others the way you'd want to be treated. No one wants to be treated badly, so if you follow the golden rule, you'll be benevolent. That's a nice silver-lining take on the situation, but you and I both know that there are times someone who has a greater and more pressing need for the job (even to feed his family) gets put aside for someone who doesn't need it as badly. The issue here isn't ""fairness."" This issue is doing unto others as you'd have them do unto you. If you're going to hold the golden rule up as a rule, you have to be consistent. Why not? Why shouldn't they be given at least closer to equal weight? The baby is going to be as real and genuine of a person as the mother; the only difference is that the baby is a few years behind. You're talking about a difference of time. An unfertilized egg or sperm alone will not grow up into a person. So it does NOT have that potential at all. That's fair enough, but I just think it's important to at least acknowledge and realize that the unborn baby does have worth and importance, and not just a piece of tissue as it's so often callously viewed.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","09:18 AM","abortion-debates","32"

Many religious groups think and revel in the thought that those who do not believe their religion will go to hell - not a compassionate stance at all.

I normally could care less how you spell something but if you claim my post is ""retarted"" then it certainly presents irony that has to be pointed out. College student doesn't surprise me much either actually. I wasn't trying to insult as I don't find anything wrong with our younger crowd other than their limited view of the world (Zachvac is pretty good about this though). But since you are in college I suggest taking a logic course (philosophy department normally) as you will understand why the conclusion you come up with does not follow from the premise. Furthermore, as I stated above (and as Phyllis stated), you make a key assumption that is false. Your logic tries to say brain dead therefore dead and then not brain dead therefore not dead. While fine this doesn't exactly say when ""life"" begins is in fact false anyway. The fetus is certainly not dead..wouldn't you agree?","ShadowPikachu","246950","Its cells are certainly living (although, the same is true for a recently deceased person, so your argument is a little flimsy there as well), but it is not mentally living.

"01-12-2007","9437",4,"Another opinion","246904","Since you propose no method which can convince anyone else that you are right and they are wrong then your approach to morality leads to nearly arbitrary distributions of morality in the world. There is no reason why someone else of another completely random belief system could not also sit back an claim without proof that ""My morality is right and yours is wrong"". One of my goals in discussing morality is that, if we don't have SOME common moral goals to work off of, then there is no chance whatsoever of reaching some moral consensus, morality is arbitrary, and we risk the moarl chaos that I would think we are trying to avoid. I am not completely following you here, but you seem to claim that my three observations are really proclamations: 1. ""I"" for me means my mental self, with my physical self just tagging along. 2. I do not wish to suffer or to have those I care about suffer. 3. I feel empathy toward others and often feel sorry for the suffering of others. These are observations I made about myself that haven't been taught or randomly reached. Other people might observe other things about themselves (ex. some people seem to get a certain satisfaction out of suffering) so, from that point of view, there is some arbitrariness to my observations of myself since others may not have the same observations about themselves. However, just because others may have other observations about themselves doesn't make my observation a proclamation. As a side note, to be completely accurate about observations 2 and 3, I have to admit that there are rare occasions when I am angry at a loved one and do want them to slightly suffer and there are various people with whom I would find it very difficult to empathize. Moral proclamations tend to run along the line that something ""should"" be a particular way in an absolute way. I am not claiming that there are no valid alternatives to my moral system - there are. I think people should have a right to follow whatever moral system they wish as long as their moral system does not impinge on the rights of others. I am not trying to force my moral system on others. I only try to convince others through force of reason and arguement. Similarly, pro-life proponents do not have the right to force their moral system on me but they are welcome to try to convince me through force of reason and arguement. That reason and arguement leads nowhere if it comes down to a proclamation (such as ""all human life is sacred"") that we don't agree on. Then it is a battle of numbers - i.e. majority wins - and nothing else. That would force the minority to suffer under the repellent system of the majority. That is what I am hoping to avoid in these discussions - I am trying to find a common moral language that we can use to find a compromise.","Steeeeve","246951","So you do not believe in a moral absolute then. This is fine but you must understand that this means you can't criticize other moral belief systems as being wrong. You can't find a compromise when you have a different basis for morality. This ""proclamation"" of all human life being sacred is not one that just came out of thin air but rather the morality system set into place. Your morality system, which is no provable than mine, says that the proclamation that came out of mine is just not true to your own morals. There really can't be a common language when you come from two directions and get two different answers. The only way to convince the other would be to show the others moral system is wrong. With a relative approach to morals you really can't say my system is wrong....so that's out.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","03:41 PM","abortion-debates","55"

"01-12-2007","9437",5,"jyoshu","246963","Yes, I do view the golden rule in the sense that Christ meant it. Let me say then that my view is that an assumed benevolent goal is the golden rule I think is the more rational view. Given that, I still feel that a rational morality is one that needs to be tempered and checked and accompanied by compassion. Sorry I didn't realize we were talking about two different things.","Another opinion","246979","I agree that adding compassion as well as reason to morality is a good approach. I just don't know how easy that would be to universally adopt. I think by our very biological natures, there seems to be some level of compassion ""built in"". Even apes have been shown to show compassion to other apes in certain situations. (This arguement assumes you agree with evolution and that this shows some biological basis to compassion). However, greed and selfishness are unfortunately also strong driving forces that often win out. In moral discussions, an appeal to compassion wins out for those who are predisposed to that anyway but I suspect that it falls on deaf ears for those for whom compassion takes a definite backseat to selfishness. However, the golden rule in the form of ""How would you like it if you were treated that way"" often does work to convince a much wider range of people to act in ways that ultimately show more compassion. It is a moral approach that far more people seem to accept and follow, so far more people can be swayed by its arguements. In a way, it is partly a selfish approach because many will agree to treat others fairly only so that they themselves are treated fairly. However, though it might ultimately have selfish motivations, it has a better chance of reaching the ultimate goal of a more peaceful and compassionate society. Perhaps we should not be referring to it as the ""golden rule"" since that might imply the automatically benevolent Jesus version, but I don't have a better name for it except for possibly refering to Kant's Categorical Imperative instead.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","05:15 PM","abortion-debates","65"

This is a classic example of a conclusion not following from the premise.","Shooterandproud","247046","Not necessarily. When ""life"" begins is irrelevant, because flowers and weeds don't have rights yet they are a life form. The thing that determines rights is intelligence. Not how much or how little, but whether someone has it at all. A spec of dirt has no intelligence. It won't pop up and say ""hey! How ya doin!"" unless you're on crack. We've actually killed intelligent entities for less than the consequences of carrying out an unwanted pregnancy. We hunt, and we go to war. Even though I do not agree with war, I do agree with hunting, and I myself hunt on occasion. However, that is off topic. The point is, carrying out an unwanted pregnancy can have devastating effects, and those next 18 years could hold her back from her life. Its awful how she will have to liver her life. If she gets an abortion, the embryo does not (to quote another opinion) ""mentally exist"". Now, hunting is really only done for recreation, and maybe a good meal. They would've been almost just as well off if they went to the local taco bell. Sure, they'd prefer hunting, but its really only done for fun and exercise. I, myself, value an animal over an embryo at its current stage. The only reason I don't completely think an animal is worth more is because that embryo has a chance of becoming a human. Then again, the animal does mentally exist and has full awareness, and the embryo is really just a sitting cellular watersack with no organs.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","12:36 PM","abortion-debates","68"
