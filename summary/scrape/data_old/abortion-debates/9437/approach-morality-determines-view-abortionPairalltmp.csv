There is no rational argument for mental existence being the point of obtaining rights...no matter how hard any of us try","ShadowPikachu","246750","We're legally dead when we no longer mentally exist (hence the term ""brain-dead""), so there is no logical reason to set the beginning point as anything other than the start of the mental existence. Just as people who are dead and without mental existence do not have the ability to obtain rights, a collection of human cells without a mental existence cannot obtain rights.

Because in medical definitions, the definition is exactly what I said (methinks you don't have an argument here). It might not prove it to you, but to most rational and logially thinking people it would. And this here shows exactly what type of a person you are. Why don't you post as to the topic of the thread instead of trying to start arguments? It's really sickening. ON the subject of your starting arguments, I notice you selectively ignored my view that I posted.

But then again, you aren't one for logic, especially when you bring this ridiculous ""quasianalogy"" into the discussion. What I am saying makes a hell of a lot more logical sense than your ""analogy. Mine actually has logic in it: If a person's mental existence ends (brain death - defined my the medical field) they are considered dead. It is logical that if mental existence begins (start of brain activity and consciousness) they are now alive.

I didn't have time to bother with a spellchecker, I was just typing what formed in my mind. My apoligies to have upset you oh high and mighty one. I've noticed that when you don't have an argument you begin to quibble over some minor misspellings, or some dictionary definition (which you seem to hold as your Bible). Hm, well, sorry, you're stabbing rather wildly, in fact, you ended up stabbing yourself. I happen to be a twenty-year-old in my sophomore year of college at Colorado School of Mines (engineering and science school in case you haven't heard of it).

The point was to show that your idea of when death ends really isn't just ""brain dead"" but rather ""brain dead with no recovery"". The key difference is that if you could recover from no brain then perhaps you wouldn't call this person ""dead"". You failed to address this. I normally could care less how you spell something but if you claim my post is ""retarted"" then it certainly presents irony that has to be pointed out. College student doesn't surprise me much either actually. I wasn't trying to insult as I don't find anything wrong with our younger crowd other than their limited view of the world (Zachvac is pretty good about this though). But since you are in college I suggest taking a logic course (philosophy department normally) as you will understand why the conclusion you come up with does not follow from the premise. Furthermore, as I stated above (and as Phyllis stated), you make a key assumption that is false. Your logic tries to say brain dead therefore dead and then not brain dead therefore not dead. While fine this doesn't exactly say when ""life"" begins is in fact false anyway. The fetus is certainly not dead..wouldn't you agree?","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","abortion-debates","52","03:28 PM"

The discussion is about whether or not death being at death of the brain makes life when the brain forms. I state that there is no logic that would ever get that conclusion as it makes no sense.
