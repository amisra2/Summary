I don't think so--I think most people are willing to make a buck off of others (business ventures), land that job they want before someone else gets it, curse someone for cutting them off in traffic, get that parking spot before the guy coming around the corner gets it, or even get in an intentionally insulting dig to someone in a discussion forum such as this. The examples could go on and on ... I think a lot of people like to THINK they incorporate the golden rule, but at close, honest examination would find that they rarely do.","Steeeeve","246795","Ouch jyoshu...you are hitting them outta the park today. Exactly, it sounds nice but it certainly isn't the only moral rule and it certainly doesn't mean one follows it. I'd say selfishness is probably the underlying value in many cases.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","02:25 PM","abortion-debates","16"

I said that most would incorporate it (referring to a world morality). Just because they would accept it doesn't mean they would follow it. Maybe you should stop trying to tear down your little strawmen.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","02:29 PM","abortion-debates","17"
"01-11-2007","9437",2,"Steeeeve","246793","I don't doubt that brain-dead means dead but I do doubt that can therefore infer that life means ""brain alive""...even you don't believe this as it has to be more than just a brain substance. well, I thought Another Opinion covered my belief fairly well so why bother? There is always the option not to respond to me. Actually I didn't even read it (and doubt I ever will). Don't get all worked up over it.","ShadowPikachu","246800","Again, I said most rational and logical people would. I didn't say you would. And I am sure you really did read through it, you just couldn't come up with a response, but whatever.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","02:31 PM","abortion-debates","18"

In short, I think this analogy needs to be reconsidered because of one important fact: a person who is brain-dead will never recover from that state no matter how much medical treatment is given, whereas an embryo who is ""brain-dead"" most certainly will fully recover from that state in a relatively short amount of time if left alone. Perhaps an illustration may be helpful. Suppose we have a person who is definitively brain-dead (I'll call him ""Braniac""). Now, suppose (hypothetically -- this is a philosophical discussion afterall) that we know with certainty that Braniac will fully recover from being brain-dead in about six months. Given this knowledge, I think it would be unequivocally unethical and immoral to remove Braniac from his life support system. I would think this would also be the intuitive position (but of course, not the logical position) of those who think mental existence makes the person, and mental existence makes the person valuable. I realize that there is a difference here between Braniac's life support system and the embryo's. My only point is this: I do not think it is as simple as ShadowPickachu has suggested. I am suggesting that my example shows that the lack of mental existence alone does not establish that the embryo can be ethically killed.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","02:54 PM","abortion-debates","19"

There IS no guarantee that the foetus would ever even develop into a baby. I wasn't arguing that because it is ""brain-dead"" (your implication, not mine), that it means what you are saying. I am saying that if death is determined by the end of mental activity it logically follows that life is determined by the beginning of mental activity. You can say that it is potential life, in that it might eventually become a living person. A woman, however, should not have her choice taken away because of some potential . Otherwise you could go and argue that you shouldn't ever cross a street because of the potential of being hit by car. If we live by potentials, we'd have a pretty poor life.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","03:09 PM","abortion-debates","20"

"01-11-2007","9437",2,"Steeeeve","246779","Jyoshu pretty much answered for me so I won't go back but I will say that your morality is formed based on arbitrary things as well. Whether you believe in a god or make yourself god you still are making arbitrary rules for which you develop a morality. The idea that you don't want to suffer and therefore came up with this morality is abritrary as everything we have stated. Why wasn't the conclusion ""I dont' want to suffer so be stronger than everyone else"" or ""I don't want to suffer so don't associate with anyone else"". Or maybe the conslusion could be to believe in a religion. Either way, you are going to have to believe in something and that forms the basis for a morality.","Another opinion","246820","My stance on morality is based on the following observations: 1. ""I"" for me means my mental self, with my physical self just tagging along. 2. I do not wish to suffer or to have those I care about suffer. 3. I feel empathy toward others and often feel sorry for the suffering of others. Those are observations, not proclamations. The way I choose a moral code to avoid the problem of suffering is to essentially make a theoretical deal with others to have a mutual moral code that we will all treat each other as we ourselves would be treated - in this way, all of us can win out and I solve my problem of points 2 and 3. Perhaps there are other better ways of finding a solution for societies to avoid suffering, but I haven't heard of one. I did not choose this solution arbitrarily. I chose it since it makes sense and should theoretically work and since many, if not most people, at least make some effort at using that moral code anyway so this moral code is at least partially universally adopted. It is the best moral option I have ever heard to address my concern about suffering. What is arbitrary about the reasoning I presented above? What unsupported proclamations do you claim that I have made? Either way, are you proposing that all moral systems are equally arbitrary and therefore equally valid? In your scenario, someone could come up with an arbitrary proclamation ""black people should be slaves to white people"" and build a morality based on that. My moral approach questions that proclamation as well and thus avoids un-necessary human suffering.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","04:37 PM","abortion-debates","25"

What is morality for one time frame may not be for another, and what is morality for one person may not be for another. The rub comes when an individual's morality goes against any given standard that is set by society. And the issue of abortion is a battle over that standard.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","04:43 PM","abortion-debates","26"

It is morality based on arbitrary proclamations such as that one which is what I am arguing against. I strongly believe that we have to try our hardest to incorporate reason in our sense of morality for it to not be arbitrary and to reduce human suffering. Though there are many religious proclamations that have reduced human suffering, others have made it worse (as in the proclamation against gays or Islam's proclamations of the inferiority of all women). A majority in a society may declare a standard but that does not make that standard right unless there are fully explored reasons behind it. US society once adopted the standard ""black people should be slaves to white people"" but any reasoning that was put behind that standard was based on faulty logic (ex. justifying slavery by assuming that black people where automatically inferior, without any evidence to support that claim). Reason and logic can very much help in eliminating such unfair moral proclamations.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","05:13 PM","abortion-debates","29"

But then again, you aren't one for logic, especially when you bring this ridiculous ""quasianalogy"" into the discussion. What I am saying makes a hell of a lot more logical sense than your ""analogy. Mine actually has logic in it: If a person's mental existence ends (brain death - defined my the medical field) they are considered dead. It is logical that if mental existence begins (start of brain activity and consciousness) they are now alive. And again, I wouldn't expect you to understand logic if it hit you in the face.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","05:26 PM","abortion-debates","30"
