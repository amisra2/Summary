Ok, so let me get this straight... your argument to ""prove"" to me philosophically that a fetus is not a person hinges on a basis of a hypothetical? One that isn't even possible? Sorry but to PROVE to me that a fetus isn't a person, you should probably start with facts, evidence or at least a common shared belief (not based off a hypothetical situation that can't actually happen).","Sigma","424226","I read and even understood the thread. Sinjin posted: So far we appear in agreement that a thing can be composed of living cells with human DNA and not be a ""human being"" aka ""person"". You replied: Yes, we are in agreement at that . If you want to add additional qualifiers such as ""separate"" and ""distinct"" that's fine but not part of the original point. Actually I'm starting with a definition. As I stated, the first goal is to establish the ""basic tenets"" to see what we agree on. So I'm seeing if we agree on the seat of individuality. If there is no agreement on the basics, then there is no common ground to even have a discussion because we would be talking about different things. So I'll ask again: Would you consider it rational to say that the individual person is in the jar?","when-life-begins","12:36 AM","abortion-debates","31"

Yes, a thing can be a living cell with human DNA and still not be a human life (a skin cell, a sperm cell, an egg cell, any cell within the human body is a living cell with Human DNA and is not a human life or human being. Actually, you started with a hypothetical question, not a definition. A hypothetical question that isn't even based in reality. Yes, we have to start with common ground, but I'd prefer any common ground to be rooted in reality, not fantasy and science fiction.","when-life-begins","12:57 AM","abortion-debates","32"
"02-17-2011","15035",3,"amirsdaddy","424167","You're on the wrong board. You should go to the Creation/Intelligent Design vs. Evolution threads...","Iuris","424228","Actually, no. I'm a bit peculiar, but that's what I believe. Life started and never stopped. I AM 3.5 billion years old - the line of life has not been interrupted since. And this does apply to the abortion debate. Life doesn't start, nor does it stop. It takes different forms. Therefore, it's not a question of when life starts but when it's recognized as a separate entity. It contributes to my position that the society can decide when it's going to recognize the nascent form as a new individual, a person in its own right, rather than part of / property of its own parents. Try ancient Rome. Where you only stopped being your father's property and became recognized as a person with marriage. Until then, you were the property of your father, who could kill you at will.

Rofl, sure, we can start on an even more basic level if you wish. It'll just take longer. Surely you won't argue that human organs, even removed from the rest of the body, are not alive. After all, transplants occur and the organs don't die between one body and the next. Would you agree it is rational to say that you are not any less of a human being when you lose a kidney, and that kidney should not gain recognition as a human being, despite being alive and containing human DNA?","when-life-begins","10:07 AM","abortion-debates","34"
"02-17-2011","15035",3,"None","None","None","sinjin","424246","If AD makes no distinction between ""human life"" and ""human being"", I can't help but think this a waste of time. A ""being"" is a specific thing. It has awareness. At some point after conception a unique, living, human organism is present. No argument from me. But that organism lacks sentience and even the physical structures required for sentience as science understands the seat of consciousness. It is not a ""being"".","when-life-begins","12:01 PM","abortion-debates","35"

Nobody is saying that there isn't life at conception. There is... but it's not a person yet.

It doesn't seem that the textbook is claiming a zygote as a person, and for good reason. (For one, as already brought up in this thread... that one zygote can split to become twins.

So logically, taking the unprovable and strictly subjective out of the equation, you're left with the FACT that human life begins at conception. Therefore, abortion IS taking the life of another human. Everybody's definition of person/personhood differs. So let's say somebody doesn't view anybody under the age of 3 a person (since memories tend to only become memories at around the age 3... just for the sake of argument). If they were to kill a 2 year old child and say ""They weren't a person. They hadn't obtained personhood yet and therefore I didn't kill them,"" Are they wrong? Justified? Even though the 2 year old child was living by all other standards? You just contradicted yourself... When you later say So either you are or you're not arguing that life begins at conception. You can't have it both ways. And yes, the textbook does clearly state the development begins at fertilization. A thing lacking growth and development renders it scientifically unalive (according to definition). So if something is alive, it's growth and development has to begin at some point, i.e. deductive reasoning tells me that the textbook is saying that life begins at conception. Regarding twinning and chimerism: The fact still remains that twinning and chimerism CANNOT POSSIBLY OCCUR without the egg FIRST being fertilized. Period. Whether you wanna call it one life or two and when (at any time after conception)... it still remains life.","when-life-begins","03:24 PM","abortion-debates","42"

This goes back to the person/personhood debate and hence the reason it can be neither proven nor disproven as to when personhood is actually achieved if ever at all. It's purely subjective. Scientifically, you're wrong. It is conclusive based on the scientific definition of life that it begins for humans at conception. It can be measured... it is not only quantifiable but qualifiable as well. If not, you have a very serious case against the scientific community for misleading us with false information for centuries, lol.

If there is metabolic activity, for example, we can say a cell is alive... but the metabolic activity isn't life. You have to provide evidence of life because life itself cannot be measured. In much the same way, if you agree on basic premises you can prove personhood. If you'd care to return to that line of discussion.","when-life-begins","03:48 PM","abortion-debates","44"

It is. And abortion does kill, but it isn't a person (philosophical term or not) and doesn't have rights. A woman shouldn't be forced to grow a person inside her against her will. In my opinion, it isn't a person until the fetus is viable. I'm not in support of 'partial birth abortion' (that is unless the mother's life is in danger or other possible reasons). As someone else mentioned, the circle of life never really ends. Life doesn't 'begin' at conception. That was the point of the twin thing. When does the twin's life start? That zygote is identical to the one of a single child. It's all a process... just because egg and sperm unite doesn't mean a person is magically created at that moment. The sperm and egg are both alive well before conception. Both are indeed 'human' in nature. I know, I know... 'but the egg needs fertilized.' But the zygote/embryo/fetus also needs a lot more to become a human. It needs to feed off the mother... That's just as much a part of creating a human as conception is. Every time a contraceptive is used, sperm are being killed (as well as any other time sperm is otherwise 'wasted.')... potential humans are being killed. That's all a zygote/embryo is--a potential human. It still needs a lot more to become a human, just like an egg needs a lot more, or a sperm needs a lot more. It really is a lot like the seed/tree argument. Destroying or digging up a seed is not the same as cutting down a tree. Anyway, I know I'm just rambling, so I'll stop.","when-life-begins","04:15 PM","abortion-debates","45"
