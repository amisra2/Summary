"03-10-2013","15035",8,"None","None","None","Emily","471235","Going back to the original issue and tying it into the abortion debate in terms of legality... I recognize that defining the ""beginning of life"" is pertinent to the issue of abortion, but - personally, anyway - I find that the ethicality of aborting a fetus is less about whether or not the fetus is truly ""alive,"" less about the potential religious aspects to the issue, and more about simple fairness and responsibility. A woman who does not want to have a child and is not willing to accept even nine months of responsibility shouldn't be engaging in ""activities"" that lead to pregnancy (subtle, I know ). I know this view sounds outdated and that the ""modern woman"" is all about being free to have as much sex as she likes with whomever she wants, but should a fetus (which I believe everyone has agreed is at least ""potential life"") be punished because ""modern"" thinking promotes irresponsible behaviors? I, personally, believe that abortion is only really ""fair,"" in cases of rape or cases in which the mother's life is in danger, however I also recognize that simply denying women from aborting unwanted pregnancies won't compel them to keep the children or provide a good life for them... I know I'm suggesting that everyone be held responsible for their actions in life and that many people think this concept is JUST ASKING TOO MUCH of the average human being, in which case I would reply that we should save the ""potential life"" in the hopes that it might grow up to be more intelligent than what we have now. And just to throw in my two cents about the original topic at hand (because I feel like I should), I would argue that one does become an ""individual"" at fertilization - the moment when living cells come together to comprise of all of ""its"" DNA, which will comprise all of its future traits, etc. Yes, these are future traits - because the fetus is still growing. Just because one is not fully grown does not mean that one is not a human being. Babies still look much different from their future 18-year-old selves who will be recognized as legal adults, just as fetuses look much different from the babies they will grow into (I'm looking at you, acorn-vs.-tree people!), but the babies are no less people than 18-year-olds are. In fact I might argue the opposite...","when-life-begins","07:28 PM","abortion-debates","111"

There is and has always been a force that has been in control and in motion for thousands of years that has determined the natural course of things that God has created. The human factor and the secular desires to have things the way humans want them have alway had the ability to screw things up for everyone. If you believe in what the Bible teaches, we are not capable of determining our own course. If we were, we wouldn't be in the situation things are in right now. This subject along with others currently on the minds of people would not be issues that would be dominating our lives.","when-life-begins","11:23 AM","abortion-debates","112"

Why is a child conceived because of rape worth less than that of an unintentional pregnancy? Is it because you recognize the difficulties that might come up for mother and child? Does her unwanted pregnancy have a way to measure how unfair or inconvenient it is where we can say a 7 is ok to abort but a 5 stays? It really isn't about what it looks like. The fact that it has no brain or internal organs and can't survive on its own or even with help outside the womb during the period when abortion is legal. It is about do I have the right to tell a woman or girl who lives across the country whose name and circumstances I will never know what she may or may not do that will impact the rest of her life. If I wasn't part of it from the beginning what right do I have to impose my decision after the fact. When we think of fair and responsible it implies that all involved walk away with something. I have said before even abstinence is only 99% effective there will be circumstances where however unfortunate termination is the better of two bad options. That choice does not belong to anyone except those involved.","when-life-begins","12:22 PM","abortion-debates","116"

I agree it's about a person whom you don't know and the impact on the rest of their life. I just don't think we should end their life because we don't know them.
