"03-07-2013","15035",7,"smiley","471060","Note at this point EZ is twisting the debate. At no point did I say that he was personally given any such order. If he knows as much about the bible as he claims, he knows that there is a passage in the bible which supports my comment. So, either he doesn't know as much about the bible as he professes, which would make him just plain dishonest, or he does know the passage to which I am referring, and is displaying his usual level of intellectual dishonesty. Either way, he is dishonest. And liars go to hell, according to his own beliefs. See that, again he is twisting the debate to avoid the point. Try reading Hosea 13:16 So, your god, who is Jesus according to your beliefs, supports the abortion of the Samarian foetus. Presumably you will argue that the Samarians had rebelled against god, so every last one of them (including the innocent unborn) deserved death. His guys get to kill all the menfolk, slice open the pregnant women and keep the virgin girls for themselves. How compassionate! So, he supports abortion. My comment proves true. And you look a fool, yet again.","Easyrider","471093","<flush> You stupid jacka*s. The only entities authorized to inflict capital punishment in the New Testament / Covenant is God (Acts chapter 5) and by government directive (Romans chapter 13). That's it. And there's ZERO ORDERS FROM GOD TO ME / TO MAN in Christianity to kill the innocent unborn. You're busted, LIAR.","when-life-begins","10:19 AM","abortion-debates","92"

You claim that your god has the right to inflict capital punishment. Presumably this includes murder, genocide and abortion, as these are all detailed in your chosen magic book, yet you claim he is the height of morality. You claim that there are zero orders from your god for man to kill the innocent unborn despite the fact that I have supplied a passage from your own book of magic showing that he did. Who do you think he got to slice open the bellies of those pregnant women? Presumably the same people who kidnapped their virgin daughters to have for their own. You claim that I am the liar, yet you constantly lie to protect this monster you call god. Luckily I can see his atrocities for what they are. If your god is depicted accurately in the bible then he is the most evil beast that has ever come to my notice. How you could worship such a beast, and continually lie for him is beyond me? I have shown that your god supports abortion. In the past I have shown him to support genocide, rape, slavery, beating slaves to death (as long as they tale several days to die). I have even shown that your have murdered your own saviour in our heart. All using your own scripture. I have not lied at all, and you still come off as the fool.","when-life-begins","10:49 AM","abortion-debates","93"

And I already have 2 dogs (which is the limit in local by-laws). Maybe when one of them eventually passes away, I will get a new dog. Until then I will continue to show what a fool you are when you make claims that are just plain stupid. You may continue your cavalcade of lies now.","when-life-begins","12:58 PM","abortion-debates","95"

If you build a garden you can destroy it at your pleasure but if your neighbor destroys it, you are mad. The same thing here; a master cannot violate rules that he creates. The person that determines the definition of ""evil"" cannot be ""evil"" without his own consent.","when-life-begins","11:11 PM","abortion-debates","100"

But it also seems to be true, assuming that the biblical god exists, that he not only defined evil, he also created evil, and is quite happy to give himself consent to do evil at the drop of a hat. Not only that, but he is also quite prepared to instruct his creations to be evil too.","when-life-begins","09:23 AM","abortion-debates","101"

Creating the free will environment where people can, apart from God, CHOOSE TO DO EVIL , is not the same thing as saying God rejoices in it, or that he wanted it to occur. And subsequently, if God decides to impart judgment on sinful people or nations, then that's also not to say he enjoys it. So wise up.","when-life-begins","11:01 AM","abortion-debates","102"

You are correct in saying that creating a free will environment so that people choosing to do evil is not the same as god rejoicing in it, but that is not what I said. You do seem to have trouble keeping up. I actually said that your god, according to the bible had no trouble choosing to do evil on a whim. He instructed his tribe where they could get slaves, and told them that they could beat their slaves to death, as long the slave took a few days to die. He sent bears to kill a group of children, he incited genocide, rape and abortion. He committed genocide, on a frequent basis. Being all-powerful, he could have chosen not to do these things, but he chose to do them regardless. I would suggest that it is you who should wise up, but you have already shown yourself to be beyond hope, so I will save my breath.","when-life-begins","12:31 PM","abortion-debates","103"
