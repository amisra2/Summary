It is at this point when all the requirements to be considered life are met.

So far we appear in agreement that a thing can be composed of living cells with human DNA and not be a ""human being"" aka ""person"".","amirsdaddy","424208","Let me explain it to you further. There are unicellular organisms and there are multicellular organisms. In a unicellular organism (a bacterial cell, e.g.) the living cell and the life of the bacteria are indistinguishable from one another. There is only one cell and is therefore both a 'living' cell and the life of a bacteria. Multicellular organisms are more complex, comprised of multiple cells (anywhere from a few to several trillion). Thus, the cell is considered living but is separate from the life of the organism. Because a multicellular organism is not dependant on one cell for it's life, rather the combination of all its cells, then the living cell and the life of the organism are distinguished from one another. A human sperm cell does not make a human life (even though it is a living cell) because a) it doesn't meet the scientific requirements of what is considered life and b) the sperm cell in and of itself, cannot reproduce into a living human being nor can it grow into a living human being. It's only when the sperm and the egg meet that allows this new cell to grow and develop into a human being that is capable of reproduction, hence at fertilization it has now met the requirements of the scientific/medical definition of ""life"". Because it is human (that being the only thing it possibly could be due to its unique DNA) makes it a human life. Well you're certainly entitled to your opinion... even at the blatant disregard for scientific fact. It was a reiteration of my statement/position which apparently went right by you. I presented the facts throughout the entire post. It's up to you whether you want to believe and accept it. Yes, we are in agreement at that. Just as I mentioned before, skin cells, brain cells... every cell in your body is living and contains your DNA. And only your DNA. It is only when the DNA from a male and a female combine that makes it a new separate and distinct life, person or human being... whichever you prefer. They're all the same to me. That combination of the DNA happens at fertilization (aka conception).","when-life-begins","10:54 PM","abortion-debates","15"

Therefore, it's not a question of when life starts but when it's recognized as a separate entity. It contributes to my position that the society can decide when it's going to recognize the nascent form as a new individual, a person in its own right, rather than part of / property of its own parents. Try ancient Rome. Where you only stopped being your father's property and became recognized as a person with marriage. Until then, you were the property of your father, who could kill you at will.

It doesn't seem that the textbook is claiming a zygote as a person, and for good reason. (For one, as already brought up in this thread... that one zygote can split to become twins. At what point does that second life begin?) Nobody is saying that there isn't life at conception. There is... It says that at fertilization, the development begins. It's not a human yet.","amirsdaddy","424416","The terms ""person"" and ""personhood"" are philosophical terms that can't be proven (as I already mentioned). So logically, taking the unprovable and strictly subjective out of the equation, you're left with the FACT that human life begins at conception. Therefore, abortion IS taking the life of another human. Everybody's definition of person/personhood differs. So let's say somebody doesn't view anybody under the age of 3 a person (since memories tend to only become memories at around the age 3... just for the sake of argument). If they were to kill a 2 year old child and say ""They weren't a person. They hadn't obtained personhood yet and therefore I didn't kill them,"" Are they wrong? Justified? Even though the 2 year old child was living by all other standards? You just contradicted yourself... When you later say So either you are or you're not arguing that life begins at conception. You can't have it both ways. And yes, the textbook does clearly state the development begins at fertilization. A thing lacking growth and development renders it scientifically unalive (according to definition). So if something is alive, it's growth and development has to begin at some point, i.e. deductive reasoning tells me that the textbook is saying that life begins at conception. Regarding twinning and chimerism: The fact still remains that twinning and chimerism CANNOT POSSIBLY OCCUR without the egg FIRST being fertilized. Period.

So thank you for answering that. Personhood and rights are matters of philosophical and legal debate respectively and although I'd love to get into those, that would be getting off topic, now wouldn't it? Notice the words ""in my opinion"". That should clue you into realizing that what you said was opinion, not fact. Not provable and not supported by empirical evidence. In fact it is supported by your own subjective standards of morals. SUBJECTIVE. But once again, that's getting completely off topic of the original question ""When does life begin?"" not ""when does a 'person' become a 'person' and what are the woman's rights?"". The circle of life never really ends? What is this, The Lion King? Thanks for that, Elton John. However, if you follow that concept through to its full conclusion then a living human being is a person. If they procreate, they've then created a person. Since life is a perpetual ""circle"" then personhood has never been lost from the very first person until now, including every child in the womb. That is, if you follow that theory to its logical conclusion. Personhood would only be transferred without loss to a new life. Again, regarding twinning and chimerism... You're ignoring the fact that life had to exist in order for a twin or chimera to form. So whether you want to call it one and then later two (for twins) or two and then later one (for chimerism) is really a moot point. it has no relevance on when life begins, only the philosophical debate over personhood. And again, according to your theory of the ""circle of life"", it wouldn't matter anyway since life is a perpetual circle and personhood is merely transferred and not lost. Either way, the argument holds no water. Perhaps you're missing the key component about sperm and egg begin 'alive' but not human life. The sperm and egg or no more human life than any other individual cell within the human body that contains ONLY the one person's DNA. Reproduction is only possible in humans with two distinctly different sets of chromosomes...23 from the male and 23 from the female. And at that point of fertilization when those chromosomes combine, it becomes a separate and distinct individual human life that is no longer just the living cell of a human but the very unique (and measurably so through DNA analysis) human life. It is now separate from both its mother and father but shares some genotypes and phenotypes of both. Is it beyond you that a separate and distinct individual cannot come into being if the egg is not first fertilized by the sperm of a different human being? Hence, the beginning of life occurs at conception. You had it right when you said a sperm (or an egg for that matter) is a ""potential human being"". That is when there is a potential for that sperm or egg cell to unite and become an ""actual human being"". Once that happens, there's no doubt scientifically that it is now a totally new separate and distinct human life. The child in the womb does need nourishment from the mother. That is a fact. The scientific definition of life does not mean that it has to provide its own nourishment. In fact, there is no living human being that doesn't get its nourishment from somewhere else. A newborn is no less dependent on the mother for all its needs than a child in utero. The only difference is that one is out of the womb while the other is still in it. Both are completely and utterly dependent upon another human being (for some time) to continue to live. Why else would women have the capacity to lactate if not for the specific and solitary purpose of providing the child with nourishment, just like the umbilical cord's purpose. Again, complete independence from another living thing is not a requirement for the scientific definition of life. There is nothing more that a fetus/embryo/zygote/child in utero needs to become a human life, it already is a human life. It needs to continually exhibit all the defining characteristics of life to continue to be a human being (as we all do, no matter what stage in life we're in from the child in utero all the way to the elderly).

You can look at consciousness in either the physical (scientific) sense or the metaphysical (philosophical) sense. Now if you're referring to consciousness or life in the physical/scientific sense then yes, you absolutely can measure it. If you're talking in the metaphyscial sense, then you're right, you can't measure it. You can't prove it. I'm not even sure what solid empirical evidence you could even amass for it. What you call evidence to debate philosophical concepts is the same as me ""witnessing"" or providing ""testimony"" to why I believe God exists. I still can't prove it and my evidence probably isn't going to be received by someone who doesn't believe in the existence of God. Again, all subjective. And again, taking the subjectivity out of the argument since neither side can definitively prove, disprove or even provide substantial empirical evidence that supports one position or another, we have to fall back on what CAN definitively be proven. And in the case of when life begins, it can and has been definitively proven by science to begin at conception. It's nothing the same. There was ACTUAL evidence to conclude definitively within the scientific community the definition of life. Does anyone dispute that definition? And how did they arrive at that conclusion? By observing and measuring the world around them. Apparently they were able to measure and observe certain characteristics of things around them to conclude a single, uncontested definition of what is living and what is not... or to even arrive at a conclusion for that matter.

The original question is an impossible scenario through an impossible hypothetical. nobody could LOGICALLY arrive at a definitive answer to that. Does the end of life actually have to do with the beginning of life? After all, they are separate and distinct stages of the cycle of life (not to be confused with Elton John and Stonewall's ""circle of life"").

Thank you.","Stonewall","424456","Your original question was begging for a philosophical argument. There is no debate on whether a zygote, a sperm, or any of those things are alive or not. They are. But that is completely irrelevant to your position. I think anybody who reads the OP understands that you are trying to say a person is there at conception. You see, you can't claim the term 'person' is purely philosophical and then demand empirical evidence proving something to be a person. It may not be supported by anything other than opinion, but I think it is reasonable to expect a human being to be able to survive outside the womb. There you go again, throwing around the word 'person.' You could also say that since every human who reproduces is an adult that they create an adult. (I realize young girls can get pregnant, but typing 'post pubescent' or 'sexually mature' didn't have the same ring.) You're begging the question... LIFE is the perpetual circle. Not personhood. Human life =/= human being. Also, I should have said 'cycle' not circle, but you got the point. If I was really wanting to reference Elton, I would have picked a better song. I'm not ignoring anything. Just because the zygote must be alive doesn't make it a person. Sperm certainly are human life, just not human beings. My hair, along with every other cell in my body, also has 46 chromosomes, just like the zygote. Having DNA does not a person make. I get the point that it is different than a sperm or egg, and that it is a unique organism, but again, that doesn't make it a person. And if it isn't a person yet, it isn't relevant. Also can't happen until the sperm or egg are created. Or until the parents have sex. The life of the components are already alive before conception. But yeah, when the zygote is created, it is definitely the beginning of that zygote's life. A totally new, separate, and distinct human zygote, yes. A human being, no. I never said anybody was truly independent, and I never said personal independence was a requirement for personhood. I was simply stating that it has to stay inside the mother and feed in order to develop from a cell to a human being. Although I didn't mention it there, though, I would argue that to be considered a person, the organism would have to be able to survive outside the mother's body, though. Yeah, all it needs is time, the right environment, and the right nutrients. Same as a plant seed. The part I bolded confuses me a bit as to what you mean. Are you conceding that a zygote isn't yet a human being, or are you using the terms 'human life' and 'human beings' interchangeably.

"02-21-2011","15035",4,"Easyrider","424469","Funny how if you leave the zygote alone it always produces a human beling. But there's more to it than that. What does the Bible say about abortion? And if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so that she has a miscarriage, yet there is no further injury, he shall surely be fined as the womans husband may demand of him; and he shall pay as the judges decide. But if there is further injury, then you shall appoint as a penalty life for life. (Exodus 21:22-23) Straight from the Jewish Torah, God immediately affirms the value of human life in a mothers womb.

Only if it is in the womb and nourished for a long period of time does it turn into a human. And as Sigma stated, 1/3 of the time an egg is fertilized, nature permorms its own abortion... I'm glad you have admitted that a zygote isn't a human being yet, though. As for the bible verse, thanks. It confirms that even the God of the bible doesn't consider a fetus a human being. The punishment for murder is death. The punishment for causing a miscarriage against a woman's will is to pay a fine (that the husband determines). Of course an abortion against a woman's will would be horrible. You can easily see, however, that if the husband and wife decided to have an abortion, the husband would not demand the doctor pay a fine at all. I'm curious why you would bring up a bible verse that doesn't support your position at all... Again, it clearly states that an unwanted miscarriage is punishable by a fine as the husband sees fit, but if the woman is also hurt or killed, then it is a life for a life.","when-life-begins","03:32 PM","abortion-debates","56"

So what you say is just not true. You are getting hung up on fertilized eggs. This is one day of the embryonic time. It is silly to argue in these terms because no one is getting an abortion as they do not know they are pregnant. Let's stick with when 99% of abortions take place which is 4 weeks after fertilization (6 weeks pregnant) to 14 weeks after fertilization (16 weeks pregnant). From a strictly biological perspective 100% of abortions occur when a unique human being is developing. No, they are human beings no matter how much you argue otherwise. There is a unique set of DNA with 23 pairs of chromosomes. Biologically they are the exact same as you which should be obvious as human beings don't change species. One or two!? Heart beating, brain activity, all major organs created, hands, feet, fingernails, eyes, eyelids...what more do you want? My position as it relates to this conversation is that an unborn human enjoys the same inherent rights as a born human. Are you asking if there are exceptions to the rights depending on ""born"" status?","pappillion001","472385"," For the purpose used the analogy was fine. It doesn't work for you just as making a distinction between the stages of development isn't working for you. I am not hung up on what a baby is for you, nor am suggesting one of us doesn't know English. It goes back to my statement about at what point is does sperm and egg equal person. For you it is sometime minutes maybe days after. I understand your reasoning and don't necessarily disagree, but think while it has no functional organs, no life sustaining systems and no nerve reception and there exists a conflict between a woman's right to her person and the right of the baby to its life I lean towards the woman. Once it those things develop then it has a right to its life. While as far as you are concerned a baby is a baby. In a broad sense yes, but in this instance since I at least am dealing with the developmental stages that a person goed through to become a person. Can't what? We try and side with the what is just and/or fair and that does not prohibit harm being done. I could argue the mother will be harmed as well. You will come back with but she will still be alive. Which leads to my other point of making life altering choices for people you have not the slightest idea of what their circumstances are. A child could be the greatest thing ever for her or condemn her to a life one step above death. You say it is between two people one born and one not, but you insert yourself in the situation just long enough to impose your sense of morality on her and then woosh you are gone leaving her to deal with what you have decided for the both of them. I don't think so Weeks 4 and 5 -1/4 inch long: Here we see the beginnings of the vertebra, the lower jaw, the larynx (""voice box""), and the rudiments of the ear and eye.

Finish the roof, Put up the drywall it's a house in that it would provide shelter and has a familiar shape, but nobody really thinks of it as a house yet. Why? Because it is not finished. There is a point when you get close enough that it becomes habitable, which is a typical point in the construction where it can be called a house. I am hung up on it because it is significant.

You don't have to agree with me but if you can't understand my position then we will continue to go around in circles. Seriously, your argument is you are right because you said so I have answered this in my responses above. No need to do so again. So abortion under any circumstances is murder. Mother should face criminal prosecution and doctor as accessory. Since it would be premeditated and the nature in which committed, maybe get a death penalty case. While only representing a small number of pregnancies do you have any thoughts on the incest, rape and deformed cases? How about the 12 - 17 year old single moms? The older women who did use birth control well I am sure there is a silver lining in there somewhere. I understand your position and don't think it a bad one. I just think forcing someone to be a parent does not sit within the duties or obligations we have towards each other. Nobody is being forced, unless they are a minor and then Mom and/or Dad decide, but for the most part the woman is the only one capable of deciding for herself what will be best for her.","when-life-begins","02:50 AM","abortion-debates","131"

More to your point, there are no abortions (in the sense we are talking about) of a fertilized egg so to talk about it is like me assuming all abortions happen 3 minutes before birth. It's right because there is no scientific distinction between human being and human embryo. An embryo is of the species homo sapiens and is a unique entity. There is literally no argument here. I'm fine arguing against the point that a person is different from a human being but to say the embryo is not a human being is just ignoring basic science and really I can't do much about that. Obviously abortion is currently not considered murder, however, in many states someone else killing the unborn baby would be considered murder. As for what I think the criminal penalties should be, I really don't wish to argue that at this point as it isn't relevant to my point.

Is this really your understanding of the life of a butterfly? That it is both an evolutionary miracle as well as a having the power of God to resurrect itself? They are only born once and once they die they stay dead and they remain the same species. There may be a distinction got each phase of a butterfly's life cycle, but their species classification remains the same. For my analogy compare that each go through distinct periods of development in which drastic changes occur. I did understand you. My arguement was at what point does one become either in possession of rights? Remember I said it often becomes a punishment for immoral behavior. And when she is not responsible? The mother didn't choose to become pregnant. if she had she wouldn't want an abortion. Hence the importance of when does it become a person, what constitutes life? One can not enslave the other either. I said Except you are comparing what I am to what it might be. When abortion is legal it is not a baby that is viable with a complete set of working organs and systems. That comes later at about the time abortion is mo longer legal. You said By the fourth week (about the time you realize you are pregnant) the baby has all major organs and a heart beat. So what you say is just not true. It is a fact a heart resting outside the body is not considered to be functional. Since the organs that it would be sending blood to are also incomplete this is not much of a problem. By comparison without my organs, skin, skeleton oxygen or nervous system including a brain I doubt I would be thriving because I would be dead. So it is not the same as me, it has some organs, non of which are complete, but yes the heart beats. Even though it it didn't it wouldn't make much of a difference. You implied at 4 weeks its a little person. . That is what I said What are you talking about? I said DNA is like the blue prints for a house. They are instructions not what is made by their execution. Not disputing that A tree sapling looks like a miniature tree. Everything it needs to survive it has. At 4 weeks an an embryo has lumps that will later be organs, but at 4 weeks they are blobs of cells. It looks nothing like a human, but more importantly it cannot survive outside of the womb. At 4 weeks it may not survive inside the womb. So yes at some point my house analogy will no longer apply, about the time the house would be finished be when the baby is born. Then each is fully and accurately described using the terms baby and house. First red flag. Science people don't give the same thing two names. If it has two names its because it isn't one thing. Now we can call them widgets for all I care I am not making a distinction to try and confuse the issue. I do so because words have meaning and both overt and subtle. You insist it is a human being, even though for this part of the discussion that is to broad a description. A human being includes adults, teens, toddlers, infants, seniors and a number of others that are not a part of what we are talking about. We both know this, but while yes they can be called human beings embryo and fetus are more accurate. It is easier even if subconsciously to defend a human being than an embryo. You are right there should be no argument, but I think it important that we have the same understanding of certain words. As you can see below science does make a distinction and that distinction happens to be the development of those organ and systems I stated earlier. Honestly, I don't make this stuff up to try and sneak something by. Science Dictionary embryo (m'br-') Pronunciation Key An animal in its earliest stage of development, before all the major body structures are represented. In humans, the embryonic stage lasts through the first eight weeks of pregnancy. In humans, other placental mammals, and other viviparous animals, young born as embryos cannot thrive. In marsupials, the young are born during the embryonic stage and complete their development outside the uterus, attached to a teat within the mother's pouch. Obviously abortion is currently not considered murder, however, in many states someone else killing the unborn baby would be considered murder. As for what I think the criminal penalties should be, I really don't wish to argue that at this point as it isn't relevant to my point. Science Dictionary fetus (f'ts) Pronunciation Key The unborn offspring of a mammal at the later stages of its development, especially a human from eight weeks after fertilization to its birth. In a fetus, all major body organs are present. I don't think abortion should be a form of birth control. I don't support late term abortions unless there is a some health concern either to mother or child. I think there is a brief period the least amount of harm, not none, is done that will permit a woman to decide what the rest of her life will be like. There are very few things that carry life long consequences. Marriage and career can but not like becoming a parent especially for a young unwed woman. Statistically she is more likely to live at or below poverty, if she was in school she likely will not complete it for a number of years if at all. She will often been looked upon with pity or as a reason someone else can be thankful they are not her. Most employers will not appreciate her needs with regards to the care of the child. She is likely to suffer from lower self esteem and depression. Many opportunities will no longer be available to her. Her male child has a good chance to have legal problems and not finish high school. Her female child is less likely to have legal problems, but more than makes up for that with a higher chance of becoming pregnant in her teens. She will likely rely on day care or a public school system to provide guidance and teaching of basic social skills as she will need to provide for both their needs. The guidance will most likely some from peers who will have more influence than the overworked, under qualified teacher at the barely adequate school they are likely to attend. This of course this is not every case and the pitfalls are not all or none. A women may face none of them or just one or two or all. But odds are that to some degree that is what her life will look like. I don't think our society is improved or or made better by this. I don't think I have the right to impose this life or anything that resembles it on another person. When you say you are for protecting a human being from being harmed by another you are assuming that human wants you to do so and the harm being prevented outweighs the harm that prevention will cause. I know there is no way to ask and in such cases we error to the side of caution, but it doesn't change the fact that it is a belief that is being used to invalidate the very real rights of the woman as well as impose obligations upon her against her will. In some instances this is only made harsher by the fact that she became pregnant either against her will or despite taking precautions. In principal I agree with you. It just reality adds shades of grey to your black or white scenario and it is that gray that pushes me the other direction at this point.

Maybe not, but she is responsible for the baby being in the current situation. Like I keep saying, there is no difference between person and human being so to be it is not an important question. As for enslaving, it is not for the same reasons described above. It actually is functional. There is a circulatory system working as this has to be the first thing working. The other organs are formed but not needed so they don't function. Your lungs aren't needed until after birth but it doesn't seem like you feel a baby in the third trimester is not a person. Fetal development: The first trimester - MayoClinic.com It is. What you look like doesn't make you a person or not. I know some pretty ugly looking people but I'm not about to say they aren't people. At works weeks it doesn't have lumps..it has the organs, at 4 weeks the heart is the only one really used (set aside skin for now). You could identify specific organ tissue if you really wanted to. Just curious, does what the baby look like matter to you? So if he/she looks like a human would that be the point where you say it is a person? Also, from what I understand 40% of abortions happen after 9 weeks. 26% 9-12 weeks. So we are on the same page that a human embryo is also a human being in the same sense a human child is also a human being? In terms of abortion this is all irrelevant to me. People like Simone will chime in and say I'm cold but the sad story of a women struggling doesn't negate, in my mind, that she want's to kill someone. In my mind it would be this same story and therefore she wants to toss her 1 week old baby into the trash. Naturally the sympathy for the woman goes away in that scenario. I actually know a number of people that had an abortion...I suspect we all do...there is not one instance where the persons circumstances were as you describe. Every story is ""oh sh*t, I'm pregnant! Well I'm still in college and want to finish up so I'm getting an abortion"". After you work in a hospital for awhile you also see the other side of this coin...the couple that comes in, the women is bleeding everywhere, she has lost her kid after trying for years to get pregnant. Those really are the two scenarios you see most often...at the hospital anyway. Now, if we want to talk about poverty and what we should do to help, I'm all for it. Yes. We assume life as a society and I'm comfortable with that. I don't want to have to tell the fireman that I want to be saved from the fire. It certainly isn't as easy as I make it sound on these forums, I'll grant you that. However, if you come to the realization that a person and human being are the same the answer in 99% of the cases is clear. Those 1% are a little harder to deal with just like the 1% of anything in life (99% of the time you wouldn't kill someone but what if someone breaks in....etc...those kinds of situations).","when-life-begins","12:30 PM","abortion-debates","136"

This isn't a great example but if you are responsible for pet sitting a cat it would be wrong for you to just walk away in the middle of the cat owners vacation leaving the cat to die. In terms of a pregnancy, the unborn child had no choice in being in their current situation as the parents put them in that situation. If you assume for a minute that the unborn child is a person would you argue the mother could abort because she doesn't want to take responsibility for the remainder of the pregnancy? Maybe not, but she is responsible for the baby being in the current situation. It actually is functional. There is a circulatory system working as this has to be the first thing working. The other organs are formed but not needed so they don't function. Your lungs aren't needed until after birth but it doesn't seem like you feel a baby in the third trimester is not a person. At works weeks it doesn't have lumps..it has the organs, at 4 weeks the heart is the only one really used (set aside skin for now). You could identify specific organ tissue if you really wanted to. Just curious, does what the baby look like matter to you? So if he/she looks like a human would that be the point where you say it is a person? Also, from what I understand 40% of abortions happen after 9 weeks. 26% 9-12 weeks. So we are on the same page that a human embryo is also a human being in the same sense a human child is also a human being? In terms of abortion this is all irrelevant to me. People like Simone will chime in and say I'm cold but the sad story of a women struggling doesn't negate, in my mind, that she want's to kill someone. In my mind it would be this same story and therefore she wants to toss her 1 week old baby into the trash. Naturally the sympathy for the woman goes away in that scenario. I actually know a number of people that had an abortion...I suspect we all do...there is not one instance where the persons circumstances were as you describe. Every story is ""oh sh*t, I'm pregnant! Well I'm still in college and want to finish up so I'm getting an abortion"". After you work in a hospital for awhile you also see the other side of this coin...the couple that comes in, the women is bleeding everywhere, she has lost her kid after trying for years to get pregnant. Those really are the two scenarios you see most often...at the hospital anyway. Yes. We assume life as a society and I'm comfortable with that. I don't want to have to tell the fireman that I want to be saved from the fire. It certainly isn't as easy as I make it sound on these forums, I'll grant you that. However, if you come to the realization that a person and human being are the same the answer in 99% of the cases is clear. Those 1% are a little harder to deal with just like the 1% of anything in life (99% of the time you wouldn't kill someone but what if someone breaks in....etc...those kinds of situations).","pappillion001","472533","Nice recovery . There is a theory (as in this one) which was retracted as scientifically unsupportable from another journal, but I agree it is an interesting approach to what is a strange process. The comparison was not supposed to highlight the specific stages of development, but that there are stages where the initial entity becomes something different while still under the broader definition of what it is. Which is technically where we disagree. The question of when is existence recognized as having a right superior to the mother's? When if ever can that right be not recognized? If there is a 50/50 chance the mother, child or both may die if carried to term you have a problem that your position is unable to address. If the mother is in accident where she can be kept alive through life support, but cannot be given anything for pain as it would kill the child is another problem your position is unable to deal with. My point is not to portray these as representative of the typical scenario, they are not, but to point out things are not black and white. Situations like these and ones where the dilemma raises similar issues. If your position can be shown to not be applicable in every case then you must establish under what circumstances it is applicable and when it is not? The child is a threat to the mother if she carries to term or the child carries a genetic disease that puts life expectancy at 5 years tops. Is she irresponsible in terminating the pregnancy? Is she even allowed to? Are these the consequences the child is now responsible for? It may have had no choice in being there, but you accept on its behalf the responsibility for keeping it there. Yes it would be wrong and yes it is not a very good example. You are comparing a conscience decision of accepting a responsibility that has if any only short term and insignificant consequences that you would have been aware of prior. The acceptance is made without emotional or physical influences nor is there reliance on any third party involvement. (birth control) And when the mother did so against her will? When the mother is unable to understand these consequences and/or is coerced? (Rape, incest, drug use, mental incapacity, minors) I don't have to assume if it makes it easier that is what I am saying. There is a period where that group of cells that otherwise would grow into a child most likely a copy of any one of millions currently running around were it allowed to fully develop is a group of cells that can be prevented from further development prior to its ability to understand, comprehend or feel anything. You can phrase it as she just doesn't want the responsibility discounting what may be real valid concerns to the one who would have to deal with them, but should she accept it. Keep in mind the age group with the most unwanted pregnancies is under 18. If you want to have the stats, it is a long read though and uses info from the 90's, but is the largest and most complete research on the subject go here Guttmacher Institute: Home Page Except when she is not or are you suggesting becoming pregnant is always the responsibility of the women? The heart is outside the body. Where in everyday life does one keep their heart outside of their body? You seem to suggest that the organs are ready to go just waiting to be born so they can be used in the manner they were made for. It takes time for them to grow. How can they be functional when the brain and spinal column are still forming as well as the nerves that would control them or the pathways that connect them? At 9 months all of these have developed. That is why birth occurs. That is why at 4 weeks it is not viable outside the womb even with life support systems, it has not yet developed enough to survive. If something costs 1.00 and you have .99 cents you don't have the 1.00. You have a handful of pennies, you will have a dollar when you get another penny, but at that moment you do not have a dollar. You continue to attribute the future to the present. Everybody knows what it will be, but this is about what it is. It doesn't. You started us down the path of physical appearance and this is where it ended up. I get 88% within the first 12 weeks. I have to make a distinction because allow for abortion to occur within a certain time frame or under certain circumstances. There must be some way to distinguish one from the other.

Who has less compassion the one who with the thumb up who says let it live or the one with the thumb down who says let it die? It is never easy and there are always worst case scenarios.

Let me know if you really wanted a response to something. That's fine but I'd argue this is a moot point. No one cares about adult vs child in terms of ""being a person"" so why fetus vs adult? You ask about extremes that make up less than 1% of what we are talking about. While I'm ok with this you have to understand that the same kind of extremes can be used in just about everything. A general rule you might have is that you shouldn't kill a born person (I say born so you know what I'm talking about). But what about a situation where you are rock climbing and your friend is attached to you. They slip and based upon previous knowledge you know that if you cut the rope and they fall they will have a 25% chance of survival while you will be fine. If you don't cut you both fall with a 25% chance of survival each. So what do you do? That's not always an easy answer but I do know that 99.99% of the circumstances will lead to the answer ""do not kill my friend"". The same thing applies to abortion. I may not have an answer for every scenario but I do know the answer for 99.99% of the scenarios. I don't need to argue the remaining extreme scenarios to prove my ""do not kill a born person"" moral. Punish the person responsible. The baby is still not responsible for being in that situation and shouldn't be punished to death for it. I'm confused in what you are saying. I'm more or less asking what your criteria is. In other words, if it isn't simply being a human being, what is it and how is that not arbitrary? Physically, yes. It is currently impossible for any other woman or any man to assume that responsibility. In terms of any financial impact or other impact outside of the actual development it is the responsibility of the persons who created the baby. In fact, you could argue the financial responsibility rests more with the father as the woman, at some point, may not be able to perform the duties that provide her with a way to live. I think dead beat dads should face stiffer penalties than what is currently on the books. This is misleading. It is not necessarily outside the embryo, merely no rib cage as formed around it so it looks like a protrudes from the body. It's actually a medical condition if you are born like this and people have been born like this. Either way, this is at 4 weeks and by week 6 this no longer is the case. I don't see while survival has anything to do with it. A 1 day old baby can't survive without help from someone else. The organs are formed and they are growing from that point on. I am not implying they are being used, they aren't...no reason for them to be. There is, however, a functioning and used brain and heart as those are needed. The last one is always the lungs which aren't used at all until birth. To be frank, I think viability is about the dumbest concept I've heard (I realize it has been around awhile). A baby can't survive at 1 day on their own so why does location change the definition of viability? I've never really gotten a reasonable answer from anyone on that. I'm not sure what you are asking and how it relates to what I said. Please clarify But this gets back to my point of identifying the parties involved. IF we are talking about one person, I'd agree. It is my view that two persons exists each with rights and therefore one may not make a decision to kill the other...in general.

Although the DOI says unalienable, in practice we have inalienable rights. In my view Natural Rights are an attempt to take legal and moral rights and place them in an objective position. That there is no accepted list of what rights are and are not included and the lack of any type of enforcement mechanism make them perfect for philosophy and political science majors to write about. If we assume for the debate that they exist and are unalienable the fetus using her body as life support would have a right to exist, but would not have the right to make the mother provide a means to do so. You can blame her or say she is now responsible or that consent was implied by her actions, but she has the right to her body and to make her carry to term would violate her rights. In this scenario there are no duties or moral responsibilities that can infringe on her rights. It could even be argued that the fetus can not have a right to exist because that right can only come from an act that violates the rights of the mother. You probably didn't even get this far before you started responding. I will try and make this brief If we assume the rights are inalienable then we are at where we are at. Rights are granted, they can nullified, forfeited or modified. There exists a system of coercion to compel people to respect others rights all of which is influenced and subject to the prevailing degree of morality and desire of the public. Now she still has a right to her person. The embryo is now though not necessarily in possession of the right to life simply because it exists. That is granted and where you and I are at an impasse. I notice you left out half of the paragraph that the above was in response to and was relevent I thought given the direction this went. Reproductive medicine currently will create several unique human beings place them in a womb knowing that that only one is the the most likely number to survive if any do. Research is done to advance our medical knowledge in some cases using these unique humans as lab rats. Why is this acceptable and morally tolerable? But really in a philosophical sense why does she have the responsibility if she was put into this position or even if she did so willingly. You say she has an obligation she says she does not. Your emotions based on life experience and cultural values is what you believe gives you the right to compel her to conform to your concept of right and wrong. If you came home and there was a baby on your doorstep with a note saying name is Bob doesn't like carrots raise him well. You would not think it is now your obligation to take care of it. She should not be the scape goat just because she is convenient. It can't exist without imposing undesirable obligations on her. Typically when one party infringes on the rights of another the damaged party is granted some form of relief. Legally benefiting from violating the rights of another regardless of fault or intention is not rewarded. Maybe the presentation was extreme but the concept is valid. You have a set of values that are important to you. You have decided that at least on this issue that what you believe and to the degree you believe it is the minimum that every person should be subject to. Their belief may be different, but that is just something they will need to learn to deal with. For the most part circumstances and reasons are unfortunate and may be important to them, but that should have been a consideration before she had sex because she doesn't have a choice anymore. But the pursuit of happiness is in the DOI. Now the question becomes does she have a duty to provide life support and care that is harmful to her (philosophically speaking not necessarily physical)? Using rights derived from what exists in nature there is plenty of evidence that she has no obligation at all. The existence of a caregiver is meaningless. They aren't trying to establish the need for a babysitter. A reasonable point in development was needed for legal clarification, You may disagree that there was a need but that doesn't change that it was. Since being alive is an integral part of having and needing rights the point at which a person can actually be alive seemed a good idea. That is also why it is relevant. Just like kids the dead don't have the same set of rights as living adults.

You probably didn't even get this far before you started responding. Reproductive medicine currently will create several unique human beings place them in a womb knowing that that only one is the the most likely number to survive if any do. Research is done to advance our medical knowledge in some cases using these unique humans as lab rats. Why is this acceptable and morally tolerable? But really in a philosophical sense why does she have the responsibility if she was put into this position or even if she did so willingly. You say she has an obligation she says she does not. Your emotions based on life experience and cultural values is what you believe gives you the right to compel her to conform to your concept of right and wrong.

If you aren't required to provide for another in the womb you aren't required to provide for another outside the womb. You called that one right! Ha. I honestly don't know much about this so I'm not sure I'm the best person to comment. And this isn't something new...societies generally work that way. We dictate morals in a society and those who don't approve can either leave or suffer the consequences for breaking them. Yes I do. If I slam the door and let the baby die I failed in my moral duties. Naturally I would call the police in this kind of situation. Different from a born child how? And ""you can put it up for adoption"" is not an acceptable answer. This gets back to fault and responsibility. I think you and I can both agree that the unborn baby has absolutely no fault in being in the current situation he or she is in. The fault is almost always with the mother and father and in the case of rape with the father. Fault doesn't necessarily mean they meant for it to happen. If you accidentally slam into the back of another car you are at fault but that doesn't mean you meant it to happen. I'd argue you can remove rights for someone at fault. So 90+% of the time we are talking about a fault of the mother and father and therefore I think a right of self is easily overrode by a right to life of the unborn who is at no fault and can only survive in the womb of the mother. The remaining scenarios, mainly rape, are no fault of the mother or unborn. At this point you have to decide which right prevails. I argue life trumps in this case. It is very meaningful. I here ""viability"" all the time but the term is useless. Ability to live outside the womb with a caregiver versus inside the womb with a caregiver is a worthless distinction in the abortion debate. I say this because the argument has always been the woman has no obligation to provide care. So when the baby is outside the womb you can't pretend that argument never existed. It literally reads like this: ""A woman doesn't have the obligation to provide care while the unborn is inside the womb because the unborn cannot survive outside the womb but a woman does have an obligation to provide care for a born child who survive outside the womb but only with the care of another"". This implies that survival for a brief period of time (aka ability to breath) outside the womb is relevant to obligation to provide care but I can't for the life of me figure out how it remotely relates.","when-life-begins","10:13 AM","abortion-debates","152"

Granted your position leaves no room for compromise, which only makes it that much more difficult, but the current system I think is about as fair as possible.

In this case The woman had a right before the child existed. A right can not void another so the child can not have its right until by doing so it does not violate the mother's right. Not quit.

Frankly I don't have to know to hold my position. I'm merely saying that a human being has a right to life same as any other human being and there is no difference between person and human being. Well, I'm not breaking any of the rules so I'm not suffering for doing so nor am I leaving. Well, the police is an option we currently have. Should no one be able to take care of the baby..say I'm on an island and the next boat comes in 18 years...then yes, I'd have a moral obligation/duty to take care of the kid. I'm glad you brought this up though. People (not necessarily you) tend to change their stance on something when more options exist. So it's kind of like saying ""I support this until it's too hard"". I don't think rights of someone should depend on the difficultly of a situation. This is why the emotional arguments related to a pregnancy are meaningless in terms of my stance on abortion. I'm not sure this answer makes sense to me. You stated ""It can't exist without imposing undesirable obligations on her."" to which I responded that this is the same with a born child so what is the difference. Are you saying there is an implied acceptance of responsibility at the time of birth? I wasn't going to bring this up but you keep referring to inalienable vs unalienable. Those are actually the same word . So I'm going to try and answer but let me know if I misunderstood your statement. Rights are tricky and a society has to always decide how and when rights can be removed. This, of course, happens after deciding what rights exist...both natural and society created. Inalienable rights is a fine term but it means ""cannot be taken away from another"". I'd argue that common ""inalienable"" rights cannot be taken away by another unless there without proper due process (as in a crime took place, you are at fault, and we have a proper way of dealing with such a crime). I'd say someone can give up a right through actions of their own. While not an inalienable right, you can give up your right to a jury trial even if this causes great harm to you in the future. So for the sake of argument lets assume an inalienable right exists for the child (right to life) and the mother (right to oneself). In all instances other than rape the mother and father engaged in an act that can result, and this isn't exactly unknown, in another human being being forced into a position of only being able to survive with the help of the mother. In this case the mother (and father as described earlier) gave up her right to self by engaging in an act where the possible consequences are known. The unborn child did not do any action that took a right away nor do any action that gave up a right. You therefore cannot take a right away via due process nor did the unborn child give up their right to life. As such, the right to life cannot be taken away even if the mother wishes to regain her right to self. In the case of rape the same thing applies on the father took away a right. Therefore the only one that can be punished by removing a right is the father. why not inside the womb? I'd argue that you don't have a choice to decline should another option not exist. If adoption is not available you still have an obligation in my opinion.","when-life-begins","12:49 PM","abortion-debates","157"

Then you are saying the fertilized egg is a person. I don't see how you can make your position work any other way. I know I was kust giving you a hard time for your statement. Usually a take or leave it statement is offered by the person with the benefit so when you said it considering laws are currently not as you would like I couldn't resist. I am not sure get this, I think from the perspective of placing a burden on someone it matters. I think that is part of the basis for labor laws as an example. Yes. Once a person accepts the responsibility they have the obligation to provide reasonable care and protection. It is ok I was a little confused myself at first, which is why when I first mentioned it I tried to explain it a little. For the most part the two words carry almost the same meaning and today have become interchangeable with a leaning towards inalienable. This is for a reason (at least I speculate it is) The Declaration of Independence uses the word unalienable to describe the self evident rights given by our creator. Which in context would make sense. These rights are incapable of alienation meaning they can not be taken or given away. Inalienable rights are not subject to alienation meaning someone can't compel you to give them up, but you may be able to voluntarily do so or forfeit them. As I described from a legal position dealing with criminals this may run into problems if they have a right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that cannot be infringed upon by the government who has a duty to protect the tights of its citizens. Going to jail would impair those rights. For the DOI it was important to establish that the people had something to compete with the Divine Right of Kings, but it creates a problem trying to enforce justice. if we look at Bouviers Law Dictionary (A.D. 1856) well see: INALIENABLE. A word denoting the condition of those things the property in which cannot be lawfully transferred from one person to another. Public highways and rivers are inalienable. There are also many rights which are inalienable, as the rights of liberty or of speech. UNALIENABLE. Incapable of being transferred. Things which are not in commerce, as, public roads, are in their nature unalienable. Some things are unalienable in consequence of particular provisions of the law forbidding their sale or transfer; as, pensions granted by the government. The natural rights of life and liberty are unalienable. Unalienable vs. Inalienable | Adask's law I did sort of explain this in my earlier posts, but I understand how with most sites one would use as a reference the distinction is not made or not emphasized so would lead you to think there is no difference. But moving on, the factor important here I believe is when does the right to life exist. Do you have a problem with the idea of taking someone off life support? It isn't considered murder, but if you can sustain your own life, meaning your body functions even if you are unable to feed yourself or move that person may not end their life even if they want to. This is really no different. If we say a fertilized egg is a human with rights how do we justify artificial reproductive science. Most women are like Octomom, but only one or two actually make it to develop and be born. In that case we are making extra people to better her odds. Legally though the child has no rights. The 14th amendment establishes rights are for citizens born or naturalized within the US. Can you imagine the immigration nightmare if if the fertilized egg is recognized as a citizen and therefore protected under the 14th?","when-life-begins","01:48 AM","abortion-debates","158"

[Dr. John Eppig, Senior Staff Scientist, Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine) and Member of the NIH Human Embryo Research Panel -- Panel Transcript, February 2, 1994, p. 31] ""The development of a human begins with fertilization, a process by which theXspermatozoonXfrom the male and theXoocyteXfrom the female unite to give rise to a new organism, theXzygote."" [Sadler, T.W.XLangman's Medical Embryology. 7th edition. Baltimore: Williams & Wilkins 1995, p. 3] ""The question came up of what is an embryo, when does an embryo exist, when does it occur. I think, as you know, that in development, life is a continuum.... But I think one of the useful definitions that has come out, especially from Germany, has been the stage at which these two nuclei [from sperm and egg] come together and the membranes between the two break down."" [Jonathan Van Blerkom of University of Colorado, expert witness on human embryology before the NIH Human Embryo Research Panel -- Panel Transcript, February 2, 1994, p. 63] ""Zygote. This cell, formed by the union of an ovum and a sperm (Gr.Xzyg tos, yoked together), represents theXbeginning of a human being. The common expression 'fertilized ovum' refers to the zygote."" [Moore, Keith L. and Persaud, T.V.N.XBefore We Are Born: Essentials of Embryology and Birth Defects. 4th edition. Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders Company, 1993, p. 1] ""The chromosomes of the oocyte and sperm are...respectively enclosed withinXfemaleXandXmaleXpronuclei. These pronuclei fuse with each other to produce the single, diploid, 2N nucleus of the fertilizedXzygote. This moment of zygote formation may be taken as the beginning or zero time point of embryonic development."" [Larsen, William J.XHuman Embryology. 2nd edition. New York: Churchill Livingstone, 1997, p. 17] ""Although life is a continuous process, fertilization is a critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed.... The combination of 23 chromosomes present in each pronucleus results in 46 chromosomes in theXzygote. Thus the diploid number is restored and the embryonic genome is formed. The embryo now exists as a genetic unity."" [O'Rahilly, Ronan and Mller, Fabiola.XHuman Embryology & Teratology. 2nd edition. New York: Wiley-Liss, 1996, pp. 8, 29. This textbook lists ""pre-embryo"" among ""discarded and replaced terms"" in modern embryology, describing it as ""ill-defined and inaccurate"" (p. 12}] ""Almost all higher animals start their lives from a single cell, the fertilized ovum (zygote)... The time of fertilization represents the starting point in the life history, or ontogeny, of the individual."" [Carlson, Bruce M.XPatten's Foundations of Embryology. 6th edition. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1996, p. 3] ""[A]nimal biologists use the termXembryoXto describe the single cell stage, the two-cell stage, and all subsequent stages up until a time when recognizable humanlike limbs and facial features begin to appear between six to eight weeks after fertilization.... ""[A] number of specialists working in the field of human reproduction have suggested that we stop using the wordXembryoXto describe the developing entity that exists for the first two weeks after fertilization. In its place, they proposed the termXpre-embryo.... ""I'll let you in on a secret. The term pre-embryo has been embraced wholeheartedly by IVF practitioners for reasons that are political, not scientific. The new term is used to provide the illusion that there is something profoundly different between what we nonmedical biologists still call a six-day-old embryo and what we and everyone else call a sixteen-day-old embryo. ""The term pre-embryo is useful in the political arena -- where decisions are made about whether to allow early embryo (now called pre-embryo) experimentation -- as well as in the confines of a doctor's office, where it can be used to allay moral concerns that might be expressed by IVF patients. 'Don't worry,' a doctor might say, 'it's only pre-embryos that we're manipulating or freezing. They won't turn into real human embryos until after we've put them back into your body.'""

You are wrong, life begins before conception all the way back to when the first self replicating molecule made a copy of it self, I do not believe that a fetus is a person however. Before a baby is born (and for sometime after that) it does not have the complex thought processes that are required to make it a person, in fact that hamburger you ate for lunch had a more developed consciousness then a baby has.
