It's a fair response. What is human life is different than asking what makes a human being. We could probably keep a brainless body alive for some time, but it wouldn't be what people would generally think of as a human individual, a human being, a person.
Turn No:3
amirsdaddy:
Is it? Scientifically it's not. What you're talking about is a philosophical and religious debate. And although I won't discredit philosophy, it's not a science, nor can it be proven. I can give you proof that a fertilized egg is a human life by the standards of science (we can argue semantics all day but you can't refute that it is by definition "life"). But you can't provide a single shred of proof that a fetus, unborn child or whatever you prefer to call it, isn't a person, a human being or a human life... not from a philosophical standpoint or any other.
Turn No:4
Sigma:
Then I can certainly prove that the fetus is not a person, since 'person' is a legal construct (not a biological one) and I can point to the relevant legal precedents that outline the subject in question showing the boundaries of 'personhood' begin at birth. Q.E.D Of course, that ignores the crux of the question: namely, is the fetus a person in the philosophical sense.
Turn No:5
amirsdaddy:
Like I said, whatever you prefer to call it... they are one and the same. Can you deny that a fetus is a human life? I suppose YOU could, but that would be disregarding science as it's already been shown conclusively that it is, in fact, a human life. Technically the crux of THIS question on this post was "When does life begin?" There was nothing about the philosophical discussion of person or personhood. So, can you prove that a fetus is NOT a "person" in the philosophical sense?
Turn No:6
Sigma:
I assumed this had relevance to the abortion discussion. Yes, the fetus is alive. If we agree on some basic tenets, certainly.
Turn No:7
amirsdaddy:
It does. I thought I'd define the beginning of human life. As you can see, many people are still confused about whether or not a fetus is a human life. Please, do go on...
Turn No:8
Sigma:
Since you've agreed it is as alive as an individual organ is alive (human life at that), I don't think you gained much. I start with a hypothetical. If we remove the brain of an adult and put it in a jar while keeping both the brain and body alive and separate, would you agree that it is rational to say the 'person' is in the jar? Meaning that if you killed the brain it is rational to say the individual would die, while if you killed the body the individual would continue to live. This hypothetical is to determine, loosely, what the definition of a person would be.
Turn No:9
amirsdaddy:
Wow, you have completely missed that entire discussion that just took place, didn't you? I don't know how many times I can say the same thing a different way for you to understand. I tell you what, go enroll in a biology class at your local college. Ok, so let me get this straight... your argument to "prove" to me philosophically that a fetus is not a person hinges on a basis of a hypothetical? One that isn't even possible? Sorry but to PROVE to me that a fetus isn't a person, you should probably start with facts, evidence or at least a common shared belief (not based off a hypothetical situation that can't actually happen).
Turn No:10
Sigma:
I read and even understood the thread. Sinjin posted: So far we appear in agreement that a thing can be composed of living cells with human DNA and not be a "human being" aka "person". You replied: Yes, we are in agreement at that . If you want to add additional qualifiers such as "separate" and "distinct" that's fine but not part of the original point. Actually I'm starting with a definition. As I stated, the first goal is to establish the "basic tenets" to see what we agree on. So I'm seeing if we agree on the seat of individuality. If there is no agreement on the basics, then there is no common ground to even have a discussion because we would be talking about different things. So I'll ask again: Would you consider it rational to say that the individual person is in the jar?
Turn No:11
amirsdaddy:
Go back and re-read my entire response to that. Yes, a thing can be a living cell with human DNA and still not be a human life (a skin cell, a sperm cell, an egg cell, any cell within the human body is a living cell with Human DNA and is not a human life or human being. Actually, you started with a hypothetical question, not a definition. A hypothetical question that isn't even based in reality. Yes, we have to start with common ground, but I'd prefer any common ground to be rooted in reality, not fantasy and science fiction.
Turn No:12
Sigma:
lol, alright. It hasn't improved upon review. Rofl, sure, we can start on an even more basic level if you wish. It'll just take longer. Surely you won't argue that human organs, even removed from the rest of the body, are not alive. After all, transplants occur and the organs don't die between one body and the next. Would you agree it is rational to say that you are not any less of a human being when you lose a kidney, and that kidney should not gain recognition as a human being, despite being alive and containing human DNA?

Note at this point EZ is twisting the debate. At no point did I say that he was personally given any such order. If he knows as much about the bible as he claims, he knows that there is a passage in the bible which supports my comment. So, either he doesn't know as much about the bible as he professes, which would make him just plain dishonest, or he does know the passage to which I am referring, and is displaying his usual level of intellectual dishonesty. Either way, he is dishonest. And liars go to hell, according to his own beliefs. See that, again he is twisting the debate to avoid the point. Try reading Hosea 13:16 So, your god, who is Jesus according to your beliefs, supports the abortion of the Samarian foetus. Presumably you will argue that the Samarians had rebelled against god, so every last one of them (including the innocent unborn) deserved death. His guys get to kill all the menfolk, slice open the pregnant women and keep the virgin girls for themselves. How compassionate! So, he supports abortion. My comment proves true. And you look a fool, yet again.

At no point did I claim that god had given any order directly to you, so it's no wonder you managed to refute that one. You claim that your god has the right to inflict capital punishment. Presumably this includes murder, genocide and abortion, as these are all detailed in your chosen magic book, yet you claim he is the height of morality. You claim that there are zero orders from your god for man to kill the innocent unborn despite the fact that I have supplied a passage from your own book of magic showing that he did. Who do you think he got to slice open the bellies of those pregnant women? Presumably the same people who kidnapped their virgin daughters to have for their own. You claim that I am the liar, yet you constantly lie to protect this monster you call god. Luckily I can see his atrocities for what they are. If your god is depicted accurately in the bible then he is the most evil beast that has ever come to my notice. How you could worship such a beast, and continually lie for him is beyond me? I have shown that your god supports abortion. In the past I have shown him to support genocide, rape, slavery, beating slaves to death (as long as they tale several days to die). I have even shown that your have murdered your own saviour in our heart. All using your own scripture. I have not lied at all, and you still come off as the fool.

Turn No: 2: Steeeeve:
Why does proximity matter? If you know the person personally does that change your response? I agree it's about a person whom you don't know and the impact on the rest of their life. I just don't think we should end their life because we don't know them. Ok, the people involved are the mother and baby. I don't see any circumstance where we should assume the baby is for being killed.
Turn No:3
pappillion001:
 Proximity was to add emphasis to the idea of how far removed from the situation people would be. The conflict is most prevalent when religion is concerned. In these cases little or no consideration is given to hormonal, cultural or educational influences. Both religious and non religious often view the situation as a punishment for immoral behavior. Define a baby and is that what we are talking about? We have accepted definitions of when is a person alive, both that would warrant attempts to maintain or improve life if in distress. We have accepted definitions of what is death as well as the cessation of life support. We have accepted definitions of a person and what rights we as a society are obligated to protect. On what grounds do we redefine what these mean? A group of cells that has the potential to become a baby is not a baby and prior to that point does the government or you and I have the right to dictate to another person what they may or may not do with their body?
Turn No:4
Steeeeve:
So no real value to the discussion. I suppose in this instance a baby would be a living human being not yet born. And yes, that is what we are talking about. I am opposed to redefining who is or isn't a person worthy of rights. But assuming this is "redefining", I would argue it isn't unheard of to do so. Further, recognizing a right and redefining a word to fit that right is not only ok, it is required. How does this relate to abortion? Are you suggesting that somehow an unborn baby (my word not yours) is not a baby but just a group of cells? Couldn't I define you as a group of cells? Afterall, you are pumping blood just like a 4 week old embryo. "prior to that point"? Wouldn't you want to be sure what "bodies" exist before deciding which bodies we can allow to be violated by another?
Turn No:5
pappillion001:
In the bigger picture I think so. Not a fertilized egg, an embryo, a fetus? Because they are different. A baby can sustain itself needing only food and shelter. A baby is not something that lacks organs, a brain or any number of vital components that make it viable. It is not who is worthy of rights and who is not. What defines a person is the question. We don't acknowledge organs or body parts or a dead person as having rights as a living human being. This is no different. Ok so why does the Government have the right to tell a woman what she can do with her body? Does the State have the right to disregard her right and under what justification? Because you assign rights and obligations to what is not yet a person. Under that idea then why stop there, sperm or an egg have the potential to become a baby. There is a point where an embryo is acknowledged as having rights that protect it. Prior to that it is not a baby. Is internal organ function what makes a baby a baby? Haven't we? So would you support banning abortion? in all cases, in some? What condition, if any, makes that "baby" an acceptable loss or in the case of none does why does it outweigh any potential risk?
Turn No:6
Steeeeve:
So is a child, adult, preteen, elder, preadolescent, etc. The term "baby" was not used inappropriately and when you asked for clarification I gave it to you. So what are you trying to say? ...from another. Which is exactly what an unborn baby and born baby needs. I'm not sure your point here. Indeed, because all persons are entitled to the same inherent rights. It's very different. What makes you different from an organ or body part biologically speaking? I suspect you might say something like how you have a unique set of parts that make up your body as a whole. An unborn baby is no different. A government can tell anyone what to do with their body when they intend for their body to harm another. If I am directly responsible for putting you in a situation where only I can ensure your survival, I have a moral obligation to ensure your survival. But they are persons. You are trying to argue an arbitrary difference between a human being and a person. You really can't argue an unborn child is not a human being; by any biological definition they are. So you end up saying that at some random point in development they are a person. This it void of logic. You seem to think so above. I'd support any law protecting inherent rights of human life. It doesn't necessarily have to relate to abortion; admittedly in this case it does.

 Is a catapiller a butterfly? No. Just as an embryo is not a baby. It may become one, but it is not one. An embryo can't Who decides whose right is superior and why is it between a fertilized egg or a woman Except you are comparing what I am to what it might be. When abortion is legal it is not a baby that is viable with a complete set of working organs and systems. That comes later at about the time abortion is mo longer legal. So if you become pregnant then we know what your decision will be. Must everyone share your standard of moral obligation? Are there circumstances that effect that obligation? From a strictly biological perspective a fertilized egg is just that. You grant it attributes it may posses in the future in the present. It will develop into and become, but at specific points in time. We are not talking about the end rersult of 9 months, but the progress after 1 or 2. If I thought that I wouldn't have needed to comment on it. So again, since this statement isn't clear. Your position would be to ban abortion period, no exceptions?
Turn No:8
Steeeeve:
The development of a human is far different from a caterpillar and butterfly so the analogy doesn't work. The term "baby" is merely a word. Word's have meanings defined by common usage. Using the word "Baby" to describe a human being not yet born is well within the acceptable usage. Surely you've heard someone say "I feel my baby kicking" or something like. I'm not sure why you are getting so hung up on the semantics; if it bothers you so much perhaps you should reconsider your views on abortion. Can't what? It's between two persons, one born one not. As a society we tend to side with the person that is being harmed. By the fourth week (about the time you realize you are pregnant) the baby has all major organs and a heart beat. So what you say is just not true. Yes. You are getting hung up on fertilized eggs. This is one day of the embryonic time. It is silly to argue in these terms because no one is getting an abortion as they do not know they are pregnant. Let's stick with when 99% of abortions take place which is 4 weeks after fertilization (6 weeks pregnant) to 14 weeks after fertilization (16 weeks pregnant). From a strictly biological perspective 100% of abortions occur when a unique human being is developing. No, they are human beings no matter how much you argue otherwise. There is a unique set of DNA with 23 pairs of chromosomes. Biologically they are the exact same as you which should be obvious as human beings don't change species. One or two!? Heart beating, brain activity, all major organs created, hands, feet, fingernails, eyes, eyelids...what more do you want? My position as it relates to this conversation is that an unborn human enjoys the same inherent rights as a born human. Are you asking if there are exceptions to the rights depending on "born" status?
Turn No:9
pappillion001:
 For the purpose used the analogy was fine. It doesn't work for you just as making a distinction between the stages of development isn't working for you. I am not hung up on what a baby is for you, nor am suggesting one of us doesn't know English. It goes back to my statement about at what point is does sperm and egg equal person. For you it is sometime minutes maybe days after. I understand your reasoning and don't necessarily disagree, but think while it has no functional organs, no life sustaining systems and no nerve reception and there exists a conflict between a woman's right to her person and the right of the baby to its life I lean towards the woman. Once it those things develop then it has a right to its life. While as far as you are concerned a baby is a baby. In a broad sense yes, but in this instance since I at least am dealing with the developmental stages that a person goed through to become a person. Can't what? We try and side with the what is just and/or fair and that does not prohibit harm being done. I could argue the mother will be harmed as well. You will come back with but she will still be alive. Which leads to my other point of making life altering choices for people you have not the slightest idea of what their circumstances are. A child could be the greatest thing ever for her or condemn her to a life one step above death. You say it is between two people one born and one not, but you insert yourself in the situation just long enough to impose your sense of morality on her and then woosh you are gone leaving her to deal with what you have decided for the both of them. I don't think so Weeks 4 and 5 -1/4 inch long: Here we see the beginnings of the vertebra, the lower jaw, the larynx ("voice box"), and the rudiments of the ear and eye. The heart, which is still outside body, now beats at a regular rhythm. Although arm and leg "buds" are visible with hand and foot "pads," the embryo still has a tail and cannot be distinguished from pig, rabbit, elephant, or chick embryo by an untrained eye. The point is at 4 weeks the organs beginning to develop and a few weeks from being functional. Yes. It is as much a person as blue prints are a house. DNA is the instructions on how to make a person, not a person. Lay the foundation and put up the studs is it a house yet? Finish the roof, Put up the drywall it's a house in that it would provide shelter and has a familiar shape, but nobody really thinks of it as a house yet. Why? Because it is not finished. There is a point when you get close enough that it becomes habitable, which is a typical point in the construction where it can be called a house. I am hung up on it because it is significant. Since in your mind there is no difference between week 1 and week 36 of course it you think it doesn't matter. You don't have to agree with me but if you can't understand my position then we will continue to go around in circles. Seriously, your argument is you are right because you said so I have answered this in my responses above. No need to do so again. So abortion under any circumstances is murder. Mother should face criminal prosecution and doctor as accessory. Since it would be premeditated and the nature in which committed, maybe get a death penalty case. While only representing a small number of pregnancies do you have any thoughts on the incest, rape and deformed cases? How about the 12 - 17 year old single moms? The older women who did use birth control well I am sure there is a silver lining in there somewhere. I understand your position and don't think it a bad one. I just think forcing someone to be a parent does not sit within the duties or obligations we have towards each other. Nobody is being forced, unless they are a minor and then Mom and/or Dad decide, but for the most part the woman is the only one capable of deciding for herself what will be best for her.
Turn No:10
Steeeeve:
No, it really isn't. There is literally nothing the same. There is a change of species, a birth, a death, and birth again. Your analogy might as well say are a baseball bat and a bat (animal) the same. You misunderstood me. My argument is that there is no difference between a person and human being. Or better yet, that the woman is responsible for the baby harming her. The baby had no choice to be in the current situation as he was created by the mother (among other things). Not relevant. If there are two humans involved one cannot kill the other just like I cannot kill you. Please don't misread "kill" as justifiable homicide. You don't think so? What part of this contradicts what I said? Clearly there is a heart beat and all major organ systems have been created. Organs being functional? If this were the criteria you could argue they aren't functional at 30 weeks! They are there and the ones that need to be used are being used much like how your lungs aren't used until they are needed to be used (a few seconds after birth). As for your bold part; I'm not sure why the viewpoint of an untrained eye is relevant. DNA is like the blue prints of a house. An embryo is nothing like that as the embryo is the house. Yet these unique "plans" can only exist if a life has already been created. If you burned it down I would say you burned my house down. In any event, well within the first trimester all the "parts" are in place...they just merely grow from that point on. This is where it tends to depart from your house analogy. At about 4 weeks as described above you are more like a tree sapling where you only grow to be a bigger tree. I'd say a 1cm tall oak is a tree...probably not building our house out of that just yet A small point, but week 3 and week 36. They backdate pregnancies so for consistency purposes week 3 of pregnancy and week 1 of fetal development. I only say this so you know what I'm talking about, not to be a jerk. More to your point, there are no abortions (in the sense we are talking about) of a fertilized egg so to talk about it is like me assuming all abortions happen 3 minutes before birth. It's right because there is no scientific distinction between human being and human embryo. An embryo is of the species homo sapiens and is a unique entity. There is literally no argument here. I'm fine arguing against the point that a person is different from a human being but to say the embryo is not a human being is just ignoring basic science and really I can't do much about that. Obviously abortion is currently not considered murder, however, in many states someone else killing the unborn baby would be considered murder. As for what I think the criminal penalties should be, I really don't wish to argue that at this point as it isn't relevant to my point. Am I the only one that thinks of the stupid term "legitimate rape" every time someone says rape in terms of abortion? Good grief that politician was dumb. Anywho, my position is that a person is no different from a human being and therefore status of birth does not change rights awarded. So take whatever scenarios you have and apply that rule and you'll get my answer. Like I said, it really isn't relevant to my point. As a general rule, I don't wish to force anyone to do anything unless it directly harms another. If there was an effective way to remove the embryo/fetus to grow elsewhere I would be fine with that just like you can choose to give your child up for adoption. But absent that, the parents (yes, you too dad) have an obligation to care for the child until the child and reasonably be able to care for themselves. As an aside, if adoption were not available I would still force the parents to care for the child even if they didn't want to. I believe this because the parents are directly responsible for the child being in a situation where the child cannot care for his or her self.

pappillion001:
 Steeeeve you always come across as a smart guy possessed of some common sense. Is this really your understanding of the life of a butterfly? That it is both an evolutionary miracle as well as a having the power of God to resurrect itself? They are only born once and once they die they stay dead and they remain the same species. There may be a distinction got each phase of a butterfly's life cycle, but their species classification remains the same. For my analogy compare that each go through distinct periods of development in which drastic changes occur. I did understand you. My arguement was at what point does one become either in possession of rights? Remember I said it often becomes a punishment for immoral behavior. And when she is not responsible? The mother didn't choose to become pregnant. if she had she wouldn't want an abortion. Hence the importance of when does it become a person, what constitutes life? One can not enslave the other either. I said Except you are comparing what I am to what it might be. When abortion is legal it is not a baby that is viable with a complete set of working organs and systems. That comes later at about the time abortion is mo longer legal. You said By the fourth week (about the time you realize you are pregnant) the baby has all major organs and a heart beat. So what you say is just not true. It is a fact a heart resting outside the body is not considered to be functional. Since the organs that it would be sending blood to are also incomplete this is not much of a problem. By comparison without my organs, skin, skeleton oxygen or nervous system including a brain I doubt I would be thriving because I would be dead. So it is not the same as me, it has some organs, non of which are complete, but yes the heart beats. Even though it it didn't it wouldn't make much of a difference. You implied at 4 weeks its a little person. . That is what I said What are you talking about? I said DNA is like the blue prints for a house. They are instructions not what is made by their execution. Not disputing that A tree sapling looks like a miniature tree. Everything it needs to survive it has. At 4 weeks an an embryo has lumps that will later be organs, but at 4 weeks they are blobs of cells. It looks nothing like a human, but more importantly it cannot survive outside of the womb. At 4 weeks it may not survive inside the womb. So yes at some point my house analogy will no longer apply, about the time the house would be finished be when the baby is born. Then each is fully and accurately described using the terms baby and house. First red flag. Science people don't give the same thing two names. If it has two names its because it isn't one thing. Now we can call them widgets for all I care I am not making a distinction to try and confuse the issue. I do so because words have meaning and both overt and subtle. You insist it is a human being, even though for this part of the discussion that is to broad a description. A human being includes adults, teens, toddlers, infants, seniors and a number of others that are not a part of what we are talking about. We both know this, but while yes they can be called human beings embryo and fetus are more accurate. It is easier even if subconsciously to defend a human being than an embryo. You are right there should be no argument, but I think it important that we have the same understanding of certain words. As you can see below science does make a distinction and that distinction happens to be the development of those organ and systems I stated earlier. Honestly, I don't make this stuff up to try and sneak something by. Science Dictionary embryo (m'br-') Pronunciation Key An animal in its earliest stage of development, before all the major body structures are represented. In humans, the embryonic stage lasts through the first eight weeks of pregnancy. In humans, other placental mammals, and other viviparous animals, young born as embryos cannot thrive. In marsupials, the young are born during the embryonic stage and complete their development outside the uterus, attached to a teat within the mother's pouch. Obviously abortion is currently not considered murder, however, in many states someone else killing the unborn baby would be considered murder. As for what I think the criminal penalties should be, I really don't wish to argue that at this point as it isn't relevant to my point. Science Dictionary fetus (f'ts) Pronunciation Key The unborn offspring of a mammal at the later stages of its development, especially a human from eight weeks after fertilization to its birth. In a fetus, all major body organs are present. I don't think abortion should be a form of birth control. I don't support late term abortions unless there is a some health concern either to mother or child. I think there is a brief period the least amount of harm, not none, is done that will permit a woman to decide what the rest of her life will be like. There are very few things that carry life long consequences. Marriage and career can but not like becoming a parent especially for a young unwed woman. Statistically she is more likely to live at or below poverty, if she was in school she likely will not complete it for a number of years if at all. She will often been looked upon with pity or as a reason someone else can be thankful they are not her. Most employers will not appreciate her needs with regards to the care of the child. She is likely to suffer from lower self esteem and depression. Many opportunities will no longer be available to her. Her male child has a good chance to have legal problems and not finish high school. Her female child is less likely to have legal problems, but more than makes up for that with a higher chance of becoming pregnant in her teens. She will likely rely on day care or a public school system to provide guidance and teaching of basic social skills as she will need to provide for both their needs. The guidance will most likely some from peers who will have more influence than the overworked, under qualified teacher at the barely adequate school they are likely to attend. This of course this is not every case and the pitfalls are not all or none. A women may face none of them or just one or two or all. But odds are that to some degree that is what her life will look like. I don't think our society is improved or or made better by this. I don't think I have the right to impose this life or anything that resembles it on another person. When you say you are for protecting a human being from being harmed by another you are assuming that human wants you to do so and the harm being prevented outweighs the harm that prevention will cause. I know there is no way to ask and in such cases we error to the side of caution, but it doesn't change the fact that it is a belief that is being used to invalidate the very real rights of the woman as well as impose obligations upon her against her will. In some instances this is only made harsher by the fact that she became pregnant either against her will or despite taking precautions. In principal I agree with you. It just reality adds shades of grey to your black or white scenario and it is that gray that pushes me the other direction at this point. This is a choice of the lesser of two evils with not much to be happy about either way.

No but interestingly enough there are theories on it(googled it just now): Are Butterflies Two Different Animals in One? The Death And Resurrection Theory : Krulwich Wonders... : NPR I think my point is that the process for butterflies radically different from anything that happens to humans. It is very misleading to say this is similar to the birth of any mammal. It was also misleading of me to say "change species"....that was merely puffery . I see, from existence is my answer. I'm not sure how it is a punishment. It is merely accepting a consequence on an action. Once you take responsibility for something you can't reverse that at the peril of another. This isn't a great example but if you are responsible for pet sitting a cat it would be wrong for you to just walk away in the middle of the cat owners vacation leaving the cat to die. In terms of a pregnancy, the unborn child had no choice in being in their current situation as the parents put them in that situation. If you assume for a minute that the unborn child is a person would you argue the mother could abort because she doesn't want to take responsibility for the remainder of the pregnancy? Maybe not, but she is responsible for the baby being in the current situation. Like I keep saying, there is no difference between person and human being so to be it is not an important question. As for enslaving, it is not for the same reasons described above. It actually is functional. There is a circulatory system working as this has to be the first thing working. The other organs are formed but not needed so they don't function. Your lungs aren't needed until after birth but it doesn't seem like you feel a baby in the third trimester is not a person. Fetal development: The first trimester - MayoClinic.com It is. What you look like doesn't make you a person or not. I know some pretty ugly looking people but I'm not about to say they aren't people. At works weeks it doesn't have lumps..it has the organs, at 4 weeks the heart is the only one really used (set aside skin for now). You could identify specific organ tissue if you really wanted to. Just curious, does what the baby look like matter to you? So if he/she looks like a human would that be the point where you say it is a person? Also, from what I understand 40% of abortions happen after 9 weeks. 26% 9-12 weeks. So we are on the same page that a human embryo is also a human being in the same sense a human child is also a human being? In terms of abortion this is all irrelevant to me. People like Simone will chime in and say I'm cold but the sad story of a women struggling doesn't negate, in my mind, that she want's to kill someone. In my mind it would be this same story and therefore she wants to toss her 1 week old baby into the trash. Naturally the sympathy for the woman goes away in that scenario. I actually know a number of people that had an abortion...I suspect we all do...there is not one instance where the persons circumstances were as you describe. Every story is "oh sh*t, I'm pregnant! Well I'm still in college and want to finish up so I'm getting an abortion". After you work in a hospital for awhile you also see the other side of this coin...the couple that comes in, the women is bleeding everywhere, she has lost her kid after trying for years to get pregnant. Those really are the two scenarios you see most often...at the hospital anyway. Now, if we want to talk about poverty and what we should do to help, I'm all for it. Yes. We assume life as a society and I'm comfortable with that. I don't want to have to tell the fireman that I want to be saved from the fire. It certainly isn't as easy as I make it sound on these forums, I'll grant you that. However, if you come to the realization that a person and human being are the same the answer in 99% of the cases is clear. Those 1% are a little harder to deal with just like the 1% of anything in life (99% of the time you wouldn't kill someone but what if someone breaks in....etc...those kinds of situations).

Nice recovery . There is a theory (as in this one) which was retracted as scientifically unsupportable from another journal, but I agree it is an interesting approach to what is a strange process. The comparison was not supposed to highlight the specific stages of development, but that there are stages where the initial entity becomes something different while still under the broader definition of what it is. Which is technically where we disagree. The question of when is existence recognized as having a right superior to the mother's? When if ever can that right be not recognized? If there is a 50/50 chance the mother, child or both may die if carried to term you have a problem that your position is unable to address. If the mother is in accident where she can be kept alive through life support, but cannot be given anything for pain as it would kill the child is another problem your position is unable to deal with. My point is not to portray these as representative of the typical scenario, they are not, but to point out things are not black and white. Situations like these and ones where the dilemma raises similar issues. If your position can be shown to not be applicable in every case then you must establish under what circumstances it is applicable and when it is not? The child is a threat to the mother if she carries to term or the child carries a genetic disease that puts life expectancy at 5 years tops. Is she irresponsible in terminating the pregnancy? Is she even allowed to? Are these the consequences the child is now responsible for? It may have had no choice in being there, but you accept on its behalf the responsibility for keeping it there. Yes it would be wrong and yes it is not a very good example. You are comparing a conscience decision of accepting a responsibility that has if any only short term and insignificant consequences that you would have been aware of prior. The acceptance is made without emotional or physical influences nor is there reliance on any third party involvement. (birth control) And when the mother did so against her will? When the mother is unable to understand these consequences and/or is coerced? (Rape, incest, drug use, mental incapacity, minors) I don't have to assume if it makes it easier that is what I am saying. There is a period where that group of cells that otherwise would grow into a child most likely a copy of any one of millions currently running around were it allowed to fully develop is a group of cells that can be prevented from further development prior to its ability to understand, comprehend or feel anything. You can phrase it as she just doesn't want the responsibility discounting what may be real valid concerns to the one who would have to deal with them, but should she accept it. Keep in mind the age group with the most unwanted pregnancies is under 18. If you want to have the stats, it is a long read though and uses info from the 90's, but is the largest and most complete research on the subject go here Guttmacher Institute: Home Page Except when she is not or are you suggesting becoming pregnant is always the responsibility of the women? The heart is outside the body. Where in everyday life does one keep their heart outside of their body? You seem to suggest that the organs are ready to go just waiting to be born so they can be used in the manner they were made for. It takes time for them to grow. How can they be functional when the brain and spinal column are still forming as well as the nerves that would control them or the pathways that connect them? At 9 months all of these have developed. That is why birth occurs. That is why at 4 weeks it is not viable outside the womb even with life support systems, it has not yet developed enough to survive. If something costs 1.00 and you have .99 cents you don't have the 1.00. You have a handful of pennies, you will have a dollar when you get another penny, but at that moment you do not have a dollar. You continue to attribute the future to the present. Everybody knows what it will be, but this is about what it is. It doesn't. You started us down the path of physical appearance and this is where it ended up. I get 88% within the first 12 weeks. I have to make a distinction because allow for abortion to occur within a certain time frame or under certain circumstances. There must be some way to distinguish one from the other. Current law uses viability, which is about the same time embryo becomes fetus. Otherwise yes. Who has less compassion the one who with the thumb up who says let it live or the one with the thumb down who says let it die? It is never easy and there are always worst case scenarios. For that reason I don't think a generalized response which over rules any choice the individual may desire is the best method. That will be the next annual fee that someone will not pay and so will not be saved. Your position makes no allowance for that 1% (or higher), but once you open that door where does it get closed again?

This is getting long so I'm cutting out some of the things. Let me know if you really wanted a response to something. That's fine but I'd argue this is a moot point. No one cares about adult vs child in terms of "being a person" so why fetus vs adult? You ask about extremes that make up less than 1% of what we are talking about. While I'm ok with this you have to understand that the same kind of extremes can be used in just about everything. A general rule you might have is that you shouldn't kill a born person (I say born so you know what I'm talking about). But what about a situation where you are rock climbing and your friend is attached to you. They slip and based upon previous knowledge you know that if you cut the rope and they fall they will have a 25% chance of survival while you will be fine. If you don't cut you both fall with a 25% chance of survival each. So what do you do? That's not always an easy answer but I do know that 99.99% of the circumstances will lead to the answer "do not kill my friend". The same thing applies to abortion. I may not have an answer for every scenario but I do know the answer for 99.99% of the scenarios. I don't need to argue the remaining extreme scenarios to prove my "do not kill a born person" moral. Punish the person responsible. The baby is still not responsible for being in that situation and shouldn't be punished to death for it. I'm confused in what you are saying. I'm more or less asking what your criteria is. In other words, if it isn't simply being a human being, what is it and how is that not arbitrary? Physically, yes. It is currently impossible for any other woman or any man to assume that responsibility. In terms of any financial impact or other impact outside of the actual development it is the responsibility of the persons who created the baby. In fact, you could argue the financial responsibility rests more with the father as the woman, at some point, may not be able to perform the duties that provide her with a way to live. I think dead beat dads should face stiffer penalties than what is currently on the books. This is misleading. It is not necessarily outside the embryo, merely no rib cage as formed around it so it looks like a protrudes from the body. It's actually a medical condition if you are born like this and people have been born like this. Either way, this is at 4 weeks and by week 6 this no longer is the case. I don't see while survival has anything to do with it. A 1 day old baby can't survive without help from someone else. The organs are formed and they are growing from that point on. I am not implying they are being used, they aren't...no reason for them to be. There is, however, a functioning and used brain and heart as those are needed. The last one is always the lungs which aren't used at all until birth. To be frank, I think viability is about the dumbest concept I've heard (I realize it has been around awhile). A baby can't survive at 1 day on their own so why does location change the definition of viability? I've never really gotten a reasonable answer from anyone on that. I'm not sure what you are asking and how it relates to what I said. Please clarify But this gets back to my point of identifying the parties involved. IF we are talking about one person, I'd agree. It is my view that two persons exists each with rights and therefore one may not make a decision to kill the other...in general. It only hinges on the fact that we can't just assume it is only the woman that exists. My position is that two people exist with equal rights. It allows for 100% of situations. See above example for further explanation.

To a limited degree we do. A child does not have the same rights as an adult. At 18 we make a distinction between child and adult even though that person may or may not be capable of being one. Why 18? There is no physical change that can be said to make a person an adult and an emancipated child can be an adult at 16. No the figures are significantly higher than 1% In 2006, 49% of pregnancies were unintendeda slight increase from 48% in 2001. Among women aged 19 years and younger, more than 4 out of 5 pregnancies were unintended. The proportion of pregnancies that were unintended was highest among teens younger than age 15 years, at 98%. At 15 that would be the parents. At 15 that would be raging hormones, naivety, lack of education or a whole list of other factors that should at least shed some responsibility from the person who is still a child. If the baby could be shown to have say partial responsibility would that make a difference? I'm confused in what you are saying. I'm more or less asking what your criteria is. In other words, if it isn't simply being a human being, what is it and how is that not arbitrary? Again, what of cases where the mother became pregnant unwillingly? Such as with incest, rape. mental incapacity, use of drugs etc. Now it is not the mother's fault she is pregnant. While abortion is legal they are not on standby. If you have a lump of clay and shape it into a bowl do you have a bowl that you can eat cereal out of every morning? No because it is not finished yet. If you try and use it it will dissolve. It is not yet functional despite the fact it may look like it is. Viable meaning it is physically functional. That everything it will need to live is present and working. We can shelter it and feed it outside the womb, we can't give it a liver or lungs or cause them to grow outside the womb I was saying you are acting with more compassion that what you credit yourself. Why is the distinction made that a fertilized egg is a person and has rights while an unfertilized egg does not? The egg did everything it could to become fertilized. It tampered with the woman's hormones and her emotional state, it was where it was supposed to be, it improved her physically, but she used birth control. Why is one so drastically different that it isn't even a consideration?

I'm talking about natural rights. I make a distinction. I thought you were talking about rape, incest, and risk of mother/child life? Were you not? Fault and responsibility are two different things. Rape (mental incapacity goes with rape) is the only instance where fault goes with the criminal. Responsibility is the duty of someone to handle a situation. In all cases it is the responsibility of the mother when she is pregnant (and as otherwise noted in my previous post). What do you consider as "finished" to a person? How is this meaningful? It seems extremely arbitrary. If you remove a 10 week old unborn baby from the womb it will die. If you remove a 10 week old born baby away from their caregiver it will die. The only difference is location. I just don't see why location of development matters in one case but not the next. Oh, well thank you Not a human being. Simple as that for me. The second you are a unique human being you have rights. I believe distinguishing between person and human being is extremely dangerous and if history is any indication, it never ends well.

The natural rights of a minor are conditionally recognized at best. They have a right to life or more accurately others have a duty to not kill or abuse them, but either way the fact remains that children do not have the same rights as adults. Regardless of reason we have created a distinction between one type of human being and another. We justify violating the inalienable rights of minors citing their best interest. That this usually works out for the best and fits within what culturally we find morally acceptable causes nobody to complain, but that doesn't change what it is. I thought you were talking about rape, incest, and risk of mother/child life? Were you not? Mental incapacity is not necessarily rape. One may be a willing participant, but have no grasp of what they are participating in. In this context the end result for you is the same. What significance is there to say your not at fault, followed by but you still have the responsibility. Where is her inalienable right to her own life. This is the punishment concept I spoke of. Through no fault of her own she is made to become against her will an incubator and then provider for another person. What she wanted for her life, gone. Taken away by a stranger who is determined to impose their idea of morals onto the rest of the human race. As I said a caregiver can be found for 10 week old newborn overcoming its inability to feed and shelter itself. Nothing can be done for a 10 week old removed from the womb who has not developed enough. Yes its arbitrary. A point in development was needed and of all the possible factors viability seemed the most reasonable and relevant. They could have just said the 8th Friday from conception, but that doesn't allow for any variation. But why? Sperm and eggs become a commodity instead of the ingredients to make a person. When eggs and sperm are donated, combined and placed in a womb we don't give consideration to that newly engineered human being, we think it just swell someone who couldn't have children now can (unless they are gay, then it suddenly matters) Sperm and eggs pretty much only have one use, making people. Each egg and sperm will make a unique person. When the embryo's are placed in the woman they put some extra to improve the odds knowing that some will not survive. Why is this seen as a perfectly acceptable part of what is considered a wonderful advancement of technology?

I believe they do have natural rights, life obviously being the most important. Maybe we just disagree on what a natural right is. I'm pretty sure that's rape. You can't consent to something without knowing what you are consenting to. Really neither here or nor there though. Still present. Well over 90% of the time it is her fault but 100% of the time it is her responsibility (again, as described in another post) what you want in your life is not a right to life. A right to life is merely the right to exist. Your second sentence is silly, come on, you know that. That's not really relevant. This implies "what you want" is a right over someones life. I don't by that. You'd also have to conclude that if a caregiver didn't exist the killing of the newborn would be justified. I don't see that happening. Why isn't a sperm and egg a human being? This is more of a biological lesson that I really don't think is necessary. Besides, we seem to both be in agreement that a sperm and egg are not a human being so this is really not a necessary discussion.

Unalienable rights can't have an order of importance as this would create a scenario in which a person could lose a right to a superior one. Although the DOI says unalienable, in practice we have inalienable rights. In my view Natural Rights are an attempt to take legal and moral rights and place them in an objective position. That there is no accepted list of what rights are and are not included and the lack of any type of enforcement mechanism make them perfect for philosophy and political science majors to write about. If we assume for the debate that they exist and are unalienable the fetus using her body as life support would have a right to exist, but would not have the right to make the mother provide a means to do so. You can blame her or say she is now responsible or that consent was implied by her actions, but she has the right to her body and to make her carry to term would violate her rights. In this scenario there are no duties or moral responsibilities that can infringe on her rights. It could even be argued that the fetus can not have a right to exist because that right can only come from an act that violates the rights of the mother. You probably didn't even get this far before you started responding. I will try and make this brief If we assume the rights are inalienable then we are at where we are at. Rights are granted, they can nullified, forfeited or modified. There exists a system of coercion to compel people to respect others rights all of which is influenced and subject to the prevailing degree of morality and desire of the public. Now she still has a right to her person. The embryo is now though not necessarily in possession of the right to life simply because it exists. That is granted and where you and I are at an impasse. I notice you left out half of the paragraph that the above was in response to and was relevent I thought given the direction this went. Reproductive medicine currently will create several unique human beings place them in a womb knowing that that only one is the the most likely number to survive if any do. Research is done to advance our medical knowledge in some cases using these unique humans as lab rats. Why is this acceptable and morally tolerable? But really in a philosophical sense why does she have the responsibility if she was put into this position or even if she did so willingly. You say she has an obligation she says she does not. Your emotions based on life experience and cultural values is what you believe gives you the right to compel her to conform to your concept of right and wrong. If you came home and there was a baby on your doorstep with a note saying name is Bob doesn't like carrots raise him well. You would not think it is now your obligation to take care of it. She should not be the scape goat just because she is convenient. It can't exist without imposing undesirable obligations on her. Typically when one party infringes on the rights of another the damaged party is granted some form of relief. Legally benefiting from violating the rights of another regardless of fault or intention is not rewarded. Maybe the presentation was extreme but the concept is valid. You have a set of values that are important to you. You have decided that at least on this issue that what you believe and to the degree you believe it is the minimum that every person should be subject to. Their belief may be different, but that is just something they will need to learn to deal with. For the most part circumstances and reasons are unfortunate and may be important to them, but that should have been a consideration before she had sex because she doesn't have a choice anymore. But the pursuit of happiness is in the DOI. Now the question becomes does she have a duty to provide life support and care that is harmful to her (philosophically speaking not necessarily physical)? Using rights derived from what exists in nature there is plenty of evidence that she has no obligation at all. The existence of a caregiver is meaningless. They aren't trying to establish the need for a babysitter. A reasonable point in development was needed for legal clarification, You may disagree that there was a need but that doesn't change that it was. Since being alive is an integral part of having and needing rights the point at which a person can actually be alive seemed a good idea. That is also why it is relevant. Just like kids the dead don't have the same set of rights as living adults. Think philosophically along the lines of both being frozen until they either expire or are used for any one of a number of different possibilities.

And I would come back to the same point I've made before. If you aren't required to provide for another in the womb you aren't required to provide for another outside the womb. You called that one right! Ha. I honestly don't know much about this so I'm not sure I'm the best person to comment. And this isn't something new...societies generally work that way. We dictate morals in a society and those who don't approve can either leave or suffer the consequences for breaking them. Yes I do. If I slam the door and let the baby die I failed in my moral duties. Naturally I would call the police in this kind of situation. Different from a born child how? And "you can put it up for adoption" is not an acceptable answer. This gets back to fault and responsibility. I think you and I can both agree that the unborn baby has absolutely no fault in being in the current situation he or she is in. The fault is almost always with the mother and father and in the case of rape with the father. Fault doesn't necessarily mean they meant for it to happen. If you accidentally slam into the back of another car you are at fault but that doesn't mean you meant it to happen. I'd argue you can remove rights for someone at fault. So 90+% of the time we are talking about a fault of the mother and father and therefore I think a right of self is easily overrode by a right to life of the unborn who is at no fault and can only survive in the womb of the mother. The remaining scenarios, mainly rape, are no fault of the mother or unborn. At this point you have to decide which right prevails. I argue life trumps in this case. It is very meaningful. I here "viability" all the time but the term is useless. Ability to live outside the womb with a caregiver versus inside the womb with a caregiver is a worthless distinction in the abortion debate. I say this because the argument has always been the woman has no obligation to provide care. So when the baby is outside the womb you can't pretend that argument never existed. It literally reads like this: "A woman doesn't have the obligation to provide care while the unborn is inside the womb because the unborn cannot survive outside the womb but a woman does have an obligation to provide care for a born child who survive outside the womb but only with the care of another". This implies that survival for a brief period of time (aka ability to breath) outside the womb is relevant to obligation to provide care but I can't for the life of me figure out how it remotely relates.
