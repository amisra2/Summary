I find many of the things that are based on religious morality just end up making the problem worse, they are paradoxical in effect. It's like teaching abstinence, it doesnt work, making sex education and birth control freely available not only reduced the teen pregnancy rate but also reduced the number of kids having sex in the first place.","when-life-begins","05:44 AM","abortion-debates","121"

The conflict is most prevalent when religion is concerned. In these cases little or no consideration is given to hormonal, cultural or educational influences. Both religious and non religious often view the situation as a punishment for immoral behavior. Define a baby and is that what we are talking about? We have accepted definitions of when is a person alive, both that would warrant attempts to maintain or improve life if in distress. We have accepted definitions of what is death as well as the cessation of life support. We have accepted definitions of a person and what rights we as a society are obligated to protect. On what grounds do we redefine what these mean? A group of cells that has the potential to become a baby is not a baby and prior to that point does the government or you and I have the right to dictate to another person what they may or may not do with their body?","when-life-begins","09:33 PM","abortion-debates","124"

Not a fertilized egg, an embryo, a fetus? Because they are different. A baby can sustain itself needing only food and shelter. A baby is not something that lacks organs, a brain or any number of vital components that make it viable. It is not who is worthy of rights and who is not. What defines a person is the question. We don't acknowledge organs or body parts or a dead person as having rights as a living human being. This is no different. Ok so why does the Government have the right to tell a woman what she can do with her body? Does the State have the right to disregard her right and under what justification? Because you assign rights and obligations to what is not yet a person. Under that idea then why stop there, sperm or an egg have the potential to become a baby. There is a point where an embryo is acknowledged as having rights that protect it. Prior to that it is not a baby. Is internal organ function what makes a baby a baby? Haven't we?

Surely you've heard someone say ""I feel my baby kicking"" or something like. I'm not sure why you are getting so hung up on the semantics; if it bothers you so much perhaps you should reconsider your views on abortion. Can't what? It's between two persons, one born one not. As a society we tend to side with the person that is being harmed. By the fourth week (about the time you realize you are pregnant) the baby has all major organs and a heart beat. So what you say is just not true. Yes. You are getting hung up on fertilized eggs. This is one day of the embryonic time. It is silly to argue in these terms because no one is getting an abortion as they do not know they are pregnant. Let's stick with when 99% of abortions take place which is 4 weeks after fertilization (6 weeks pregnant) to 14 weeks after fertilization (16 weeks pregnant). From a strictly biological perspective 100% of abortions occur when a unique human being is developing. No, they are human beings no matter how much you argue otherwise. There is a unique set of DNA with 23 pairs of chromosomes. Biologically they are the exact same as you which should be obvious as human beings don't change species. One or two!?

It doesn't work for you just as making a distinction between the stages of development isn't working for you. I am not hung up on what a baby is for you, nor am suggesting one of us doesn't know English. It goes back to my statement about at what point is does sperm and egg equal person. For you it is sometime minutes maybe days after. I understand your reasoning and don't necessarily disagree, but think while it has no functional organs, no life sustaining systems and no nerve reception and there exists a conflict between a woman's right to her person and the right of the baby to its life I lean towards the woman. Once it those things develop then it has a right to its life. While as far as you are concerned a baby is a baby. In a broad sense yes, but in this instance since I at least am dealing with the developmental stages that a person goed through to become a person. Can't what? We try and side with the what is just and/or fair and that does not prohibit harm being done. I could argue the mother will be harmed as well. You will come back with but she will still be alive. Which leads to my other point of making life altering choices for people you have not the slightest idea of what their circumstances are. A child could be the greatest thing ever for her or condemn her to a life one step above death. You say it is between two people one born and one not, but you insert yourself in the situation just long enough to impose your sense of morality on her and then woosh you are gone leaving her to deal with what you have decided for the both of them. I don't think so Weeks 4 and 5 -1/4 inch long: Here we see the beginnings of the vertebra, the lower jaw, the larynx (""voice box""), and the rudiments of the ear and eye. The heart, which is still outside body, now beats at a regular rhythm.

The point is at 4 weeks the organs beginning to develop and a few weeks from being functional. Yes. It is as much a person as blue prints are a house. DNA is the instructions on how to make a person, not a person. Lay the foundation and put up the studs is it a house yet? Finish the roof, Put up the drywall it's a house in that it would provide shelter and has a familiar shape, but nobody really thinks of it as a house yet. Why? Because it is not finished. There is a point when you get close enough that it becomes habitable, which is a typical point in the construction where it can be called a house. I am hung up on it because it is significant. Since in your mind there is no difference between week 1 and week 36 of course it you think it doesn't matter. You don't have to agree with me but if you can't understand my position then we will continue to go around in circles. Seriously, your argument is you are right because you said so I have answered this in my responses above. No need to do so again. So abortion under any circumstances is murder. Mother should face criminal prosecution and doctor as accessory. Since it would be premeditated and the nature in which committed, maybe get a death penalty case. While only representing a small number of pregnancies do you have any thoughts on the incest, rape and deformed cases? How about the 12 - 17 year old single moms? The older women who did use birth control well I am sure there is a silver lining in there somewhere. I understand your position and don't think it a bad one. I just think forcing someone to be a parent does not sit within the duties or obligations we have towards each other.

There is a change of species, a birth, a death, and birth again. Your analogy might as well say are a baseball bat and a bat (animal) the same. You misunderstood me. My argument is that there is no difference between a person and human being. Or better yet, that the woman is responsible for the baby harming her. The baby had no choice to be in the current situation as he was created by the mother (among other things). Not relevant. If there are two humans involved one cannot kill the other just like I cannot kill you. Please don't misread ""kill"" as justifiable homicide. You don't think so? What part of this contradicts what I said? Clearly there is a heart beat and all major organ systems have been created. Organs being functional? If this were the criteria you could argue they aren't functional at 30 weeks! They are there and the ones that need to be used are being used much like how your lungs aren't used until they are needed to be used (a few seconds after birth). As for your bold part; I'm not sure why the viewpoint of an untrained eye is relevant. DNA is like the blue prints of a house. An embryo is nothing like that as the embryo is the house. Yet these unique ""plans"" can only exist if a life has already been created. If you burned it down I would say you burned my house down. In any event, well within the first trimester all the ""parts"" are in place...they just merely grow from that point on. This is where it tends to depart from your house analogy. At about 4 weeks as described above you are more like a tree sapling where you only grow to be a bigger tree. I'd say a 1cm tall oak is a tree...probably not building our house out of that just yet A small point, but week 3 and week 36. They backdate pregnancies so for consistency purposes week 3 of pregnancy and week 1 of fetal development. I only say this so you know what I'm talking about, not to be a jerk. More to your point, there are no abortions (in the sense we are talking about) of a fertilized egg so to talk about it is like me assuming all abortions happen 3 minutes before birth. It's right because there is no scientific distinction between human being and human embryo. An embryo is of the species homo sapiens and is a unique entity. There is literally no argument here. I'm fine arguing against the point that a person is different from a human being but to say the embryo is not a human being is just ignoring basic science and really I can't do much about that. Obviously abortion is currently not considered murder, however, in many states someone else killing the unborn baby would be considered murder. As for what I think the criminal penalties should be, I really don't wish to argue that at this point as it isn't relevant to my point. Am I the only one that thinks of the stupid term ""legitimate rape"" every time someone says rape in terms of abortion? Good grief that politician was dumb. Anywho, my position is that a person is no different from a human being and therefore status of birth does not change rights awarded. So take whatever scenarios you have and apply that rule and you'll get my answer. Like I said, it really isn't relevant to my point.

But absent that, the parents (yes, you too dad) have an obligation to care for the child until the child and reasonably be able to care for themselves. As an aside, if adoption were not available I would still force the parents to care for the child even if they didn't want to.

My arguement was at what point does one become either in possession of rights? Remember I said it often becomes a punishment for immoral behavior. And when she is not responsible? The mother didn't choose to become pregnant. if she had she wouldn't want an abortion. Hence the importance of when does it become a person, what constitutes life? One can not enslave the other either. I said Except you are comparing what I am to what it might be. When abortion is legal it is not a baby that is viable with a complete set of working organs and systems. That comes later at about the time abortion is mo longer legal. You said By the fourth week (about the time you realize you are pregnant) the baby has all major organs and a heart beat. So what you say is just not true. It is a fact a heart resting outside the body is not considered to be functional. Since the organs that it would be sending blood to are also incomplete this is not much of a problem. By comparison without my organs, skin, skeleton oxygen or nervous system including a brain I doubt I would be thriving because I would be dead. So it is not the same as me, it has some organs, non of which are complete, but yes the heart beats. Even though it it didn't it wouldn't make much of a difference. You implied at 4 weeks its a little person. . That is what I said What are you talking about? I said DNA is like the blue prints for a house. They are instructions not what is made by their execution. Not disputing that A tree sapling looks like a miniature tree. Everything it needs to survive it has. At 4 weeks an an embryo has lumps that will later be organs, but at 4 weeks they are blobs of cells. It looks nothing like a human, but more importantly it cannot survive outside of the womb. At 4 weeks it may not survive inside the womb. So yes at some point my house analogy will no longer apply, about the time the house would be finished be when the baby is born. Then each is fully and accurately described using the terms baby and house. First red flag. Science people don't give the same thing two names. If it has two names its because it isn't one thing. Now we can call them widgets for all I care I am not making a distinction to try and confuse the issue. I do so because words have meaning and both overt and subtle. You insist it is a human being, even though for this part of the discussion that is to broad a description. A human being includes adults, teens, toddlers, infants, seniors and a number of others that are not a part of what we are talking about. We both know this, but while yes they can be called human beings embryo and fetus are more accurate. It is easier even if subconsciously to defend a human being than an embryo. You are right there should be no argument, but I think it important that we have the same understanding of certain words. As you can see below science does make a distinction and that distinction happens to be the development of those organ and systems I stated earlier. Honestly, I don't make this stuff up to try and sneak something by. Science Dictionary embryo (m'br-') Pronunciation Key An animal in its earliest stage of development, before all the major body structures are represented. In humans, the embryonic stage lasts through the first eight weeks of pregnancy. In humans, other placental mammals, and other viviparous animals, young born as embryos cannot thrive. In marsupials, the young are born during the embryonic stage and complete their development outside the uterus, attached to a teat within the mother's pouch. Obviously abortion is currently not considered murder, however, in many states someone else killing the unborn baby would be considered murder. As for what I think the criminal penalties should be, I really don't wish to argue that at this point as it isn't relevant to my point. Science Dictionary fetus (f'ts) Pronunciation Key The unborn offspring of a mammal at the later stages of its development, especially a human from eight weeks after fertilization to its birth. In a fetus, all major body organs are present. I don't think abortion should be a form of birth control. I don't support late term abortions unless there is a some health concern either to mother or child. I think there is a brief period the least amount of harm, not none, is done that will permit a woman to decide what the rest of her life will be like. There are very few things that carry life long consequences. Marriage and career can but not like becoming a parent especially for a young unwed woman. Statistically she is more likely to live at or below poverty, if she was in school she likely will not complete it for a number of years if at all. She will often been looked upon with pity or as a reason someone else can be thankful they are not her. Most employers will not appreciate her needs with regards to the care of the child. She is likely to suffer from lower self esteem and depression. Many opportunities will no longer be available to her. Her male child has a good chance to have legal problems and not finish high school. Her female child is less likely to have legal problems, but more than makes up for that with a higher chance of becoming pregnant in her teens. She will likely rely on day care or a public school system to provide guidance and teaching of basic social skills as she will need to provide for both their needs. The guidance will most likely some from peers who will have more influence than the overworked, under qualified teacher at the barely adequate school they are likely to attend. This of course this is not every case and the pitfalls are not all or none. A women may face none of them or just one or two or all. But odds are that to some degree that is what her life will look like. I don't think our society is improved or or made better by this. I don't think I have the right to impose this life or anything that resembles it on another person. When you say you are for protecting a human being from being harmed by another you are assuming that human wants you to do so and the harm being prevented outweighs the harm that prevention will cause. I know there is no way to ask and in such cases we error to the side of caution, but it doesn't change the fact that it is a belief that is being used to invalidate the very real rights of the woman as well as impose obligations upon her against her will. In some instances this is only made harsher by the fact that she became pregnant either against her will or despite taking precautions. In principal I agree with you. It just reality adds shades of grey to your black or white scenario and it is that gray that pushes me the other direction at this point. This is a choice of the lesser of two evils with not much to be happy about either way.","when-life-begins","01:34 AM","abortion-debates","134"
