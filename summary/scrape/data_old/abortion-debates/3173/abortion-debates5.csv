"09-29-2004","3173",5,"syklopps61","None","Just out of curiosity, would any of you support abortions based on what the child might look like, or what sex they are? I mean, what if a female fetus was considered useless and a drain and there were mass abortions based solely on that?","Sigma","68954","Nope, I wouldn't support that.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","12:05 AM","abortion-debates","61"
"09-29-2004","3173",5,"syklopps61","None","Well, I appreciate your honesty at least. Seems to me to be somewhat contradictory in the sense that you have admitted that abortions are a matter of convenience. So, not having a female child could be considered a convenience to the woman/parents, or a woman/parents might absolutley HATE red hair....why is this any different from your argument? And I mean the CONVENIENCE part","Sigma","68987","I wouldn't support it, but it is none of my business.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:33 AM","abortion-debates","63"
"09-29-2004","3173",5,"syklopps61","None","MY GOD, PLEASE tell me that you hold politicians to this same criteria then!!! I know this is a little off the topic, but it needs to be said...we have Liberal politicians and activists who claim to care for the poor and starving, push for policies to ""help"" these people, but do little or NOTHING to change the problem themselves, i.e., taking the poor in, giving enough money DIRECTLY from their own pocket to feed a starving family. We Conservatives are considered EVIL because we DON'T push the policies, but rather prefer doing things on our own to help. I expect to get a few laughs from your side on that one, but seems to me if the shoe fits....Do you consider the Democrats/Liberals saviors of the poor? Seeing my point, no doubt you will say no, but then that wouldn't be consistent with a Liberal way of thinking","sinjin","68999","I trust that there are both Conservatives and Liberals giving directly to the ""poor"". I don't know how consistently liberal I am but I do not consider Conservatives ""evil"". If private donation can be said to have not solved the ""problem"" since it persists, I don't see any other solution than to have some level of governmental intervention. The fact that no perfect solution has been found does not suggest that all support should be abandoned. I do not subscribe to the conservative notion that everyone can ""lift themselves by their bootstraps"" given there are many without boots.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","10:29 AM","abortion-debates","64"
"09-29-2004","3173",5,"syklopps61","None","Well up until he was running for President, Kerry didn't seem to care much at all about charities. But anyway.... . Well, considering that trillions have been spent ""helping"" the poor, I would say that that can be labeled as a HUGE failure. And no doubt not all Conservatives take people into their home, but then again, we don't make that a cornerstone of our beliefs, and Liberals do. And I beg to differ, we all have bootstraps, we just have different levels of motivation","sinjin","69015","Do you believe lack of motivation explains why we have the poor?","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","11:56 AM","abortion-debates","67"
"09-29-2004","3173",5,"syklopps61","None","It's certainly a factor. There have been poor that have made it big, have there not? Are you going to say that they made it on luck alone?","sinjin","69019","Do you believe that since some poor have ""made it big"" that it can be inferred that anyone can?","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","12:05 PM","abortion-debates","69"
"09-29-2004","3173",5,"syklopps61","None","I think everybody has within them an ability to become successful to the point of not being a drain on society","sinjin","69031","I agree but that wasn't the question. Conservatives are big on the ""rags to riches"" mythology and you are talking ""rags to thrift store"". IMO veiled contempt for the less fortunate is a cornerstone of conservative idealogy and the reason I cannot be one. It strikes me as a form of ""manifest destiny"". If the strong don't seek to protect and uplift the weak then what sort of people are they? I do not share values with these people.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","01:01 PM","abortion-debates","71"
"09-29-2004","3173",5,"syklopps61","None","I think I answered the question directly. I would add that the ""rags to riches"" saying is used more because it just rolls off the tongue and sounds better (can't remember the literary word for it...alliteration?) Besides, according to the government, ""riches"" would be about $75K per year, and I don't think that's an unobtainable goal You have a very and overly critical opinion of Conservatives, so I can't really accept what you said in a recent post that you don't consider Conservatives to be evil. You MUST if you believe that a cornerstone to our beliefs is one of contempt for those less fortunate. I'm FAR from rich, but have no jealousy or contempt for those who are BETTER off than myself, unlike some. . Perfect timing for this statement because it gets us back to abortion, Conservatives ARE seeking to protect the weak that don't have a voice, that sounds to me to be THE most compassionate thing a person can do. Now, regarding the ""weak"" and poor in society, there is also nothing MORE compassionate than to have the faith and confidence in them and the opportunities this country holds that they CAN become better than they are. There is nothing more sad than keeping a person down and beating it into them that they have NO chance to become better unless someone GIVES it to them","sinjin","69043","I don't think it makes one ""evil"" to believe those less fortunate probably earned and are deserving of their fates. This society largely presumes you are a more worthwhile citizen as demonstrated by your wealth. Hard work and some luck has made many a success but hard work and no luck can produce the opposite. As far as ""giving it to them"" I can only say that most successful people were ""given"" by their family exactly the needed support and advice that is lacking in most poor/uneducated families. How can this cycle be broken without ""giving""? To get back on topic I have always been unwilling to grant full status as citizen to a collection of a few dozen cells with no demonstrable sentience. It may be life, even human life, but a person, not IMO.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","02:07 PM","abortion-debates","73"
