"10-05-2008","3173",10,"Phyllis","326450","The meaning of slavery in the 13th amendment is the meaning that term had when the amendment was adopted. The United States banned slavery as it was defined by everyone in 1865. They did not ban slavery as you define it here in 2008.","chester","326452","What a tautology. Of course not; the authors of 13A were writing for their time and their experiences. Do you expect Americans in the 21st Century to be bound by the meanings of words as they were used in the 19th? The 1905 definition of uranium was ""a worthless white metal whose oxides are sometimes used for tinting glass."" Should we be bound by that definition today? If so, we should cease worrying about Ahmedinijad immediately. All he wants to do is work in his stained glass works.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","07:29 PM","abortion-debates","139"

"10-05-2008","3173",10,"Phyllis","326450","I don't know why I need to prove it has a mental state beyond reflex. I don't know why you are linking the presence of a will with the presence of a mental state. I was prone to think that the folks who were stretching the definition of slavery in the 13th Amendment beyond any recognition would be the ones attempting to make an appeal to emotion. The problem is not everyone breathes all the time. I also suppose that a person unable to breathe due to some medical emergency would still be a person. The point is, a person is a person before they touch the ground. Believe it or not, there are plenty of people walking around in the world who have never had a social security card. a person can be charged with homicide for deliberately causing the death of a fetus absent the exception of abortion. In other words, you saw how ridiculous your slavery claim was, and therefore tried to change the subject I'm not trying to force my agenda or will upon the fetus.","Colonel Ingus","326456","You don't, if you are arguing for fruits, vegetables, or inanimate objects. Prove you can have one without the other. In order to have free will one must have the power of making free choices. A ZEF cannot make a choice, and you are trying to take the pregnant woman's choice away from her. Fact is, anti-choicers seem to think that ONLY THEY have the right to decide what is right for all parties involved, even though they have nothing to do what-so-ever with anyone involved. Well you go right ahead and use emotion as your guiding light. I'm sure I'm not the only one here using your nonsensical responses as entertainment, and we thank you for that as there is nothing good on TV Oh so you want to play word games? I should have known. After all anti-choice = word games. Perhaps I should have used the phrase ""act of breathing"" instead. Yes they would be known as a DEAD person. Dead people are not treated the same as a living person, so thanks for proving my point ( again ). No, a person is a person after they have been born. Big difference. Ahh... but we are not talking about people in the world, we are talking about slavery in the U.S. - I know it's hard for you but please, try and focus. You forgot to mention that it was anti-choicers who pushed that law. Thank you. First of all the slavery topic is logical and valid. Second of all it was YOU who tried to change the subject from fetuses to born children. Let's keep this in chronological order shall we? Of course you are. By trying to manipulate the pregnant woman you are doing just that. So we'll ask you again, If a fetus has no will as you suggest, then why are you trying to FORCE your agenda and will upon it and the woman who is carrying it?","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","08:53 PM","abortion-debates","141"
"10-05-2008","3173",10,"Phyllis","326458","I am not trying to force my agenda or will, through the law, upon the fetus. I am trying to force my agenda and will, through the law, upon anyone who would do harm to the fetus--to include women, men, and physicians--because it is the right thing to do, just as the abolitionists' imposing their agenda and will, through the law, upon slave owners and traders was the right thing to do.","chester","326459","Except that, in this case, you are on the side of the slavers and the slave catchers.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","10:00 PM","abortion-debates","143"
"10-05-2008","3173",10,"Phyllis","326453","For purposes of Constitutional interpretation, I absolutely do.","chester","326460","Believe what you want. Fortunately, that belief carries no legal weight and places you far outside the mainstream of Constitutional interpretation. Besides which, unless you are a member of the SCOTUS or an avatar, your opinion is meaningless. You can't help but think in absolutes, can you? Even your quote shows it. The Creons, Torquemadas, and Jauverts would recognize a kindred spirit. Is that the company you wish to keep?","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","10:02 PM","abortion-debates","144"
"10-06-2008","3173",10,"None","None","None","chester","326467","OK then. Let's see what you make of the 1791 words of 1A which say "" NO LAW "". Are you ready to advocate for the dissemination of kiddie porn, or have the words "" NO LAW "" changed meaning over time so that they no longer mean not a single, solitary law ? BTW, I can think of others who believed in absolutes - Mao, Louis XVI, Bismarck, Stalin, Hitler, Pinochet, Jaruzelski, and Kim Jong-Il. On balance, I think they more than cancel out your list. Be that as it may, there simply is no getting around the fact that profetallifers wish to keep pregnant women in slavery to their fetuses and that they are willing to sacrifice women on the altar of their fetuses.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","08:54 AM","abortion-debates","146"
"10-06-2008","3173",10,"None","None","None","smiley","326469","The biggest danger in the belief that there is an ""absolute truth"" is going on to believe that you know this ""absolute truth"", and then trying to impose your truth on others.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:28 AM","abortion-debates","147"
"10-06-2008","3173",10,"None","None","None","Galactababe","326476","One cannot be a ""slave"" to a tiny human being one helped create. That is the stupidest thing I've ever seen come out of CapO's mouth.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","12:28 PM","abortion-debates","149"
"10-06-2008","3173",10,"Phyllis","326472","Aside from the fact that the 1st Amendment applies only to Congress, ""the freedom of speech"" has never been an absolute. Treason, for instance.","chester","326477","Please don't show the entire forum your lack of knowledge of the Constitution by writing drivel such as this. Treason is the only crime defined in the Constitution, in Article 3 to be precise. If you took the time to read it, you would see that it dealt with ACTS, not speech. Besides which, why not tell us just exactly how, in light of the words NO LAW in the First Amendment, speech can be, under your absurd idea that the words of the Constitution, restricted , except by others interpreting those words. Kinda knocks your pet theory into a cocked hat, I would say. You want the words to be unchanging when they support your warped POV, but flexible when they do not. NICE!! Further, the dissemination of kiddie porn IS a Federal crime, so it would seem that all prosecutions by the Federal government must cease forthwith.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","12:54 PM","abortion-debates","150"
