Not sure about you, but I've never seen anyone being deomted or fired for being a hardworker","GeekGirl","69138","They may not be demoded or fired but they can be layed off. I teach in an very low socio economic area. I can tell you that there are success stories when it comes to rags to riches (my dad is one of them), however he grew up in a stable two parent home and was well educated (thanks in part to our awesome public education but thats another story). I see that a lot of times my students come from very unstable homes (drugs, rapes, young siblings murdered in the street, foster homes, youname it and they've seen it). Its difficult to have these students focus on learning that the tectonic plates of the earth are shifting because of the convection currents in the lithosphere (6th grade Earth Science) when they are worried about dad beating up mom...or mom's going to jail for cutting the neighbor, etc. It becomes a vicious cycle that very few can break out of because this type of lifestyle does affect you psychologically. They are poor, not because they want to be poor. Sometimes they just don't know how to get out of the poverty. Its all they know! Last year I took my students on a field trip to the beach. I work in Los Angeles County about 30 minutes driving distance from the beach. You should have heard the stunning silence that came accross the school bus when they saw the beach and then the loud ""WOW!"" 10 of my students (35 total) had never seen the beach in real life until that moment. Field trips are hard to come by these days (They don't make it easy for teachers to take kids on field trips either)... Anyway, my point was poverty can sometimes be a cycle. If its all you've known you are more likely to fall into it because you have not been exposed to anything else. As for the picking yourself up by the straps of your own boots...Its a cute idea but when you don't have any straps on your boots, no food, or safe shelter then Maslow's hierarchy of needs comes into play...","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:34 PM","abortion-debates","77"
"09-29-2004","3173",6,"syklopps61","None","But why? Please, I'm dying to know","Sigma","69145","Which? Why I wouldn't support it or why it's none of my business?","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","11:12 PM","abortion-debates","79"
"09-29-2004","3173",6,"syklopps61","None","Yep, sure can, but that can happen to anybody at any level anyway And with all due respect, there are many ""sob"" stories out there, but the fact still remains that it's not the government's job to pick up where bad parents leave off. And I'm sorry...""awesome public school system""? ROTFLMAO the one that has put our country behind so many others in an area we USED to excel in? Anyway, you're right, a whole other story LOL I'm sure as a teacher you've heard how ""white"" it is to study and be smart...that's the fault of WHOM?","GeekGirl","69148","I've never heard a kid say its ""white"" to study and be smart. And I did say public school had its problems but I think it is awesome. We make an attempt to teach EVERYONE, what other school system gives that a shot? (No mistake...there is a lot of room for improvement...but nonetheless)... Anyway back to abortion...","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","11:40 PM","abortion-debates","80"
"09-30-2004","3173",6,"syklopps61","None","Well, I thought obviously, going back to the original question, I was referring to why you don't support it","Sigma","69199","It's not something I would do, and don't believe others should as well. I just don't believe it's a good reason :P That is not to say that I would make a law against it, because I wouldn't unless it becomes a problem in our culture. Even then, I would want to change the attitudes that lead to that decision, not take away that decision.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","10:00 AM","abortion-debates","83"
"10-01-2004","3173",6,"None","None","None","syklopps61","69393","Sigma, I sure hope everything is okay...I mean, for a while there we were exchanging comments several times a day and then suddenly you haven't been around. I sure hope you haven't grown bored, I thought that my last comment might spice things up a bit. I'm sure it's just a coincidence that you haven't commented since I brought up this last point ;-)","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","08:21 AM","abortion-debates","85"
"10-01-2004","3173",6,"syklopps61","None","There have been millions of babies aborted and THAT qualifies as a problem, no other way you can categorize it. So, maybe you guys need to change the attitudes that cause you to kill innocent babies .","kickin50","69413","Back to freedom of religion. Change the attitudes? You mean change your religion. I've never had an abortion and luckily never had to even make that decision. Finding out there's a baby coming is a wonderful exciting experience. But, I leave room for those who simply aren't excited. And I leave room for those who simply say no. I don't want a baby. When a woman says no, a pro-lifer's answer is always a right-wrong, good-bad, innocence-guilt judgment. I do have religion in my life, but I don't feel it's my responsibility to force it on others. Some don't believe. Period. I have enough religion to say that God will decide right-wrong, good-bad, innocence-guilt. He doesn't need my help. I have faith in His ability to handle it. I also have enough religion to say that IF that was a life (I'm not so sure), and IF it has a soul, and IF it has not yet taken on original sin, the baby's well being isn't in jeopardy. True faith can be very calming.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:34 AM","abortion-debates","86"
"10-01-2004","3173",6,"syklopps61","None","Oh, so one's financial situation (remember, this does not only apply only to the poor, you have either flat out said or inferred that it's up to the mother whether she should have to support a child she doesn't want) IS a good reason? Because she would be inconvenienced for a few months (remember, in MOST cases women do not suffer long term health problems from pregnancy) IS a good reason? How so, because YOU say so? You probably don't see that what you just said easily applies to those of us against abortion. There have been millions of babies aborted and THAT qualifies as a problem, no other way you can categorize it. So, maybe you guys need to change the attitudes that cause you to kill innocent babies. That last part-""not take away the decision""-was thrown in to cover your butt to make it appear you are being consistent with not making laws taking away a woman's ""right"". I'm sorry, your stance on this is the height of hypocrisy By the way, I notice you go into NO detail as to WHY it's something that YOU wouldn't do and that people SHOULDN'T do...interesting","Sigma","69415","Since it is my opinion, of course it's because I say so. Why shouldn't women have abortions... because you say so? Cover my butt? I truly believe I have no right to tell women what to do with their bodies. Surely, you have your opinion, and I have mine. You believe you should tell women what to do with their own bodies, I do not. This is why we have a debate. I fully realize that when I say ""I do not agree with this"" that you will say ""well I don't agree with that !"". However, I don't think I should be able to tell women what to do while you do. I believe that it is a problem as well, but I do not believe outlawing abortion is a solution since it will not stop unwanted pregnancies. I believe stopping unwanted pregnancies will stop abortions. How am I a hypocrite? I believe I had shown you to be a hypocrite with my arguments earlier. Is it important? I am not trying to change the law to make it illegal, so I don't really need a reason I believe the way I do; it's a personal belief. Unless you want to debate it, of course, but that gets us off the main topic of the legality of abortions in general.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:49 AM","abortion-debates","87"

Plus, I've been going out a lot more with my SO with all the money I've been making with my new job :P I like debating this, no worries","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:52 AM","abortion-debates","88"
"10-01-2004","3173",6,"syklopps61","None","Well, you ARE entitled to your opinion, no matter how wrong it is :-D I believe I have given a logical answer to that in previous posts, that being that an innocent life is being snuffed out. So it seems to me that one should err on the safe side and let a life grow to it's full potential. YOU on the other hand have still NOT provided any rational reason for the obvious inconsistency you have in your argument, merely saying it's your opinion doesn't quite cut it That's clear, you are saying it's okay to have an abortion so that the woman doesn't have to put up with the inconvenience of raising the child and all the hassles it entails, and for financial reasons as well, but yet you DON'T think it's okay to end a life based on gender or how the child may look, etc.... I think it happens to be VERY important, it helps us to understand the TRUE reasons behind your support for abortion as it is today...adds to your credibility..or lack thereof ;-) I'd love to, thought you'd never ask!","Sigma","69554","We've debated that already, though. You believe the way you believe, and I believe the way I believe. Unless something new is brought to the table, we know where each other stands. Actually, the only opinion I've given you is that I don't believe choosing for hair color. There are many instances I don't believe abortions should be performed, especially cosmetic reasons. Whatever reasons I believe aren't good ones for abortions are just my opinion and have no bearing on whether I believe abortion should be legal. I don't ""support"" abortion. I am against making it illegal, but I have no love for abortion. I believe it's a necessary choice. Ok. Not my favorite way to debate but I guess I'll give it a go.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:01 PM","abortion-debates","90"
