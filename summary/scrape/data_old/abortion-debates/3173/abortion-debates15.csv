Do you really believe that exterminating 6 million Jews is just as moral as liberating an entire race from the institution of slavery? I will say again, if you cannot answer this very easy question of morality, then you have no credibility when speaking to the morality of the slightly more complicated issue of abortion. If you can't tell us that exterminating 6 million innocent people is absolutely wrong, why should we take your view that government should not intrude in the issue of abortion with any weight at all? If it is just as moral to exterminate 6 million innocent people as it would be not to exterminate 6 million innocent people, then for all we know, it is just as moral for government to intervene in abortion as it would be for it not to intervene.","chester","327008","I'm glad YOU think it's an ""easy question of morality."" They always are for those of limited reasoning ability. I'm with Archie; there are no absolutes in the world, and your feeble attempt to pretend that there are simply shows that you and your ilk are incapable of contemplating more that one perspective at a time. Life, fortunately for all of us, cannot be compartmentalized into such neat boxes. This is precisely why the decision of whether or not to continue her pregnancy must needs be left to each pregnant woman. Now, what objective standards would you use to to determine who was more immoral - Stalin or Hitler. Now, what objective standards would you use to determine that the US was correct in allying itself with Stalin to fight Hitler insead of vice versa. Alyssa Rosenbloom, probably known to you as Ayn Rand, is dead, as are her warped ideas. I used to think she was on to something; then I grew up.

I have said that it has occurred in my own family and we wouldn't trade her for the world. But even knowing and loving Dina as we do, If my sister had been given the option before receiving her, that she had the option to have an asian or a caucasian child, which would she prefer, she would have chosen the caucasian. As would most all adoptive parents given the option. This is a common sense issue and arguing it is childish as you well know that what I'm saying is basic human nature but in no way is criticizing inter-racial adoption as wrong. And that wasn't the reason I originally made the statement either. I made it only as a personal preference issue for adoptive parents if so many children weren't killed through abortion.

From there one can read the thread in context and see clearly that this debate was specifically about the preferences of adoptive parents in adopting children of their own race and ethnicity, and the unavailability of choice due to the holocaust of abortion. No where in that discussion was the issue of ""MORAL ABSOLUTES"" ever raised or discussed at all. POST 16 clarifies the point I was making very well. But again, morality wasn't the issue at all. Nor was I saying that there were no moral absolutes in this world or anywhere at all as that wasn't the subject being debated. [ Post 16 by Archangel ] Jo, we live in a world where there are exceptions to every rule for ONE reason or another. So your example doesn't conflict with my point at all. But my point stands and could be confirmed by polling every adoptive couple who seeks a baby in any given year. The vast majority of any race polled, to the tune of 99% I would wager, would say that if given their first preference, they would prefer a child of their own race. Of course, if that isn't possible due to the high number of abortions which limit the number of babies that are available, loving parents of any race will take babies of any race. My point isn't racist at all, it is acknowledging reality and the human nature which causes us to be drawn to those who look like we do. That is an inherent human characteristic that goes back to our very roots. You people are so blinded by modern day political correctness that you've lost the ability to be socially honest or objective. Note the bolded, it was this sentence which caused me to make the statement regarding no absolutes. And it is plain to see that it had nothing at all to do with moral absolutes. But you know what's going to make you look even more pathetic? That you'll continue to defend your abuse of what I said in order to attempt to make it look like we agree on something. Even though I am here in person calling you a blatant liar for ripping what I say out of context. You are so sick and twisted that you will attempt to tell me what I meant at the time.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","10:10 AM","abortion-debates","217"
"10-09-2008","3173",15,"None","None","None","Another opinion","327030","Jumping into the fray here, I would disagree with the idea of moral absolutes but, at the same time, I would aknowledge that there are clear trends in moral views throughout humanity based at least partly on human nature. Where moral absolutes are concerned, the problem, of course, is WHICH moral rules one chooses to be absolute. Different religions have different moral rules, all of whose proponents consider those absolute since they have trust that their religion reflects the truth. Similarly, 18th and 19th century discussions on natural rights often ran into the problem that philosophers (as well as politicians and laymen) disagreed on which rights would be considered absolute. Major problems are encountered if one tries to base ideas of moral absolutes on either religious belief or gut feeling. However, just because morality does not work in absolutes, that does not mean that there are no trends in people's moral beliefs. One trend that is VERY common is the idea that one should treat others as one would expect to be treated. It has many versions - ranging from the Golden Rule, to the phrase so often heard by parents telling their children ""How would YOU like it if that happened to you..."". Since our human experiences of physical and emotional suffering are similar, independent of the context, this would automatically lead to trends in moral rules - against murder, theft, etc. Most of the rest of moral judgement rests on value judgements, and these value judgements often depend on ones initial assumptions, on knowledge one has about the moral situation in question, on the traditions one was brought up with, etc. For example, a major value judgement that determines ones view on first trimester abortion rights is whether one places higher value on a woman's right to her own body (pro-choice) or on the life of a human body that will develop into a person but, up to that point, is merely a body (pro-life). Taking the example of the Holocaust or slavery, both of these situations were situations where large groups of people were caused significant suffering, where the imposition of that suffering was not necessary and was justified by illogical racist arguements (i.e. that Jews were evil, or that blacks were so mentally incapable that they needed to be governed through slavery). Therefore, most of us could imagine how injust it would be if we were placed in that situation, so we condemn such actions.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","10:29 AM","abortion-debates","218"

But all of that is irrelevant to what is actually absolute morality in reality. The great flaw in peoples reasoning is that if they don't accept something as true, right, real or moral, then it doesn't exist to them. That type of thinking is self delusion. It's like atheists insisting there is no God. They are actually ignorant enough to believe that there is no God because they say there isn't one. None of which changes the fact that our Creator God is alive and well on Planet Earth and intimately involved with us and human history. So it is with morality, these simpletons can believe that the right to abortion is somehow absolute because it's the woman's body which carries the child, but that is just more self delusion no matter what the man made law say's. Because that unborn child is a developing HUMAN BEING which will surely grow into a sentient being if only allowed to complete the gestation period of 9 months. And the only rational and reasonable absolute choice the woman has in that situation is the control over her body not to have that unprotected sex, or sex at all if getting pregnant is going to be a problem for her. Once she gets pregnant, the choice of absolute control over her own body is long gone because NOW there is another totally innocent life in the equation, and that innocent life trumps her right to control over her body. THAT IS THE MORAL PERSPECTIVE WHICH THE CHESTERS, PENFOLDS, S&Ps AND INGUSES REFUSE TO ADMIT TO. And that is because they have no moral center beyond there own very shallow personal opinions.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","10:56 AM","abortion-debates","219"
"10-09-2008","3173",15,"Another opinion","327041","I am happy for you that you should have the confort of feeling that sense of certainty. Most people don't. Most people need some level of evidence to be able to have certainty in a particular idea - be it religious or secular. Secular humanists will not believe in any view with any degree of confidence unless evidence exists. Most people are somewhere in between in that they take some level of a leap of faith, even without evidence. It is a minority of people that have strong confidence in belief despite evidence. Even the Bible aknowledges this doubt from lack of evidence as a problem and has a type of sympathy toward the disciple ""doubting Thomas"". The problem with moral absolutes is that many people claim to have the list of absolute moral rules, and these moral rules often differ greatly from each other (between different religions, between different natural rights philosophers, etc.). Your moral certainty seems to come from the spiritual enlightment you say you went through. Unfortunately, nobody can experience the spiritual enlightment that you went through for themselves and, since many others equally claim spiritual enlightment but with different conclusions, an outside observer could not tell which, if any, were true revelations. So, they have to go by evidence and reason. Nevertheless, one overlap between religious and secular moral philosophies is essentially the Golden Rule. That, at least, can be a starting point of moral discussions to try to reach a consensus. There are various value judgements that happen during a pregnancy and decision whether or not to abort. The side of a choice for abortion might include: - The negative consequences of giving birth to and bringing up a child in adverse circumstances (which could include a woman never getting the chance to then have an education to get out of poverty, could include forcing her existing family into poverty by having ""too many mouths to feed"", etc.). - The negative consequences of giving birth to and adopting out a child, where many women feel a lifelong guilt about adopting out their child, which is understandable since (though many people are supportive) most people in society find it hard to imagine how anyone can give up a child. - The anger at feeling that ones rights are infringed upon when on is forced to carry a child against ones will. - Dire circumstances of rape, incest, major risk to health or life, etc. The side of a choice against abortion might include: - Religious beliefs about the sanctity of life at all stages. - Aknowledgement that the early fetus will, if left alone, become a person like one of us which translates into a value of that potential. - Recognition that, in late term, the fetus might ALREADY have emotions, thoughts, the ability to suffer and feel pain, etc. There are values on both sides that are balanced. For the most part, I agree with pro-choice advocates that the mother is in the best position to decide - especially since it is HER body we are talking about. However, in late term, I would agree that TWO people are now involved, not just one, so the state has some right to get involved and make its own value judgements. Addressing a different point you made, when women have sex, they know that they risk pregnancy but that doesn't mean that they are agreeing that, if they become pregnant, they will carry the pregnancy to term. If one is walking in a bad neighborhood, one knows that one risks getting mugged. That doesn't mean that one agrees to be mugged.","Archangel","327069","You're ignoring the fact that it matters not in reality what they don't believe is real or true, because it doesn't change what is real or true in any way, shape or form. Truth surpasses all human understanding and even though I claim to understand the absolute scriptural morality of the bible, neither I nor any human being can fully grasp or appreciate the fullness of Gods truths. I just happen to understand that absolute morality exists at all which is more than most secular humanists believe which has been asserted by chester on multiple occasions here. Again, I know this is what they argue. Without evidence they are free to ignore absolute truths. But that ignorance of the absolute in no way nullifies it or negates its ultimate result as absolute truth. It's like the law say's that ignorance is no excuse for breaking the law. So it is with the eternal truths which are as real as the physical laws which secular humanists accept as real and undeniable. Actually millions upon millions of believers in Christ have had similar experiences to mine which proved to them that they are not alone in this life. I am definitely not alone in my personal experiences. Only my experiences are unique as they specifically apply to me, but many have experienced similar events that proved to them that both God and absolute spiritual truths are as real as the physical laws which guide Gods Creation. Actually, the Golden Rule is taken directly from the bible, but has been adopted and applied by secularists, as have most every single moral principle by which humanity lives by in order to maintain an orderly Society. The only aspect of Gods moral principles which is being erased from Society today is God Himself are atheists and secularists who desire to elevate MAN to the position of our own moral guides. This of course is leading to a society of amoral and narcissistic hedonists who believe that if it feels right to that person, then it must be ok to do it. Then adopt it out! Are you actually arguing that the guilt of adopting out a healthy child is greater than knowing she killed her own child in the womb, thereby denying it any life at all? I need evidence that such a scenario is rational, much less likely. You mean the anger of being forced to be responsible for their own actions? Do you feel sympathy for the murderer who is sorry they got caught and are facing the legal consequences for their crime? I have never argued against the validity of abortion under certain extreme circumstances. This is changing the goal posts for the sake of this debate. You're just stating the obvious here. Again, the moral issue you are ignoring is that it is no longer her body which she is responsible for. It is now an unborn child which will surely grow into a sentient being if allowed to grow which is inside of her. You are arguing a false point since we all know that from the point of the egg being fertilized, it is inevitable that if allowed to complete the gestation cycle, it will result in the birth of a child wich carries the combined genetic features of both parents. To deny that is to deny the reality of what is growing in her womb. Irrelevant! they have the responsibility, along with their partner to be responsible only over their own bodies. Once a child is conceived, they have no right to end its life for the sake of their own personal convenience when that choice ends the life of an innocent bystander which the child is since it played no active part in its own conception. You are no different than the other pro abortion apologists when you seek to force that innocent child to pay the ultimate price for their irresponsibility.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","01:47 PM","abortion-debates","221"

In the real world, the question of personhood is purely metaphysical, permitting of no answer, let alone no absolute answer, except the one formed by each individual based upon her/his values, morals, and experiences. Speaking of absolute morality, is the woman who escaped with others from Bergen-Belsen a murderer is she smothers her crying infant in order to save the rest from being discovered? How can anyone possibly say there is a single answer to that question. Second scenario: A group of children is playing on a railroad track. Unbeknownst to them, a rail car has broken loose and is hurtling toward them. You have the power to turn a switch that will divert the car onto another track. The problem is that, by so doing, the car will hit a homeless person sleeping between the rails (BTW, it is a commonly held belief among tramps that a snake will not cross a track.). Murder or not?

This talk about downplaying the humanity of the unborn because they haven't taken a breath yet, or implying that it's a parasite because it draws protein from its mother is both disingenuous and an inaccurate description of what a fetus is.
