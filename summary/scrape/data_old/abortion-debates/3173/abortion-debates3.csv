I doubt that throughout history, the definition of murder falls much closer to how I defined it, more than the way YOU defined it. Yours is just a convenient twisting of words in order to have a definition satisfy you so that you can sleep comfy at night. Pretty weak actually","Sigma","68504","...

"09-25-2004","3173",3,"syklopps61","None","C'mon, don't try to defend your assumption and then put others down for making their own! You EASILY could have made your point about killing an intruder whether or not I was ""pro-gun"", so don't get righteous with me Well IF you mean civilized people compared to the animals in the Middle East, then I would agree, but without an absolute in society it begins to decay. When we can all go around with our own set of rules, how can a society survive? Now, if you are juvenile and still have a problem with authority, then I guess you wouldn't agree with that statement. Anyway, I said this originally because I took your comment to mean that I was somehow a terrible person for valuing my life and the lives of my family more than that of someone breaking into my home I know I said a guarantee, but I also believe I had said if there is a reasonable expectation as well, so please don't take my words out of context in order to try to prove me wrong. It is REASONABLE to expect that someone committing such an act as breaking into my home, that they are there for a bad reason. I therefore, should not have to sit back and ask what his intentions are, I have the right to ASSUME he is there to do me harm. If you are saying that you are surprised that a cop would have the right to shoot you if you pull a gun on him, then you are more naive than I could have dreamed. Are you really telling me, that if you were a cop, you would wait for someone with a gun to raise it, point it at you and fire, before deciding that they are going to do you harm? Why do you assume that I was dodging your point? Are you that desperate to make one or win one? I didn't want to come right out and criticize the run on sentence, so I just asked you to clarify. IF you are referring to my celebrating over the death of someone who entered my home without permission, how do you come to the conclusion that I'm being hypocritical. Not everyone's life has the same value. People that commit illegal or evil acts against others have forfeited their ""right"" to be treated equally and to me the value of their life is greatly diminished. An innocent life, one that has done NOTHING evil or illegal, has the MOST value as far as I'm concerned, so yes, those innocent lives should be spared. I fail to see the hypocrisy (unless I was desperate to make a point of course, then it becomes obvious LOL) Who is claiming that pregnancy is easy? Have I ever said that? All I have said is that it is a normal biological process for which a woman's body is equipped to handle...if she couldn't, the human race would disappear. Does that mean that some women are unable to have a child safely? Of course not, I never said that EVERY woman on the planet has to lay on her back and spit one kid after another out of her. It is absolutley ridiculous to use this juvenile argument that because a baby obtains nutrients from the mother, and because this affects her health, FOR THE MOST PART DURING (SOME women might be affected afterward) her pregnancy, that somehow taking that innocent life is then justified is...just juvenile, not other polite way to put it. ROTFLAMO!!! Ya know what, when I have the flu, I can't do the things I could BEFORE I had the flu, SOMETIMES the flu kills people. Whya hasn't Congress looked into a law against the FLU? Don't they care about us, those bastards? Why do those of you who believe in killing innocent babies like to throw this in to the debate? It has been acknowledged by MOST people who are ""pro-life"" that if the mother's LIFE is in danger, then an abortion can be justified. You're going to throw it some few instances (like the whacked out chick in Texas who drowned her five kids) that the EVIL man just wanted to use her to spit out as many kids as possible with complete disregard for his wife's health..again, another desperate attempt to make a point Have you ever REALLY stopped to read and think about that statement? LMAO it really IS, without a doubt, THE silliest thing I've ever heard. The death of this country is putting EVERYTHING in legal terms. Then let me ask you, does the fetus CHOOSE to selfishly rob the mother of these nutrients? Oh wait, ignorance of the law is no defense, right? The fetus SHOULD know that it's actions are against the law, right? ROTFLMAO Man, you people think you have a winner of a point, and all I see are people with big clown shoes and orange hair trying to make it. You really don't know how silly you look hiding behind this ""argument"" My job puts stress on MY body, sometimes a lot, sometimes enough to kill people, sometimies not so much LOL I wish, JUST FOR ONCE, you people would just have the courage, without hiding behind silly arguments, to admit that all abortion is is a selfish act so that a woman does not have to be responsible for her actions (i.e., laying on her back with whoever she damn well pleases, afterall, a MAN can do it, so why can't WE, right?). Okay, now don't be disingenuous, you know as well as I do that that ""pig"" of a man that would leave a woman to face ALL the responsibilities by herself should be made to pay dearly. And for your information, the act of having an abortion when it is NOT medically necessary, is the act of someone running away from their responsibilities. IF in fact you really believe a man shouldn't be held responsible I guess I can at least say that you are consistent...and in Bizarro world yours would be a good thing. See, I believe a man SHOULD be responsible, and not ONLY financially...I also think the WOMAN should be responsible and have the child.. I TOO am consistent and I happen to live a place called REALITY Your credibility is GREATLY diminished when you make this statement, even if you only PARTIALLY agree with it. It ALMOST is as silly as the ""robbing nutrients""...maybe not LOL IN order for you to take actions that involve self defense, wouldn't you have to be taking actions against someon who is INTENTIONALLY trying to harm you? You are lying to yourself, it IS out of convenience and YOU know it deep down, but you know if you DO admit it then you have no other leg to stand on. GEEEEEZ, for so long the argument your side had was that the fetus WASN'T life, and since that has been totally blown out of the water you people have had to go to plan B, and you rely on the argument developed by some geeky little attorney or some femi-nazi who hates men. When I was growing up, when your story kept changing, it meant that you were lying...seems now in Bizarro world, it's okay to keep changing your story, if they don't buy this one, we'll keep trying another until they do. I believe the ""pro-life"" argument has remained pretty much the same over the years HUH? Pregnancy IS a natural consequence, isn't it? There is no LEGAL consequence to that. I get the feeling that you are very young, and I can accept blame on behalf of my generation for the way you think. When I was a kid and you did ANYTHING, you accepted the consequences that followed..you learned that there were other things that could happen as a result of my actions. My generation has screwed your mind up, making you believe that there is ALWAYS a way out, no matter what you've done. If you committed a crime, even a minor one, mommy and daddy spent big bucks on a lawyer so your ""good name"" would stay in tact. Now, if you want to interpret a woman not being allowed to commit murder out of convenience as something being a consequence that is legislated, then so be it. All it REALLY boils down to is if you are old enough to lay on your back and you know that pregnancy is a ""natural consequence"" then you have to take responsibility FOR your actions. I know that's not a concept that is recognized in Bizarro world...:-D May I ask you, if I have AIDS and spread the virus to other women, should there be legal consequences to my actions? I mean really, if so, you would be placing ""legal consequences"" on sex, wouldn't you? As long as it's not at the expense of innocent life, I could care less if you want to waste your time on a fruitless search No, you are fighting to allow women to do what they want with total disregard for anybody else ( It really is very simple, then don't lay on your back and put yourself in the position of getting pregnant! Despite what you think, I'm not some old fuddy duddy LOL There ARE other ways of enjoying sex, are there not? If you aren't aware of them, you might want to ask around LOL","Sigma","68509","I tied it in to being ""pro-gun"" because it shows you, in a way you can understand, that the value of human life is subjective depending on the circumstances you are in. Hopefully, it will put a stop to you crowing about how people who are pro-choice do not value human life. No, you are not a terrible person for valuing your life and the lives of your family more than someone breaking into your home. That is a perfectly understandable response that I would share. No clue why you brought up the Middle East. I agree. It is reasonable to think that a person breaking into your home will do you harm if you interfere with that person. It is not a guarantee. I'm not sure what your analogy is with the cop, or what your point is. It was not a run-on sentence. I over-use commas sometimes, but the sentence makes perfect sense if you say it right. You are being hypocritical when you blast pro-choice people, saying that we do not value human life when you yourself do not value the life of an intruder in your home and would in fact celebrate at his death. And this is just assuming he will do you harm. A fetus' rights to live (which it does not have, btw) does not supercede a woman's right to her own body. A fetus lives at the sufferance of the body it occupies. Then you are ignoring the hardships it puts on a woman's body? Why are you able to say to a woman I know its hard but you have to tough it out because I say so . It is a normal biological process that a woman may not want and is able to stop. An STD is a normal biological process for a virus. Your body becomes infected in a ""natural way"". You are allowed to stop it despite it being ""natural"". Not every woman is able to ""handle a pregnancy"" as easily as others. It is not up to you to decide if she still has to. It is up to the woman, and rightly so. It is justified because the fetus does not have the right to take nutrients against the mother's will and without her consent. Why is that hard to understand? And what do you do when you have the flu? Try to get rid of the damn thing don't ya?! I didn't say your wife's life was in danger. I said it debilitated her. She was weakened and in pain; her health was impaired. I said that she did not want to go through that again, that she did not think she could face how bad it made her feel. Do you support legislation that gives her no other choice but to continue with the pregnancy? How stupid is your comparing killing a random person on the street with the intensly personal and integrated nature of pregnancy? The fetus is not a stranger; it is a creature that is attached, drawing energy from the mother and dumping wastes into her system. It is literally living off of her body. This is more comparable to an intruder in your home than a random person on the street. eta, The fetus cannot choose anything, it has no concept of choice. Any and all choices for the fetus are done by the mother. Just because the fetus isn't intentionally harming its mother does not mean it is not harming its mother. Then quit. You can quit. You do not want to allow a woman to ""quit"" the pregnancy, despite any harm that comes to her short of killing her. I am not denying that an abortion is usually a selfish act. So is you killing an intruder. She values her life and her goals in life more than she values the fetus. She values her physical well-being, her emotional well-being, her mental well-being and her financial well-being more than she values the fetus inside of her. Is it wrong? Depends on who you ask. Should selfishness be illegal? You better lock up every single person ever born . I for one can not blame her for looking after herself first, and you are hypocritical when you do blame her for valuing herself more than another. wtf are you going on about? You have some real woman-issues you need to work out when you spout this drivel with no promptings. You continually ignore that abortion is a consequence. It is sometimes easier to face than pregnancy and motherhood which is why it happens. I can understand, since pregnancy and motherhood are life-changing events that should not happen because a woman has no other choice . I agree that men should be responsible, and so should women. However, I also believe that no-one should be a parent because they have no other choice. I strongly believe that every pregnancy and child should be wanted. Your way of forcing motherhood on unwilling people is not the way to do it, imo. Abortion is the responsible choice in some circumstances. Sometimes having a child is not a responsible thing to do. Then you deny that a pregnancy can sometimes kill a woman? It does not have to be intentional. If I am swinging a bat and unintentionally swing it toward you and you knock it out of my hand, are you acting in self-defense? Self-defense is just that, defending yourself from harm, intentional or otherwise. I don't lie, least of all to myself. At least, not intentionally Must have been a result of bad intel. eta, The story does not keep changing. There are just so many compelling reasons to keep abortion legal. Moral grounds, legal grounds, biologic grounds, medical grounds, in nearly every way you can think of there are compelling reasons to keep abortion legal or to allow abortions. Quite a rant. Getting older are we? Abortion is taking responsibility FOR your actions. It is a consequence. You don't like this particular choice, but you cannot deny that it is a possible consequence. Not taking responsibility is not thinking about the future, not thinking about how the pregnancy and childbirth will affect you and your future. In some cases, abortion is the responsible choice. You wish to make motherhood a legal consequence. Pregnancy is a possible consequence to sex, as you say a ""natural"" consequence. Abortion can be a consequence as well, depending on the woman involved and what decision she makes. You wish to make a legal consequence for becoming pregnant which is mandating motherhood. And you would be in favor of telling women to ""deal with it"" since she should have been more careful and really she consented when she had sex didn't she? STDs are a possible consequence for ""laying on her back"". Ah, such a pessimist. Negative, I wish to see that their rights aren't reduced in favor of what is growing inside them. Thank you, I know a bit about sex already I agree that people shouldn't put themselves into positions without thinking about what can happen. Unfortunately, they do. I still do not believe women should be punished for irresponsible behavior by being forced to gestate and give birth.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","11:48 PM","abortion-debates","35"

"09-26-2004","3173",3,"syklopps61","None","Will you deny that your side's argument has ""evolved"" over the years? And will you also deny that there could then be an ""evolution"" of the definition of murder so that it all fits nicely into this newfound argument you all have? OF course you will, I would be floored if you had the guts to admit it!","Sigma","68593","Truly told, I do not know when this legal definition came about, but I sincerely do not believe that it was created after Roe V Wade or tailored for use against pro-life groups. The language of the Constitution is similar, so I believe that laws simply have language such as this. ""Innocence"" is really a subjective concept. If it just means that one has not done anything wrong, then is killing someone who at one time did something wrong legal? No, of course not. So, ""innocent"" is not part of the language. Using the word ""illegal killing"" is much more precise and the legality of the killing can be determined with other laws. Using the word ""person"" is pretty universal as well instead of ""human"" because then you get into sticky ""what exactly makes a human human"" type of debate. ""Person"" is able to be defined without getting into that type of debate. I really think the language is used as it's used because it works without a lot of qualifiers and such.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","08:56 PM","abortion-debates","38"
"09-26-2004","3173",3,"syklopps61","None","You continually and conveniently leave out the part of INNOCENT life, and that of course is what I'M referring to. The guy breaking into my home is not innocent, so therefore his worth is diminished. STOP...THINK LOL I only mentioned this because in post #31 you had said how the value of life varies from person to person, and I was throwing in an example of people from the UNcivilized world who don't value life on ANY level. Are you just ACTING stupid or.... LOL I was making an obvious analogy that killing in self defense is justified as long as there is a REASONABLE expectation that you will be harmed. It's unfortunate that I have to try to simplify things so it's easier for you to understand, and then it becomes too much for you to handle all at once Well, back in my day we knew how to write and had some knowledge of punctuation, sorry I wasn't raised with the lower standards of your generation Honey, I'd swim in his blood with orgasmic glee!!!! You must not be a parent, because you have no idea what a human being is capable of when your family is in danger. Ever see Patriot? The scene when Gibson mutilates the guy? You've got to tie me in my seat during that scene ;-) OH, but wait, you may never know about this because you are so UNselfish as to not have a child...LOL You guys have better brainwashing techniques than the Moonies!!! LOL NOPE, I thought it was clear that I acknowledged the hardships...I'm not really sure I could've put it any more simple than I did All I'm saying is don't get pregnant because I said so :-P Just because one can stop it doesn't mean one should. I will repeat, if you don't want it, don't get pregnant in the first place..is that ALSO too hard to understand for you? Well, it's just silly and juvenile, so in THAT way it's hard to understand Well, TECHNICALLY speaking, you can't get rid of the flu, you can only try to prevent it, and IF you get it you have to endure it God help us...proof of the failure of the public school system. An obvious simple analogy to try to make it easy for you, I wasn't making a real comparison That you would not allow abortion unless a death is guaranteed is sickening and careless of health hazards to women from pregnancy. Would you want me up on murder charges if I killed someone who I just ASSUMED would kill me (NOT the intruder scenario please, talking about someone just walking down the street). There HAS to be a guarantee or a reasonable expectation to justifiable kill someone Okay, her's another SIMPLE analogy, okay? If I kill someone while drunk driving, I don't get the death penalty because it wasn't ""intentional"". So, why does the fetus, which you have acknowledged as being a life, have to have it's life ended, because it selfishly and unintentionally robs the mother of nutrients. Being a good Liberal, I'm sure to you that is an easy thing to do, but for those of us that understand responsibility, it's not that easy. And women that understand the concepts of sacrifice and responsibility willingly endure the hardships for the rewards that follow...but these are things you just can't grasp I will say unequivocally that it is DEAD wrong. I WILL judge you and everyone around me. It's not my job to judge your soul (or lack thereof LOL), but I can sure judge your behavior. There's no law against selfishness but maybe there should be,,,afterall, there IS a law against hate, right? And by the way, it most likely escaped you, but I'm joking (about the law for selfishness anyway, unfortunately you Libs have gotten your law against hate) Why do you immediately assume I have issues with women? Pretty sad tactic. Remember that simple rule..STOP...THINK? It's pretty obvious that I was spelling out what motivates people like you to so rabidly defend the taking of a life. The women's rights movement has brainwashed women into believing they can do everything a man can, and it doesn't stop with the professional world either. They want it with regard to sexual activity. Those dar babies get in the way of their sexual freedom, and THAT'S at least one of the reasons you fight to take an innocent life Anyway, too tired and bored to deal with the rest of this...maybe tomorrow :-D","Sigma","68603","er... whether or not it's an INNOCENT life, the value of a life changes depending on the circumstances you're in. Certainly they value the lives of their brethren more than they value the lives of Americans. But we were talking about that without cops That is why I didn't know why you suddenly brought up cops. Perhaps if you were clear to begin with you wouldn't have to ""simplify things"". I apologize. I will keep my sentence structures simple. ""Honey""? Are we married now? Haven't I said that I agree that a person would consider his or her family more important than an intruder? Why are you behaving like I said your family isn't important? er, ok. Ah, I see... And you are qualified to decide what those hardships justify why? This is a ridiculous pro-life argument. When we are talking about abortion, the woman is already pregnant . What are you are doing is saying that we should have closed the door after the man has escaped . Ok, yeah, we should have closed the door but what do we do now that he has escaped?! Your comment ignores the extremely varied circumstances that women find themselves in. However, whatever the circumstances of her getting pregnant whether it be getting drunk, smoking weed, getting raped, wanting a pregnancy then finding the situation is untenable, wanting a pregnancy and then losing a job, being physically threatened, emotionally abused, any number or any combination of these and other innumerable things, in the end she is still pregnant and we are arguing whether she should be allowed to have an abortion. Of course it doesn't mean one should. However, you cannot argue that it cannot be allowed because it's a ""natural biological process"". That is a really stupid argument. I agree that if you don't want it you shouldn't get pregnant. However, women still get pregnant and then don't want the pregnancy. Sometimes they get pregnant unintentionally, sometimes it is after they are pregnant that they discover that the situation is untenable. Whatever the reason, they are pregnant. Saying well they shouldn't have gotten pregnant ignores the problem. While with pregnancy you can get rid of it Good thing too, sometimes it isn't something a woman wants to endure. ... I said: Then you said: Obviously trying to compare killing someone just walking down the street to abortion. Do you practise being obtuse? Not because it ""selfishly and unintentionally robs the mother of nutrients"" but because the mother is not required to allow it to do that if she does not wish to share her body's resources. The drunk driver is not required to donate his or her kidney if the person they hit needs a kidney, even if he or she caused the accident intentionally or otherwise. (emphasis mine) And unwillingly? If the rewards that follow are not worth the pain now? Oh, I grasp them perfectly, but you undermine your own argument saying what you do. I have no problem with what you say here, I even agree with you to a certain extent. With many women, the pain and sacrifice they go through with pregnancy is rewarded with a child that they did all of this for. However, if the pregnancy is unwanted then the child that they will be presented with at the end is not worth the pain and sacrifice they are going through now . I don't believe in forcing them through that pain and sacrifice unwillingly. Agreed, it's hard to keep from judging people. I know that I can't help but judge you Yeah, hate crime laws are really ridiculous. Virtually all crimes against individuals are motivated at some levels by hate. Having a law against selfishness is the stupidest thing I've ever heard however. Thank goodness you're joking. When you're pulling **** like ""these women just want to act like men"" it makes me think you have some deep-seated issues with women who aren't demure and passive. I believe I told you exactly what is motivating me... and it has nothing to do with women's sexual desires. If you want to debate that, we'd have to start a new thread, but somehow I don't believe you will. Probably reveal too many skeletons in your closet :P Blah blah blah. Whether or not a woman wants to have a lot of sex outside of marriage or wants to have sex only with her husband has no bearing on my argument. Unplanned or unwanted pregnancies happen with any kind of couple or single parent. That you bring this up makes me think that you have some inner issue with women who want to have lots of sex. I certainly said nothing about it and it hasn't been part of any of my argument with you. Always good for a laugh","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","11:35 PM","abortion-debates","40"
