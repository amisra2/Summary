"10-10-2008","3173",17,"gansao","327153","I have just learned to my horror that we were once dangerous parasites inside our mothers womb ( think some people have been watching too many alien movies). This theory is backed up by the definition of parasite in a dictionary( maybe they should look up 'common sense' or is that a theosaurus that you need?) The people that come up with this charming idea also seem to argue that the fetus is not a seperate entity until birth, therefore it cannot be a parasite..just a growth maybe? So lets look at another fast growing VERY dangerous growth in young men...testicles..these can cause many problems in the young male , one of which is making parasites in young girls( shame on you!) they can also cause behaviour problems in adolesents that are potentially fatal!! Its too late for most of us but maybe there are one or too precocious teenagers that would be better off by freeing themselves of these dreadful parasites. This would be beneficial to them and have an added bonus that they would not pass this nasty bit of inhuman properganda to thier own parasitical offspring. I just hope that this is a joke!","Archangel","327157","Hi gansao, you make an excellent point which I have failed to consider. If unborn babies are dangerous parasites as Ingus, penfold, chester and shooter all claim, then as we humans always do, we should fix this problem. And you rightly focused right in on the source of the problem by singling out the male testicles as the organs which produce the invasive microbes, which once implanted into the poor unsuspecting female, is victimized by the completely unexpected growth of this foreign parasite that attempts to take over her body in such a violent and invasive way. From that point of view, one must thank God for the abortion procedure. And if true, then not enough of them take place in reality. If ZEFs are in fact true parasites, then they all should be forcibly removed from the women who's bodies they have invaded. So what to do is the question. How do we avoid this infection from continuing in the females of the human race? The only real solution seems to be full on castration of every male child. And it seems to me that due to the trauma of such an invasive operation, such an operation should be performed at the same time as boys foreskins are removed for sanitary purposes immediately after birth. Of course, the result of such a move if enforced on an International scale would lead to the complete extinction of the human race within one generation, but hey, we would also rid the world of those pesky parasites which invade the females of our species on such a regular basis. How's that for a solution LEFTISTS? Is that a solution you could support? And you would kill 2 birds with one stone as this ridiculous debate about abortions would also disappear all together. Please respond to this suggestion and tell me how you would vote on such an amendment. Maybe for once, we can actually come to a positive conclusion on one of these debates and agree on a universal solution which everyone can live with; or die with. Or maybe you'll finally admit that you are lacking the understanding of a preschooler to even dare to suggest with a straight face, that our unborn human offspring are parasites.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","08:32 AM","abortion-debates","241"

"10-10-2008","3173",17,"None","None","None","Another opinion","327247","Though technically, one could probably call a fetus/embryo a parasite, the term is misleading since it usually implies: 1) an invasion of sorts (which fetus/embryos aren't), 2) often implies harming the host (which fetus/embryos usually don't), 3) implies a foreign species (which fetus/embryos aren't) 4) and implies no redeaming qualities of the parasite (where fetus/embryos clearly have redeaming qualities of being able to become human beings if left alone). I find that the arguement between the two sides in this thread seems to rest mainly on the faulty premise that the only two choices for how one describes a fetus/embryo is 1) parasite, or 2) full human being. Yes, the fetus depends on the bodily resources of the mother (which makes it similar in that sense to a parasite) but it will eventually become a full human being (though in early pregnancy it is not one yet). It is something in between - a developing soul/mind-less body, dependent on the mother's body, that will eventually become a human person. That is what it is - one can neither equate it to a parasite nor to a full human person since it is between the two.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","01:39 PM","abortion-debates","248"

But they refuse to admit that because it would then mean that they are endorsing the killing of a human being.

A 6 day old baby is no more capable of caring for itself, communicating or surviving than a 6 week old fetus is, yet you would argue for the six day olds right. So you are splitting hairs when you know very well that the 6 week old fetus will grow into the newborn baby and beyond if only allowed to survive the lethal hand of the abortionist. Stop capitulating and compromising what you know is right based of foolish definitions that only go to marginalize the value of a developing child when you know all too well what it will develop into if only allowed to grow.

"10-10-2008","3173",17,"None","None","None","Archangel","327261","A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: THE PRO-ABORTION AGENDA OF JUSTIFICATION THROUGH DEHUMANIZATION To those people who are attempting to rationally debate the issue of ABORTION with these pro-death secular humanists and atheists, it is very important that you understand their true agenda and modus operandi for justifying the procedure which murders unborn babies while still in their mothers wombs. The method for justification requires that they dehumanize the unborn children which is why they will refer to them as ZEFs and Zygotes. And is why they will use comparisons to the fertilized and unfertilized chicken egg, which we eat for breakfast. You see, either way, when debating this issue on such a simplistic level, they win by default because they have already lowered the standard of debate to that of a chicken egg. So, by just understanding the shallowness of their tactics, we win by not allowing them to dehumanize our human offspring to the status of an inhuman analogy. Remember that these people are attempting to justify the murder of our very own human offspring. And they know that as well as you and I do. What they must do is both justify their stance and maintain a clear conscience so they don't have to live with the guilt that they are in fact defenders of a pro murder philosophy. That is why no matter what common sense arguments you use with them, no matter how obvious and rational your reasoning, they will never accept or concede that their position is not only false and irrational, but is criminal and a pro-death philosophy which supports and encourages genocide. After all, it is painfully obvious that any doctrine which not only allows, but enables the killing of 1.4 million members of one particular class of American consistently, year after year can be described as nothing other than genocide. That is why they must dehumanize the unborn, because they don't want to admit that they are proponents of the Great American Genocide. So forgive them for their irrational debating style which results in them offering the most infantile and ignorant arguments in their attempts to justify their sociopathic and shortsighted gospel of death and destruction of our most innocent and silent demographic, who have no personal voice of their own with which to defend themselves. What better a group to victimize than the absolute weakest among us? And they are even out of sight, so also out of mind of the masses. If they can only be dehumanized, then justifying their extermination should be easy according to the proponents of this MULTI BILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL INDUSTRY. So by understanding the rationale of these opponents of life for the unborn, you are more prepared to deal with the ignorance and shallowness of their inane attempts to justify such human carnage on such a massive scale. Just understand that these proponents of ABORTION are also victims since they have been raised in a selfish and self centered Society to believe that personal responsibility is a thing of the past, so demanding that the innocent child pay with its very life, the price for the sins of its mother/parents is just fine. And if they can moralize it by dehumanizing the baby so they can feel as though it is justified, then all the better.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","02:07 PM","abortion-debates","253"

Unfortunately for you - your rhetoric doesn't impress anyone over the 2nd grade. That's because even a 2nd grader knows that DICTIONARIES are used to DEFINE words. dictionary \ dik-sh-ner-, -ne-r \ noun : a reference source in print or electronic form containing words usually alphabetically arranged along with defined information about their forms, meanings , pronunciations, functions, and etymologies. Your right-winged rhetoric does not define words. Not only that but even a 2nd grader knows that MEDICAL dictionaries are used to define MEDICAL words. Williams Obstetrics is one of the most renown medical references in the world - and just like a 2nd grader you are ignoring what they say just because you don't like it. Boo-hoo-hoo for you. Further more, unlike you , even a 2nd grader understands that EDUCATED PEOPLE use DEFINED WORDS when forming a sentence. I guess you must have stayed home from school that day, and never learned that BASIC fact. So I don't really care what ignorant person might believe your pompous rechewed rhetoric gansao, I only care about the facts of the matter as determined and listed in well know established dictionaries, encyclopedias and medical journals. Your clueless, incognitant and inane ramblings are crazier than a fruit basket at a vegetable convention.
