The same holds true for all civil rights which have had opposition from the ""religious-right.""","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","03:16 AM","abortion-debates","2"

Why is the murder of human beings in their smallest form legal? What is different from a baby in the womb and a baby just born? And if there is no difference, killing your baby after it has been born should be legal as well.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","10:46 PM","abortion-debates","7"

So are you really positive you're not bringing god into this??? I guess it's impossible for anyone to prove that these opinions are not formed as a direct result of ""spiritual guidance"". There are plenty of differences between a foetus and a child, but that's another thread. So to avoid digressing further, I would wonder if there are any examples where there isn't this type of conflict in any type of legislation or moral judgement that is presented. You are virtually always going to be threatening the rights of an individual who doesn't agree with the views of a group that has the balance of power and is willing to use it. In terms of abortion, the reality is that there is no law forcing a religious person to have an abortion. But the churches have an intrinsic mandate to impose their views on others, regardless of the fact that abortions are simply available for the protection of women. The conflict is unavoidable!","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","12:59 AM","abortion-debates","8"

It truly is a tough decision, and is often very upsetting for weeks, months, or years afterwards. To say it is a selfish copout demeans problems that women go through that makes abortion necessary.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:57 AM","abortion-debates","10"

Your strongest point is asking why it's legal? You actually believe there is no difference between a fetus and a born baby? This thread discusses moral differences between born children and a fetus. There are numerous physical differences as well, perhaps the biggest being that the fetus is attached to a woman and is drawing nutrients out of her .","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","10:05 AM","abortion-debates","11"
"09-23-2004","3173",1,"syklopps61","None","C'mon, that's the OFFICIAL story.. IF it were so earth shattering then seems that HAVING the child would have LESS of an impact on the woman's life then. I can understand if my this part of my comment is what caught your eye, but I was wondering if you could/would comment on the other part, about the amoeba that is","sinjin","68181","Celebrating the discovery of life on another planet is not about celebrating the ""sanctity"" of all life but that the Earth is not unique in its ability to support life. If it happened tomorrow I wouldn't turn ""vegan"" either.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","05:50 PM","abortion-debates","13"
