That is the stupidest thing I've ever seen come out of CapO's mouth.","simone","326484","If one dies because of that ""tiny human being,"" can that ""tiny human being"" be tried for murder?

If she does not , then the parasite is imposing itself upon her until she can get rid of it. Thanks for agreeing that a woman has the right to do with her own body the same as a man can with his. You wouldn't want to advocate a double standard now would you? LOL","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","01:41 PM","abortion-debates","153"
"10-06-2008","3173",11,"Phyllis","326458","Do you think a 1 day old infant can make choices? What does this mean? even though they couldn't breathe, they would still be a person? Please tell me how possessing a social security card has anything to do with personhood I'm glad you are willing to admit you were wrong about only born persons having rights. I made an analogy. I am trying to force my agenda and will, through the law, upon anyone who would do harm to the fetus","Colonel Ingus","326490","When it's feeding time try putting a Yankee Pot Roast and the mothers nipple in front of it and see what it chooses for nourishment No surprise to your response here. Yes - a dead person. Try applying for a SS card for a fetus and see what they tell you. Where, exactly did I ever admit any such thing? The law is ridiculous and needs to be challenged. Only a XXXXX would think that the law makes any sense. If by 'analogy' you meant that the topic matter was fetuses - and all of a sudden you start talking about killing actual born babies, then sure, I can see your personal definition for that word. Without knowing what the fetus 'wants' ( which you yourself said was impossible ) or what the pregnant woman wants, you are sticking your nose where it is not wanted by either of them. Did the ZEF directly ask you to infuse yourself in the situation? Did the pregnant woman ask you to infuse yourself in the situation? Since the answer to both of these questions is no , then you are CLEARLY trying to force your own agenda and will upon both of them. Does it turn you on to be a busybody? Does it make you somehow feel important to manipulate or force others to do something against their own will? The question isn't if you can somehow shoe-horn or "" justify "" what you're doing. The question is why would anyone in their right mind think it's OK to manipulate or force others to do something against their own will . That's what you're doing, so be an adult and own up to it and understand why in this country you are a minority","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","02:18 PM","abortion-debates","154"
"10-06-2008","3173",11,"chester","326477","Kinda knocks your pet theory into a cocked hat, I would say.","Phyllis","326541","No, it really doesn't. But what I would really like to know is this: Do you really believe that what Hitler did was just as moral as what Wilberforce did? Do you really believe that exterminating 6 million Jews is just as moral as liberating an entire race from the institution of slavery?i","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","08:19 PM","abortion-debates","156"
"10-06-2008","3173",11,"Phyllis","326537","It doesn't make me fell important. Everyone supports forcing others to do things against their will. In principle, I have no problem with forcing people to do things against their will--prospective murderers, thieves, rapists, etc., for example.","chester","326545","Now that's just frightening! By definition, a "" PROSPECTIVE murderer, thief, rapist, etc."" has not taken a single step that would cause her/him to be labeled as such. Therefore: 1. What mechanism would you use to identify these PROSPECTIVE wrongdoers? and 2. Just what ""things"" would you have these innocents do ""against their will""? BTW, it's ""FEEL"" important, unless you have changed the definition of ""fell"".","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:10 PM","abortion-debates","157"

BTW, you might want to ask the Ukrainians about why they allied with Hitler.(Hint: it wasn't because of his Final Solution!) At any rate, we note that you have once again tried to shift away from a topic you don't want to discuss - your slippery Constitutional interpretation wherein you claim the right to determine which words are to be used as when they were written and which others you choose to modify over time. How about NO LAW in 1A. What new spin will you put on them to deny the right of someone to disseminate kiddie porn? Denying a pregnant woman who wants one of the RIGHT to an abortion in making her a slave to her fetus.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:27 PM","abortion-debates","159"
"10-06-2008","3173",11,"Phyllis","326546","The police do this all the time. If they are given evidence that these crimes are going to take place, they will take action to prevent them from happening. If they are unable to prevent them, they punish the perpetrators. Presumably most of these perpetrators would rather not go to prison.","chester","326548","Maybe in YOUR world under YOUR Constitution the police punish perpetrators. In the world of the USA and under our Constitution, that is the function of the courts, provided, of course, that the accused receives a fair trial under the laws and the Rules of Criminal Procedure of the jurisdiction wherein the crime is alleged to have occurred.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:30 PM","abortion-debates","160"

"10-06-2008","3173",11,"Phyllis","326537","Shocking as this may be, Abraham Lincoln never once possessed a social card card. And, I know it is hard to believe, but even though he didn't have that little card, he still was a rights-holding person. So you think the California legislature is filled with a bunch of XXXXXX? Everyone supports forcing others to do things against their will. In principle, I have no problem with forcing people to do things against their will murderers, thieves, and rapists If they are given evidence that these crimes are going to take place, they will take action to prevent them from happening.","Colonel Ingus","326552","LOL Oh come on Phyllis, you can do better than that... Your entire post was nothing but one big red herring Seriously, call up your local SS card office and ask them how to get a SS card for a fetus. They will laugh at you, the same as everyone here is, and then when you tell them that you are serious because a fetus is ""a person"" you will hear the sound of a click of them hanging up on you. There is a REASON why you need a birth certificate to get a SS card. That reason may be beyond your level of intellect but that doesn't make it a non-valid reason. Who ever came up with that law and who ever voted for it is a XXXXX IMO. If the shoe fits then they should wear it. WOW... I could see Attila the Hun saying that, but not a mature adult in this century. So now you are comparing an innocent woman who just happens to get pregnant with murderers, thieves, and rapists? It is because of people like you that Congress overwhelmingly passed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. You need to learn the difference between prevention , and forcing someone to do something against their will. Among other things, you are in fact condoning rape","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","10:16 PM","abortion-debates","163"

"10-06-2008","3173",11,"Phyllis","326551","Using force, locking them up, and other various things provided by law.","chester","326555","You would do this to those whom you label PROSPECTIVE lawbreakers, i.e., those who have not committed a criminal act? Welcome to Burma, North Korea, and Sudan, among others. We would love to know what the ""various other things"" might be. Well, there goes the original interpretation of 4A, 5A, 6A, and 8A. Not really an originalist are you, except when it suits your purposes? It's fun watching your dearly held theories slowly unravel under scrutiny. Now, what about kiddie porn under 1A? You know, the part that says NO LAW!","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","10:25 PM","abortion-debates","165"
