I'm really not sure what your point is with your comment. I wouldn't think life found on Mars is more important than those who found it. It would be exciting because it's a discovery of life beyond earth, but I would not think that life is worth more than life on earth.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","08:36 PM","abortion-debates","17"
"09-23-2004","3173",2,"syklopps61","None","Sigma, I was only joking. It hit me this morning though that if I'm willing to talk about abortion without bringing up God, I wonder if the Pro-Choicers could argue their position without bringing up ""women's rights"". ;-)","Sigma","68213","I'd be willing to give it a shot. Except, you cannot bring up ""right to life"" but can use God all you want.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","08:39 PM","abortion-debates","18"
"09-23-2004","3173",2,"syklopps61","None","Whenever I want to get my blood pressure to dangeroulsy high levels, I can always count on this comment to get me there. I will always sit back in utter amazement at people who can actually look in a miirror knowing a fetus is a life, but then put their ""right"" above it. How can you POSSIBLY justify it? There appears to be absolutely nothing worth dying for by those on the Left, but yet they seem to have no problems killing","Sigma","68221","Are you ""pro-gun""? I'm assuming you are. Do you justify it by saying that people have a right to protect themselves? Do you delude yourself into thinking that people won't ""protect themselves"" by shooting intruders or threateners? It is similar, you are putting a ""right"" above their lives. Are you against or for the death penalty? Euthanasia? There are instances of killing where it is justified. Abortion is justified because women should not be required to share their bodies resources against their will.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:40 PM","abortion-debates","20"

"09-24-2004","3173",2,"syklopps61","None","LMAO I think NOW I've heard it all. I'm not sure what kind of childhood you had, but I have three kids and they are an expression of the love I have for my wife. It has taught us that there IS more than ourselves in this world, and so in fact it becomes a very selfLESS thing to do. Those who choose NOT to have children are in fact selfish and lead empty lives because it's all about ME.","sinjin","68364","IMO they are expressions of your desire for some form of immortality. A selfish desire. They may be the embodiment of your love for your wife.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","06:07 PM","abortion-debates","22"
"09-24-2004","3173",2,"syklopps61","None","Why, yes I am. Are you an atheist...I assume you are ;-) I don't need to justify protecting oneself, that's the silliest thing I've ever heard. If I come up and slap you, are you gonna sit there and take it or are you gonna fight back somehow? It's not a ""right"", it's an instinct! You only say that so it wil fit nicely into your argument that a woman is only protecting HERself when having an abortion. HMMMMMMMMMMMMM, if I kill an intruder that was most likely going to harm my family, I would have a beer and celebrate over the dead body. One of you all said that an abortion can affect a woman for years...doesn't sound much like ""self-defense"" does it? Yes, during a time of war or in self defense. I cannot kill someone walking down the street just because I ASSUMED they would kill me, right? There has to be a reasonable expectation that your life was in danger in order to kill someone else. A fetus does NOT carry with it the GUARANTEE that it will kill the mother by so selfishly getting nutrients from her body and sharing blood and oxygen...the nerve of fetuses anyway, how dare they. Quite a stretch from the premise of self defense. May I ask, did the woman lay on her back against her will? I can't help but laugh at this silly notion that a woman is ""REQUIRED"", like mankind made some law to keep women suppressed or something. GEEEEEEEEZ, it's a biological function that you are equipped to do by God (OOOOOOOOOPS, bad word, sorry, I might get banned for THAT one). I'm not thrilled with the idea of having taste buds that force me to like some foods more than others, and therefore I may become fat because of it. Whichever politician that had the gaul to vote for people being required to have taste buds should be kicked out of office! LMAO get over it already","Sigma","68397","I fail to see how that matters :P I wasn't asking you to justify it; I was taking it as a given. I am not trying to say that abortion is self-defense... though in some cases it really is. I am saying that you believe your life to be more valuable than the intruders. The sanctity of your home is more important than the intruder's life . Your material possesions are more important than the intruder's life . I'm not saying you're wrong, in fact I agree with you. I am not against owning guns; you are assuming that of me. However, you are critical of people, saying oh how could you it's a life OMG YOU HEARTLESS BASTARDS when you would ""celebrate over the dead body"" of someone intruding your home. You value human life less than your material possessions, less than the sanctity of your home, so you are hypocritical to say what you say about pro-choicers. I would agree with you about the death penalty if it wasn't so damn expensive and didn't serve as a deterant. So you're against euthanasia I take it. It isn't GUARANTEED that someone intruding your home will harm you. It isn't assumed that a fetus is a detriment to a woman's health, it's pretty much established. That you would not allow abortion unless a death is guaranteed is sickening and careless of health hazards to women from pregnancy. That you would force motherhood is... I have no words. All it is to you is a consequence, not something that should be wanted . I never tried to tie in self defense, you assumed that. Your ""Do the crime, do the time"" argument is a horrible, horrible way of looking at it. Sex is not a crime, and motherhood should never, ever be treated as a punishment as you are doing. Motherhood should be desired, wanted. Every child born should be born because its mother wanted to have it . Your attitude needs some serious adjusting. When ""politicians"" make legal consequences to having an abortion, when they try and make continuing pregnancy a requirement by law, they are forcing women to continue their pregnancies. To believe otherwise is ignorant and shortsighted.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:59 PM","abortion-debates","27"
"09-24-2004","3173",2,"syklopps61","None","okay, a fetus is a life, taking an innocent life is murder..case closed. Shouldn't all debates be that simple and clear? LOL","Sigma","68398","Taking an innocent life is murder? No it's not. The illegal killing of a person is murder. An abortion does not fit this since abortion is legal and a fetus is not a person.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","10:04 PM","abortion-debates","28"
"09-24-2004","3173",2,"syklopps61","None","Well, not real sure why I'm pro-gun matters either, but anyway And I'm sure you value YOUR life than mine Obviously I have a very real and rational expectation that if they would break into my home to take something, they could be there to harm me as well. If I pull a gun on a cop, he's not gonna take the time to determine if I have bulletts.... I'd love to respond, but I wasn't sure where one thing ended, so could you clarify? AH, my way would be REAL cheap and very much a deterrent :-D You assume much LOL Honestly, I haven't given much thought to it. My first reaction is if the person if of sound mind then yes, it's okay. I will qualify that, by again stating that I haven't really weighed everything, so don't go trying to use that against me :-P No, true, but there IS a reasonable expectation that they will...see the cop analogy above My wife and I have ""selfishly"" had three and she seems pretty darn healthy to me :-D Would you want me up on murder charges if I killed someone who I just ASSUMED would kill me (NOT the intruder scenario please, talking about someone just walking down the street). There HAS to be a guarantee or a reasonable expectation to justifiable kill someone From this statement, it sounds like there should not be consequences to ANY actions then. When a life is involved, there is no FORCING involved, that's just a copout so a woman can behave like a man without any consequences. I'm sure you'd agree then that we should do away with deadbeat dad laws? I mean, he shouldn't have to face any consequences for his actions, right? Yep, guilty as charged, but there ARE those ""femi-nazi's"" out there who DO think that Who said anything about it being a punishment? what a sad way of looking at motherhood. Sex is not a crime, I'm all for it actually :-D, but murder IS, and murder should NOT be made less of a crime just out of convenience to the woman AAAAAHHHHHHH a perfect world WOULD be nice, wouldn't it? LOL LOL, why does MY attitude need serious adjusting? I'm defending an INNOCENT life here, and THAT'S a BAD thing? Man, we are living in Bizarro world now, scary No, it is simply putting innocent life above petty, selfish ""rights""","Sigma","68403","Because I have a point with asking. Do you have a point? I assume you mean that I value MY life more than YOURS, and you are correct. If I had to choose, you would die before me. The value of life varies person to person. They could . There is no guarantee , and that is your point, isn't it? There has to be a guarantee? Pulling a gun on a cop? When did cops enter into this? Ah, a blind spot where your hypocrisy is concerned, eh? When you are critical of people who are pro-choice, saying that we don't value human life you are being hypocritical. The value of human life varies to you, just as you accuse of pro-choice people. Bypassing due process of law isn't allowed Innocent until proven guilty and all that, and that's what is so expensive. Trials to prove guilt. Truly told, I could care less about it. If people want to kill themselves in this way why not. And there is a reasonable expectation that a pregnancy will be hard on a woman's body. There is a reasonable expectation that a woman will not be as healthy during the pregnancy. There is reasonable expectation that being pregnant is harmful to her health. There is reasonable expectation that it will harm her physically, emotionally, mentally or financially depending on the situation. Making broad comments and, more importantly, arbitrary laws that don't take into account specific situations is very irresponsible. Congratulations! Was she as healthy during the pregnancy as before and after? Was she able to do everything that she was able to do during as before and after? Pregnancy has effects on health, sometimes serious effects. If her health deteriorated, would you really support legislation that forced her to continue the pregnancy that was seriously and adversly affecting her health? If, heaven forbid, she was debilitated after the first pregnancy, recovered and accidently got pregnant again and told you she did not think she can face the health effects a second or third time, could you really support legislation that forced her to continue the pregnancy? ""someone walking down the street"" is not comparable to a fetus that is inside a woman, sharing her bodily resources and drawing nutrients out of her against her will and without her consent. It is much much more comparable to an intruder inside your home. It isn't ASSUMED that a fetus is sharing a woman's bodily resources and drawing nutrients out of her body, it's a fact. A fetus puts stress on a woman's body, sometimes a lot, sometimes enough to kill her, sometimes not so much. Every woman should have the right to not risk her health against her will . I personally believe that a man should be able to ""abort"" his rights and responsibilites when a woman is pregnant, but we aren't talking about anyone elses rights or responsibilites. We are talking about abortion. And in some cases, it is true. A fetus can indeed be a life-risk for a woman. A health risk is more frequent. I agree. Good thing abortion is not murder. You treat sex as a crime when you legislate consequences to it. Whatever ""natural"" consequences come from it come from it. Legal consequences are a different matter, and when you legislate motherhood as a consequence for sex you treat motherhood as a punishment. Then you won't mind me working toward that, eh? And I'm defending women so that they aren't required to be pregnant for your morals! Your attitude that ignores women's needs and desires needs adjusting. Putting an ""innocent life"" that has not been born over the life of women who have to bear that burden against their will. It's really disgusting.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","11:04 PM","abortion-debates","30"
