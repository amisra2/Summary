"10-06-2004","3173",8,"Sigma","None","They are different to me Just for the record, most women who have abortions do not need psychotherapy, and the mental anguish varies from woman to woman. Sometimes there is none. Do you mean that she decided not to take the pill for urinary tract infection? Those can be dangerous, and I applaud that both of you wanted a child enough to take that risk. I would never belittle the choice you made, as I would never belittle if you both had chosen to not have a child to take medication. My point has nothing to do with wanting to buy a car or house instead of a child, it's a matter of affording to have a child period. Still, whether or not I'm liberal is really meaningless. I believe there should be laws and morals as well, and in fact I am morally opposed to creating a law banning abortion. Personal responsibility, yes. I believe in that as well. I believe women should make responsible choices. I believe that abortion can be a responsible choice, and I believe women should be free to make that choice. Yes, If I were pregnant or my SO were, we would have decided on our own to sacrifice a life that is inside either of our bodies and is attached to either of us. It would be and should be our decision alone (along with anyone we would wish to include). Heck, who says that I'm even a woman? Oh come now. You should be more intelligent than that. I never made that a criteria, or indeed even as an option. In fact, pro-life people should support gov't programs to help pregnant women to reduce the amount of abortions, since the majority of abortions are done for financial reasons (I believe...)","syklopps61","70207"," I'm not claiming they AREN'T, just stating that you mirror our society The pain! Ooooh, the pain! Okay, then just for the record, let's not bring up how mentally anguishing it is then, okay? You can't have it both ways. I realize there are degrees of anguish, but you have claimed/inferred/implied that this is a makor decision that can have longlasting effects on a woman's life. I would suggest that IF you use this, you need to also add that for MOST women the decision for an abortion is made as easily as what to fix for dinner Well, she will admit today that she stupidly took one or two before contacting our regular OB/GYN (who happened to be away playing golf or something LOL) While I appreciate your kind words, I can't help but feel there is a little bit of that moral equivalency going on. You say that you wouldn't belittle our choice either way, but it would actually be silly to make the two sound equal. We were willing to risk a great deal of turmoil in our lives to give a baby a chance. While if we had taken the easy way out, it would have been for selfish reasons. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH JUDGING PEOPLE!!!! GOOD LORD! WE AREN'T CONDEMNING SOULS. JUDGE ME PLEASE!!!! And my point is that many people find ways to afford that car. Maybe I was just DAMN lucky, but a car is more expensive than raising my kids so far has been. Now, if you want to be one of those whackos that has to have all the BEST for their kid, then yeah, it might cost you an arm and a leg BLAH BLAH BLAH You claim support of personal responsibility, but yet can't bring yourself to say that getting pregnant in the first place and keeping the child also falls under personal responsibility Not when it devalues life, sorry Well, you refer to yourself being pregnant, so I would think that's a logical conclusion. If not, my apologies All I meant was this: You brought up the government programs and implied/inferred that at least having an abortion would mean that the government wouldn't have to pick up the tab, and to me that's just a silly excuse to NOT have the child. And for people that DO feel it's a good one, then it seems to me then we should just kill everybody on government programs","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:57 AM","abortion-debates","106"

I would say my views on abortion are consistent with what our society is today. Agreed, no one can have things both ways (generally speaking). Abortion is a major decision, and the decision to have a child is also a major decision. Trying to judge which makes more of an impact on a woman's life has way too many variables to judge objectively. My own opinion is that having a child has more of an impact on a woman's life. No, I don't agree with this. I would say that most women are relieved after it is done, but I also believe it is almost always an big decision in a woman's life. It should not be done casually, and I don't believe it is done casually. Hardly something either of you can be blamed for, since you did not know it had harmful effects :P Nothing bad in the end though, so that's one good thing. I don't believe they are equivalent, really. They are both choices that are made during the pregnancy, but that's about it. I believe it is a wonderful thing that a woman feels she is ready for a child. I believe it is a sad thing that a woman feels she cannot care for a child. You risked a great deal of turmoil, and a woman who has an abortion risks nothing (generally). I agree that abortion can be and is usually selfish, and I think that sharing your life with a child is selfless (it has it's selfish aspect as well, but I believe in general it is selfless). I'm not a very judgmental person. I believe those who disagree with me are merely misguided and only must see things as I see them and they'd instantly understand what we must do. I'm a bit of an egomaniac, eh? They might find ways to afford a car if they must have a car, like I must have one to work and make money to support myself. A car generally has pretty predictable costs though, while with a child you're basically playing the lottery and hoping your kid has no major problems that will cost a lot of money. To me, a car is a lot less risky, especially since you can take it back if it has problems immediately, and get a warranty for farther down the road. A child provides nothing (materially, a child is usually a joy to parents) unlike a car and there are no guarantees in terms of health and costs. In terms of strict cost/benefits, I would go with the car. This is even without the costs of education thrown in when the kid goes to college. I have no numbers, but my feeling is that a child is more expensive in the long run, and in the short run if the kid has health problems. That by no means should be a deciding factor on having a child, however. A factor, sure, but that should not be the way you decide to have a kid. At least, it would not be with me. Oh, I think that getting pregnant when you are not ready to have a child is very irresponsible, for both parties. I also believe that a woman is beign responsible when she looks at her life and makes a decision, which could be that she is not ready to have and care for a child. It might be ""the easy way out"" and it is in some ways. I believe and abortion is an easier thing than carrying and then birthing it, but I also believe it is a responsible thing to do in some instances. Ah, well, I don't believe in devaluing the woman of the relationship by making the fetus more important. If she were my SO, I would value her life more than the fetus inside of her. That would indeed be logical. I am careful to say if I am pregnant, and if I am the husband. No need to apologize, I simply do not wish you to start making assumptions. Your sentence structure is a bit awkward here, so I'm not sure what you mean. Too many negatives to keep track of for me :P If gov't assistance is the sole criteria that I have for justifying abortion, then you are right that the same argument applies to everyone that is on gov't assistance.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:20 PM","abortion-debates","107"

Or is it a big decision? WAIT..John Kerry, right? LOL LOL, not at all. But I would say that we are ALL judgemental but since that's considered a bad word nowadays no one wants or likes to admit it.

Depending on her circumstances, not having it there can be a huge relief. I am judgemental, but I am very understanding of other's opinions. A desire for surety in our lives is not wrong :P Certainly better than chaos around every corner. In a relationship, both partners decide if and how. In a healthy relationship, anyway. I don't believe forcing the responsibility of motherhood is moral. It should be wanted. I don't see the fetus as less than human, any more than I would see an intruder in my home as less than human. I view the fetus as less important than me and my SO, as I would view an intruder as less important than me and my SO. I am not talking about risk to the mother's life. The fetus would be less important to me than my SO, in every way. If I were a husband, my wife's desires would always come first to me. Her life, her health, her dreams and goals would be more important to me than what is growing inside of her. If they conflict, I would choose her, in every way, over the fetus. I would trust that I would choose a woman (or man, if the case might be) that shared my beliefs about when to have an abortion.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","11:01 AM","abortion-debates","109"

Therefore, there would have to be a very good reason to supress that very important right. It is not enough for any life form to have human DNA or to even have the potential to become a full person just like us. The only thing that is important enough that would outweigh a woman's right to her own body is if the fetus is ALREADY close enough to being a person such as ourselves that it would gain rights that might overcome the right of a woman to her own body. For many people, including myself, the critical development that crosses this threshold is the development of a mental existence in the fetus. In other words, there has to be ""somebody home"" in that body, not just a developing body on its own, for us to start weighing in rights for that fetus that might overcome the rights of the woman to her own body. Indeed, from a 2003 poll listed on pollingreport.com/abortion.html, 84% of Americans polled thought that third trimester abortions should be generally illegal (minus certain exceptions). This would mean that the majority of pro-choice supporters also think third trimester abortions should be restricted. The typical reasons either are similar to the ones I stated or, as in the case of Roe vs Wade, stress fetal viability as the criteria for when the state can restrict abortion rights.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","02:43 PM","abortion-debates","113"

If you want to define the terms pro-life and pro-choice as lying on the extremes (abortions always or never), then that would mean that the great majority of Americans are neither pro-life nor pro-choice but somewhere in between. Traditionally, it seems that pro-life has been defined as no abortions except for very limited exceptions (risk to mothers life, rape, incest, and sometimes risk to mothers health). However, it is interesting to note that ~66% of Americans from that same poll said that first trimester abortions should be generally legal, which would include a minority of self-proclaimed pro-life proponents.
