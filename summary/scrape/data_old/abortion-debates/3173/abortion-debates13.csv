Try this one: Are the following three scenarios just as moral as each other: (1) Government forcing a woman to have an abortion; (2) Government forceing her not to have an abortion; and (3) Government allowing her to decide for herself whether to have an abortion?","chester","326733","Nice try, but no dice. #3 Should say, ""Government taking no position whatsoever on the question of abortion, leaving the decision where it properly belongs, in the mind of each pregnant woman."" Don't even try to play your Jesuitical word games, sister; they don't work. Now you will get your answer after you respond to my question of how, under an originalist view of the words NO LAW in the First Amendment, the government can do anything to prevent the dissemination of kiddie porn.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","08:23 PM","abortion-debates","181"
"10-07-2008","3173",13,"Archangel","326728","By what standard of depravity do you base this statement on? Since when isn't it societies or the Law's business when legal infanticide is taking place to the tune of 1.4 million copies a year in the USA alone? Since when are people of good conscience and solid moral values who actually respect human life, expected to remain silent when such a human holocaust is taking place all around us, promoted and justified by Godless heathens who can't see past whatever makes them feel good at the moment?","chester","326734","HO-HUM!!

"10-07-2008","3173",13,"Phyllis","326741","Ok, so: We've been over this before beginning here , and my answer hasn't changed.","chester","326748","Here's the entire content of your post. I doubt you can cite Scalia as an activist in First Amendment cases when he has voted to overturn bans on flag burning. You really should try to think before you speak; or perhaps you actually did, in which case we should simply conclude that you have no idea what you are talking about. Regardless, any decision that holds that something is in the Constitution, when in fact it really is not, is wrong and merits reversal no matter which judges perpetrate the wrong decision. You didn't answer it there, and you still won't answer it here. How do you plan to get around the fact that the words NO LAW are in the Constitution? Guess you will have a L--O--N--G wait until you get my answer.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:25 PM","abortion-debates","184"

The discussion went on for several pages, and you are free to read it again if you like. And the question is, are each of the following three scenarios just as moral as the other: (1) Government forcing a woman to have an abortion; (2) Government forcing her not to have an abortion; and (3) Government taking no position whatsoever on the question of abortion, leaving the decision to each individual woman.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","10:38 PM","abortion-debates","186"

"10-07-2008","3173",13,"chester","326758","Not until I get a straight answer, or at least an admission from you that ""originalism"" is a fraud.","Phyllis","326765","Originalism is not a fraud. If it were, I would be forced to take every word you ever say and interpret it to mean whatever I think it ought to mean, and you would have no objective basis to say that my interpretation was wrong. The result is a breakdown in language and an impossibility to communicate. I have already addressed your ""no law"" question. If you are too lazy to read the answer that is not my problem; it is yours. You, on the other hand, have no where answered the questions I asked, and so my ignorance of your answer is not due to my laziness, but rather it is due to your unwillingness to answer some very simple questions. I'll repost them both for your convenience, but not because I think you'll answer them, but because I think you won't. And I think you won't answer them because, being a moral relativist, your answer would be very shocking indeed. Do you really believe that what Hitler did was just as moral as what Wilberforce did? Do you really believe that exterminating 6 million Jews is just as moral as liberating an entire race from the institution of slavery? Are each of the following three scenarios just as moral as the other: (1) Government forcing a woman to have an abortion; (2) Government forcing her not to have an abortion; and (3) Government taking no position whatsoever on the question of abortion, leaving the decision to each individual woman.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","11:47 PM","abortion-debates","188"

See, it IS relative. Now, let's pose another one. Since Stalin was responsible for far more murders that Hitler, who was more immoral? Is the murder of a kulak or a Ukrainian or a White Russian or a political opponent by Stalin of less importance than the murder of a Jew by Hitler? Better yet, who is more immoral, the one who takes the life of a person in being, or the one who removes a parasite from another's body? The doctor who performs an abortion on a woman who chooses to have one is the moral equivalent of Wilberforce, for she or he has freed the woman from enslavement by her ZEF. There simply is no moral equivalence between a person in being and a ZEF.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","12:10 AM","abortion-debates","191"

You compare a tapeworm to an unborn child who will surely develop into a person just like you if allowed to, and you have the nerve to call pro-lifers hypocrites? And you then claim to be rational thinkers? Or do you? Because there is nothing rational about making such a comparison. I fully agree that a tapeworm is a parasite, but to even suggest that a human being is a parasite is the epitome of ignorance and is absolutely unprovable on every level of rationality. I mean, just look in the mirror, beside being a parasitical and sanctimonious pro-death looney lefty, do you see a parasite in the reflection? So show me one true parasite that grows into a sentient being if you can? If allowed to continue to exist, what will the tapeworm grow into that is equal to us as human beings? If your answer is, IT WONT GROW INTO ANYTHING EQUAL TO US, which it must be, then how can you compare developing human beings in the womb to TAPEWORMS And still claim to have anything more than a first grade education? I'm so sick of the irrational and dumbed down comparisons to our unborn by people who obviously don't understand the most basics of biology or what constitutes intelligent, sentient life. Prove your claims LEFTISTS. Support your ignorant assertions for once as you denigrate human life to the level of a tapeworm.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","08:33 AM","abortion-debates","193"

The only person who has a say in the matter is the pregnant woman. If she feels it is a baby and she chooses to carry it to term, we in the pro-choice community will honor that choice. If, on teh other hand, a different woman has a different opinion and chooses to terminate her pregnancy, we honor that choice as well. That's exactly why CHOICE must remain the all-American family value. BTW, given your repeated support for the Death Penalty, you completely forfeit your right to be called ""Prolife."" At least be honest enough with yourself to admit that you are only pro SOME life, and that you want the right to choose which lives you are ""pro"".","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","08:49 AM","abortion-debates","194"
