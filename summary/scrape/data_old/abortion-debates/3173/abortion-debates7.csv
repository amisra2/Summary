How can our freedom OF religion be a sure thing, when other religions force themselves upon us throught the government and legal system?","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:13 PM","abortion-debates","92"
"10-01-2004","3173",7,"syklopps61","None","Well, that wasn't clear from your posts. I just don't understand though, you believe in a woman's choice, for whatever reasons she feels are important to her, but yet you think it would be wrong for cosmetic reasons? Gender reasons too? Sorry, seems ""inconsistent"" to say the least","Sigma","69606","It would only be inconsistant is I had abortions for those reasons. Others do things I don't approve of all the time. If I don't approve of you owning a gun but I believe in your right to, am I inconsistent? Believing in the right and approving of the action are two different things.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","11:09 PM","abortion-debates","93"
"10-02-2004","3173",7,"syklopps61","None","So you are saying if a woman chose to abort her pregnancy based on cosmetic or gender reason, you would support her right to do that? And to further clarify, away from the RIGHTS aspect, you seem to believe it's okay to abort for financial reasons but not for cosmetic/gender reasons? THAT to me is where the inconsistency lies. Forget about the rights part for a second, basing it on your BELIEFS","Sigma","69675","I support the right to abort for any reason. My personal reasons would not include cosmetic reasons. If I or my SO were pregnant, we would have to be in dire financial straits to consider abortion. Cosmetics don't necessarily negativly affect us, while a financial burden would. If our circumstances were such that we flatly could not afford an extra expense, then we would consider abortion. It would not be a light decision. Obviously if either of our lives were threatened, or our health seriously impaired we would consider it then as well.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","03:09 PM","abortion-debates","95"
"10-02-2004","3173",7,"syklopps61","None","Despite our differences, I don't consider you stupid (the ARGUMENTS you have are a different story :-P), so I would have been shocked if you had said differently....on HERE anyway ;-) There's no truth detector here to say with any certainty that you in FACT think this way, you are smart enough to know that IF you had said differently it would've damaged your argument, so ANYWAY.... We all know how iffy one's financial situation is at any given time. While you are pregnant, things could be a little tight, and the day after you have an abortion you could get a big promotion. Or could be the other way around, you're pregnant and things are going great and boom, the child is born and you lose your job...what then? You really can't see what a weak argument you have, to base that kind of decision on circumstances that can change at the drop of a hat.","Sigma","69727","I'm not sure what you mean by this It isn't an argument, it's my personal beliefs. If I or my SO got pregnant and decided that we could not afford it, we would consider an abortion. If we decided to keep it and after it was born lost our jobs... we would not and could not change our decision. We had decided we wanted a baby. After it is born we would not want to change our decision, nor could we.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","11:53 PM","abortion-debates","97"
"10-04-2004","3173",7,"syklopps61","None","and I just meant that IF you had responded differently, it would make the defense of your beliefs more difficult because it would not have been a consistent belief See how legalistic this society has become? You know what I mean, substitute argument for beliefs then if it makes it easier, good Lord. And you couldn't change your decision if you killed the fetus and then hit the lottery the next day either! IF it's such an earth shattering decision like you claim, and since finanial conditions can change for the better or worse at any time, it would make much more sense to be prudent and assume that one's finances DO get better (afterall, I'm sure many of us are making more money now than we did at 22 or 29 or...) and therefore one would keep the child. But it seems that those who believe like you can't see past their noses and make a decision based on THIS day.","Sigma","69847","Oh. Ok... why did you ask me then? To give me a chance to be inconsistent? They are not the same thing. An argument must be logical and be grounded in a supported premise. A personal belief does not have to be logical or grounded in any premise. While it is always wise to explore why you have a personal belief, you are not compelled to. If our financial situation is iffy, we would not want to get pregnant. If we got pregnant accidently, we would probably get an abortion if our financial situation is iffy. We do not want to have a child unless we have a secure financial future and savings built up. Don't say something horrible could happen and you could lose all your money because there is a difference between possible and probable. It's possible something could happen, but if we're in a situation where we believe our work is secure and our finances stable, it is likely to be so. And the likely is all we can really base our decisions on. If a person's financial situation is volatile enough to change for better or worse at any time, getting pregnant and having a child is not the responsible choice, imo. I'm seriously confused why you are saying that we should just assume our finances would get better and therefore continue the pregnancy. There is no guarantee of that, and I would not bargain my future on a faint hope.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","02:30 AM","abortion-debates","99"

EVERYBODY misspeaks at times, and nowadays when someone does they pull out the dictionary and law books and ""stick it"" to the other person. Common sense is dead Is it not equally probable that you could lose the savings, some emergency could pop up or investments could tank? And is it not equally probable that one's finances get better as time goes by (for the most part)? But yet, you've decided to lkill a fetus because TODAY my finances aren't that great...go figure, seems kina convoluted to me Well then, we all oughtta get fixed , because MKOST of us do not have that ABSOLUTE security you seem to cite as a criteria for having a child Then you are in the wrong line of work or not handling your career well, because most of us starting out in our chosen fields are making more today than when we started, I don't see that as some faint hope. What you are REALLY saying is that you want it all to be as easy as pie, you want the guarantees, and without those guartantees you feel it's worth it to kill a child. God forbid you would have to sacrifice YOUR comfort for anything or anyONE else","Sigma","69884","Ah, yes, because you say so :P I did not misspeak. My personal beliefs are separate from my abortion arguments. My argument is strong, and I have yet to see anything that would change my mind about abortion. My personal beliefs don't have to be ""strong"" as an argument does because they are my personal beliefs. I don't have to be logical or consistent with my personal beliefs. No, it is not equally probable Of course it's possible, but why in the world would you think that at any given point it's equally possible that an emergency would wipe out your money as not? Is it equally possible that you would win the lottery at any given point as not? Kill a fetus TODAY? Because I would be pregnant TODAY :P You're ""as time goes on your finances get better"" means nothing over the course of a pregnancy. No, I never said absolute security. However, I do not think it's responsible when my financial future is unknown or poor in my belief. If I have a steady job that pays more than enough to live on and savings built up then my financial future is pretty secure. At that point I would be willing to have a child(all other criteria being met). If I am working at Burger King for minimum wage... then no. Even if I'll be making more money in the years to come (and that is by no means certain), I am not making enough now to support a child. First of all, I am not required to sacrifice my comfort for anyone else. Perhaps I am not handling my career well :P Perhaps I should not have a child when I have no clue if I will continue my job. And, yes, I do want some guarantees, even if there are none. I want to know that I will have enough money to survive on.

I need Webster approved words to know what the heck you are saying Yes, you could at any point lose your job, no matter what your job is. You could lose your job at any point. Does that stop you from being confident that you aren't going to lose your job if your job is going well and there is no reason to believe you will lose it? I have just gotten a new job and I have little fear I will suddenly lose it (though it is indeed possible). There is no reasonable fear of losing my job. I would call my financial situation secure if I have no reasonable fear of losing my job and I have savings built up and I was putting money away every paycheck. At that point I would feel confident I could support a child with my SO. I still don't know what you are talking about saying that there is a ""reasonable chance one's finances will get better as well"". Over what time frame are you talking about? It probably won't suddenly get better over a pregnancy, and if one cannot support a pregnancy or child at the start, there is no reasonable belief that one can at the end. If you mean that over years one's income generally goes up then I would generally agree with you. However, that does not help a woman who is pregnant NOW and cannot afford it. Only if you get a significant raise or quit your job and start somewhere else that pays better. There is no guarantee of either, and betting my future on the hope that I can have either is not something I would do (unless I had a very good idea that I would be hired at the new place). Yes, tomorrow things could turn around. But I'm putting my faith on the trend of things, not sudden spikes and drops. Certainly I will try and prepare for them, but I am not basing my decisions completely on what ifs . No, but you can reasonably predict what things will do. If there are warning signs that you may lose your job then you make decisions based on that. If there are no warning signs that you will lose your job then you make decisions based on that. Of course you can lose your job without warning signs, but you cannot base every decision on the assumption that you will lose your job without warning. No one is psychic (at least I'm not), so all you can do is base decisions on what you know and what is reasonable to predict. Wait, earlier in the debates you thought I was really young... gen Xers aren't terribly young. Who says I'm liberal? I'm really not terribly liberal except on the abortion issue. Even here I believe in personal decisions and removing the interference of the gov't, which are ""conservative"" ideals I think. I have not asked others to sacrifice anything. Yet you are telling others that they must sacrifice their bodies and lives for others, and in fact you said: So which is it. Are you telling me I must sacrifice for another, or do you believe that I should decide for myself whether or not to sacrifice? Or are you Liberal for telling others to sacrifice? I really don't believe I have the right to tell others what they must sacrifice. I don't believe you have that right either. On my knees? Am I supposed to give my boss head? That's your solution to getting ahead in life? If it makes you feel better believing that, go ahead. I have in fact said that I don't think the gov't should be involved in abortion at all . If I was what you are suggesting I am then wouldn't I say ""go ahead and get pregnant because the gov't will take care of you anyway"". Wouldn't I think that we should create more gov't programs to support pregnant women instead of believing women shouldn't have children if they are not financially secure enough to support them?

And I DID go to college, but I never realized I used those big ""college"" words...my bad :-P With respect to this financial stuff, we can go round and round forever. The bottom line is the decision you make today can't be changed, so many things need to be considered, ESPECIALLY if, as you claim, abortion is such a life changing decision. If I knew that decision could devastate my life, I would choose the least devastating, wouldn't you? I would think that giving up the new fancy car would be worth not having years of mental anguish and psychotherapy, wouldn't you? I'll take this opportunity to relate a personal experience....back in 94 my wife was maybe a month pregnant when some whacko doctor prescribed some new drug for a urinary tract infection, even though my wife said she may be pregnant. Our OB/GYN never heard of the drug and had no studies to refer to. My wife had only taken one or two of the pills. Our doctor said that he could go ahead and perform an abortion if we had concerns about deformities or whatever else could have happened. We thought about it for a nano second and said no...today we have a beautiful, smart, funny daughter. If we had chosen to be selfish and think how a deformity could result in us not getting that nice house or car, we would have missed out on all the joy she has brought us. Well, considering that most who believe in the ""right to choose"" are typically Liberal, so it was a safe assumption. There DO need to be laws and morals though, and that IS a Conservative belief. Conservatives believe in personal RESPONSIBILITY, and in that sense getting rid of government interference. And you haven't asked to sacrifice, you have just decided on your own to sacrifice a life No question you should decide for yourself, I'm not saying that should be legislated (we've covered that before), except when it comes to another life, then your right no longer exists. I certainly have the right to say whatever I like, I just don't have the right to impose it on others. I can criticize and judge 'til the cows come home, I just can't take any actions to back it up Where did THAT come from? Are you then saying the only way to get ahead is to lay on your BACK?

Ooooh, the pain! lol, I hardly have enough for a fancy car. You're right, it is a life-changing decision as the decision to actually have a child is a life-changing decision. Either decision can devastate your life, and weighing both carefully would be very wise before making that decision. Sometimes choosing to have an abortion and not having a child is the least devastating. Just for the record, most women who have abortions do not need psychotherapy, and the mental anguish varies from woman to woman. Sometimes there is none. That's wonderful :D Do you mean that she decided not to take the pill for urinary tract infection? Those can be dangerous, and I applaud that both of you wanted a child enough to take that risk. I would never belittle the choice you made, as I would never belittle if you both had chosen to not have a child to take medication. My point has nothing to do with wanting to buy a car or house instead of a child, it's a matter of affording to have a child period. Still, whether or not I'm liberal is really meaningless. I believe there should be laws and morals as well, and in fact I am morally opposed to creating a law banning abortion. Personal responsibility, yes. I believe in that as well. I believe women should make responsible choices. I believe that abortion can be a responsible choice, and I believe women should be free to make that choice. Yes, If I were pregnant or my SO were, we would have decided on our own to sacrifice a life that is inside either of our bodies and is attached to either of us. It would be and should be our decision alone (along with anyone we would wish to include). Oh? Well, then we have really nothing to argue about :D I respect anyone's beliefs, so if you disagree with abortion I think that's just super. I simply disagree with banning it, personal beliefs nonewithstanding. Oh, I see. I didn't know what you meant by being on my knees. Heck, who says that I'm even a woman? Oh come now. You should be more intelligent than that. I never made that a criteria, or indeed even as an option. In fact, pro-life people should support gov't programs to help pregnant women to reduce the amount of abortions, since the majority of abortions are done for financial reasons (I believe...) Many programs aimed at helping pregnant women be able to afford children, such as WIC and others, are woefully underfunded and exclude many women. Adoption is only possible after the child is born. Some women cannot afford to be pregnant . Then, abortion is the only option to not have a fetus inside of her.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","10:23 AM","abortion-debates","105"
