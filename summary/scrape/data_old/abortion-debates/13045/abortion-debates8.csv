I'm interested in your thoughts on my observations regarding the use of ' self defense .'","Steeeeve","364016","You can but like always I post 1-5min responses when I can so don't expect a huge posting thing. Basically your argument is flawed because you are killing the unborn child who never caused the threat...in other words, there was no fault for the unborn. The only example I can think of is something that would be from a Saw movie. Suppose you and another person were captured and placed into a situation to where the one person has no idea what is going on is rigged up so that there is a 1-5% chance that this person will unknowingly kill you. So have a gun and can kill this person which will immediate that chance. I don't think you have the right to kill that person. Perhaps a more realistic (but less compatible) example would be the fact that you don't have the right to kill a drunk driver before he drives off just because the risk of him/her killing you or others on the road is dramatically increased.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","10:59 AM","abortion-debates","106"

I mean, what fault is it of prebirth child's when the Dr.s say, the pregnancy must be terminated or the mother will die? My point is, the right to self defense is not predicated on the guilt or innocence or even the ""intent"" of the person or persons posing a threat. Self defense laws are predicated upon the ""reasonable belief"" that your life is in danger. It requires you use resaonable force and that you try all means possible to remove yourself from the threat prior to using deadly force. My debates with Allen Asch and other lawyers in the ACLU forum was precisely about this aspect. And in the end, some finally (reluctantly) ceeded the point. Your response tells me that a new thread is warranted. Thanks.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","11:27 AM","abortion-debates","107"

The ""knowing before the fact"" is where both will die. Luckily we are arguing over less than 1% of abortions where morality might be harder to determine. Your life is no more endangered by a pregnancy from rape that a normal pregnancy.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","11:36 AM","abortion-debates","108"

In the rare cases that a rape results in pregnancy, you may in fact be able to convince a woman that she is not in danger, that it's not the baby's fault and that she should go ahead and have the baby. If a woman can pull that off, she's (in my book) elevated herself to 'super-human' status! But the laws allow for and support a woman's right to defend herself against an un-reasonable threat that she didn't invite against herself. This is my last on it in this thread. I'll start another.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","11:51 AM","abortion-debates","109"

"08-05-2009","13045",8,"Chuz Life","364005","CUNx,... this from a guy who acknowledges that all abortions kill babies. A guy who in spite of that acknowledgment supports keeping abortions legal for any woman, anytime she wants one? Now, all of the sudden,.... you can't find the justification in allowing for abortions in cases of rape? It's really very simple. A rape is a medical threat to a woman's life that she did not invite upon herself. It is a threat that is forced upon her. She (a raped woman) has a reasonable right to defend herself against any and all threats to her life that are forced upon her. (same as we all do)","CUNxTime","364054"," You know I don't late term abortions. There's no need to misrepresent my position. I was asking questions to help understand someone else's position. But your position is that its a person, with all the rights of personhood. If that is the case, how come it doesn't get a say? How can you and Steve approve of killing a human-being just because its father was a bad guy? If the woman shouldn't be able to 'kill' a fetus that stems from consensual sex, why should she have a right to kill a rape fetus? Isn't that saying that the 'baby' isn't innocent? Isn't that taking away its rights? Isn't that murder? Update...I see Steeeve's answer further up the thread...thanks.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","03:14 PM","abortion-debates","113"

Edit in progress 1 Not So, My position is that a prebirth child has the basic rights of a human individual (person Not that they have the full panapoly of rights that say an adult rape victim would have. 2 Prebirth children do have a say (a voice). Even in cases of rape; as Steeeve is speaking in their defense presently in this thread. And as we eventually got to in the ACLU forums,... and as you eluded to in your remark that you oppose ""late term abortions,""... The long a raped victim waits to report the attacks,.... the louder the voice in defense of the child will be. And this is consistent with most other crimes. If someone breaks into your house and you wait a year to report it,.... you somehwat own the consequences. 3 Steeeve and I do not agree on the justifications for an abortion in cases of rape, Cunx. Not yet, anyway. And I don't know that we ever will. But for my part, when an woman aborts her child in a rape pregnancy it's not to punish the child for the acts of his/her father. That's a total mischaracterization of what's taken place. A woman has a right to protect herself against threats against her health and life that have been forced upon her. In fact, forcing a woman who is pregnant as a result of being raped is tantamount to raping her all over again. 4 Already explained this. ""You can't invite someone into your home and then kill them for tresspass and claim it was self defense."" 5 Only if you twist it to make it seem so. You see our laws regarding 'self defense' do not require (as I said earlier) that 'guilt or innocence' be established. Only that one acts on the 'reasonable belief' that the threat is real and can't be avoided and that subsequently excessive force will not be used. 6 No more so than the killing of anyone else in an act of self defense can be twisted around to make it seem as though the attackers rights are being denied. No. 7 No. A justified act of self defense is not murder even if the person killed was not intentionally threatening or aware that they were posing a threat. Tragic? Yes. But in these cases it is the Rapist who is ultimately responsiblefor the child's death. Not the raped- victim/ woman.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","03:29 PM","abortion-debates","115"

Hopefully without the epic-post-length of the Challenger's Corner thread, though! Developing this analogy further... If someone was kidnapped and the kidnapper tied their victim to a radiator in your house, should you then be allowed to shoot the kidnapped person? Somehow I can't see you being able to convince a jury that the 'real' killer of the person you deliberately shot 'for trespass' was the kidnapper who put them there in the first place.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","04:27 PM","abortion-debates","116"

The relationship between a pregnant woman and the child she bares is like no other. In your analogy, a 'person tied to a radiator' somewhere in your home is especially bad as you can leave your home with the person there (a pregnant woman can't do that) You can call the authorities and have them remove the person unharmed ,... (a pregnant woman can't do that either) I find it increasingly odd that so many who demand a woman's right to have an abortion for any reason she wants (with the denial of personhood to her child) would completely deny her the right to an abortion in cases of rape (if personhood were to be established.)

Why would you find that surprising though? I'm about personal responsibility. A woman should have an opportunity to control whether she reproduces.
