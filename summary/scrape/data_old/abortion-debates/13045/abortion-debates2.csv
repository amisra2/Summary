"08-01-2009","13045",2,"Nebuchadnezzar","362994","I was wondering if there was anyone else that believes as I do that women should be given a choice but still hope they choose life.","Easyrider","363293","They always have a choice, whether legally or illegally. But I too hope they choose life. What disturbs me, though, are all the blacks, whites, and Hispanics who claim to be Christians, plus those who claim to be followers of the Jewish Tanakh, and who apparently think voting for a man (Obama) who is an abortion enabler, is ok with God. Have they never read Jeremiah 1:5 and Psalm 139:13, where God is instrumental in some way in creating life in a mother's womb - perhaps creating the spirit or whatever? Maybe they should look in an abortionist's sink and check of the bloody remains of the babies that are butchered. And if they think what they see in that sink is ok with God then they're really sick individuals. You know what all pro-abortion folks have in common? Their mother's ALL chose life.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","06:42 AM","abortion-debates","16"
"08-01-2009","13045",2,"Steeeeve","363212","Some people judge but that has nothing to do with abortion being right or wrong. Seems there is always a disconnect in the arguments of abortion. No one objects to a person choosing what is right for themselves. No one objects to the idea that murdering a person is wrong. The disconnect is that pro-life people feel the unborn is a person and therefore should choose for themselves and thus abortion would be the same thing as if you killed me. So pro-life folks never see it as a one-party problem but as a two-party problem.","chester","363300","Just so. We who are Pro-Choice support the absolute right of pro-life people not only to hold to that position but also to practice it, within the privacy of their own families. What we will never submit to is taking that particular (and, to MY POV, peculiar) answer to a metaphysical question and giving it the force of law, to be imposed on others who do not share it.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","09:24 AM","abortion-debates","17"

If those verses are relevant to your opinion, good for you; just know that for others they carry no meaning whatsoever in a debate about American civil law. Only a religious fundamentalist - Taliban, Christian Redemptionist, or Ultra Orthodox follower of Judaism - would contend otherwise - would contend that religious law be imposed on those who do not believe as they do.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","09:28 AM","abortion-debates","18"

And do so without adding any 'confusion?' I'm sorry CUNxTime,... but I can't stand it when anyone from either side of the abortion issue dumps religion back into the debate as though religion has anything more to do with it than the actual science and the Constitution does.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","10:49 PM","abortion-debates","21"

I don't do three-ways, and if god was there without me being home, he forgot to leave a dollar on the nightstand. In all seriousness...how does ""psalm blah-b-da-blah"" and ""jeremiah-yadda-yadda"" have anything to do with those of us who don't believe in your silly god? If you really want to justify to an atheist or an agnostic that abortion is wrong...you need to come up with a better excuse than ""god said so"". I highly doubt they throw them in the sink. They probably put them in a red plastic biohazard bag, tie it shut, and throw it on the pile of other red bags to be shipped off to a medical waste incinerator to be burned. May sound graphic and callous to you, but it is probably far more accurate that a ""sink full of bloody baby remains"". Why must the anti-abortion crowd use such fallacious images to sell their point?","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","08:42 AM","abortion-debates","23"

Benjamin Franklin referenced scripture at the Constitutional Convention, so it wasn't out of place there either. As opposed to liberalism, paganism, or secularism being imposed on people? Why not just adopt the bylaws of Sodom and Gomorrah?","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","09:32 AM","abortion-debates","25"

He is God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer"" (i.e. Saddam and/or evil people and nations). So, the contents of the bloody remains in the bag are ok with you?

I think it's tacky and doesn't speak well of the people who try to kick God out of debates like this. When judgment comes to America (if it hasn't started already) for all the innocent babies people have slaughtered over the years, then you're going to be completely clueless about what's causing all the chaos. And that kind of a mentality is extremely dangerous to our country. You can play like God isn't aware of, or a player in all this, but that would be a big, big mistake.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","12:07 PM","abortion-debates","29"
