I have two sisters, one who is into witchcraft and the other who is married to a golf professional. Both sisters had almost the same as my own upbringing (Christian home, kicked out around 15 years old, redeemed back around 17), but we all three chose different paths as we hit our later teen years. One sister watched the move ""the craft"" and decided to follow Wicca. She became pregnant around the age of 20 and was not married. She chose to have her child and offered it up for adoption; the child was adopted by a very wealthy family of studio execs that live in Hollywood. She later had a nude wedding and was married to her husband. She had another child which she decided to keep. Her style of mothering is... unorthodox to say the least. She openly cursed around her child so that he would not see the words as special and would not seek to use them as any child does with what is ""forbidden"". It didn't work; the child is ignorant to the point that some teachers think he is mentally handicapped and is a total brat- a creative brat, but a brat. The other sister was more into drugs and for several years my mother told me she was a prostitute and forbade me to speak to her. I later found out that she had become pregnant and decided to raise her child as a single mother and cleaned up. She used to hustle men to get money, but never did anything involving sex which is where my mother got the notion of prostitution which in a way it was, but she stopped this practice after having a child. This sister was a social outcast from my family despite being, in my view at least, the most intellectual. She later met a retired motorcycle side-car racer who was presently a teaching golf professional. They later became married and live in a wealthy neighborhood; she provides all the best that she can afford for her son, whom I am convinced is destined for greatness. This kid was beating me in monopoly when he was five and I was fifteen, and I am now in school for my Astronautical Engineering major. Since I am a male, my views may be somewhat twisted in that I have a fourth option however immoral it might be: run as fast as I can. For the sake of focus, I'm taking it off of the table. I was kicked out of my house three times throughout my childhood. As such, I learned to be very self-sufficient and somewhat emotionally-detached at a very early age. I've been to more high schools than there are grades in school for a doctor. I've been to several parties too many and never been on the safe side of things. Suffice to say, I don't think I could have the courage my sisters did if faced with a similar situation even though I am in a much better place than they were at this age by the grace of God and the forgiveness of my father. Thankfully, I have never had to worry about an accidental pregnancy, but God knows I've freaked out several times when I thought I might be. I say all of this because any of these situations could seem like a textbook abortion scenario and it ended in life. Whether for good or for worse I am thankful to live in a country where there is a choice, even if I wish for all to choose life regardless of the consequences .","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","11:02 PM","abortion-debates","1"

I have a couple of standard question that I always like to ask after reading a story such as yours, Neb. 1: Do you agree that children (wanted or not) have a right to their life? 2: Do you agree with me that a child's right to their life (the life they are already living) should ""begin"" when their life does? Please don't tell me the answers, yet. I have a request of sorts. Please answer those two questions for yourself and then read your sister's stories to yourself again. Then tell me what you think.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","11:35 PM","abortion-debates","2"

I thought about just saying ""cuz"", but I thought that might be a bit lacking. I am against abortion on a personal level, as is my wife. We believe that if we knowingly take the chance of producing a life, that we personally will care for it and raise it to the best of our abilities. I do not disapprove of it in any way other than as understood in our relationship. There are probably couples and single mothers that abortion is the best option for. It is a personal choice, not a public policy of mine. Yes and no. I agree that civilized society must restrict certain behavior from time to time. However, a person's right in choosing what is best for them is not something that should ever be restricted. If there are consequences for our actions, we should be prepared to accept them, either in the eyes of the law, or in that god fellow so many people talk about. What did he say? Judge not lest ye be judged? Now I don't know if that god fellow is for real or not, but those sound like pretty good words anyway. There were some very learned people who wrote in the bible. It's too bad that society has forgoten some of the lessons handed down to use over the last 2000 years.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","08:08 PM","abortion-debates","7"

I guess it would be something like having no real problem with eating cake you just never real want to. Ha, that's the best I could come up with Some people judge but that has nothing to do with abortion being right or wrong. Seems there is always a disconnect in the arguments of abortion. No one objects to a person choosing what is right for themselves. No one objects to the idea that murdering a person is wrong. The disconnect is that pro-life people feel the unborn is a person and therefore should choose for themselves and thus abortion would be the same thing as if you killed me. So pro-life folks never see it as a one-party problem but as a two-party problem.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","10:24 AM","abortion-debates","10"

I do not see why I should pressure these women to choose ""life."" I fear that the whole muddled up concept of ""choosing life"" is a spurious notion. My main opposition to abortion is that it is an invasive procedure and that it is far better to have failproof contraception, as well as comprehensive sex education on sexuality, contraception, how to avoid STDs, how to avoid the necessity of an abortion. The major problem I have with the so-called ""pro-life"" people is their utter hypocrisy. They love the fetus as well as they love the bloodness of warfare and the death penalty. This is to be morally ugly.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","11:44 AM","abortion-debates","12"

We feel that if we produce a life, it is our responsibility to take care of it. Balance that with the fact that we would have no problem with having an abortion in the event of pregnancy resulting from rape or grave danger to her health. So am I personally opposed to killing an embryo or fetus simply as a matter of birth control...yes. Am I opposed to others making the choice for themselves...not at all. I have a choice, and I choose no. But I am very glad I have the choice.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","05:11 PM","abortion-debates","15"
