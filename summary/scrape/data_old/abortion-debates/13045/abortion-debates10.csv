Selective editing by Chuz Life seems to indicate that Fascism is embraced by both liberals and conservatives. However, it is quite clear that Neo-Fascists have stolen some of the language of the left, as indicated in the above more contextual quote, in order to further the conservative goals of fascism. I believe the LaRouche people are rather fond of this sort of tactic.","Chuz Life","364573","Everyone is invited to read the definitions and Wiki articles and decided for themselves,.... 'Is it is or is it aint?;' An act of 'fascism?;' To declare that a 'child is not a child until it lives too long and develops to an arbitrarily drawn point?;' After which, they can't be denied any longer? It sure seems fascist to me.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","01:42 PM","abortion-debates","136"
"08-08-2009","13045",10,"chester","364518","Yes. It seems that the baby becomes sentient, possibly able to feel pain and such, at that time. A woman should have the right to terminate her pregnancy but that right isn't unlimited. A pregnant woman also has a responsibility to make that choice before the baby becomes conscious.","chester","364637","[QUOTE=CUNxTime;364519] OK, let's for the sake of argument that your POV is passed into law. What sanction would there be for having a later-term abortion? Upon whom would the sanction be applied? The woman? The Doctor? Both? Are you really ready to subject the American people to the sight of people going off to prison for the ""Crime"" of terminating a pregnancy? BTW, if you come out for anything less that the DP or LWOP, you are really condoning the ""murder"" of a sentient being. Do you mean to?","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","07:43 PM","abortion-debates","137"

Doesn't the law already back my position? Aren't there laws, with sanctions, saying how far along the limit for abortions are? I TOTALLY support murder for certain criminal types. However, I wouldn't in this case (and BTW we're talking about elective abortions, not threat to mother type). I don't know what the penalties are currently but I actually do look at abortions as killing. I support a woman's right to chose because I believe her rights supersede that of the fetus and I certainly don't want the govt. in the doctor's office with us. However, at some point the woman gives up the right to terminate a pregnancy because she's let it developer to a point where its not just a bunch of cells. I not sure what kind of penalties are in place for when this happens and I'd be curious to know what the law says now. I haven't give it enough thought prior to this to really have an opinion on the penalty part.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","09:00 AM","abortion-debates","140"

To say you haven't ""given it enough thought"" is evidence that you haven't given the entire issue enough thought.

Sorry I don't have specific legal opinions for each thing I believe in. Anyway, I just went and looked it up and it says most states say that the penalty is up to 2 years in prison. I'm sure that the lawmakers put more thought into it than I did so I'm good with that as the MAXIMUM penalty. I wouldn't think that it would be nessisary that there would be to many prosecutions though.... if the penalties are the same for the doctor combined with heavy fines and loss of license, then I doubt any doctors are going to risk it in the first place.....
