"08-03-2009","13045",6,"snakespit","363800","I guess it comes down to the fact that while I see both the fetus and the person synonymous with life, I do not see the fetus synonymous with the person. I don't really look at it as ""unborn person"" and ""born person"". There are people, and there are fetuses. I myself would always choose to allow that fetus to become a person, but some would choose not to. I support other peoples rights to make their own decisions.","chester","363809","Why is that so hard for the compulsory pregnancy people to understand?","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","11:17 PM","abortion-debates","76"

This is similar to what pets are to people (not the exact same I understand)...you don't want to see them killed and would protect that but if it came between the person and the pet the person's rights win. This is slightly different because you actually don't have a choice to slaughter your pets...as Michael Vick found out","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","09:20 AM","abortion-debates","77"

It is no more valid than arguing that old people are a burden and therefore a family should be able to put them down if they see fit....even if against the persons wishes. If morals are relative to what people want them to be than it isn't good if you are on the other side of that. Don't think it doesn't happen.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","04:14 PM","abortion-debates","82"

Haven't we become sentient and educated enough beings that we are capable of forming our own opinions about what we feel is best for us as individuals? Remember, much of evolution was about the development of a larger brain that got us to where we are as a people. It is through use of discrimination, which in evolutionary terms is not always used in a negative connotation, that we became the only existing hominid about 25,000 - 30,000 year ago.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","08:39 PM","abortion-debates","88"

Surely you wouldn't say we are educated enough beings to be capable of forming our own opinion on whether or not we should kill people under 2 years of age. Why? Because we don't want that up to our own opinion, we want a law saying you can't do it. The abortion debate always will come back to the person question and as I stated many times, my position is the only one that actually refuses to answer the question (as explained in another thread).","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","09:36 PM","abortion-debates","90"
