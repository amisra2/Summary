A line has to be drawn somewhere...from no abortions on one end to 8 months and 29 days on another. In my opinion, that line should be drawn before possible cognition/response to stimuli (this is all concerning elective abortion, not threat to mother type abortions). Most science seems to point to the 3rd trimester before the beginnings of any higher functions begin. Disallowing elective abortions after the 2nd trimester is, IMO, a good compromise.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","11:42 PM","abortion-debates","121"

Fascism; Roe v. Wade which sets the limits on the State's right to limit elective abortion was in fact ""arbitrarily decided."" The SCOTUS 'arbitrarily' picked 'viability' as the point at which a State has the right to intervene. The SCOTUS ignored the fact that 'viability' is a relative term in that a zygote must be ' viable ' in order to live long enough to reach the embryonic stage and latter trimesters. Prior to Roe v. Wade, ""viable"" was more often defined as ""capable of maintaining life"" and such as that. The SCOTUS in Roe (in an act of heavy handed fascism) chose to narrow the definition of the word 'viability' so as to dismiss the previous viability characteristics of even younger prebirth children. ""They don't look like me, they can't think like me or feel pain like,... me so it's ok to deny them, to use the power of the government to deny them,...and to KILL them for any reason I want,... etc."" -- Is a perfect example of ""fascism.""","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","04:05 PM","abortion-debates","128"

That someone else could use exactly the same logic that you use; to defend the slavery as opposed to abortion; should give you cause to pause and reflect. If you don't see it, maybe some other readers will. ---------------------------------------------------- I didn't call you anything, CUNx. I gave my definition for what I see as a 'Leftist Fascist' as inspired by some of your comments. You might deny that the definition applies to you, personally. I expect that you will. Nice attempt to twist things around. The problem is,... I am actually for smaller and LESS intrusive government. I simply feel that (in as much as I am for smaller govt.) the Government does have a legitimate role to play in defending the rights of those too small and defensless to defend themselves; against you and those in your ilk who seek to use the powers of the government to deny them their rights, lives and personhood.
