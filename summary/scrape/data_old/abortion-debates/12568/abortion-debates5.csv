"04-30-2009","12568",5,"Lakrite","351775","The government is not forcing the woman to get pregnant. If by ""a woman's pregnancy"" you mean ""the life of an unborn child"" Your current question has no right answer; both the mother and the current government are willing to allow abortion... ""Who is better to determine the future of slaves? Slave owners or the government?"" Before the Civil War the government declared that the people could ""choose"" to have slaves if they wanted. That was wrong. Therefore the government had a similar opinion to the slaveholder. Both the government and slave holders were willing to have slavery...","Chuz Life","351784","This is a perfectly fitting analogy, Lakrite. The denials of Chester's ilk are right along the lines of those who denied personhood to African Americans during the times of slavery.

"04-30-2009","12568",5,"Chuz Life","351770","Obama opposed the partial birth abortion ban and the born alive infant protection act. So, to answer your question, Obama doesn't take into consideration the rights of the woman's prebirth child. So, yes,... to a simpleton who ignores, denies or is otherwise in denial about a prebirth child's rights,... the answer to your question is almost a ""no-brainer"" (punn intended.)","chester","351789","It's not a ""child"" until it's born, no matter how many times you repeat that stale old mantra. Rights inhere at birth and not before. Even in the unlikely case that there were some type of ""right"", it is trumped my the pregnant woman's rights every time - no exceptions. It's none of your, my, or the law's business. This is why I have no position on the issue. I defer to each individual woman to make the choice for herself. The President recognizes this, and you had better get used to the idea that this will be government policy at least until he leaves office in 2017.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","08:34 AM","abortion-debates","63"

The facts prove otherwise . Biologically, factually speaking,... "" conception "" is the true ""birth"" of a new human individual (child). As, conception is the moment that a new child first (biologically) ""comes into existence."" ( see definition 6 ) Nice hedge,... but you're inccorect. By your claim, a woman has the right to terminate a pregnancy all the way up to birth. That would make Roe. V. Wade an un-constitutional law, seeing as how it recognizes the STATE's right to intervene. Or what? We have a favorable seating on the court. And, we have the Constitutional right to assemble, speak and to petition the government,... You better get used to that,... because just as I was here before Obummer's reign of terror and socialism,...

My POV is that it is up to each and every pregnant woman to make that determination for herself without interference from you, me, or the law. It's a metaphyisical question totally lacking an answer that is correct for all people at all times and in all circumstances. That's why the choice must of necessity be left to the woman, just as our President has declared. That would make Roe. V. Wade an un-constitutional law, seeing as how it recognizes the STATE's right to intervene. Aside from the fact that RvW is not a law but a Supreme Court decision, you are basically correct, but it was about the best that could be obtained in 1973.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","03:09 PM","abortion-debates","67"

I presume then, that, if at some time in the future one of your children should come down with a malady that could be easily treated through embryonic stem-cell therapy, that you would choose death for that child of yours.

In some cases (like the current climate with regards to abortion) we have to do so without physical interefence. But we still have the right (I say responsibility) to defend her child against her. We have the right to speak, assemble and to petition the governent for redress of the laws on the child's behalf with all due respect to the woman's rights as well. Your claim that the choice ""should"" be left up to the woman is nothing more than your opinion. It doesn't negate my 1st. Amendment rights to speak. Neither does it negate my responsibility as a human being to stand up for those who can not defend themselves against those who seek to use the powers of government to DENY them their rights or personhood. That would make Roe. V. Wade an un-constitutional law, seeing as how it recognizes the STATE's right to intervene.--Chuz This is 2009 and the ruling is no more just today than it was the day it was determined.

Why is it that a baby in a womb at 6 months is not a child and does not have rights, but a baby born premature after 6 months is a child with full rights? Then why can't the woman kill the child once it is born? She, after all, knows what to do with her child more than the government does. If she has a 1 year old boy, why not kill him if she feels that it will be best? Why do you make birth such a sharp line between the value of life? Obviously YOU cant. It is spelled A-N- A -L-O-G-Y.

I think maybe you should slow down and re-read what you just responded to and maybe re-think your response to it. Also, you might want to consider that you can't invite someone into your house (intentionally or un-intentionally) then change your mind and kill them for tresspassing. A child in the womb (unless the woman was raped) is only there because it was invited in by the actions of the mother. Her ""choice"" to risk pregnancy if you will. Even if the child was not invited conciously by the woman, it was invited by her actions. There is no justification for killing the child, just because she now considers him or her ""un-invited.""","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","07:58 PM","abortion-debates","75"
