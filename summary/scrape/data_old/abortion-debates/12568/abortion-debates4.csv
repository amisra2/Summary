I leave the meaning for those who care to follow those links to decide for themselves. I make no bones about what my conclusions are, nor about how I arrive at them. You say that you disagree with the conclusions? What you set as your threshold for ""necessary correlation"" is not a template for everyone else to follow. Nor is my threshold at template for others, for that matter. Your personal attacks on myself, my logic, etc. are fast growing tiresome. If you have a position that you feel is better supported by the facts. A position that is complete with your ""necessary correlation?"" Let's hear it.","electrolyte","351342","No, you provide links and references to the constituent premises of your argument. You fail to ""support your claims"" insofar as justifying your conclusion. I do. ""Therefore, zygotes are persons"" is not a logical conclusion of ""aging begins at conception."" The whole point here is that I do object. You just got through saying that this is a forum for discussion of viewpoints, and now you're saying that you're not interested in pursuing that discussion? Yes, and that -- as a consequence -- your argument remains unsupported. I noticed. Plenty of people are just like you in that they see some information and decide that it confirms what they believe. You repeatedly brought up genetics and biology and how they allegedly support your point, so I told you that I wanted to talk about them in detail. Strangely enough, you've balked repeatedly at the offer. 1. You opened the door when you referred to your ""background in logic."" You proceeded to make a statement that you thought was a tenet of logic but was actually not, so I called you on it. You don't get to complain for being exposed as illogical. 2. Your continual reference to ""biological facts"" that you pretend actually support your point is tiresome, too. I keep calling you on it, and you keep pretending that it's not an issue. Given the opportunity to discuss the both the scientific findings and the conclusions that might be drawn from them scientifically (versus philosophically) with somebody who is qualified to do so, you're running away. 3. My previous post addressed a number of points -- some of which you introduced -- including interpretation of the Constitution, personal rights, and bait-and-switch terminology, but you elected to respond to none of them. I don't have to present a position in order to rebut yours. Period. If you knew anything of logic, you'd understand this.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","10:38 PM","abortion-debates","46"

I know that I have consistantly justified my conclusions. MANY have taken issue with my justifications and my conclusions. But that doesn't mean they haven't been justified. I know they have been justified and I don't need your acceptance to know it to be so. If anything, your outrage and personal attacks re-affirm my conclusions even better than any reluctant tacit acknowledgment ever would. When scientists determine that a person's aging process begins at their conception, they are (whether they like it or not) adding justification to the claim that a person's life begins at conception. AND to the claim that ""personhood"" begins at conception as well. [bold added] ... you could have been asking questions which get to the specifics of the points you are trying so desperately to make. (that's why it's so tiresome) No matter how desperate you are to make it so,.. an attack on or the questioning of someones logic is not quite the same thing as refuting it. I accepted your challenge to debate the specifics of the issue and it was YOU who ran from the debate challenge. A total insult to the builders of this site who (I'm confident) has every intention of keeping formal debates genuinely directed towards a significantly meaningful conclusion and not just a ""gold star of the day"" recognition for the one who made the best attempt at a presentation. Yeah,... I'm saving some of that for a more formal debate .","electrolyte","351509","Please pay attention. I'll use small words and type slowly so that you might be able to understand. When done reading, please re-read. I am not denying that you provide citations. What you do not provide are the connections between the claims made by your sources and your conclusions. Many of your arguments are of the form: If A, then B. A. Therefore, B. I am not denying A. I am not denying the validity of the structure. I am denying the soundness of the first premise, A implies B. I see no reason to accept that because biological aging begins at some point, the quality of personhood also begins. Thus, you can argue A all you want, but you're not concluding B until you can justify the first premise. Of course, you've come out and said that you've already given your side of the argument. I'm saying that your argument fails for the above reason. Period. Earth to Chuz: that's the point of the debate. ""A implies B"" is part of your argument, so the burden of showing that it is a justifiable part lies with you. You've purposely skipped this part. Then all you'd have to do is post what you feel are your best reasons for accepting the premise ""aging implies personhood"" instead of providing a link that doesn't work. Just like a right-winger: repeat, repeat, repeat without evidence, and people might just believe it eventually. This is the claim that I challenge. You have made no connection between ""aging"" and ""personhood."" You've simply declared that they correlated. I've said it over and over and over. I can't believe I've had to break it down to a damn argument using symbols. Maybe now you can't justify any more evasion? Poppycock. You got nailed fair and square. You exposed your lack of logical expertise, which -- unlike your assertion -- is direct evidence that you're not as logically suave as you'd like your readers to think. I'm right here, right now. If I had challenged you to a formal debate, I'd have actually said that, and you'd be able to quote me. What I actually challenged you to do was debate the specifics of your scientific claims, and I meant in this thread. I haven't run from my challenge; I'm still seeking my challenge. You still haven't presented anything new about your ""scientific"" claims. The first formal debate I was in at this site might be the last formal debate I'll be in at this site. The grandstanding and rhetoric became the entirety of my opponent's side of the debate after the first -- well, not even the whole first post. I ended up having to refute absolutely absurd claims because I was afraid the judges would either be convinced by them or would deduct points for not addressing my opponent's ""arguments."" I'm in no hurry for more of that nonsense. Considering you've been flaunting your alleged understanding of logic while simultaneously exposing your vapid understanding of logic, I'm certainly in no hurry to be locked into a formally judged debate with you.

Just because I can't provide a ""logical reason"" for quantum gravity doesn't mean that things don't fall. The data show that there's no reason to believe that outlawing abortion produces a decrease in abortion rate. Do you have a response for these data, or are you still desperately searching for a way around them? See, we had this big conversation about all of these data and now you're doing everything within your power to avoid addressing them. That's because they're utterly damning to your point of view. The real kicker here is that the question was answered. It was answered by the conclusions of the study, and I even mentioned it. Lakrite pretended that I didn't.

I don't want any part of this kind of childish nonsense. Especially after having some recent medical events which make me value my time; now more than ever. The connectivity between the point for which a person's life begins and the point of which their physical (biological) life begins is pretty much self evident. I have no idea what more you need to see in the way of connectivity; how much does anyone need to conclude that a person's life begins when their aging does and vice versa? And I'll note for the readers that you have just injected the word ""quality"" into my stated position. A second rules violation of misrepresenting/ mischaracterizing another's views as a means to attack them. Now, in your desperation, you've resorted to adhominems and strawman fallacies,... what's next? Well you can claim anything you want. I welcome all readers to read the materials, do their own research, check their own guts and draw their own conclusions.

Wow, this bait-and-switch is even more blatant that I'm used to seeing. Pretend I'm arguing that ""life"" and ""life"" are different. Yeesh. I already provided two counterexamples that should serve as a jumping point for clarification. Rocks age. They're not alive. Sperm cells are often considered ""alive,"" but they don't age by the criterion you use for declaring zygotes ""aging."" Sadly, this is probably the easy one, and you're not even accomplishing it. Then that's a misinterpretation on your part. I am not intending to inject any meaning that is not existent in your word selection. By referring to the ""quality of personhood,"" I simply mean ""being a person."" I chose the word ""quality"" merely to maintain use of the word ""personhood."" How about an answer from you? You actually do need to work on your comprehension of my points, and my ""injected"" word, quality , does not change the meaning of your argument when read as I've actually intended. So can you.. and you do. Repeatedly. Me too! Can anybody explain why aging implies personhood? Chuz apparently can't. I respond in kind. I see no reason to continue showing particular patience with people who won't answer questions. Why should I be particularly considerate with someone who lies about what I'm arguing or things I've said? The only reason you don't think I'm objective is because I don't agree with you. Bye! Hey, wait... You're not leaving? Okay, but I sure wish you'd make up your mind. Don't you realize that this is exactly what somebody could say if they're completely wrong? It's not even an ad hom . It's even less ad hom -like than the opening statement of my previous post. This statement explains why I was disappointed with the politics of the formal debate I had here. I continued by pointing out that Chuz had exposed several shortcomings in his understanding of logic, which should make it clear that I'm not too inclined to enter a formal debate with him. Why debate with somebody who -- in making a statement about basic logic -- contradicts basic logic? But referring to someone's logical flaw is an ad hominem ? Poppycock. ""Run away!

"04-29-2009","12568",4,"Lakrite","None","Thesis: Gravity exists. Claims: [none] Warrants: [none] Evidence: Things fall. I seem to recall that you posted one -- count it, all of it, ONE country that supports your point. That's cherry picking. Hell, I tested your claim about North America versus Europe, and you still didn't have evidence. Do you have anything else? Please learn to read. I stated that the abortion rate in Africa (and elsewhere) strongly suggest that the legality of abortion has little to no effect on abortion rates. The analysis is already on the website. I linked to the pages. Is this a case of you being unable to read or just unwilling to read? But in science, a theory is evidence, evidence, evidence. My point is that, no, I don't. The data support my point regardless of the reason why I've stated that legality is not an impactful variable. Abortion rates may be higher or lower for a number of reasons. I state legality is one of them and gave my reasons why above. I gave evidence. You have stated legality is not one of those variables. I never said that it was the only variable in play. In fact, I explicitly mentioned, multiple times, that it's not the only variable. Another lie. I agree! But simple logic appears to be too complex for you. You don't understand parody as a method of logical refutation. I see no reason to continue showing particular patience with people who won't answer questions.","Lakrite","351638","Sure thing. Thesis: Gravity exists as that force. Claims: A force must be causing things to fall. Warrants: An object in motion stays in motion, and an object at rest stays at rest unless acted upon by an outside force. Evidence: Things fall. Only one developed country actually has true illegal abortion throughout itself... You are trying to find out if the legality of abortion has an effect on the number of abortions. How would comparing Europe and the United States prove anything? You have to compare developing countries that have legal abortion with developing countries with illegal abortion. That would mean that your opinion is different from the article...it compares the US to Africa/other developing countries and makes that conclusion... Yet you then tell me that I need to read the article again after telling me your point is not even what the article says? Definition of theory: ""1. A belief or principle that guides action or assists comprehension or judgment: staked out the house on the theory that criminals usually return to the scene of the crime. 2. The branch of a science or art consisting of its explanatory statements"" Definition of evidence: ""A thing or things helpful in forming a conclusion or judgment:"" Let me explain this to you as simplistically as possible. There are multiple variables that cause increased and lowered abortion rates. We will look at two of them. 1. Contraception 2. Legality Say a country has legal abortion and contraception, and another has neither. Country A has both. Country B has neither. Country A and B both have similar abortion rates. Now which of the factors listed causes this similarity? You cannot simply say that legality does not because of the evidence shown. That would be the same as saying contraception has no effect. One can say that the number of abortions will increase without contraception because more people will become pregnant. Therefore, contraception has an effect. Outlawing abortion will cause the availability of abortion to decrease. Therefore, it too has an effect on the number of abortions. If country A has something that decreases the number of abortions (contraception) and something that increases the number of abortions (legal abortion) are present at the same time, and Country B has something that decreases the number of abortions (illegal abortion) and increases the number of abortions (illegal contraception) at the same time, the two countries should have relatively similar abortion rates. And they do. The why is important. If you, as a science teacher, cannot understand that, then you should not be teaching science. Thats exactly what I said you stated. You aren't reading everything I am saying. ""one of those""=variables that do effect abortion rates, as clear from my paragraph in context. If that is true, then you DO have to explain why it is that legality is not one of the many variables that effect abortion rates. The evidence you showed may be caused by a number of variables, so now tell me why legality is not one of them. You still haven't. You can't be that ambiguous. You must literally say that A=this and B=this. You have to define the variables first. So you are willing to admit that there is no logical reasoning behind your argument? Oh the irony! I spy a hypocrite! You then must be impatient with yourself, for you have yet to answer my question. Why would the legality of abortion have no effect on the number of abortions? All common sense says it does. Think about it. Yes, think. I hate to tell you that people actually need to think. Abortion is legal: 1). People have access to it almost anywhere. 2). It is safe; more people will take the risk. 3). There is no legal punishment. Abortion is illegal: 1). Access is limited to illegal ""undercover"" operations. 2). It is dangerous; less people will take the risk. 3). There is legal punishment if caught. You cannot honestly tell me that you think abortion rates would be the same. It defies logic completely. Tell me why your evidence applies to your thesis. Why would the legality of abortion have no effect on the number of abortions? Like you, I have little patience with people who can't answer a question.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","01:00 AM","abortion-debates","56"
