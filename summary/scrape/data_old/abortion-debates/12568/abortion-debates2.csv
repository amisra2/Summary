I don't think you can, because I think you pulled this idea right out of your bum. I find myself wondering why it is that you associate abortion-prohibiting countries with rampant crime yet still want to make this country abortion-prohibiting. Outlawing abortion does very little -- if anything -- to actually reduce the number of abortions. Even if we take the Guttmacher numbers at face value, however, the claim that criminalization does not effect the abortion rate does not bear scrutiny. Abortion in Ireland, for example, is illegal in most cases, whereas across the pond in England and Wales it is basically legal (though with more restrictions than in the U.S.). According to Guttmacher, the abortion rate for Ireland in 1996 was 5.9 . For England and Wales, 15.6. That is, by Guttmachers own numbers, the abortion rate for England (where abortion is legal) is several times what it is in Ireland (where it is not). Presumably the lower Irish rate is not due to the countrys fanatical devotion to sex education and contraception. 3. If you want to reduce the number of complications from abortions, those abortions should be legalized procedures performed by standard medical protocol and subject to standard medical oversight.","Lakrite","350423","A known fact is that the fast majority of all countries that have abortion outlawed are in South America and Africa. Countries in these regions are developing countries, and developing countries tend to have increased poverty and crime rates. The few that do allow abortion still have high crime rates. South Africa has very high crime rates, a known fact. You cannot compare the statistics of a developing country with the United States. Outlawing anything does very little in developing countries. However, in more recent years, crime rates have began to decrease in developing countries, but the abortion statistics I was given in the article were from 2003, when developing countries did have higher crime rates. But even if all of what I said above is totally false, you still cannot compare the abortion rates of developing and developed countries. The economic systems are entirely different. One reason for abortion is poverty, and developing countries have more poverty and would be more willing to break that law and have an abortion. In order to more fairly compare abortion rates, we must look not at countries in Africa but countries in Europe. This article explains why it makes little sense to say that by making something that had been legal illegal, more people will do that something. Ironically, it disputes the actual source of evidence you cited in your argument. Even if that evidence is completely valid, your own source disproves the point you are trying to make. Time to compare countries in Europe with more similar economic structures. Let us compare not Africa and the United States, but Ireland (Illegal Abortion) with England and Wales(Legal abortion) Actually, upon reading the whole article, it is stating what I was stating at the start of the post. Read the whole article, it touches on the main points that: 1. Abortion rates are higher in developing countries whether or not it is illegal or legal. 2. Developed countries have lower abortion rates. 3. When comparing developed countries with illegal and legal abortion rates, countries with illegal abortion have less abortions than countries with legal abortion. This point is correct, but the problem is that women should not be getting abortions when abortion is illegal. That is their own fault for breaking the law. It reminds me of court cases were burglars sued homeowners for slipping on their sidewalk when trying to break into their house. If people do damage to themselves as a result of breaking a law, that is their own problem. I have more to say, but I do not have time right now to type anything else or even proofread this post for typos etc. So I will be back later tonight to finish up.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","08:34 PM","abortion-debates","17"

What is the logic behind the idea that outlawing abortion will not reduce the number of abortions? Evidence is used to support a claim based on logic, and I would like to see that logic to better understand what it is exactly you think. Evidence is important, but it will cause ambiguity if there is not sufficient analysis behind it. I believe that if something is made illegal and enforced properly, less of it will occur, including abortion. Can you please tell me why you think outlawing abortion will not have any effect on the number of abortions?

It's pretty damning."" Translation: ""I need something else to argue against, because my XXX is grass if we continue talking about the data."" What is the ""logic"" behind wave-particle duality? One could easily argue that there is none. Our understanding of quantum mechanics is based wholly upon evidence gathered by experimentation. That experimentation supports our current QM-based predictions to a level that is beyond reproach, yet the layman likely sees no logic in the fact that a moving particle has a wavelength. Easy. The data show that the legality of abortion has minimal effect on the number of abortions performed. Period. It's that simple. What don't you understand about this? What your or my predictions happen to be are irrelevant. For example, I predict that outlawing abortion in the U.S. will not lead to ""proper"" enforcement of that law. Arguing that that's my prediction means nothing; arguing that that is the likely result based on data means everything.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","12:00 AM","abortion-debates","29"

Why do you think legislation started changing then? People didn't start getting abortions because the law changed; the law changed because people started wanting abortions. Check the damn numbers already. It's not even a phenomenon restricted to the U.S. As these ""family planning"" options became understood, safe, and affordable, the demand for them increased, irrespective of law. To claim that I've argued that the numbers will increase as a result of elective abortion being banned is not only not supported by the historical facts, it's a big fat lie. Your insinuation is awfully dishonest. Why do you have to build a strawman to attack? Is it because you can't counter my actual argument?","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","12:15 AM","abortion-debates","30"
