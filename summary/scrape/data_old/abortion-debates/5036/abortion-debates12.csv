"05-08-2005","5036",12,"WhiteFalcon","None","She shouldnt go through a pregnancy at 13. Read Jitobears post a few above this, which explains why it is so dangerous and unhealty for a 13 year old GIRL to go through a pregnancy The risks and problems rise greatly when a girl is only 13. Girls that have just started to begin ""maturity"" arent fit to complete something that is difficult for ""adults"". You may be 99.97% certian she would not die, but what do you base that on. And that has nothing to do with all the problems that could occur during pregnancy that could ""ruin this girls life"". Just cause she has a small chance of ""dying"" or even if she wouldnt need to actually ""care for the baby"" doesnt mean her life couldnt be ""ruined"". This ""life"" you talk about isnt one, as of when it is still a ""fetus"".","Steeeeve","118571","It is dangerous and unhealthy for an abortion too. you are talking about .001% and .03% death percents (which is where i got my 99.97% by the way). I mean really..to save a life it is not that dangerous. See above...I disagree Can you prove it is not a life? It has its own seperate human DNA....at some point it can live on its own....it looks like you and me....why is it not a life? It is not part of the women because it will come out and continue to live(as opposed to if your lung comes out it will die). So I think the burden on proof is proving it is not alive...as it would be better to play it safe then to risk killing...right? I would say a .03% of ruining someones like is better then a 99.99% chance of ruining someones life.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","01:42 AM","abortion-debates","178"
