Honestly and I am sure you are looking for the truth, when I was pregnant, I didn't say anything, to anybody. I didn't even realize i was pregnant until i was 4 and a half months pregnant and once i found out i was too scared to tell anyone and didn't tell my dad till i was 8 months along. And also, if i am here being honest, i never called her my baby in the first place, not until i had her for 3 weeks, because i didn't like her, i didn't understand how to take care of a child and never had a mother myself. If my father had known or i went to planned parenthood or knew more about babies, i would never have had her. Thankful now that i have her, it wasn't always that way and there was resentment for a long time. I was lucky, i had the support of my family but millions of women don't have that help, don't have support and abortion can seem like the best option for them, even if they later regret it, which is stupid on those mothers parts. If there was doubt, the mother shouldn't have done it. Sometimes what seems right at the time, if your broke and have no one, then later in life, you have more support and what not, it's easy to regret it i'm sure.","Voice Of Reason","116200","OK, have you ever heard any woman when she found out she was pregnant say ""I am going to have a fetus""?","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","07:38 PM","abortion-debates","31"
"05-03-2005","5036",3,"Nikki","None","i believe an abortion in the first tri-mester should be legal and i don't find it to be murder and I never will They are not babies, they are a fetus, if it was a baby or infant they would call it an infant I think i have a liberal point of view but i care about human life.","Steeeeve","116201","Wait, only the first trimester? Why then? Is a ""fetus"" all of a sudden a person after 3 months? Nothing insane happens from 2months 29 days to 3months 1 day. It was simply a way of dividing up pregnancy that a judge made up. And? A fetus is a person...a baby is a person...an adult is a person. Yet you don't care if it dies? Human life begins at conception as many scientists have pointed out. Even if science disagrees you should still take it on the safe side until you do find out. Would you say that we should take a chance that the ""fetus"" is not a human and keep doing abortions until we find out for sure when human life begins? I don't think human life is something to play around with like that. But to each there own i guess","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","07:39 PM","abortion-debates","32"
"05-03-2005","5036",3,"None","None","None","nikki22005","116202","Lets say for example that when i was 15 i did have an abortion and now 7 years have gone by. I would have been able to use my scholarship to art school and would have gotton my degree, had a great job by now, looked back and said ""i would have a 7 year old now... i could have supported her damn it"" and felt regret. It's all how you look at it I guess. Not that right now i am some bum on the street or anything, because i am not and my daughter lives a very spoiled life, but some people would choose the latter and have thier life dreams and goals, to most people who feel they can't support thier child, i agree with that. People do have a right to live thier lives the way they want to, even if they have abortions and believe in capital punishment, it's an american right. If you don't like abortions, don't have one.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","07:41 PM","abortion-debates","33"

"05-03-2005","5036",3,"Steeeeve","None","The 13yr old girl was ruled to be smart enough to know if she wants an abortion or not. However, if she is smart enough to get an abortion then she is smart enough to have sex, know the consequences, and know how to take care of a baby. I honeslty don't think the 13yr old girl knows the consequences of her actions at all and therefore shouldn't have sex, get an abortion, or take care of a baby. Obviously she had sex and got pregnant. Now she needs to learn the consequence of this action much the same way I learn from my mistakes. Should she keep the baby? No, because she doesn't know how to take care of one. If you let her get an abortion you are just saying that there are no consequences to your mistakes because we can always cover them up or make them easier for you. This really gets me steamed. She had sex, she needs to know what happens when you do have sex. I bet she will have many more abortions after this because there is no consequence to being irresponsible anymore.","WhiteFalcon","116205","So your saying here that ""making"" her have the baby would be the only ""punishment"". I agree with you that she isnt responsable enough and doesnt know the ""consequences"" of what she did, so she obviously wont beable to care for a baby. Your saying here that she shouldnt have an abortion because thats the only ""punishment"". So if she shouldnt have an abortion, all she can do is have the baby, yet you state that her having the baby is a bad idea. Seems like you contradicted yourself a little. There can be other types of consequences instead of ruining her life...","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","07:44 PM","abortion-debates","35"

Oddly enough a baby that died before birth is buried next to my grandfather. By the way Nikki..you can quote by using the quote option. It is the little box that looks like a quote bubble underneath the word [Color] and 2 to the lft of the # sign. just hit that at the beginning of the quote and then again at the end of it...or if something pops up, paste the quote in there.

"05-03-2005","5036",3,"Steeeeve","None","Who said it was a punishment? I said the 13yr old should deal with the consequences...that is far from a punishment. It is more of a lesson in life, there are no quick easy fixes. The only punishment would be to the baby that gets aborted. The girl has sex and punishs the baby by death...that makes no sense. She needs to face consequences the way everyone else does, this is how we learn. This goes beyond abortion too. Pain, depression, stress are all normal things people should feel. Not everything is happy flowers. This is why Prozac makes me mad too. This fixes nothing for most patients. People need to stop looking for quick fixes and deal with the problems they are dealt. Just because it is hard doesn't mean you don't do it. Do you view problems as opportunities or threats?","WhiteFalcon","116283","Yet you also state that the girl is not responsable enough or informed enough to take care of a kid, however you still say she should deal with the ""consequences"". I agree there should be ""consequences or a punishment"" for her action, however you even agree she is not fit to have a child, and yet you state that is the only way for her to know the real ""consequence"".","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","09:46 PM","abortion-debates","41"

We all make mistakes in our lives, but the measure of anyone's character lies in dealing honorably with the consequences. I salute you. Moreover, in later years I think you will become more convinced that you made the right decision. At least I did. I got married a week after I turned 19; the marriage was a disaster (and ended nearly 40 years ago), but the kids and grandkids bring me far more joy than any fraternity parties I might have missed.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","09:52 PM","abortion-debates","42"
"05-03-2005","5036",3,"None","None","None","Steeeeve","116287","I believe I stated that she is not responsible enough to have sex or any of those things. However, one did happen..she had sex. Now she should face the consequence of this action because she thought she was responsible enough. I suspect she will learn otherwise. Maybe a little kid thinks he is responsible enough to play with fireworks...you tell him no and he does it anyway. He blows his hand off. He made the choice and now lives with the consequences eventhough he wasn't ready to have no hand and to be playing with fireworks.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","09:52 PM","abortion-debates","43"

This girl is not near ready to have a child. Its almost like your saying 2 wrongs equal a right. The girl has sex(wrong) + She should have to deal with the ""consequence"" even though she is not near the maturity level she need to be to carry a baby, therfore most likley ruining her life as well as her babys(wrong)= (Right) Shes a kid, she made a mistake and isnt near responsability to care for a child or know the ""consequences"". Instead of ruining this girls life you need to teach her so she knows the ""consequences"" of this. Her life shouldnt be ruinied by this one mistake, that she wasnt even informed on as much as she would need to be. 2 wrongs dont equal a right.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","10:05 PM","abortion-debates","44"
