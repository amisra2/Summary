"05-16-2005","5036",22,"Duo The Slave Owner","None","Since when has human life never had a price on it? Human life has always had a price and a rather cheap one at that looking at history.","Steeeeve","123464","And you think this is ok?","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","07:27 AM","abortion-debates","316"
"05-16-2005","5036",22,"Voice Of Reason","None","A species............What the hell are you talking about? Its a baby..........","tonybrown74","123591","Did you bother to read what I was responding to?","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","12:20 PM","abortion-debates","317"
"05-16-2005","5036",22,"Steeeeve","None","And you think this is ok?","tonybrown74","123606","Non-sequitor. What does the ""price"" have anything to do with a woman wanting - or needing - an abortion?","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","12:28 PM","abortion-debates","318"
"05-16-2005","5036",22,"Sigma","None","The only women I have ever seen actually regret the decision felt they were coerced into it. And that is a fairly small percentage. What adverse effects?","Voice Of Reason","123623","That is because you bury your head in the sand and refuse to see the real world when it comes to murder in the womb............Make no mistake about it that is what it is.......Murder in the womb............","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","12:58 PM","abortion-debates","319"

What does the ""price"" have anything to do with a woman wanting - or needing - an abortion?","Voice Of Reason","123627","Because some of you pro abortion types have the false impression that women have abortions becasue they can't afford the cost to carry the babies to term which is and outright lie.........","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","01:00 PM","abortion-debates","320"
"05-16-2005","5036",22,"Voice Of Reason","None","As usual you jump all over the place............I am talking about social services for Pregnant Women...........Any woman that can not afford to carry a baby to term can get the financial assistance they need from them...... As far as insulting goes you open mouth insert foot and i just calles em as I sees em............. I don't think I would ever want to get near a woman like you who is without compassion for the unborn...............","jitobear","123665","You just keep proving how you don't care about women every time you post. All you care about is getting them through pregnancy. All they are to you is a pregnancy. The only thing you will address or acknowledge is that pregnancy. You completely dismiss everything else in their lives - their safety, jobs, education, and any family they may be supporting. Everything takes a back seat to that pregnancy. And you say I have a lack of compassion? You see very little. Funny thing to say to a woman who lied, worked three jobs, doubled her course load, to have her baby AND get her degree so she would be able to support it later. I love kids and would like to spoil every last one on this planet. The difference between my compassion and yours is that mine doesn't end at birth. You can't and won't help babies by continuing to trivialize serious issues and demonize desperate women.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","01:43 PM","abortion-debates","321"

For a while there I thought you might answer my questions but then you slip back into this rhetoric.

Both had multiple children and would have been a financal burden on both families. One was a single mother with 2 kinds, and the other was a married couple with 3 kids. But, hey!
