You don't offer any constructive arguments to support your position, and you sure as hell don't try to represent other positions fairly. All you do is post non sequitors and childish retorts. I'll tell you what, I'll start a thread where you can show that you're willing to engage in a discussion about the morality of abortion. I can't say I expect much, but a pleasant surprise is always nice. Of course, you could always just engage cushla_machree's argument directly instead of trying to evade it. And for God's sake, what's up with those constant ""....."" after each phrase? Do you not understand how to use sentences, and commas, and periods?","Voice Of Reason","129557","Just because you say it does not make it so.......Your problem is your blinded by your liberalism and have no compassion for the unborn and that is very sad...........","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","11:28 PM","abortion-debates","406"

I'm stating a fact that anyone on this board can verify. So how about you directly answer cushla_machree's position, addressing each of her points and offering a critique of her position? Or can't you do that?","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","12:04 AM","abortion-debates","407"
"05-28-2005","5036",28,"Steeeeve","None","I like VOR has gotten to the point where he knows no one here will listen. Some of us actually take what the person says and look it up and research it to see whats up. However, sense the vast majority don't, it gets tiring going in circles. So I don't really blame VOR. By the way, I think this case in goign to the SCOTUS soon.","Steeeeve","129779","My own point was proven in the posts falling the quoted one.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","06:34 PM","abortion-debates","408"
