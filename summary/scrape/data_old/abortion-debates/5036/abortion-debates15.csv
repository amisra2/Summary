You see only one - impending death, with everything else being selfish or frivolous. That is not compassion for woman. Quite the opposite actually . It simply makes you another garden variety misogynist who fails to see any value of women past their reproductive organs. BEEEEP Wrong answer. Pregnancy will be more dangerous for her at that age. She is a little girl. Got that? Not teen. Not woman. Little freaking girl. Go down to your local middle school and look around. And remember - I am the one between us who has actually has had experience as a 13 year old girl and being pregnant.","FISHX","120885","Sorry i was pregnant at 14 and it did me no harm.

"05-11-2005","5036",15,"None","None","None","inmyopinion","120989","This post brings several thoughts to mind: 1) If she had the child, her mother ""said"" she'd care for it. This was the same mother who threw the girl out. 2) Why did the state advocate for her to allow the abortion yet NOT go after the FATHER ( the girl gave his age; it was statuatory rape). How do you support one law and not the other? 3) I don't know how a 13 year old could cope with the emormity of the situation w/out a strong, close family (that she didn't have). I think this would be a reason she ""chose"" to get rid of the ""problem"". [ I have seen former students of mine, from really tight, close families, have kids and get on with school, etc. Not that I support it, but I have seen it] With so many couples (older, mature, married) who ""want"" kids, I wish some would step up and adopt thes kids who are being aborted. Sadly, they want in-vitro, surrogates, etc..............","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","06:00 PM","abortion-debates","220"

You conservatives are rediculous to be in favor of a baby in this case. She has no close family, she is a 13 year old girl, and isnt near mature and ready enough to have a baby. Err on the side of life....even if that life isnt even wanted? Even if that life is coming into an already broken family? Let me ask you this you people who are con abortion based on religious and God etc. A ""baby"" is a blessing, no? Well how much of a ""blessing"" would it be if the parents dont even want the baby in the first place?","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","06:31 PM","abortion-debates","222"

I have not blamed it for anything. I agree, it did not go out and get pregnant. What is the significance of this? Are you saying that the woman needs to be punished for going out and getting pregnant? Truly, it is. However, I would never turn around and say ""You could have made the wrong choice with me, therefore I will make sure you never have a choice in the future"". I am glad she chose life. I am also glad she had a choice. She chose to have me and I love her for that. Are you so insecure, Voice Of Reason, that you believe you would not have been born if your mother had a choice? imo, women should not be forced to remain pregnant to provide a child for someone else.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","08:43 PM","abortion-debates","225"
