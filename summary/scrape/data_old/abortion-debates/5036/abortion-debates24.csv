I don't see anyone else who has any right to make such a decision for her. Apparently she can choose to have sex, get pregnant and care for another human being. But she can't make the choice not to go through with it. Makes total sense.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","09:08 PM","abortion-debates","346"

I happen to agree. However, I would say those also add up to not being mature enough to have an abortion.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","09:17 PM","abortion-debates","347"
"05-17-2005","5036",24,"Steeeeve","None","Yeah it does matter if you put a price on a human life. I guess if you support slavery though and prefer devaluing human life. In fact you probably support devaluing women too (which many are against on this forum). You would be ok with girl being on the corner or maybe even having a 5yr old in the sweat shop for 10hrs. So YEAH IT MATTERS So just because other people do it means it is ok? I guess Duo is in favor of pricing humans","Duo_Maxwell","124350","Ah, the fallacy of the strawman. Considering how you use fraud as the fundemental basis for your arguments, I shouldn't have been suprised at that specific event. I don't support pricing life , I just merely accept it as how this world works. As I said before, and as you clearly ignored (which btw is the fallacy of selective reading, two counts of fraud , growing up means making peace with establishment. Life, all life, has a price. Deal with it. Where did you get that? Devaluing? Please, where did I make such a claim. females and males of all species (and those inbetween) have a price. It costs millions to mount a peacekeeping mission. yet those only occur when a large, and I mean LARGE amount of people are killed or thought as to have been killed. Life has a price. A large amount of people must be killed in order to equalize or be larger then the amount spent to save them. It's a sad fact of life, but one that exists, no one likes it we just accept it and move on. There are things you can change in this world, there are things you cannot, that is one of them. Sweatshop yes if the alternative is worse. As you recall, in some parts of Southeast Asia, girls that young are brought in the sex industry. A sweatshop is far more productive and less damaging in the long run to the girl. it's not a great choice, but one weighs the pros and cons, it is clearly the better. As for being on the corner, if that is the only way to ensure your family survives, well, that's the price of life. As you clearly see life is very much a ***** and values people, behaviors and everything else by comparsion. Sure, it matters to some, does it affect anything? No. Can it be changed? No. Does it matter if it is okay? Things that are inherently natural, and for all purposes unchangable are pointless in discussing beyond a philisophical manner for the sole reason as they cannot be changed. It is merely there. I don't like it, but I cannot change it and when looking back through history, I see a pattern of life valued extremely cheap. I guess Steeeve is in favor of lying, using fraud and otherwise acting in a very unchristian like manner.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","09:19 PM","abortion-debates","348"

Never mind...........","cushla_machree","124353","I don't have to put a pie in the oven just because they neighbors want one. Get real. What part of ITS MY BODY AND MY UTERUS AND MY LIVING cells do YOU not get? ::rolls eyes:: why would i bother conversing with a misogynist?","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","09:22 PM","abortion-debates","349"

I 13 year old may or may not be mature enough to handle sex and its consequences. However, if we are going to presume she is old enough to HAVE the child, then i don't she how she would not be old enough to decide not to. Your logic is fine as long as you say she is not mature enough to care for a child, being a child herself. Howwever i did not get that impression, thus i find your logic rather hypocritical. Pregnancy isn't like getting a tooth pulled or your wisdom teeth out, it is something that is so fundamental to being a woman and to the rest of your life. As long as she is informed and discussed of ALL her options, i think she should be able to make that choice for herself.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","09:27 PM","abortion-debates","350"

This is why you can't have sex with a 13yr old...she is not mature enough to understand the consequences, however, having a baby will help that out and her getting an abortion will let her know that having unprotected sex at 13 is ok because you can always abort. I hope that clears things up","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","09:35 PM","abortion-debates","352"
"05-17-2005","5036",24,"Steeeeve","None","Awww Duo....I guess you really love your fallacies (even if you mis-use them all the time). Ah, the fallacy of you think you know everything. You did it in the bold part. So is it ok to so? We have abortion, that doesn't mean I have to like it or accept it...how do you think things change? If you just say ""hey, we can't change anything so what the heck...sell people"" Then you have slavery. So do you support pricing people or not? Last warning on you calling me a liar without any backing.","Duo_Maxwell","124364","How am I misuing that? You clearly made a straw man out my claim and then attacked me for things I never said or implied. And I devalue them where? of wait, never. More fabrication upon your part. What is the point of assiging morally good and bad to thinkings completley out of our control? The only thing I can think of is to make one feel more important then they really are. I asked you a question before: When has life never had a price? , you're clearing using the fallacy of raising the bar to limit the discussion to abortion and slavery, which are parts of pricing life, but are not the entiretiy. Banning slavery prices life as well. It merely prices human labor above pack animals. There's no getting around this. Life has a price. You claimed that I support pricing life. my post made no reference towards that , in fact it even stated making peace with establishment. Your claim is one that is obviously wrong and is directly contrdicted in the post you quoted.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","09:42 PM","abortion-debates","353"

With full knowledge of such, you still made the claim. How is that not lying? HELL. I even said specific parts that proved I wasn't approving of it, merely that I accepted it as something that is part of life and the to a greater extent, the universe. How can you cite a quote that implies, hell, says! that it's not good, but what can I do and then say that I support it? That's lying.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","09:57 PM","abortion-debates","355"

"05-17-2005","5036",24,"Nurglitch","None","Yes, letting her get an abortion will teach her that unprotected sex at 13 is okay, because she can always go through a dangerous and invasive medical procedure. In fact, I bet that if she gets that abortion, she's be spreading her legs before the bleeding even fully stops!","Steeeeve","124407","Wait, medical procedure? She can't consent to one of those as she is not 18...Oh well, who cares about laws anyway? That aside, people that get one abortion are likely to have another.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","10:28 PM","abortion-debates","360"
