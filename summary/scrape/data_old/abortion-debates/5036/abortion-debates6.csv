She simply does not have the maturity to understand what she is getting into if she does consent to sex. 2 - She can't consent to sex. Age of consent varies from state to state - the youngest is SC at 14, everywhere else it's at least 16. 3 - Girls hit puberty first - in my reading about boys at that age - it's questionable that any of her male peers could get her pregnant yest - which means it is far more likely that somebody older than her by at least 2 is the father. 4 - It is physically dangerous for a girl this young to be pregnant. 5 - You do not punish a little girl by saddling her with consequences that are scary and difficult for adults.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","01:50 PM","abortion-debates","78"

If she doens't understand sex then abortion is way outta her league. Yet abortion is a piece of cake decision? I don't think so. It is dangerous to have the abortion too. what were the facts...1 out of 10000 die from the pregnancy and 1 outta 30000 die from the abortion. Both are pretty small odds. (I think someone posted that earlier). So the danger is not a big issue. Also, a consequence is not a punishment. The punishment would be sending her to jail or grounding her..something like that. Pregnancy is a consequence for her action. She doesn't know how to consent to sex and she surely doesn't know how to consent to an abortion. However, she will learn a lot about sex if she has the baby...Most people learn from the consequences from their actions.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","02:59 PM","abortion-debates","81"

Basicaly if this termination went ahead then the state would be breaking it's own laws.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","03:07 PM","abortion-debates","82"
"05-04-2005","5036",6,"zelma","None","The 13 year old girl is not mature enough to care for a baby. She is not even old enough to make a decision about an abortion. She is still a child and her parents should be making these decisions....not the courts or anyone else. Personally, I think that a life begins when ""the breath of life"" is given to a born infant. If life begins at conception, could you take that fetus out of the womb and it live? No, so to me, it is not a living viable entity, it depends on an umbilical cord to exist. That is how I see it.","gnojek","116813","So if she had to have surgery or she would die, would it be ok if the parents objected to modern medicine and let her die? Why do the parents get to decide if she lives or dies? if her baby lives or dies? You could take a 6 month old baby out and it would live. It takes extra care, but all newborn babies can't live without lots of care. And I read the article linked by Duo_Maxwell and that girl seems much smarter than your average 13 year old, especially in foster care.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","03:52 PM","abortion-debates","83"
"05-04-2005","5036",6,"Steeeeve","None","I think since the 13yr old is smart enough to have an abortion that she is should be smart enough to find a place to live...Kick her out of government supported housing...yeah i know, I normally support helping people but in this case I support teaching the girl a valuable lesson that she just an immature girl that doesn't know what she is doing.","gnojek","116814","It's not legal for a 13 year old to have a job.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","03:58 PM","abortion-debates","84"
