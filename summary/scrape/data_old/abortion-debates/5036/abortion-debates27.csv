I'd like you to find examples of all these viable third trimester abortions occuring on healthy babies. I doubt you would find few, if any doctors who are performing this. You are just trying to be inflammatory with no evidence to back up your statements. Fact is, you know nothing about the woman who are getting abortions, why they may be getting them and the conditions that brought about their choices.","Voice Of Reason","127629","I don't have to do that.........If there were not abortions being performed in the 3rd trimester then why would the U.S. Senate pass a bill banning it?","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","10:21 PM","abortion-debates","391"

You ask a good question, why WOULD the senate waste time passing a bill banning a procedure only done under the most extreme circumstances, when 90% of abortions occur in the first trimester of pregnancy? Answer: for people like you. What better way to stir up the masses then have them imagine viable fetuses being plucked out of the womb, moments from birth? It works.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","08:58 PM","abortion-debates","393"
"05-26-2005","5036",27,"Voice Of Reason","None","I was around during those days and the stats that the pro abortion people put out are greatly exaggerated ? Actually in most cases the pregnant woman carried the baby to term and put it up for adoption if she did not want it Did you know that the plantiff in Roe V Wade was coerced into filing the lawsuit by a group of feminists and has been quoted as saying it was the worse decision of her life and she will regret it always? It boggles my mind how you pro abortion types can shrug off 40,000,000 murders in the womb since 1972........It begs to ask the question, How can you sleep at night?","cushla_machree","129079","That is funny given that one of the stats i sent you was posted from the national center for health statistics. It was reposted at abortionfacts.com, which is sponsored by the heritage house, a pro-life organization. Just because something doesn't fit into your ideological agenda, does not mean it is biased. Those statistics were good enough to post on a pro-life site, which makes me laugh at your comment. You don't like the statistics, so you make up some BS about it being exaggerated. Thanks for the laugh. Well, that is obviously true because you said so. I don't see the revelance here. So what? Some woman are willing to give up their babies for adoption, some aren't. That has been the norm for a very long time. I don't have a problem with adoption, it is a wonderful thing. I have a problem with forcing woman to give birth and give their children up for adoption. If you don't think it happened, watch the Magdalene sisters. Or read about them. I do know that the woman known as Roe now works for pro-life organizations. I however see no proof of coercion. And frankly, i don't care what she believes now. Roe V Wade is not about her, but about the woman across the country, as concerned with their right to privacy in making medical decisions. I have a feeling it is because those 'types' don't view it as murder. It is called difference of opinion, of which people are entitled to have. I can't answer for them, i can only answer for myself. As a woman, being pro-choice is not about whether or not i agree with abortion, or what the total number of abortions is. it is about the fact that reproductive rights protect human dignity and autonomy at a basic level. Creating laws that affect your body is a form of ownership, forcing you to carry a pregnancy to term, or forcing you to abort are both forms of coercion, both taking ownership of your body away from you. It is about who has the right to your destiny and your body, you? Men? Politicians? The government? And that is the cornerstone of the movement itself, does the woman have control over her body, or does the government. Since 1965's Griswold v. Connecticut, the Supreme Court has recognized a ""right of privacy"", it invalidated a Connecticut law prohibiting the use of contraception by married couples. Roe v. Wade established that laws against abortion violate a constitutional right to privacy. And that is what the pro-choice movement is about, the privacy to make reproductive decisions, in effect, to be in control of your reproductive choices. My body and my health would always come over that of any developing fetus. When you give a fetus rights, you supercede those of the woman. When politicians pass fetal rights laws, they are almost always used to prosecute and undermine the legal status of pregnant women, not to protect pregnant woman and their fetus. Some people believe that the right to life begins at conception, others when it is a viable being, at birth, or not till later. That is all based upon opinion, which is why i do not agree with bestowing rights upon a fetus, zygote, etc till it is born. And i think birth is something we can can agree on.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","09:28 PM","abortion-debates","394"

I support the privacy rights of woman. Do *I* personally support third trimester abortions? No, not unless there was a compelling medical reason. But here is the problem, the current law against late term abortions is unconstitutional because it does not allow for an exception for the womans health. that is unfathomable, and quite frankly shows that the creators and supporters of said legislation do not have the best interests of the woman at heart. In fact, it shows they could care less. Honestly, I have a problem with this types of law, because where does the burden of proof lie? WHO gets to decide when an abortion would be medically necessary? Do you get to go to another doctor for a second opinion if the first denies you? I am just left wondering how you would legislate this fairly, which doesn't even address the issue of privacy - would the woman have to petition the courts and open up her private medical record? To me ultimately this is a privacy issue, thus i do support abortion rights throughout the pregnacy, given that fetal viability is subjective. Well, i can tell you she wouldn't be the first to regret her past. And i wouldn't be surprised if she felt as if she were a pawn in the whole issue..but yet i don't see what that has to do with the issue. Roe V Wade is probably the most important piece of legislation concerning the rights of woman, along there with the right to vote. I hardly feel it relevent if in hindsight, she regrets her actions. Because it was about all woman, not just her. That is all fine and well, and i agree, but i am left wondering WHO is going to decide when one is warrented and when one isn't. I could tell you personally what situations i think abortion is warrented, but that would be my own opinion. And i don't think i can legislate that on woman i do not know. As a woman, i can tell you were i pregnant i don't think that it would concern YOU or anyone else for that matter. You may lose sleep over the potential lives lost to abortion, but i lose sleep over how anyone could think they could control my life and my destiny like that. I tend to think my rights are more important than anything growing inside me. And i don't feel the need to prove to anyone why i might need an abortion, given that it is my life. Just because people are willing to adopt is not a valid reason. I don't beleive the majority of the pro-life movement really cares about these children, because they are the first in line to force a young poor girl to abort (while they or their rich friends could easily get an abortion were it illegal elsewhere), and then first in line to deny her a living wage, healthcare, affordable housing, etc. I can't expect you to understand what it is like to be the mother of several children, only to get pregnant again with no means to support the next child. You haven't been in that position thus have no right to judge. This is a complicated issue, and saying well i think some abortions are warrented, and that people should be forced to carry pregnancies to term because somewhere out there someone is willing to adopt, isn't really realistic. This is about fairness and privacy under law. And who would overturning roe V wade hurt the most? I can give you a hint, not the politicians familes who would suggest such a thing.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","09:34 PM","abortion-debates","404"

Instead of debating, the pro-life side tends to resort to emotional appeals, like.... ""but would YOU support ripping out 8 month old fetuses and throwing them in the garbage?"" NO, and i doubt anyone would support such an extreme position, BUT it is an excellent way to deride the conversation. Of course i am not one of THOSE PEOPLE. Suddenly they have shifted the debate in their favor. My problem with most pro-lifers is they tend to live in a dream world. Where only neccessary abortions will occur, people obviously won't use their connections to get illegal abortions and no woman will endanger herself to self induce. Abortion has been around for ages, its not going to magically go away just because you personally dislike it.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","09:44 PM","abortion-debates","405"
