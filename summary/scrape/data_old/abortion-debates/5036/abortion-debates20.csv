"05-13-2005","5036",20,"Diogenes99","None","A few years ago, a guy on the Gulf Coast was hauled into court for collecting the eggs of an endangered species of sea turtle. He argued that they were only eggs, not protected sea turtles. The judge replied ""No, but they're going to be!"" and fined him $250,000. Do human beings deserve less protection than sea turtles?","tonybrown74","122356","Are human beings endangered? And the point would be irrelevant. It's still the woman's body. You cannot force her to bear children to save the species.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","04:06 PM","abortion-debates","286"

Forcing that soul to inhabit a child that is neither wanted or unable to be cared for is worse then allowing it to come back in a condition where it is wanted and able to be cared for.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","04:09 PM","abortion-debates","287"
"05-13-2005","5036",20,"Voice Of Reason","None","I love women ............ What other reasons would there be to murder a baby in the womb?","jitobear","122376","Love like yours - who needs hate? The reasons for abortion are as numerous and varied as women are. But you don't see that. All you see is a baby making machine who has nothing to worry about in this world at all unless she is at death's door. Pregnant women need - food, shelter, safety, medical care, an income, and all the same things you do. They may also be supporting other children. Those issues impact pregnancy - but you absolutely refuse to acknowledge them. You seem to think that all pregnant women are spoiled little rich girls with endless means and you trivialize their issues down to ""bad hair days"" and ""stretch marks"". You are blind and hateful and insulting to every woman alive - including your wife, sisters, and daughters. And who is the horse's behind who reduced helath concerns to a summer without tennis? What are you - some white bred yuppie who has never left the burbs? Lots of women are poor. Lots of women have families to support. My health concerns caused me to have to stop working half way through my pregnancy - something that was managable for me as a single woman, but would not be now - the single mother of a ten year old boy who gets ZERO child support.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","04:49 PM","abortion-debates","288"

He has never EVER been willing to acknowledge that women face other serious issues when pregnant, nor has he ever been willing to dialogue about finding ways to address those issues as a means of reducing abortion. NOT ONCE. He reduces it to a ""bad hair day"" - those were his words.

Well, just puting myself in his shoes.. i dont think he truly disrespects women.. He may have said that type stuff, but i mean, ive said some dumb stuff on here as well... but that doesnt make me the biggest woman hater on the face of the planet. I think he would admit that, During a pregnancy it is rough on the lady... there is no doubt in my mind he would admit that.. (which he might have since i didnt read further down cause im just responding to you i guess..) but anyways, i just dont the VOR is truly a person who would degrade someone who is just as human as he is..","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","01:36 AM","abortion-debates","294"
"05-14-2005","5036",20,"None","None","None","Nurglitch","122536","I think what Jitobear may be saying, if I may take the liberty Jitobear, is that Voice of Reason is not respectful or sympathetic to position of women faced with the decision to abort or not. Voice of Reason does not 'hate' in the sense of active malevolence, but rather in the sense of being insensitive to the realities of other people's lives. Putting himself in other's positions is not his strongpoint, from what I've seen. Take his position that women using abortion as a means of convenient birth control is wrong. Personally, and maybe I'm unimaginative, but I cannot think of a form of birth control less convenient than an abortion. When a woman cannot bear the economic impact of carrying, baring, and raising a child, I do not call that a measure of convenience. I call that a measure of desperation. I personally think that children should be conceived when its parents are willing and able to raise them. But when a child's parents are not willing to raise it, or unable to raise it, and all other options such as finding foster care are exhausted, then that child should be aborted and its loss mourned. What Voice of Reason seems unwilling to acknowledge is that this latter situation is the reality that many women are faced with. The harmful impact upon those women is such that we must give them the option of abortion.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","02:22 AM","abortion-debates","295"
"05-14-2005","5036",20,"None","None","None","Duo_Maxwell","122539","What I don't get is that the anti-abortion, particularly those who use the 40 million number is why they never talk about the consequence of feeding, clothing and educating these children, not to mention the opportunity cost of forcing women (and their other caregivers) to have these children. But that isn't all that suprising really as most people here don't have the simplest grasp of economics. Seems that they think that life in the womb is precious, but don't give a damn about the kid or the impact upon society once s/he is born.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","02:25 AM","abortion-debates","296"
