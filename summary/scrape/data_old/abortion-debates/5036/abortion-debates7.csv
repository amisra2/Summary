Please show me something that says that 2 - 13 year olds will be charged with a crime for having sex. I've never heard of it. Ok, I see your site, but I don't see where it says what you claim. All it says about stat rape is: Statutory rape is the crime that someone can be charged with if they have sex with a person who has not reached the age of consent but who agrees to have sex. Some countries have different names for this, and some states in the US call it 'unlawful sexual penetration' or just 'rape'. But, this is implying that 2 - 13 year olds would be charged for having sex. This is not the case.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","05:39 PM","abortion-debates","95"

"05-04-2005","5036",7,"Steeeeve","None","Then how can she consent to an abortion? If she doens't understand sex then abortion is way outta her league. Yet abortion is a piece of cake decision? I don't think so. It is dangerous to have the abortion too. what were the facts...1 out of 10000 die from the pregnancy and 1 outta 30000 die from the abortion. Both are pretty small odds. (I think someone posted that earlier). So the danger is not a big issue. Also, a consequence is not a punishment. The punishment would be sending her to jail or grounding her..something like that. Pregnancy is a consequence for her action. She doesn't know how to consent to sex and she surely doesn't know how to consent to an abortion. However, she will learn a lot about sex if she has the baby...Most people learn from the consequences from their actions.","jitobear","116879","Grils that young are not physically ready for pregnancy. According to this link girls under 20 are 4 times as likely to have problems and die due to pregnancy than a mature woman. And that pregnancy complications and unsafe abortion is the number one cause of deaths in women under 20 (I suspect this may be a global statistic that may be lower in the western world where there is better medical care).

"05-04-2005","5036",7,"Steeeeve","None","How is it ruining her life? Lots of things are obstacles in my life...they don't ruin it. so is KILLIING THE 14 WEEK OLD UNBORN BABY...but no one seems to care about that....actually, I don't think making her have the baby is unfair. What better way to teach then to give her the chance to see what having sex does. I am sure she had learned at some point that having sex can get you pregnant...that obviously didn't work. This will. If I steal something something I should pay a consequence too...jail time...I don't ask for someone to teach me that stealing is wrong. BLAH","WhiteFalcon","116901","Are you joking?! Do you understand the responsabilities and maturity that it takes to beable to care for a kid. This is girl is 13! What you have to understand is if a 13 year old girl were to concive a baby, there are much greater odds for somthing to go wrong, with either the girl or the baby. Its just not smart to have a baby so young. No one seems to care about how sad of a life this baby will most likley have and probably end up making mistakes just like this girl. I am applled that you are so close minded to see just about giving her a ""consequence"" because she did wrong and the only way to learn is to make her have a baby. You need to look at all the problems that would occur if a 13 year old GIRL would be to have a baby. This is absoloutley rediculous that you think it right to make a 13 year old girl have a baby.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","06:48 PM","abortion-debates","102"

That's what I was asking.... It's a valid link that doesn't say whether 2 underage kids would be charged with a crime for having sex. The only thing I have found (doing your work for you) is something about British law, which wouldn't apply to the kid in Florida. http://www.ageofconsent.com/comments/underagesexlaw.htm This is implying that the 14 yo was charged with a crime. I wonder if the girl was also charged? If not, this is British law that seems weird to me...","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","08:17 PM","abortion-debates","103"

The law in California does say that 2 people under 18 cannot lawfully consent to sex with each other. Interesting that it says sex is ok between them if they are married. So they are old enough to get married but not old enough to have sex without being married.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","08:24 PM","abortion-debates","105"
