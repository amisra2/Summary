"05-23-2005","5036",26,"Steeeeve","None","However, she is without a doubt not mature enough to make a decision like that. , having a baby will help that out and her getting an abortion will let her know that having unprotected sex at 13 is ok because you can always abort. I hope that clears things up","cushla_machree","127531","How do you know? She is obviously old enough to get pregnant and make the choice to have a baby, so i don't see why she is not old enough to make the decision not to. You are obviously a male, right? Because you see no problem with arbitrarily deciding that she is not capable of making that decision. Then who is, YOU? Give me a break. This is something that will affect the rest of this young girls life, how COULD someone else make that decision for her? Turn it around, say the state (as it appears they would be the only logical guardian) decides she is not capable of caring for a child, thus forcing her to abort. Do they have the right to force her to have an abortion against her will because they sat around and decided that she had no say? Hmmm? THIS IS ONLY SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS HER THE REST OF HER LIFE. I cannot fathom why anyone would attempt to take her opinion out of it. Yes, i think she is too young to go through the process ALONE, but not to ultimately make her OWN decision. You have proof for this? Is this the same LAME argument that making condoms available causes people to have sex? Why don't you join reality. Abortion is not easy, and is not cheap. Legalized abortion doesn't mean more people are going to run out and have tons more sex. Because before the 70s, teenagers and unmarried couples never got pregnant EVER. Id love to see the study that would back up that claim. Its like the argument that capital punishment stops murder, because no one ever murders anyone in texas anymore! As far as consequences go, getting pregnant seems like a big enough one to me. Thats enough to deter anyone from having sex, especially unprotected sex. But this is the real world here and not some imaginary place. Here is a goog bumper sticker to chew on, ""It's a child, not a consequence""","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","07:32 PM","abortion-debates","378"

The amount of woman who died from botched illegal abortions prior to the 70s. http://www.abortionfacts.com/image/l...hapter27_1.gif You don't appear to know much about abortion rates. When abortion was first legalized, we had no prior data, but the rate was increased in the 70s. Abortions leveled off in the 80s, and declined in the 90s. Under the current president, abortion rates are once again on the increase. This is not suprising given his stance against womans reproductive rights, education, access to birth control and affordable health care, and the fact that the econony is worse off than it was in the 90s. Reversing these trends is a real step in reducing the total number of abortions, however, i doubt that is something you even care about. http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/poli...phusabrate.gif The idea to criminalize abortion would not work, because people would still obtain abortions, legally out of country, illegally here, or through dangerous self induced abortions. In a world as mobile as as, this is not realistic. I cannot fathom why anyone would propose turning pregnant woman into criminals i this manner. Abortions are now on the rise again, and the pro-life community has not and will not address this issue, instead focusing on punishing and criminalizing pregnant woman. We don't live in a perfect world, abortion will never be illegal worldwide, and making it illegal here won't end abortion. That being said, as long as abortion IS legal, it would seem logical for pro-lifers to support measures that are successful at reducing abortions. That could include good economic conditions (not what bush gives us), women might elect to not have an abortion if they are more secure financially. Comprehensive sex education (yes abstinance is included in this) and greater openness to discussing sex. Support for family planning is essential: counseling, BC, emergency contraception, etc. I won't hold my breath. But i do know that the the pro-life community cares not about the child or the fetus. It is all about control and punishment. As a woman, I will never support that.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","09:22 PM","abortion-debates","386"

I'd like you to find examples of all these viable third trimester abortions occuring on healthy babies. I doubt you would find few, if any doctors who are performing this. You are just trying to be inflammatory with no evidence to back up your statements. Fact is, you know nothing about the woman who are getting abortions, why they may be getting them and the conditions that brought about their choices.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","09:30 PM","abortion-debates","387"

Did you know that the plantiff in Roe V Wade was coerced into filing the lawsuit by a group of feminists and has been quoted as saying it was the worse decision of her life and she will regret it always......... It boggles my mind how you pro abortion types can shrug off 40,000,000 murders in the womb since 1972........It begs to ask the question, How can you sleep at night?","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","10:19 PM","abortion-debates","390"
