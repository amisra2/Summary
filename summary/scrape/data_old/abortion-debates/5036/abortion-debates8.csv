The point others were making about allowing a abortion was the questioining of her health. As it stands abortion is actually safer then carrying the baby to term. Um, no. She has a 30% higher chance of dying if she goes to term then aborting. Pay attention to the keywords.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","09:07 PM","abortion-debates","107"
"05-04-2005","5036",8,"None","None","None","Steeeeve","116994","and you the same duo....your high school ""I know everything"" additude is annoying me (and probably many). You once said age shouldn't matter...yet it does. I have learned how dumb I was just 2years ago and will probably learn later on that I am dumb now. I am not saying I am wrong, however people in high school and college(however much better) are far less mature then someone 23(or so)+. For this very reason I think that an older person has more credibility. This is why I respect and actually take into account Jitobears and Sigmas arguements more so then yours. I would say this is a good credibility indicator: High School or below: Extremely Probable they don't know what they are talking about College: More likely then not they don't know what they are talking about...however the level of credibility increases from freshman to graduate. 23-25 age+: 60-75% chance they are credible. This is probably somewhat accurate however I would ask upon those 30 and up to critique it as I fit into that graduate college range. That pointless rant aside, I was just saying that when you say the risk is 30% higher it comes across as 30% chance of dieing. It is a psychology thing . Never the less...abortion would be safer however not by any real amount. .003% is next to nothing and so it .01% (or whatever it is) so one could say she has above a 99% chance of living with both cases. Which still doesn't answer why she should have the ability to consent to an abortion.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","11:27 PM","abortion-debates","108"

Stop trying to blame me for your own problems. When was this? Oh yes, I do recall that. I said that age doesn't matter in a argument in the terms of the debators as such a claim is the fallacy of knowledge of the ancients. Once again, you show your affinity for dishonest quote context. And that proves their arguments wrong how? Oh wait, it does not. You are merely using the fallacy of knowledge of the ancients, which by all means is a fraulent argument. Shall I start counting your acts of fraud in this thread as well? First of all, that's stupid. Second, no one call actually tell the age of anyone here. To declare such when the verifiability that the claim depends on does not exist is sheer insanity. It is similar to saying that person A who is behind a wall and gives no evidence of age besides merely stating something has more credibility then person B who is behind a wall and gives no specific age. We cannot prove who is older. As such your claim is quite ludacrious and falls apart. No, you don't respect my arguments because I highlight your fraud. No one likes it when their fraudlent behaviors are shown to everyone. Not to mention I keep bringing up stuff you refuse to answer for obvious reasons. Besides, I don't care if you respect my arguments or not. It is irrevelant. Well, your logic dictates that if someone does not know the vast majority on a subject, they know nothing about it . Therefore everyone from birth to the grave who does not know the vast majority about something, knows nothing about it. I offered you the chance to get out of that insane line of thinking. You came back with a pathetic insult. Once again, we cannot prove age here. Your argument is based upon something that cannot be used. For all I know, you are a 15 year old typing off a accounting magazine. Such is the problem with claims of age, not to mention that age itself is no inherent sign of intelligence or wisdom. You were wrong. Once again, it is not my fault you cannot read carefully. I never answered that. I never intended to answer that. I never made any notion to answer that. If you want a answer to that, I suggest you ask someone who was making the claim.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","12:06 AM","abortion-debates","109"

He is entertaining though. I wonder what lame fallacy he will bring up next. Anyway, my question about why she should have the ability to consent to an abortion still needs to be answered.
