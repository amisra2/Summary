"05-08-2005","5036",14,"Duo_Maxwell","None","And you'd be wrong. I already pointed out with retroactive math that at least 300 have been executed. several thousand have been killed already. Even if that was 3,000, the innocents executed would be 10%. Is that acceptable?","Diogenes99","118869","Your ""retroactive math"" reminds me of the aeronautical engineer back in the thirties who ""proved"" that bumblebees could not fly using a similar technique.

I'm merely applying the current rate of release to the number of death row inmates from the 70s to now. The number is actually artifically low considering i'm not accounting for bad lawyers and racially motivated sentencing.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","05:59 PM","abortion-debates","199"

I think most people on the forum has realized this by now. This aside, I think we should get back on the topic of the 13 year old girl being allowed to make the decision to get an abortion. No one has said why SHE should be able to make that choice.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","07:11 PM","abortion-debates","200"

"05-11-2005","5036",14,"Voice Of Reason","None","I have compassion for both them other and the baby........I just think a woman needs a good reason to murder her baby unlike you....... Its just as tought for her to have an abortion, something she might regret the rest of her life........","jitobear","120866","I think they do have good reasons to abort. But then I think there are many serious issues women face that deserve to be addressed. You see only one - impending death, with everything else being selfish or frivolous. That is not compassion for woman. Quite the opposite actually . It simply makes you another garden variety misogynist who fails to see any value of women past their reproductive organs. BEEEEP Wrong answer. Pregnancy will be more dangerous for her at that age. She is a little girl. Got that? Not teen. Not woman. Little freaking girl. Go down to your local middle school and look around. And remember - I am the one between us who has actually has had experience as a 13 year old girl and being pregnant.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","02:30 PM","abortion-debates","210"
