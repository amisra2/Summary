Twelve --fourteen weeks --no, they don't breathe. If a fetus is four months gestation, then they don't do abortions, they induce labor. You might put yourself in these peoples shoes for a moment. If you had a 13 year old pregnant girl, would you want the state to decide what is best for her? I wouldn't. I wouldn't want the state involved. Now, I don't know where the parents of the girl were, but they are the ones who should be responsible for the welfare of this girl. Why would anyone want a 13 year old girl to have a baby is beyond me. Do you think she will raise the baby, or will it end up in a trash can? There are a lot of things worse than abortion and you know those things happen. Punish her for having sex? Punish her for getting pregnant? That sounds really vicious. Can you imagine how she feels, don't you suppose she is feeling scared, alone, battered, unloved? 13 years old is a child.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","02:20 AM","abortion-debates","121"

Interesting that it says sex is ok between them if they are married. So they are old enough to get married but not old enough to have sex without being married.","FISHX","117098","Yes i noticed that a bit hypocritical really isn't it?","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","06:16 AM","abortion-debates","122"

And if she didnt know what she was doing at age 13... for pete's sake she must have the mind of a 7 year old. Not to mention she must've been going through ovulation before that... ay?? she had to know what was going on.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","09:19 AM","abortion-debates","125"
"05-05-2005","5036",9,"Duo_Maxwell","None","alright. I see you abandon your unfounded, unproven claim. First of all, that's stupid. Second, no one call actually tell the age of anyone here. To declare such when the verifiability that the claim depends on does not exist is sheer insanity . It is similar to saying that person A who is behind a wall and gives no evidence of age besides merely stating something has more credibility then person B who is behind a wall and gives no specific age. We cannot prove who is older. As such your claim is quite ludacrious and falls apart. Once again, we cannot prove age here. Funny. Why is it that everything I said about you has been proven true? You're a coward when it comes to defending your positions. You haven't been in the military at all. Virtually every prophecy you say is false. You flip flop like Bush and Kerry. You don't know anything about liberalism or conservatism. You call everyone who disagrees with you a liberal. The list goes on and on. Not to mention you're a 13 year old from Florida. here's the full post Then why did you support Dubya? (i know you're about 5 years to young to vote) ... here's the full post Because his IP is from a Florida ISP. you could check it on PWH, and I have at least 4 other people check it recently, and unless he's running a country wide proxy, (which is rather stupid for a 13 year old) , he's lying. Here's the full post That doesn't make sense. How can a 13 year old have served in the military for 46 years? Here's the full post","Cone","117254","I'll pick it up from here.... Oh really? Wow, I would have never guessed. This is news to me considering... Here is yet another example of Duo holding other people's arguments to a higher standard than he holds his own. Duo, you said "" Second, no one call actually tell the age of anyone here. To declare such when the verifiability that the claim depends on does not exist is sheer insanity ."" Are you right? Anyone claiming to know age on these boards without evidence is insanity? Duo, if you are right, you are calling yourself insane. That's not going to help you out on the credibility meter.

As sad as it may be, the state is the parent. Adoption is always an option. When my daughter was in high school, she came to me one weekend, hemmed and hawed for several minutes, assuring me over and over that this was a school assignment, and finally asked how I would react if she told me she was pregnant. I thought for a few seconds and gave her my gut reaction that I would support anything she decided except trying to raise the baby herself. I was surprised to learn the next week that only two other girls in her class had dared to carry out the assignment - apparently there was not a high level of trust and confidence between her classmates and their families, which I think is very sad.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","11:52 AM","abortion-debates","127"
