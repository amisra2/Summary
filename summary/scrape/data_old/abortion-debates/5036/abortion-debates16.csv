"05-11-2005","5036",16,"Sigma","None","What am I blaming the fetus for? I have not blamed it for anything. I agree, it did not go out and get pregnant. What is the significance of this? Are you saying that the woman needs to be punished for going out and getting pregnant? Truly, it is. However, I would never turn around and say ""You could have made the wrong choice with me, therefore I will make sure you never have a choice in the future"". I am glad she chose life. I am also glad she had a choice. She chose to have me and I love her for that. Are you so insecure, Voice Of Reason, that you believe you would not have been born if your mother had a choice? imo, women should not be forced to remain pregnant to provide a child for someone else.","Voice Of Reason","121099","I know you are only interested in murdering the innocent, defenseless baby in the womb.............","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","09:38 PM","abortion-debates","226"

"05-12-2005","5036",16,"None","None","None","Nurglitch","121435","Okay, so what if we say that we care enough about helping this girl to support her agency in this matter? She made a mistake (and hopefully it was a mistake rather than a rape), and we should help her by disposing of the fetus. This abortion will not be a matter of 'convenience', but rather of safety considering she is too young to deliver a child more safely than the child may be aborted. As for the value of the fetus, I think the life of the mother is more valuable than the life of an unborn fetus she unwillingly carries. It would be nice if she could bring it to term so it could be adopted, as she's obviously in no condition to look after it, but since that's more dangerous to her health than aborting it, and she doesn't wish to bring it to term, then it should be aborted.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","11:19 AM","abortion-debates","238"
