"05-14-2005","5036",21,"tiggeroo2005","None","Like I said before if she had the stupidity to get pregnant she should at least have to go through the labor pains! She can give it up for adoption. Well, she should be required to give it to adoption because she is certainly not mature enuf to take care of it!","cushla_machree","122753","So because you think her 'choices' are 'stupid' she should have to go through labor pains? You people are sick. Pregnancy is NOT a punishment for whatever this poor girl has gone through.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","03:13 PM","abortion-debates","303"
"05-14-2005","5036",21,"Voice Of Reason","None","I am not trying to belittle you, far from it.......I am not calling you sad.......I think its sad that millions of babies have to die....I commend you for carrying your baby to term but you avoided my question........How about the baby? Doesn't he or she have any rights? Why does he or she have to pay for the mistakes of their mother? The legal right you talked about is a law made by liberals who do not care about human life...... It is a horrible law that hopefully sometime in the near future will be overturned.....I think the law of God takes precedence......... God bless you for having your baby and raising it the way all mothers should.........","cushla_machree","122759","Well the rights of a living woman should always come before that of a fetus. The unborn should never have rights above and beyond the woman carrying it. Being that it is part of her body, it should be her choice. You can cry about the thousands of unborn babies, but i can guaruntee you not everyone does. I am concerned with the living, and considering this girl has no family and no one to turn to, considering that her young age and god knows WHO the father is and if he forced her into sex or took advantage of her, i think it is well within her limits to decided if she wants to end this pregnancy or carry it to term (either for herself or adoption). And i think most of of are pretty tired of hearing the adoption angle, sure babies are always in demand. Young healthy white ones that is. Just because some family wants a baby, doesn't mean you should force a woman to carry to term a child she doesn't want, only to have her give it away. What right do YOU have to tell a woman to go through a pregnancy, which is difficult if not sometimes dangerous, especially teen mothers? If someone wants a child, there are THOUSANDS of children sitting in foster homes RIGHT NOW. We should never force woman to carry pregnancy to terms just because someone else might want it, get real. Pregnancy should never be a punishment, nor should we force people to go through it just because we disagree with their choices. Some people do everything right and get pregnant, some people do everything wrong. ABortion is a personal decision, and a hard one. I don't think it is ANY of your busines why a woman might choose it, she may not be able to care for one, she may not want one, or she may have health issues. Her personal reasons and personal medical reasons for obtaining an abortion should never have to be proved to YOU or any poltician or lawmaker. And no, i do not believe an unborn baby has 'rights' like you and me. Thus are disagreement. Until birth, you can't argue about rights because once you give it to a fetus, you take it away from the living mother.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","03:23 PM","abortion-debates","304"

What a frigging cop out...............You have to do better then that........ I could turn you every which way but loose...trust me.......","jitobear","122764","Oh WOW - I guess Imissed the headlines that poverty has been licked. And the one that all people have medical insurance now. And nobody is homeless! I am so excited. These things all just went away in my sleep last night. woo hooo What a relief! Are you seriously this clueless? Do you really think there are respources enough. Come spend a week in my neighborhood and tell me that again - and I live in a HIGH tax state with more resources than most. God forbid I send you to New Mexico, where my sone was born, and me a social worker had to LIE to the state government to get me access to medical care. I love how your cozy male self continues to harbor the illusion that you know what it is like for these women. You get more insulting every time you post.

"05-15-2005","5036",21,"Duo_Maxwell","None","What I don't get is that the anti-abortion, particularly those who use the 40 million number is why they never talk about the consequence of feeding, clothing and educating these children, not to mention the opportunity cost of forcing women (and their other caregivers) to have these children. But that isn't all that suprising really as most people here don't have the simplest grasp of economics. Seems that they think that life in the womb is precious, but don't give a damn about the kid or the impact upon society once s/he is born.
