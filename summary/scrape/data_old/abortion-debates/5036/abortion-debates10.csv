We compared psychiatric admission rates of women in time periods from 90 days to 4 years after either abortion or childbirth. Methods: We used California Medicaid (Medi-Cal) records of women aged 1349 years at the time of either abortion or childbirth during 1989. Only women who had no psychiatric admissions or pregnancy events during the year before the target pregnancy event were included (n = 56 741). Psychiatric admissions were examined using logistic regression analyses, controlling for age and months of eligibility for Medi-Cal services. Results: Overall, women who had had an abortion had a significantly higher relative risk of psychiatric admission compared with women who had delivered for every time period examined. Significant differences by major diagnostic categories were found for adjustment reactions (odds ratio [OR] 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14.1), single-episode (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.32.9) and recurrent depressive psychosis (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.33.5), and bipolar disorder (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.56.0). Significant differences were also observed when the results were stratified by age. Interpretation: Subsequent psychiatric admissions are more common among low-income women who have an induced abortion than among those who carry a pregnancy to term, both in the short and longer term.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","02:31 PM","abortion-debates","136"

Reardon, Ph.D. Abortion advocates, relying on inaccurate maternal death data in the United States, routinely claim that a woman's risk of dying from childbirth is six, ten, or even twelve times higher than the risk of death from abortion. In contrast, abortion critics have long contended that the statistics relied upon for maternal mortality calculations have been distorted and that the broader claim that ""abortion is many times safer than childbirth"" completely ignores high rates of other physical and psychological complications associated with abortion. Now a recent, unimpeachable study of pregnancy-associated deaths in Finland has shown that the risk of dying within a year after an abortion is several times higher than the risk of dying after miscarriage or childbirth.(1) This well-designed record-based study is from STAKES, the statistical analysis unit of Finland's National Research and Development Center for Welfare and Health. In an effort to evaluate the accuracy of maternal death reports, STAKES researchers pulled the death certificate records for all the women of reproductive age (15-49) who died between 1987 and 1994--a total of 9,192 women. They then culled through the national health care data base to identify any pregnancy-related events for each of these women in the 12 months prior to their deaths. Since Finland has socialized medical care, these records are very accurate and complete. In this fashion, the STAKES researchers identified 281 women who had died within a year of their last pregnancy. The unadjusted mortality rate per 100,000 cases was 27 for women who had given birth, 48 for women who had miscarriages or ectopic pregnancies, and 101 for women who had abortions. The researchers then calculated the age-adjusted odds ratio of death, using the death rate of women who had not been pregnant as the standard equal to one. Table 1 shows that the age-adjusted odds ratio of women dying in the year they give birth as being half that of women who are not pregnant, whereas women who have abortions are 76 percent more likely to die in the year following abortion compared to non-pregnant women. Compared to women who carry to term, women who abort are 3.5 times more likely to die within a year. Such figures are always subject to statistical variation from year to year, country to country, study to study. For this reason, the researchers also reported what is known as ""95 percent confidence intervals."" This means that the available data indicates that 95 percent of all similar studies would report a finding within a specified range around the actual reported figure. For example, the .50 odds ratio for childbirth has a confidence interval of .32 to .78. In other words, it is probable that 95 percent of the time, the odds ratio of death following childbirth will be found to be between 32 percent and 78 percent of the non-pregnant woman rate. The 95 percent confidence interval for the odds ratio of death following abortion was reported to be 1.27 to 2.42 of the annual rate for non-pregnant women","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","02:32 PM","abortion-debates","137"
"05-05-2005","5036",10,"None","None","None","FISHX","117385","Abortion is not as safe as we have been told Risky Business Over one hundred potential complications have been associated with abortion in medical literature. Some are short-term and others have long-term consequences. Thus, an abortion recorded as complication-free in a short term study, might, in fact, cause long-term damage. The longer women are kept under surveillance after an abortion, the higher are the reported rates of complications. Every type of abortion procedure carries risks that can be serious. The earlier the abortion is done, the lower is the rate of immediate and short-term ""major"" compli-cations. Late term abortions greatly increase the probability of harm. The younger the patient, the greater the long-term risks to her reproductive system. And all risks greatly increase when women experience repeat abortions. The nine most common major complications resulting from vacuum abortions are: infection, excessive bleeding, embolism, ripping or perforation of the uterus, anesthesia compli-cations, convulsions, hemorrhage, cervical injury and endotoxic shock. Minor complications include: minor infections, bleeding, fevers and chills, second degree chemical burns, chronic abdominal pain, vomiting, gastrointestinal disturbance, weight loss, painful or disrupted menstrual cycles and Rh sensitization. The risk of infection increases the chance of two long-term complications infertility and ectopic pregnancies. Scar tissue left by the infection may block the fallopian tubes resulting in total or partial infertility and an increased probability of ectopic pregnancies. If a chronic infection results, a total hysterectomy may be required months or years after the abortion. Cervical damage may occur during the ""scraping out"" in a vacuum or D&C abortion or during the ""expulsion"" in a saline or prostaglandin abortion. But it is during the forced dilation of the uterus in vacuum and D&C abortions that most cervical damage is incurred. During forcible dilation, which occurs in all early surgical abortions, the cervix is hard and ""green."" Thus, a tremendous stress is placed upon the womans ""green"" cervical muscles which virtually always causes microscopic tearing of the muscles and occasionally results in severe ripping of the uterine wall a major complication. The resulting weakening of the uterus may develop an ""incompetent cervix"" which, unable to carry the weight of a later wanted pregnancy, opens prematurely, miscarrying or prematurely birthing. Most data available on complications are based on information that is voluntarily reported by abortion clinics. But these clinics have an interest in minimizing or covering up their mistakes. No law requiring accurate reporting from clinics exists. Moreover, when compli-cations do occur, few women go back to the abortion clinic which caused the problem. Women turn to family doctors instead, thus never showing up as a complication in study results. Vital Statistics ""10,000 women are hospitalized for abortion complications each year."" ""Ulcer Drug Tied to Numerous Abortions in Brazil,"" New York Times, 5/19/93, p. C13. The rate of immediate and short-term abortion complications is 10% or more. This figure is based on a reported 100,000 abortion complications in 1977, when the total number of abortions was one million. The 10% rate is an undisputed minimum rate. It does not include unreported or long-range complications such as infertility. Two independent studies place the compli-cation rate for vacuum abortions at 12%. Considering both immediate and long-term complications, a major German study found the total complication rate for vacuum aspiration abortions exceeded 31%. Since the legalization of abortion in 1973, there has been a 300% increase in ectopic pregnancies in the United States. In a series of 1,182 abortions which occurred under closely regulated hospital conditions, researchers found that 27% of the patients acquired post-abortion infection resulting in fevers lasting three days or longer. The infection rate from outpatient ""abortion mills"" is probably much higher. A womans body will overcome milder infections, but long-term damage may still result. Mild or severe infections may extend from the uterine lining to the fallopian tubes or to organs adjacent to the uterus. In one study of 74 women killed by legal abortions, anesthesia complications ranked as the third leading cause of death. The officially reported rate of anesthesia complications is one per 5,000 first trimester abortions. Women who undergo just one induced abortion are three to four times more likely to suffer from secondary infertility than non-aborted women. Numerous studies have found that three to five percent of all aborted women are inadvertently left sterile by the operation. Nearly 60% of all abortions are for first pregnancies. Though normally only five percent of all babies are born prematurely, this rate jumps to 40% among women who have had abortions. The risk of long-term complications following an abortion is ten to twenty times greater than the risk of any complications following childbirth. Above statistics documented in Aborted Women, Silent No More, David Reardon, 1987, pp. 93-113. Human Interest ""Physically, many (aborted women) have paid a high price for their abortions. Along with incomplete abortions, hemorrhage, and infections, some have suffered the loss of other internal organs, infertility, miscarriages, tubal pregnancies, premature births and stillbirths. Some have never had another child. Sadly, some never will, as they have lost their wombs to safe, legal abortion."" Karen Crabtree, Heart to Heart Ministries, ""Testimonies of Regret, 20 Years of Legal Abortion,"" January 1993. Crabtree has gathered the testimonies of more than 500 women.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","02:33 PM","abortion-debates","138"

The forum owner of WS gave his age and VOR said that was his age as well. The problem was he cited that he was in a specific battle that would have to make him -15 years old to be that age. So perhaps he isn't a teenager, he's just a complusive liar. Steeeve is insanly arguing that a age which cannot be proven is why a argument is either credible or not credible. That's stupid. When I smack VOR for his age, it's not because he's wrong, it is because he is lying. I suggest you actually read the context as you seem to have the same problem as steeeve when it comes to dishonet quote usage. VOR is wrong because his arguments are factless, not because of his age.

"05-05-2005","5036",10,"Voice Of Reason","None","The question one has to ask is it more dangerous for the girl to carry the baby to term or to abort it?","jitobear","117474","At 13 - abortion, unless she is uniquely physically advanced. It's incredible how many men are sure being pregnant is no big deal.... Steve - regarding whether she can consent to abortion. Technically I don't think a minor can consent to either sex or abortion in any state (unless emancipated). I know that is how it is in Minnesota. I am sure the laws vary from state to state. Medical decisions generally fall to the parents. I know whether minors should have access to abortion without parental notifications is a controversial issue. On the surface one would think, of course not - but there is concern for those girls who are in abusive situations at home. And as I told VOR, if I had a daughter bound and determined not to tell me, I would rather she have access to safe abortion than resort to something drastic. A baby pregnant - yikes. Personally I think it's innapropriate and dangerous for a little girl to carry a pregnancy to term. But I would sure love to simply avoid it through better prevention. I do not think an abortion would be anything but scary for her either - but technically, at that age, it would be safer. Steve - in no way, shape or form is a 13 year old ready for this - not physically, mentally or emotionally - not for pregnancy, and certainly not for parenting.
