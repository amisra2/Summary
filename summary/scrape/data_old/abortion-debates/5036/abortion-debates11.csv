All of those links prove one thing: you didn't use the link I provided on this site at least 4 times that ran a search on VOR's history. How is my claim of your laziness wrong when your posts prove such? Did you not even read my posts? I gave you specifics as to how VOR let his real age out, or how that his claims of old-ness were outright lies. Notice how I said here . As I recall, no one here has given hugely conflicting claims about their age. Notice how I said WS, refering to the site that VOR was on in the past. Seriously, that's the fallacy of selective reading. C'mon cone, you're smart enough to figure that out, but then again, I have been lately assigning intelligence to people who prove they don't actually have it in the quantity I believed them to have. Also, VOR's age isn't why he's wrong. Huh. I remember saying that as well.","Voice Of Reason","117555","I can't believe how fascinated you are in me ""Little Man"" I am flattered......","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","06:22 PM","abortion-debates","151"

"05-05-2005","5036",11,"Steeeeve","None","There was once a man who had deformed legs and was supposed to be nothing. He didn't look at this as if his life was ruined. He looked it is as an opportunity. He is know one of the fastest runners in the world. Would be baby ruin her life? That depends on how she rises to the situation. Not to mention she can just put it up for adoption. As if you know this? I guess we won't ever know. Oh, i think it is ridiculous all right. However, abortion is not the fix. Everything has a consequence just like pregnancy. It will not kill her to have the baby and it have saved a life. How you could say one life is worth killing just so another one doesn't have to deal with the consequences of her actions?","WhiteFalcon","117602","That ""analogy"" refers to ""human will"" and ""tenacity"". Not to ""responsability"" and ""maturity"" to take care of a kid. Those are 2 different things. That analogy says nothing and has no relation. Your darn right a baby would ruin this girls life. Where are the parents in this situation? From what I know they are barley doing enough to care for their daughter, so they sure as heck wont be ready for their own 13 year old Daughter to have a baby of her own. The girl certaininly isnt near ready to have a baby either. Think about it...Its obvious, this girl is 13. How do you know it wont kill her to have the pregnancy? This baby would put a burden on this girls life and her whole family. At some times a ""consequence"" to try and show whats right is really ""wrong"". What you arent realizing is what it takes to take care of a kid. What you arent realizing is how hard of the babys along with the girls life will be. What you arent realizing is how stupid it would be to make a 13 year old GIRL to go through labor!","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","08:42 PM","abortion-debates","156"
"05-05-2005","5036",11,"Voice Of Reason","None","Its sad that you feminists have no sympathy or compassions for the innocent, defenseless baby in the womb............","jitobear","117634","And you misogynists have none for women. And when are you and Hunter gonna get it? I want abortion gone too - I just know that won't be done until the reasons women abort are seriously and adequately recognized and addressed. Until then - all your preaching, all your laws - will mean squat. Successful pregnancies require the mother - you can dismiss her issues, tell yourself that she won't resort drastic actions, that more babies won't be born addicts and poverty and go pat your misgynist pals on the back. But in the end you will not have helped a damned thing.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","11:12 PM","abortion-debates","157"

Pregnancy is really hard on a body. Really it is. Even on a healthy, mature woman's body. Not just painful and uncomfortable - but really hard. Your organs get squished and moved. My bladder was permanently damaged by my pregnancy. Labor - although painful - is something I suspect even men could get through. Delivery is another matter. You have do be BIG enough to deliver. Not many 13 year olds have a big enough pelvis for that. Or even a big enough body to sustain the girth of a baby. We are not talking a woman, or even teen here - we are talking about someone who is barely more than a little girl. She can't own property, get a job that would ever support a baby, she can't helath insurance, she has not even been through high school. No no no no","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","11:23 PM","abortion-debates","158"

"05-07-2005","5036",11,"Steeeeve","None","First off, she is in the custody of the state. Second, I never said she should keep the baby. She should put it up for adoption. My analogy by the way does have human will and tenacity..however, we all can have that...that guy was running at 13. You really don't know. Well, I am 99.97% sure she won't die. The baby wouldn't be a burden on anyone if she put it up for adoption..and then it would be a blessing. Whoah, raising a kid and going through labor are two different things. The 13yr old shouldn't be able to take care of the kid, however, she shouldn't be able to end his/her life either. So put it up for adoption and all problems are solved.","WhiteFalcon","118402","She shouldnt go through a pregnancy at 13. Read Jitobears post a few above this, which explains why it is so dangerous and unhealty for a 13 year old GIRL to go through a pregnancy. Always a ""blessing"" Im sure. So lets just add yet another baby with no parents and stick em in the adoption facilties. A ""fetus"" isnt a baby to me and I beleive that your not killing a ""human being"". My personal beleifs, get over it. You dont know everything will be ""perfect"" either. The risks and problems rise greatly when a girl is only 13. Girls that have just started to begin ""maturity"" arent fit to complete something that is difficult for ""adults"". You may be 99.97% certian she would not die, but what do you base that on. And that has nothing to do with all the problems that could occur during pregnancy that could ""ruin this girls life"". Just cause she has a small chance of ""dying"" or even if she wouldnt need to actually ""care for the baby"" doesnt mean her life couldnt be ""ruined"". This ""life"" you talk about isnt one, as of when it is still a ""fetus"". My personal beleifs as before.. As jitobear stated a while back- You dont show a girl the ""consequences"" when these ""consequences"" are very difficult and scary for adults. What you fail to understand here is that this is a 13 year old GIRL.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","07:25 PM","abortion-debates","161"
