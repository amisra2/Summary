As God determines a person to be a person long before they are even in the womb. And he talks about not killing innocent people (murder). So this would support the claim that a Christian who believes in Gods Word would not support abortion.","christian-cant-support-abortion","03:32 PM","abortion-debates","47"
"04-23-2005","4912",4,"chloe","None","Luke 1:15 ""...he(John) will be filled with the Holy Spirit while yet in his mother's womb."" Take this along with the passages denouncing murder. Along with the passages Cone and Steeeeve have mentioned.","Linus","111311","That is nice but that still doesn't condemn abortion. Abortion is legal. The Hebrew word for murder exclusively means illict killing. Abortion isn't illict. You failed again.","christian-cant-support-abortion","03:44 PM","abortion-debates","48"

"04-23-2005","4912",4,"Steeeeve","None","""If you don't believe in the Bible then how can you be a Christian? So with that in mind, God is against abortion. This is easily found by combining two things together in the Bible."" ""As for Linus, I got real tired of spelling things out for you. However, I suspect you don't support the Roe vs Wade case because abortion (the exact word) is no where in the constitution.","Linus","111315","Your combination isn't working and you have so far proven a lack of knowledge of the Bible. Killing people was not ever condemed within the Bible. God and his followers kill thousands upon thousands of people for rather silly things in the Bible. Even if you found a combination, which you haven't, you still haven't proven a single direct verse against abortion. This is why you need to pick and choose ones that fit your political agenda. Anyone with a political position can do this...communists often used a few verses from the New Testament to support it. Spelling what out? You never proved any of your arguments but instead go off of hearsay and groundless opinion. The Bible doesn't have a direct verse on abortion and thus you need to just deal with it. I am sorry that you were wrong about it but you need to move past it. There isn't a single statement mentioning individual gun ownership in the Constitution either. So guns are now unconstitutional?","christian-cant-support-abortion","03:52 PM","abortion-debates","50"

Rasche is defined as unlawful killing judged harmful by the community. Unlawful strictly applies to mortal laws, not divine. Abortion isn't illegal. A woman's choice to abortion is supported by the majority within the community (i.e. America). So once again you guys fall flat on your faces. Geez, I am not even a Christian and I know more about the Bible then you guys.","christian-cant-support-abortion","03:57 PM","abortion-debates","51"
"04-23-2005","4912",4,"Cone","None","Oh I don't sugar coat what he did. I just hold to sound Biblical doctrine that says God is just in everything he does.","Linus","111320","So then you renounce your pro-life feelings and decide to worship and support a being that used genocide and chattel slavery against innocent human beings? Apparently you just did.","christian-cant-support-abortion","03:58 PM","abortion-debates","52"
"04-23-2005","4912",4,"Voice Of Reason","None","I believe there is a comandment that states: Thou shall not kill...","Linus","111321","There is no comandemnt that states this. ""Thou shall not kill"" is one of the biggest myths within the ten commandments and it is just a dumbed down version of the original Hebrew translation. And no, killing and murder are not the same thing. Go look them up in the dictionary. Am I the only one who has read the Bible? And I don't mean just read it but actually researched it? Apparently none of you pro-lifers have. I getting so tired of spoon feeding you guys on theology.","christian-cant-support-abortion","04:01 PM","abortion-debates","53"
"04-23-2005","4912",4,"Voice Of Reason","None","The difference little man is when you execute a criminal it is because he has committed a capital crime.......... The innocent defenseless baby in the womb is just murdered..... I know that is tough for someone like you to understand..........","Linus","111323","Apparently you have just disproven the ""thou shall not kill"" as wrong. If you believe God told you not to kill then that is applied to all human life. Even criminals. So now you renounce ""thou shall not kill"" because you feel it doesn't make sense. Your lack of knowledge of the Bible has made you fall into committing hypocrisy. And it is a just fate for those who speak unknowingly about something.","christian-cant-support-abortion","04:05 PM","abortion-debates","54"
"04-23-2005","4912",4,"Linus","None","That is nice but that still doesn't condemn abortion. Abortion isn't illict.","chloe","111325","Yes it does How not so? Prove it Biblically. Its been proven to the contrary.","christian-cant-support-abortion","04:07 PM","abortion-debates","55"
"04-23-2005","4912",4,"Ender Wiggin","None","To say he's a hypocrite is absurd. Just look at your examples. For instance, ""execute prisoners"" if I'm not mistaken prisoners, have committed a crime. And did not VOR state, that babies, have not. Now the comparison of ""wage war"" in war, both parties have objectives involving punishing the other. So war, is justified in the minds of those who wage it, by accusing their opponents. A baby can not be so accused, and his death can not be justified. My dear Duo_Maxwell, you have committed the logical crime, of false comparison. I love you man","Duo_Maxwell","111328","what do you not understand about no exceptions ? The 10 commandements simply states ""thou shall not kill."" To support killing of specific groups while attacking someone for supporting the killing of another while citing the 10 commandements makes them a flaming hypocrite. Again, what do you not understand about no exceptions ? I asked for where the 10 commandements has exceptions. Neither of you could list it. The fallacy doesn't work. It doesn't matter about the accusation! Thou shall not kill is not a subjective application. Thou shall not killn anyone . Translation: I just got throughly owned but I am too pathetic to admit defeat.","christian-cant-support-abortion","04:12 PM","abortion-debates","57"
"04-23-2005","4912",4,"chloe","None","Yes it does. How not so? Prove it Biblically. Its been proven to the contrary.","Linus","111330","No. It doesn't. You are just forging links and it is starting to look depserate and sloppy. I am not here to prove your points. That is your job. There has never been a Hebrew law against abortion that placed it as murder found. Never. However if we had to guess I would think abortion was permitted in Hebrew society. Considering the Jews believed that life started at birth and burial rituals were only permitted to those who were above six months of age after birth. Apparently fetuses were not equal to born people in burial cermonies.","christian-cant-support-abortion","04:18 PM","abortion-debates","58"

I said: If God is just in everything He does, as the Bible obviously states He is, then it directly follows that he cannot be impugned by anybody for what He does. He especially can't be impugned by any human being, who we can safely assume is not omniscient, and therefore cannot know the situation fully. For you to imply that you are more just than God, is to imply that you know more than God does, which by reading your posts on these forums, we can safely say is flat out wrong.","christian-cant-support-abortion","04:20 PM","abortion-debates","59"

This is not the case. You are just getting random facts from ""religioustolerance.org"" without even knowing if what they say is right or not. http://www.biblestudy.org/question/notkill.html is a site offering another ""side"" to the story. This is amusing though Linus...keep it up","christian-cant-support-abortion","04:22 PM","abortion-debates","60"
