She mentioned that she has recently become a Christian and that HER god is one that supports a womens right to choice. Now there are so many problems with this that I don't even know where to start. Not only that, I am saying this as almost a ""newbie"" Christian as in I don't know everything there is to know about the Bible. However, I do know that the Christian God that is defined in the Bible is against abortion. Many argue that the Bible is not what the Christian God is because it has been translated into a meaningless document. How is this true when we have so many of the original scrolls? Moreever, how can one claim what God thinks if they don't have anything to base it on? For example if you say the Bible is worthless, you are a Christian, and God believes abortion is ok...then how did you come to this conclusion? The Christian God talks about how one is created before they were put in the womb. God also talks about not killing. So if you wish to be Christian and for abortion you need to rethink one of those stances. God doesn't conform to anyone.","christian-cant-support-abortion","12:19 AM","abortion-debates","1"

I don't condone that vet spitting on her but I don't blame him........ As far as the abortion issue goes there is no God that supports the murder of the innocent unborn in the womb........","christian-cant-support-abortion","12:29 AM","abortion-debates","2"

Do some research...fundamentalists from the far right would want you to believe without questioning that Christianity is solidly against abortion. However Christian theology and history have disproven this time and time again. In fact, Christianity's supposed stance against abortion is only very recent. For hundreds of years Christianity openly supported abortion before quickening. It is a dirty little secret that the ideological masters of the Christian-Con movement hope you never find out about because it would destroy them. The Bible falls completely silent on the issue of abortion. All direct condemnations on abortion found in the New Testament were quickly discarded as irrelevant by theologians. Christianity had it's chance at condemning abortion in the Bible and choose not to! For hundreds of years the Vatican supported abortion rights. Even it's most celebrated saints were not only outspoken supporters but blazed a path for theology to support it. And in early America, it wasn't rare for abortion services to be posted on Church bulletinboards. Again, these are facts that the pro-life/Christian-Con movement you never find out about. They would rather have you believe in lies instead for their political agendas.","christian-cant-support-abortion","12:41 AM","abortion-debates","4"

"04-23-2005","4912",1,"God","None","The Bible tells us God is involved in our creation from the womb: ""Did not He who made me in the womb make him, And the same one fashion us in the womb? (Job 31:15) Yet Thou art He who didst bring me forth from the womb; Thou didst make me trust when upon my mother's breasts. Upon Thee I was cast from birth; Thou hast been my God from my mother's womb. (Psalms 22:9-10) For Thou didst form my inward parts; Thou didst weave me in my mother's womb. I will give thanks to Thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Wonderful are Thy works, And my soul knows it very well. My frame was not hidden from Thee, When I was made in secret, And skillfully wrought in the depths of the earth. Thine eyes have seen my unformed substance; And in Thy book they were all written, The days that were ordained for me, When as yet there was not one of them. (Psalms 139:13-16) Thus says the LORD who made you And formed you from the womb, who will help you, `Do not fear, O Jacob My servant; And you Jeshurun whom I have chosen. (Isaiah 44:2) Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, and the one who formed you from the womb, ""I, the LORD, am the maker of all things, Stretching out the heavens by Myself, And spreading out the earth all alone, (Isaiah 44:24) If men fight, and hurt a woman with child, so that she gives birth prematurely, yet no harm follows, he shall surely be punished accordingly as the woman's husband imposes on him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. But if any harm follows, then you shall give life for life","Steeeeve","111140","lol Linus...You provide no proof for this. However the Bible does say ""I create you before I placed you in the womb""...this would imply that God created you before you are even conceived. Now He also talked about how you can't kill an innocent person. Maybe you should read up a little bit about what the Bible says on abortion. Christians are supposed to believe in the Bible as it is the Word of God. You are supposed to be able to figure out anything that you have question on in the Bible (such as abortion, slavery, homosexuals etc..). Then Exodus says the following: Not that hard to figure out dude...What is your proof?","christian-cant-support-abortion","12:58 AM","abortion-debates","8"

Anything to fill the void after a rather damning debunk on the thread I suppose. A very typical tactic on your behalf and I would not expect more. Apparently I spoke well past your head...not my fault. Any ways... The Bible falls silent on the issue of abortion. You couldn't find me a verse that directly condemns abortion if your life counted on it. And if the Bible is silent then what about theologians? Once again...nothing.

God also says he made you out of dirt and then supernaturally lifting the dirt from the ground into the womans uterus. Oh well, I suppose it is all beliefs no matter how silly it sounds. I have read the Bible myselfnever found such a verse anywhere. Then again I suppose that depends on your definition of innocent, considering God sponsored the slaughter of non-Jews, disobedient children, people based upon their ethnic origin and etc.. And also person. The burden of proof would be for you to prove that God applies this to fetuses. It is impossible to read something that cant be found. You mean Exodus 21:22-23 and you are using a contemporary translation of itnot tradition. The traditional interpretation of this text, which even rabbinical scholars accepted for thousands of years, is this: if a man hurts a woman enough to cause a miscarriage, he reciprocates according to how much injury he caused her, i.e., an eye for an eye, etc. However, if the miscarriage resulted in no injury to the woman, then all the assailant had to pay was a monetary fine. The fact that the Bible does not equate the assailant's life with the stillborn's life is proof that the Bible does not count the fetus as a person. Further more we should have found replications of your contemporary translation since the copying of laws in the Middle East was widespread. Instead, the Assyrians, Hittites, Sumerians, Babylonians, Hammurapi and Eshnunna all have similar laws that go according to the traditional interpretation of it. Lastly, if a woman gave birth prematurely back in Biblical ages it would have resulted in the birth of a stillborn. Saving premature babies is an achievement of modern science. Not God. If it isnt so hard then why havent you found it yet? I am still waiting and you becoming cocky is not helping you.","christian-cant-support-abortion","01:45 AM","abortion-debates","14"
