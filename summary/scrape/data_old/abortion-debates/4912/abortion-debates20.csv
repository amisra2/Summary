"11-22-2009","4912",20,"Easyrider","379634","Report: Kennedy barred from communion by bishop Nov. 22, 2009 PROVIDENCE, R.I. Roman Catholic Bishop Thomas Tobin has banned Rep. Patrick Kennedy from receiving Communion, the central sacrament of the church, in Rhode Island because of the congressman's support for abortion rights, Kennedy said in a newspaper interview published Sunday. The decision by the outspoken prelate, reported on The Providence Journal's Web site, significantly escalates a bitter dispute between Tobin, an ultra orthodox bishop, and Kennedy, a son of the nation's most famous Roman Catholic family. ""The bishop instructed me not to take Communion and said that he has instructed the diocesan priests not to give me Communion,"" Kennedy told the paper in an interview conducted Friday. Kennedy said the bishop had explained the penalty by telling him ""that I am not a good practicing Catholic because of the positions that I've taken as a public official,"" particularly on abortion. Report: Kennedy barred from communion by bishop - Yahoo! News Yes! Now do that with the rest of the Biblically-challenged, spiritually-inept Kennedy family, and all the rest of the pro-abortion Catholic democrats.","simone","379670","So the bishops finally did it.

"05-05-2010","4912",20,"Steeeeve","111128","I was watching the Bill Maher show today and they had Jane Fonda on. She mentioned that she has recently become a Christian and that HER god is one that supports a womens right to choice. Now there are so many problems with this that I don't even know where to start. Not only that, I am saying this as almost a ""newbie"" Christian as in I don't know everything there is to know about the Bible. However, I do know that the Christian God that is defined in the Bible is against abortion. Many argue that the Bible is not what the Christian God is because it has been translated into a meaningless document. How is this true when we have so many of the original scrolls? Moreever, how can one claim what God thinks if they don't have anything to base it on? For example if you say the Bible is worthless, you are a Christian, and God believes abortion is ok...then how did you come to this conclusion? The Christian God talks about how one is created before they were put in the womb. God also talks about not killing. So if you wish to be Christian and for abortion you need to rethink one of those stances. God doesn't conform to anyone.","ShadowPikachu","400520","Well here is a christian who supports abortion. I personally HAVE had an abortion. I had it several years, and while it was an extremely hard and emotional decision, I chose what was best for me. I was engaged (now married), and both my then-fiance and I were on birth control (I was on the pill and he used condoms). Unfortunately, despite those precautions, I became pregnant. We aren't that rich, and both of us our still finishing up our college degrees and are under enormous student loan burden. He supported my decision to abort as neither of us would have anywhere near the time or money to support a baby (hence our use of contraception), and neither of us have taken a full job in our fields yet to be able to provide that money to pay for the loans let alone a child. I think this is one of the many circumstances in which abortion is absolutely justifiable, especially because I think that except for rare circumstances, abortion should be allowed up to the third trimester (the exceptions would be if the woman's life was in danger, etc. for a later abortion). As to God not supporting abortion? Rubbish. If you'd like I could give you verses in which he not only supported abortions, but ordered forced abortions through his people (that is if you take the OT as literally true)","christian-cant-support-abortion","05:15 PM","abortion-debates","289"

Come on, people. You don't butcher an innocent baby for the conveience or sins of the parents. There's plenty of people in the world who would have adopted that baby. And if no one else would have, I would have. Let's see your best one (1) example. In the meantime, you can revel in this: What does the Bible say about abortion? And if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so that she has a miscarriage, yet there is no further injury, he shall surely be fined as the womans husband may demand of him; and he shall pay as the judges decide. But if there is further injury, then you shall appoint as a penalty life for life. (Exodus 21:22-23) Straight from the Jewish Torah, God immediately affirms the value of human life in a mothers womb. Next, a divinely appointed prophet from the womb : Jeremiah 1:5 Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations. Psalm 139:13 For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mothers womb. Of course, the question here is: What divine insight does the pro-abortion crowd think they have to where they can destroy in a mothers womb that which God is somehow instrumental in creating? That was a future prophet to the nations in the womb. But the pro-infanticide crowd wants to pretend that instead of a baby with a divine plan, its nothing more than an unviable tissue mass. Well, God is not fooled , and neither are we. Finally, every time you see another child playing and laughing, every time you see a boy or girl graduate, get married, have their own child, and so on, I hope you see that innocent little baby you had ripped from your body. I recommend you ask God / Christ to forgive you.","christian-cant-support-abortion","07:36 AM","abortion-debates","290"

Why willingly follow an book when you don't know half of what's in it? Especially when a great portion of that stuff is just plain unpleasant and oppressive? Nothing baffles me more than female Christians. You willingly follow a religion that says you're beneath men and should be treated as property. -_- Nice going really that makes as much sense as a black KKK member. That said I don't have problems with people having their own personal religion but when you try to piggy back on another religion and then either don't understand said religion or throw out the unpleasant bits (or only throw out said unpleasant bits that apply to you) I can't help but facepalm.","christian-cant-support-abortion","09:55 PM","abortion-debates","293"
