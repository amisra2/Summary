"04-28-2005","4912",16,"Steeeeve","None","They said they wouldn't it being overturned. So I guess your point is correct that most people believe in Roe Vs Wade but what does this prove?? It doesn't prove that people support abortion because other polls suggest otherwise.","Sigma","113856","I think it does. Why else do they support the decision, and oppose overturning it?","christian-cant-support-abortion","10:53 PM","abortion-debates","226"
"04-28-2005","4912",16,"None","None","None","Steeeeve","113865","I oppose overturning it (unless it is done by saying that SCOTUS wasn't supposed to rule on that case)...So thats one example. In the sense of overturning it to make abortion illegal..I wouldn't support that. Besides, other polls suggest that people don't support full out abortions but only in the extreme cases. Although in a way this doesn't matter to me because I wouldn't support abortion if I was the only one that thought that.","christian-cant-support-abortion","11:40 PM","abortion-debates","227"
"04-28-2005","4912",16,"jitobear","None","I love you, Hunter. You are living breathing proof of what the pro-life movement is all about. Half-witted mysoginists disregarding women. No way she can just think your a jerk and be angry, huh? Must be something wrong with her. Are you actually married? If so, where did you find a woman with low enough self -esteem to put up with you?","Hunter","113867","I love you to jitobear. What got you panties in a wad? Don't you have something to do in the kitchen for your man? Do you even have a man in your life? If not, that may be your problem. If I am a half-wit, your brain is bouncing around like a BB in a box car. I am not married and do not want a female with low self-esteem in my life. I am looking for a pretty white girl from PA. who is God fearing and conservative in her views. Also, she should be a good cook and not give me too much back-talk. You need not apply. Wish me well.","christian-cant-support-abortion","11:44 PM","abortion-debates","228"

Your support for the dignity of human life apparently begins with conception and ends with birth, if the birth results in a female. Otherwise, the dignity continues.

"04-29-2005","4912",16,"Zardoz","None","And, of those hundreds of people polled, what location of the 'across america' did they gather them from? If I were to present a poll using the same criteria and methods they use except call the boonies, bible belters and small townies instead of college campuses or large blue cities, the results would be different.","Sigma","114201","Did you go to the site? The polls were from many different polling agencies, done over different years. Is your contention that... they are all biased? Unless you have specific information or objections where a poll is biased you have little basis for dismissing them. Do you happen to know that they all polled blue states? Objecting to one or two I can understand if you had specific objections to that polling agency but... all of them?","christian-cant-support-abortion","01:39 PM","abortion-debates","233"

I disagree with you on this issue but do not question the intentions of your heart. This is not the first time Hunter has spewed about women like this. He has referred to them as property, preached that we all need to married and home and nothing else, and continually dismisses women's issues not to mention the disrepectful way he treats women on this board. His behavior is absolutely piggy, not funny and not a joke.","christian-cant-support-abortion","02:47 PM","abortion-debates","236"

There is just no way my liberal friends can rationalize this horrific act on their fellow human beings unless the mother's life is endangered or possibly in the case of rape and incest..........","christian-cant-support-abortion","04:50 PM","abortion-debates","237"

Do that and yout will be doing the most for mother, child and the reduction of abortion. It will do far more than a ban will. There are simply too many people, reasons, and circumstances to make blanket laws without making blanket exceptions as well (which some here have complained about). Address the things that lead to unwanted pregnancy and the reasons women choose to abort. That will do the most help. It makes my head spin the time, money, and energy wasted on the fighting.....","christian-cant-support-abortion","01:55 PM","abortion-debates","239"

I honestly think we do need to help out more..and not just with women but eveyone. And there are some groups out there that help pregnant women without ever recommending abortion. I am not sure how you fix unwanted pregnancy caused by two people having sex and realizing they just didn't want the pregnancy. You would have to do a major culture shift involving many things. However, having abortion, in my opinion, probably won't help people stop having sex but would encourage it. If there is a way out people will do it. I suspect that if abortion was banned and the next 5yrs or so many teens get pregnant then we would see a drop because people would get a bit smarter. So culture shift if the only way to get rid of that portion of abortions. The rape, incest, and probably the poor problem could be solved with some community support groups. Have people be less selfish (another culture shift). However, having abortion here wouldn't help people become less selfish because abortion in itself is selfish (atleast on someones part, not always the mother). So those are my views on it. I don't see people starting to help women until abortion is gone. One other side-not thing. The people that are more inclined to help are the ones that don't support abortion. This is obviously not a fact but is an opinion that I have observed. Church groups come to mind when I think of this.","christian-cant-support-abortion","02:41 PM","abortion-debates","240"
