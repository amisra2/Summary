The worst part of it is thanks to the left and people like ""Little Man"" we are being held hostage by the Arabs.........","Duo_Maxwell","111750","NoNoNon. Your claim is even more ridiculous. You do let people get away with unfounded claims. Especially the person in question. Neither you nor cone have argued aganist VOR;s insane arguments. He makes claims such as http://4forums.com/political/showpos...6&postcount=52 and neither of you two commented.","christian-cant-support-abortion","07:59 PM","abortion-debates","137"

I don't check every thread nor do I intend to...So, right now we are talking about your unfounded claim....Are you going to answer it? I will post it again. Originally Posted by Cone What bothers me is that you have yet to provide evidence of the following, gigantic claim: Quote: Originally Posted by Duo You have obviously missed where VOR supports the murder of abortion doctors, pedophiliacs and other groups. You have charged him with supporting murder. An accusation this large requires direct evidence. Up till now, the only direct evidence is your statement that it is true.","christian-cant-support-abortion","08:03 PM","abortion-debates","138"
"04-24-2005","4912",10,"None","None","None","Duo_Maxwell","111757","nonon. your claim is truly ridiculous . It tops everything said here. I haven't seen cone argue once that VOR was wrong. Even in his most INSANE arguments, especially the one that because a bill was one vote short that it has a hard time passing from now on. I haven;t seen you do that either. That's pretty selective. It appears you people are fully willing to let someone who is aganist abortion go off on insane arguments which have no facts but hold someone who supports abortion to that standard. Your claim should be changed to ""we don't let people who support abortion say unfounded claims but people who don't can say anything they want, even itf it is obviously wrong in every obvious way."" Let's deal with the murder: he supports the death penalty which has executed 23 innocent people along with many others.","christian-cant-support-abortion","08:07 PM","abortion-debates","139"

We are talking about your claims. We are talking about how you called VOR a hypocrite without posting evidence...you know have posted some evidence. THis would be against your thread about ""because I say so"" arguements. This means you might be a hypocrite, right? So in short, your claim was unfounded at the time (and is still questionable)....You also provided no support for your claim about VOR with regards to Cone's question. Don't put things on someone else when you can't handle the questions.","christian-cant-support-abortion","08:11 PM","abortion-debates","140"
"04-24-2005","4912",10,"None","None","None","Duo_Maxwell","111768","why did you ignore the last part? Besides, your claim is currently the most ridiculous here. And it's provable that it's false in all aspects. LEt's see, VOr supports execution of drug dealers. http://4forums.com/political/showpos...9&postcount=37 HOLY ****!!!!!!!!!!!!!! VOR supports executing women who abort. http://4forums.com/political/showpos...1&postcount=17 Well, I guess that proves my point.","christian-cant-support-abortion","08:16 PM","abortion-debates","141"
"04-24-2005","4912",10,"None","None","None","Duo_Maxwell","111774","alright, i may have been hasty in name specific groups. However, that doesn't mean he doesn't support the murder of others, as I have named. http://www.whistlestopper.com/forum/...9960#post79960 What are the punishments for those? DEATH. Maybe I wasn't so hasty.","christian-cant-support-abortion","08:22 PM","abortion-debates","144"

This is not murder(according to US law atleast).","christian-cant-support-abortion","08:29 PM","abortion-debates","145"
"04-24-2005","4912",10,"None","None","None","Duo_Maxwell","111780","Um, not really. It is murder for the state to execute a innocent person?","christian-cant-support-abortion","08:30 PM","abortion-debates","146"
"04-24-2005","4912",10,"Steeeeve","None","I dont see where VOR says those people should be murdered. So your claim is unfounded again. he didn't say innocent person..he said people that commited those crimes that he stated.","Duo_Maxwell","111785","What is the punishment for such crimes as dictated in the bible? DEATH. Except he doesn't believe anyone has been innocently murdered when the facts say there are. I'd like to get back to your claim. Your claim should be changed to ""we don't let people who support abortion say unfounded claims but people who don't can say anything they want, even itf it is obviously wrong in every obvious way.""","christian-cant-support-abortion","08:34 PM","abortion-debates","148"

I will point out if I see a claim that is unfounded to me..it is that simple.","christian-cant-support-abortion","08:38 PM","abortion-debates","149"
"04-24-2005","4912",10,"Duo_Maxwell","None","What is the punishment for such crimes as dictated in the bible? DEATH.","Cone","111796","The Bible says X is wrong. VOR also thinks X is wrong. Therefore VOR must think X is wrong because the Bible says so. The Bible says X is punishible by death. VOR thinks action X is wrong because the Bible says so, therefore he thinks action X should be punishable by death because the Bible says so. ---------------------------------------------------- Therefore, VOR thinks X is punishable by death????? That simply does not follow. The third and fifth premises are rather weak as it can not be implied, not from that single post anyway given: 1) VOR said ""I am not that religeous of a person."" 2) VOR said ""I think religion tells you to love the sinner but to hate the sin."" Duo, this has been a hard and heated debate, yet I've enjoyed it...I hope there's no hard feelings though...","christian-cant-support-abortion","08:46 PM","abortion-debates","150"
