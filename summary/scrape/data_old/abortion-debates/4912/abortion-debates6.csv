"04-23-2005","4912",6,"chloe","None","I think that maybe the point is that because of the way the courts have defined ""the woman's health"" that an abortion can be performed for any reason at all and for no reason at all.","Linus","111385","I don't think it is the point at all...I think it is just his shot at defacing the seriousness of having an unwanted pregnany.","christian-cant-support-abortion","06:57 PM","abortion-debates","76"
"04-23-2005","4912",6,"Linus","None","However, it doesn't matter and I asked specifically for a verse directly on abortion. You can mix two, three, four or even hundreds so you can boil it down to a single message but it still comes down to the fact a direct verse would only involve one passage. This is all I asked for and having read the Bible myself I expect you'll never find something that doesn't exist. Nice try though.","Cone","111386","Suppose Jim wants to do the following: take his newborn infant, and with a knife cut off its fingers and toes. Then he decides he wants to cut off its legs and its arms. Being a good Christian though, Jim wants to find out what the Bible has to say about this particular action. He decides that he needs direct evidence that this action is wrong, therefore he will need to find one verse that specifically says this particular action is wrong. Well, Jim read through the Bible, and found no direct reference to this action. Since he can find none, his action must not be wrong. No, stronger. Since there is no verse that directly states this particular action to be wrong, then the Bible actually says this action is right. Something is wrong with Jim's logic, shall we try and find out what it is?","christian-cant-support-abortion","06:57 PM","abortion-debates","77"

But come on people, wake up and smell the roses..There is a breathing, living human being here that is involved... Why do the people on the left think this infant has no rights?","christian-cant-support-abortion","07:21 PM","abortion-debates","80"
"04-23-2005","4912",6,"Steeeeve","None","We weren't talking about my thinking now were we. You claim the Bible never talks about abortion and therefore you can't say God thinks it is wrong. Well using that logic you would say that banning abortion is not unconstitutional because it never mentions the word abortion. Is this what you think?","Linus","111393","You just did. You are comparing apples to oranges. Demands were made on this thread that the opinions of other theologians, popes and churches are irrelevant and we should go strictly by the Bible. I played along because I knew none of you could prove a direct passage. I easily won because of a predictable outcome; you guys learned too late that the Bible said nothing about abortion and started to frantically link passages to other passages to support your position. However the constitution is a different story. The constitution is not read by what it says at face value alone but also what it insists. If you wanted to argue about something being constitutional without the opinions of the Supreme Court justices then so be ithowever that isnt the case. Abortion is not mentioned in the constitution and neither is individual gun ownershipthey are implied rights. You fatally decided to pigeonhole yourselves into a book that says nothing about abortion and then pretend to be the same theologians you ruled out as irrelevant to this topic. If you want to introduce the opinions of theologians into the argument then be my guestbut you are already dead in the water because the Christian institution has been supporting abortion for hundreds of years. Christianity doesnt have a consistent message to stand on when comes to abortion. Play theologian all you want but you have already proven the Bible is silent on abortion with the tactics you adopted.","christian-cant-support-abortion","07:21 PM","abortion-debates","81"
"04-23-2005","4912",6,"Cone","None","Linus, don't forget about my post here . I know things can get a bit messy on these boards and it is easy to miss something. Wow, apparently you can't deduce one logical thing from any statement I make. I said: Quote: Oh I don't sugar coat what he did. I just hold to sound Biblical doctrine that says God is just in everything he does. If God is just in everything He does, as the Bible obviously states He is, then it directly follows that he cannot be impugned by anybody for what He does. He especially can't be impugned by any human being, who we can safely assume is not omniscient, and therefore cannot know the situation fully. For you to imply that you are more just than God, is to imply that you know more than God does, which by reading your posts on these forums, we can safely say is flat out wrong.","Linus","111398","Thank you. There isnt anything logically about what you said. If Position A says you must respect Authority X and if Position B makes you worship something that doesnt respect Authority X then you provide a double standard. A person can only serve one ideology in matters like these. You may feel god is against abortion but it isnt. Apologist logicpeople commonly use to this defense to excuse psychopaths from their crimes. Because we cant understand we cannot judge. And pro-choicers use it to when they believe mens opinions are irrelevant on the issue because theyll never be pregnant. No human being can judge the complete motives of another and by your logic we should let all criminals free. Your comment is weak of morality. More me to judge your god is to imply just thatI can judge. If you want to search for hidden meanings then be my guest but you are just utilizing the fallacy of attacking the messenger instead of the message.","christian-cant-support-abortion","07:31 PM","abortion-debates","82"

I clearly said God is just in everything He does, not that men are just in everything they do. When we are talking about what the Bible says about something, we assume the entire Bible. Thus it is impossible to refute my claim, on Biblical grounds, that God is just in everything He does. I have shown that for you to judge God is to in fact claim that you know more than God. The only way you could be right in saying this is if you know more than He does. This thread is arguing on Biblical grounds, that is, what the Bible says; and as such, it is again impossible to refute my claim.","christian-cant-support-abortion","07:41 PM","abortion-debates","83"

Geez! So much for Christian morality. The kid must be lacking common sense, needs to be locked up and be given a new set of parents who can actually teach him morals. Secondly, the Bible is silent on the issue of that as far as I know but what multiple verses will he use? Someone can mix up five verses that regards Jim as having the right to even kill his brother. People have used the Bible to support all kinds of cruelties throughout the ages; slavery, anti-Semitism, the torture and murder of women as witches, sexual repression, censorship and the Inquisition, Crusades and other aggressive wars, and capital punishment for misdemeanors. None of these were directly supported by the Bible, just like abortion, but they were implied as such.","christian-cant-support-abortion","07:42 PM","abortion-debates","84"
"04-24-2005","4912",6,"Voice Of Reason","None","Why do the people on the left think this infant has no rights?","Duo_Maxwell","111482","Why do the people on the right think infants have rights? Third trimester abortion was struck down, and I don't see anything in the consituation which grants rights to fetuses.","christian-cant-support-abortion","02:51 AM","abortion-debates","86"
"04-24-2005","4912",6,"Duo_Maxwell","None","what do you not understand about no exceptions ? The 10 commandements simply states ""thou shall not kill."" To support killing of specific groups while attacking someone for supporting the killing of another while citing the 10 commandements makes them a flaming hypocrite. Again, what do you not understand about no exceptions ? I asked for where the 10 commandements has exceptions. Neither of you could list it. The fallacy doesn't work. It doesn't matter about the accusation! Thou shall not kill is not a subjective application. Thou shall not killn anyone .","Ender Wiggin","111515","The 10 commandments, properly translated from the original Hebrew and Greek, says thou shall not ""murder"" and their is a difference. Killing, such as in war or capital punishment, is justified and is NOT murder. God himself set up this standard. Think about it, he wrote 10 commandments, yet he sent the Hebrews to war, and set up a system of kinsmen redeemers, to punish murderers by death. (See earlier post for ample refutation) Maybe you should take the time, to understand a situation FULLY, before you start accusing people of hypocrisy.","christian-cant-support-abortion","10:40 AM","abortion-debates","87"
"04-24-2005","4912",6,"jitobear","None","I do not believe in imposing morality and I do not believe that is the purpose of the law. The law is to keep order and to protect individual rights and freedoms. The issue with abortion is whether you find the mother's or the fetus' more important.","Cone","111543","The law itself is a moral code. The law sets a moral standard by which we are to live. Whether that is its purpose or not is neither here nor there. The purpose may be to protect individual rights and freedoms, but it does this through imposing moral rules on people.","christian-cant-support-abortion","12:55 PM","abortion-debates","89"
"04-24-2005","4912",6,"Jitobear","None","Third trimester abortion was struck down, and I don't see anything in the consituation which grants rights to fetuses. And you can be a cold-blooded murderer and still be a Christian. You can dance at a pagan fire and still be a Christian. Action does not negate faith - although it can make it empty.","Steeeeve","111546","I don't see anything in the constitution which grants a women the right to have an abortion. As for the fetus...if it is considered a person it has rights. Gets down to what is a person? Is it DNA? Is it not connected to someone else? Is it 7 months old? The second one I have a heard time believing because concoined twins are connected and they are both people. I guess you can call yourself a Christian..this is true. However, I mean you can actually BE one. There really is only one way to BE a true Christian. I can call myself President but I am not .","christian-cant-support-abortion","01:09 PM","abortion-debates","90"
