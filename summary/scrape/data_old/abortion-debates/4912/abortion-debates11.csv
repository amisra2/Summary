"04-24-2005","4912",11,"Cone","None","The Bible says X is wrong. VOR also thinks X is wrong. Therefore VOR must think X is wrong because the Bible says so.","Duo_Maxwell","111809","He considers them the same as other sins which all have the same punishment. Why would he link a number of sins which all have death as the punishment? The sins he mentions have no real link to each other except how the bible deals with them.","christian-cant-support-abortion","09:13 PM","abortion-debates","151"
"04-24-2005","4912",11,"Steeeeve","None","This is another claim that you provide no backing for....It is a ""because you say so"" arguement, which you are against (as stated by the thread you posted). I will point out if I see a claim that is unfounded to me..it is that simple.","Duo_Maxwell","111810","What? Now you're just lazy. I haven't seen cone argue once that VOR was wrong. Even in his most INSANE arguments, especially the one that because a bill was one vote short that it has a hard time passing from now on. I haven;t seen you do that either. That's pretty selective. It appears you people are fully willing to let someone who is aganist abortion go off on insane arguments which have no facts but hold someone who supports abortion to that standard. Your claim should be changed to ""we don't let people who support abortion say unfounded claims but people who don't can say anything they want, even itf it is obviously wrong in every obvious way.""","christian-cant-support-abortion","09:14 PM","abortion-debates","152"

Therefore, if VOR makes a claim in another forum, I am likely not to respond to it. If VOR makes such fanciful claims as you suggest he does in the abortion forum, and I see it, I'll be on top of that like a fly on dung.","christian-cant-support-abortion","09:28 PM","abortion-debates","154"

Steeeeve! Dude, you've only pointed out like one or two of VOR's arguments as hugely problematic. He's created 16 threads and all of them have bad, unfounded arguments.","christian-cant-support-abortion","09:31 PM","abortion-debates","155"

That wasn't so in the past. There isn't anything linking the sins he mentions beyond a common punishment. Why would he consider the ones he specifically noted as the same? Besides his claim goes a bit cooky. When he mentions any other, does he mean that he thinks homosexuality is on par with working on Sundays? Steeve, Must I DO EVERYTHING?

So I still don't see your point. I call out unfounded claims when I see them...sometimes I don't need to see evidence of some stuff..however, such as today I wanted to see some evidence of VOR being a hypocrite because your claim was unfounded at that point. So what is your point?","christian-cant-support-abortion","09:46 PM","abortion-debates","159"

I will wait until he speaks on the issue before I think, infer, conclude, or imply what he thinks about it. For me to do so is to say, ""I think VOR would say this"" which is obviously different then saying ""VOR said this."" I certainly desire others to afford my posts this courtesy, therefore, I try to afford it to everyone as well, no matter how much I might disagree them.","christian-cant-support-abortion","09:58 PM","abortion-debates","160"
"04-24-2005","4912",11,"Cone","None","If you believe that Jesus was God, but don't believe the Bible is God's word, then you believe that Jesus can lie and still be God. Jesus claimed He had fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah 61, thereby confirming the testimony of Isaiah as God's word. If Jesus lied, He was not God. God can kill anyone He wants because 1) The commandment says you shall not murder. 2) if God takes life justly , it follows that He did not murder.","zachvac","111856","Or you believe that God/Jesus didn't write the bible but man did. Or maybe people wrote it to try to support belief in God. I never claimed that he did, I am saying that many people murder such as serial killers yet he doesn't punish them, he punished EVERYONE with the flood. Was EVERYONE worse than these serial killers? I don't think so. This quote is one of the reason I don't agree with Christianity. When you have a ruler that by definition is always just I don't like it. Too much authority. He could say that you have to eat your children and it would be considered just. Also someone earlier brought up finding anything you want to in the bible. Someone mentioned that the bible promoted homosexuality because it says ""love thy neighbor"" and maybe I want to go love my neighbor. They've used it to justify wars against innocent people (they weren't Christian, that was their only ""crime""), they've used it to execute ""witches"" and other stuff like that. Politicians use it to justify wars all the time (in fact Bush said that ""God told me to strike Al Quadea and I did, then he told me to strike Iraq, and I did""). You can twist and bend verses of the bible any way you want which is the problem. While you say that it states that fetuses are babies and murder is a sin but many also use the bible to claim that women should be inferior to men. They use it to justify their actions every which way and that's why the bible being so vague is a bad idea. If only they had written the word abortion or had an appendix at the end defining murder we'd know but unless there is a direct mention about abortion all you can take is an educated guess. People already admit that we can't comprehend God, how can we comprehend what he meant with 2 separate verses? Maybe he used different logic than us. With God you never know, that's why I like to stick with what I do know.","christian-cant-support-abortion","11:20 PM","abortion-debates","161"
"04-24-2005","4912",11,"None","None","None","zachvac","111858","In the past you've always seemed like an intelligent, mature person who has thought things through and made a thoughtful, intelligent response. But now that VOR has come he seems to be bringing out the worst in you. Try not to argue about his past, debate what you think is faulty logic in the thread you are discussing in. We are supposed to be debating topics not people. Since he has come you have gone to personal attacks instead of keeping your cool and refuting his claims. Yes he has used faulty logic sometimes, but expose it instead of claiming he's a hypocrite with 12 links from the past. Refute claims with quotes and refute his claims rather than him. Next time you respond to VOR pretend it says ""bobJones"" and try to respond like you would to any other person.","christian-cant-support-abortion","11:23 PM","abortion-debates","162"
"04-24-2005","4912",11,"None","None","None","Duo_Maxwell","111875","Steeve quoted badly. He removed the context of the quote which is clear no-no. He removed in a number why vor was a hypocrite. Specifically reasons in the past. Well, it's quite clear that VOR doesn't care if he's wrong. He just cowardly runs away. believe me, I tried that in the beginning two years ago. It didn't work at all. A number of people tried that. up2date, Jd3, Captain America, Platapyus, the list goes on and on and on. It didn't work for any of us. Currently play C is in action. Merely link arguments which have in the past refuted his claims and archive his contiunal web of lies and contridictions. It removes the effort we put into refuting him by merely citing past work. Basically it lowers the energy problem. It is quite clear he puts litterally no thought or effort into his arguments, and to refute him requires a extensive point by point. therefore by merely citing something that has already refuted his rehashed arguments the energy expenditure is now even. We can now fight him without wasting time. Simply copy paste and his argument is refuted. If that does not work, plan D of just outright mocking will be set in motion.","christian-cant-support-abortion","11:58 PM","abortion-debates","163"

I didn't quote badly because I was just pointing out where you said he was a hypocrite...In all those links you provided no quote and provided no contradiction of any kind. Try this plan: Make a claim..say--> I believe VOR is being hypocritical in this statement ""<insert statement here>""... Show evidence of this claim-->using these posts: ""<post 1 showing one position>"" ""<post 2 showing another position on the same thing>"" This is a simply easy way to do so. Before hand you just did the following: ""VOR is a hypocrite because he said you can murder"" ...well thats nice, but you didnt provide any evidence of that and don't expect us to keep tabs on what everyone said. So take the advice given to you by all sides of these forums and stop with the lame posts. You know a simple ""thank you"" woulda been nice instead of trying to refute Zachvac, Cone, and myself.","christian-cant-support-abortion","12:22 AM","abortion-debates","165"
