I don't recall saying I hated Jane Fonda by the way so I see no point in what you said. Moreover, you state that you have a right ot believe whta you like, and that is fine.

"04-28-2005","4912",15,"Steeeeve","None","Believe your geocities website if you want...However, I would trust a Bible Study website over geocities anyday. Jane Fonda is a joke of a Christian. If someone calls themselves a Christian it doesn't mean they are. I can call myself president all day long and it won't be true. To be a Christian you gotta believe in God and his Word. Only one way to do that. Please, at some point you appeal to authority However, having a PHd holds more credibility then a geocities website. So I suggest you get a source to prove some of your stuff or this is a worthless debate. I have shown what all of those passages mean and how they fit together to show that God doesn't support abortion at all. So go ahead and call me an ""ungrateful loser"", I choose facts and sources to show my points.","Linus","113350","Even if the Bible Study website told to you that abortion was okay and the geocities did not? Hey, you are the one who implied it. You said any day. Once again you are dodging facts by attacking the source. Are you so horribly intimidated by a geocities website that you dodge the content of the site? Sad. No, you and your movement are the joke. You made a claim that cant even support fifteen pages later. Your claims are ridiculous. The majority of Christians in the USA believe abortion is a right or believe it should be allowed in only a few circumstances. So does that mean only a few Christians reside here in America then? Last time I checked only about 5-9% of Americans are absolutely opposed to abortion so I guess 9/10 Christians are false. Apparently George W Bush and over 90% of republicans are not Christian anymore because you said so. Keep it up, you are defeating yourself with your own logic. By the time you are done shunning heretics within your own religion on the abortion issue alone, Christianity would be a tiny, irrelevant faith left on the footnotes of modern history. A great way to turn people away from Christianity. Arent you the same guy who claimed I said abortion was okay because the Bible is silent on it and yet never proved I said it? So what if someone with a Phd made a website on geocitiesthen what? Are they no longer credible? And what makes a geocities website less credible then a regular website? Is it because someone felt like forking over money to pay for web space and the other didnt? Or is it because the creator of the website knew HTML scripting and the other didnt? Please explain. A Phd only means the level of education of someoneit doesnt mean theyll utilize that knowledge. Today, we have people with Phds that claim the world is flat. I find such comments like yours amusing. Apparently you dont even bother to think these things through and just post out of impulse. Following your logic, pro-lifers are irrelevant because the Supreme Court is ruled by those who have taken years and years of classes on American law as opposed to a group of angry religious zealots who usually just have a high school education. Based on your conclusion these judges know what they are talking about and you dont. See what happens when you base reason on appeal only? Most Americans support Roe v Wade. So does that makes abortion right? The Supreme Court supports Roe v Wade. So does that makes abortion right? The AMA supports Roe v Wade. So does that makes abortion right? You guys lose. Time for you to take a class in logic. Already have but the only problem is that you ignore the information provided and attack the messenger instead. If the information on these sites are so wrong and invalid then you wouldnt feel so threatened by them. Either you find the website too anti-Christian or it is ran by a web service you dont like. You need to suggest yourself a source to prove that the Bible directly condemns abortion before you can suggest anything to others. Your topic is centered on explaining how Christians cannot support abortion but yet never have you provided a source to prove this. Only innuendo and post-hoc logic. No. You havent. They dont fit together, you make them fit together in order to create a viewpoint that is totally alien within the Bible. It is called forging a link. Not once have you provided evidence that God condemns abortion. No, you only select facts and positions that support your viewpoint and then attempt to discredit or ignore facts that collide against your precious views. Any time I use a source you find an excuse to avoid acknowledging or simply ignore it. This is what makes you an ungrateful loser. You go into a seizure of denial when the truth becomes too unsightly. P.S. Jane Fonda is still Christian and supports abortion. It must drive you nuts.","christian-cant-support-abortion","06:05 AM","abortion-debates","216"

Activist judges on both sides (appointed by whomever president is currently capable of pushing one into a life seating) will say different things on this matter. ""Today, we have people with Phds that claim the world is flat."" The American Medical Association says a lot of things at times that later turn out to be countridicted. Seems the actual determination on whether abortion is right or wrong falls upon the 'Because I say so' line of belief. Of course, since some can't think for themselves, they'll turn to another source. Well, we can always use the logic you tend to apply. As a non christian fairly well schooled in the bible, as has been said, the easiest interpretation of the bible states it's opposed to abortion. The bible supposedly being the word of God hisself and all. That aside, many people choose to intrepret all sorts of things in it to get what ever they desire. From those who desire bible approved homosexual relations to abortion approval to mass murdering popes killing the heretics. So what? Yeah. She can also claim to be a man or a martian. If she quacks, she can even say she's a duck. Heck, look at christianity. You have these protestors in various shades and even catholic division that's barely stiffled at times by the uppers putting some smack down. Now, if you'll excuse me, God has given me instructions on filling a paper bag with dog doo and setting it on fire on my neighbors doorsteps.

I'm really curious where you're getting the 'most' support fetal stem cell research...or, are you merely leaving 'stem cell research' generic so as to confuse the situation. For example, I oppose fetal stem cell research but support other types of stem cell research. There are subtle differences. Sure, some people who think an innocent child should be protected and think a guilty man should be put to death...and? It's still not 'most' without an absolute count of the numbers or a reflective poll of a wide selection of people. Are all 'pro-lifers' and 'pro-choicers' supposed to be identical??? Sounds currently like you're as bad as those you accuse. But, then I could say 'Most' of you abortionist are. If I polled the rabid neo-con christians here, I'd be right...and all you could do is refute my source and methods. Kind of ironic. Vague generalities.

Whoaso does that mean if someone said the sky is blue on geocities it wouldnt be a fact then? If you ever dared to read the site that I provided the author credits their information. On the other hand your BibleStudy.org doesnt provide any citations of information. But then again, I am sure you have never read it. Too busy attacking the web service provider then the info. My teachers never allowed me to use information from the internet unless it came from a .gov. Unlike government websites, which can be held liable for the information they use, anyone can say what they want on the internet. Whether it be geocities or some .org. Even your precious bible study website shows no proof of the author having a Phd. So there is a difference between calling Jane Fonda a joke for what she believes (God supporting abortion) and calling you a joke for what you believe (God condemns abortion)? Your hypocrisy is astounding and the fact that you dont dismiss this probably means you agree with my assessment. The double standards you present are tearing your argument to pieces. You posted this ten pages down and I have defeated it again, again and again. It is like beating a dead horse. Lets go over the motions once again. I. Your interpretation of Exodus 21 NEVER states killing a fetus is murder. In fact, it wouldnt be murder at all; it is manslaughter. The man who harms the woman did it by accident while murder would require him to premeditatedly attack the woman. However you use commandment 6 in conjunction with Exodus 21 to make your point but commandment 6 only condemns murdernot manslaughter. So commandment 6 + Exodus 21 do not equal abortion is wrong. Try again. II. Give Exodus 21 the benefit of the doubt. There are many countries that punish people for harming pregnant women and allow legal abortion. III. The Bible doesnt absolutely condemn killing fetuses. In Numbers 5 and Exodus 21, people are given the right to destroy innocent fetal life. Hebrews could slay unborn babies of the enemy, husbands could make their wives miscarry if his wife became pregnant due to adultery and etc.. IV. Biblical laws were often emulated and vice versa to similar neighboring cultures. Their laws interpreted the same way Rabbis have been interpreting Exodus 21 for hundreds of years. The Code of Hammurabi and the Sumerian code fined the man who induced a miscarriage upon the husbands wife (in the Sumerian case, it was based on the womans social status.) In Assyrian Code, a man charged with the crime only had to do public service. Again and again, accidentally inducing abortion was only a misdemeanor. Not murder nor manslaughter. And I posted this as irrelevant and goes to a more thornier question; if god knew us before the moment of conception then why would he supposedly ensoul a zygote that would have been knowingly aborted? I dont need to refute; it isnt going to make my position anymore right then it already is. I have already over-killed your argument. If you want to squabble over Hebrew words be my guestnot going to spend hours at a library finding the definitions of such words in a classical Hebrew dictionary. ( www.pollingreport.com/abortion posted 1,525,829 times now) 60% of Americans support Roe v Wade. Attitudes about abortion have changed relatively little in the 30 years since the Roe v.
