(12 or 100 pack) Nontracts the freethought answer to ubiquitous religious tracts. Brief but thorough, easy to read, 3 1/2 x 4 1/4-inch folded brochures address many common myths about freethought or religion. Order individual packs (12 for $4), a Sample Pack or by bulk (100 or more of the same nontract). -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Absolutely nothing! The word ""abortion"" does not appear in any translation of the bible! Out of more than 600 laws of Moses, none comments on abortion. One Mosaic law about miscarriage specifically contradicts the claim that the bible is antiabortion, clearly stating that miscarriage does not involve the death of a human being. If a woman has a miscarriage as the result of a fight, the man who caused it should be fined. If the woman dies, however, the culprit must be killed: ""If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. ""And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, Eye for eye, tooth for tooth . . .""--Ex. 21:22-25 The bible orders the death penalty for murder of a human being, but not for the expulsion of a fetus .

Psalm 139:13 - 'For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb.' Jeremiah 1:5 - 'Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations."" Of course, the question is, what divine insight does the pro-abortion crowd think they have to where they can destroy in a mother's womb that which God is somehow instrumental in creating? Quotes on abortion, from Mother Teresa: "" But I feel that the greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion, because it is a war against the child - a direct killing of the innocent child - murder by the mother herself. And if we accept that a mother can kill even her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another?"" ""By abortion, the mother does not learn to love, but kills even her own child to solve her problems. And by abortion, the father is told that he does not have to take any responsibility at all for the child he has brought into the world. That father is likely to put other women into the same trouble. So abortion just leads to more abortion. Any country that accepts abortion is not teaching the people to love, but to use any violence to get what they want. That is why the greatest destroyer of love and peace is abortion.

It takes no insight considering your GOD had nothing to do with it. Women should have the right to Choose if they make a mistake. Women should have the right to Choose if they are told they might die giving birth. Women should have a right to choose if they are told their baby may have a severe birth defect. YOU don't have the right to tell anyone how to live their life, that's where you zealots get it wrong.
