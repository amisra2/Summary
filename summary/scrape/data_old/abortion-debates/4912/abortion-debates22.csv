You can't have your cake and eat it too.","dnwppg","404208","I'm no Catholic, so I don't agree with denying someone communion because their sinful actions are common knowledge. However, if the Catholic church normally denies communion to someone because the person is opposed to a Christian belief regarding abortion, the fact that the person happens to be a politician cannot be allowed to restrict the church's normal handling of that situation or else the state is, in a small part, establishing a religion by controlling what the church can and cannot do.","christian-cant-support-abortion","04:12 PM","abortion-debates","317"
"06-08-2010","4912",22,"Shooterandproud","403492","But I do see them saying things like ""gays are sinners"" and ""abortion is murder."" I don't care aboutbpar lines. Whether they're saying things I agree with or not is irrelevant.","Steeeeve","404240","Those two things are not just political statements like ""Vote for Bob because he'll give us a new building"". Biblical teachings and teachings about what is or isn't a sin directly relates to religion even if it is a hot topic in politics. If a preacher says ""theft is wrong"" then this doesn't mean they are engaged with politics since theft happens to be illegal. I certainly agree with you that churches shouldn't be a front for political games and ones that are should have tax-exempt status removed. I would even be fine with a preacher talking about the importance of electing government officials who believe in God but I think the line should be drawn when it is clear the sermon is becoming a political commercial for a specific candidate or is in substance this. Granted this is a hard standard sometimes but overall I don't think many churches have a problem with this.","christian-cant-support-abortion","11:55 AM","abortion-debates","318"

"06-11-2010","4912",22,"Steeeeve","111128","I was watching the Bill Maher show today and they had Jane Fonda on. She mentioned that she has recently become a Christian and that HER god is one that supports a womens right to choice. Now there are so many problems with this that I don't even know where to start. Not only that, I am saying this as almost a ""newbie"" Christian as in I don't know everything there is to know about the Bible. However, I do know that the Christian God that is defined in the Bible is against abortion. Many argue that the Bible is not what the Christian God is because it has been translated into a meaningless document. How is this true when we have so many of the original scrolls? Moreever, how can one claim what God thinks if they don't have anything to base it on? For example if you say the Bible is worthless, you are a Christian, and God believes abortion is ok...then how did you come to this conclusion? The Christian God talks about how one is created before they were put in the womb. God also talks about not killing. So if you wish to be Christian and for abortion you need to rethink one of those stances. God doesn't conform to anyone.","shaunjosef","404387","Have you read the Old Testament? In Numbers, God says don't count any male child under one month old as a person. They also didn't count girls at all. He also had them burn Tamora while she was pregnant.","christian-cant-support-abortion","01:10 AM","abortion-debates","320"

Honestly, how many times do you think I've heard the Exodus and Numbers quote on this forum given my post count and join date? Do a search on the Exodus one...easy to see that is wrong. The Numbers quote has nothing to do with who or who isn't valuable to God. That's like saying counting people over the age of 40 years old means everyone below is not a person.","christian-cant-support-abortion","02:01 PM","abortion-debates","323"

Psalm 139:13 For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mothers womb. Of course, the question here is: What divine insight does the pro-abortion crowd think they have to where they can destroy in a mothers womb that which God is somehow instrumental in creating?

Ultimately their are responsible to God for what they believe and how they advise others on what to do in a situation based on that belief. I know that one of the things God HATES and there aren't many things mentioned in the bible that He hates, one of the things is the shedding of innocent blood. If God HATES such a thing then I certainly do not want to support it. I don't know what could be more innocent than an unborn child.
