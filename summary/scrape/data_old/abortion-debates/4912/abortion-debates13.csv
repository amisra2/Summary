The last thing the world needs is an armchair theologian telling everybody else who is a Christian centered around their own personal feelings.

"04-25-2005","4912",13,"Linus","None","Because you use contemporary Hebrewnot classic, which is hundreds of years outdated like Old English. The grammar and definition have changed for many words in Hebrew since the reestablishment of Israel. Understandably, the community part would be dropped off so rashach would sound similar to the more accepted definition of murder. However splitting hairs isnt going to do you any good either. Your site is just using the regular old contemporary translation of Exodus 21 that I pointed out earlier. For thousands of years Rabbis translated it as this; if a woman is injured then it is an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a life. If the fetus is injured then it is only a small crime that and those responsible must pay a fine according to the father. As such, even such a law was reflective in all other surrounding cultures. You dont have to go far into Judaism to see that Jewish culture didnt really cherish fetal life since an embryo is not reckoned a viable living thing (in Hebrew, bar kayama). Even the phrase adopted to unborn children is ubar yerech imo-- which deems the fetus as being part of the pregnant woman's body. If the webmaster to your site wants to play history revisionist because he thinks Exodus 21 should be interpreted differently from the way it has been done traditionally for many centuries then so be it. It doesnt change history or the original interpretation. And yet it still doesnt say anything against abortion. Try again. No, even if the Jews had translated it as such it would not condemn abortion. By your interpretation a man is being punished for wrongfully killing a fetus. This doesnt bar the parents from attaining an abortion. Once again you are using a logic fallacy. If situation Z provides punishment Y then situation X would provide punishment Y too. Your logic doesnt make any sense. Indeedwe have already lost 3,000 on 9/11 because of Bush incompetence and 1,500 soldiers because of his war on demand in Iraq. However it is not a loss that is exclusive to just us. I would like to think it applies to many Americans. Everyone of them that I have read (and I have read a lot). From the most conservative (Falwell) to the most liberal (Kangas), the bible is silent on the issue. If there was a direct verse against abortion then we wouldnt be arguing about this but since there isnt, both sides dig in the Bible looking for verses that might support their political agendas. I find it to be rather pathetic. If you need to pervert ancient scripture for the sake of their political ideology then it certainly shows a lack of conviction on their part.","Steeeeve","111995","Because you say so right? Everywhere I looked it said that word (which you even spelt wrong making it harder to look up) means murder and not kill...this was because they had another word for kill. Would you like to post a credible site that states otherwise? I actually got it from a number of sites. It doesn't matter how rabbis translated it for many years as it still shows that the Exodus 21 phrase doesn't translate into miscarriage as you claimed earlier. Not only this...it can only have one meaning which doesn't change and since you have provided no evidence to contradict what I said it is just what you think. If we translated as I had stated then ther person that killedthe fetus would be punished as killing a person (eye for an eye) as they said and would be punished by death. So logically since the fetus is considered a person and abortion kills a person....Do I need to spell it out? logic fallacy...I think not. ""try again"" as you always say. and 600,000 under Lincoln...way to take the statement and try to prove a different point. You know..the Bible doesn't directly talk about a lot of things, however, we can easily figure out what it is talking about. This is because the Bible is written to provide answers to morality of today, yesteday, and future (I believe Cone posted a quote from the Bible showing this in this thread). And if you think Falwell is silent on the issue of abortion...think again. And you continue on for pages.... However proving nothing and even going as far as to suggest that I am desperate and not very insightful. Maybe you didn't mean this and I will give you the benefit of the doubt, however, you make a lot of claims which seem ok however you provide no evidence for these. You claim that NO theolgian has my views (eventhough I believe I posted one) and yet you provided nothing to prove your point other then a crazy website about religious tolerance. Shall I submit a website about how we are all robots as evidence that this is true? I am just suggesting that you provide some evidence to back your claims of hebrew words..etc...in order for me to actually take your claims seriously. WHo knows, you may actually be correct on some things...however you just saying it will not convince me when I find things contrary to what you say....Just a suggestion","christian-cant-support-abortion","10:30 AM","abortion-debates","183"
"04-25-2005","4912",13,"zachvac","None","This quote is one of the reason I don't agree with Christianity. When you have a ruler that by definition is always just I don't like it. Too much authority. He could say that you have to eat your children and it would be considered just. You can twist and bend verses of the bible any way you want which is the problem. ....that's why the bible being so vague is a bad idea. People already admit that we can't comprehend God, how can we comprehend what he meant with 2 separate verses? Maybe he used different logic than us. With God you never know, that's why I like to stick with what I do know.","chloe","112015","While the Bible claims God is just and true in all his ways (and backs it up with evidence), it also makes multitudes of claims about other aspects of his nature (and then backs it up with evidence). Psalms 145 8 The LORD is gracious and merciful; Slow to anger and great in lovingkindness. 9 The LORD is good to all, And His mercies are over all His works. Ex 33 18 Then Moses said, ""I pray You, show me Your glory!"" 19 And He said, "" I Myself will make all My goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the name of the LORD before you; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show compassion on whom I will show compassion."" And then Ex 34 34:6-7 Then the LORD passed by in front of him and proclaimed, ""The LORD, the LORD God, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in lovingkindness and truth; who keeps lovingkindness for thousands, who forgives iniquity, transgression and sin; yet He will by no means leave {the guilty} unpunished, visiting the iniquity of fathers on the children and on the grandchildren to the third and fourth generations."" None of these attributes ever conflict with justice. The Bible makes the claim of clarity. But you have assumed that just because anyone can twist and bend it, take it out of context, do whatever to make it say what they want, then it is not clear (which happens to be a wrong assumption). It is true that anyone could distort and misrepresent any clearly written document in the same way that they can take the letters of the alphabet and make it say whatever they want. This is why it is imoportant to read the document in question in context before buying into any claim made of the document. While God cannot be fully known he can be known and can be rightly known and the Bible can be rightly known and understood. This is according to the Bible's claim.","christian-cant-support-abortion","11:41 AM","abortion-debates","185"

Or how about the 10,000 iraqi civilians we bombed? Maybe you should take the time, to understand a situation FULLY before defending a idiot. You have obviously missed where VOR supports the murder of abortion doctors, pedophiliacs and other groups.","Ender Wiggin","112255","No, it really doesn't. Nobody said that. In fact where I come from, we call that a ""straw man"" fallacy. It happens when you twist my arguments, to say something I didn't say. Or in this case the exact opposite of what I said. Pretty cowardly approach if you ask me. You seem to miss the fact, that VOR sees those people as guilty. So by his standards it is not murder, and he is not a hypocrite. You know, you spend so much time trying to thwart VOR, you almost never thoroughly support your own opinions.

However Ill give you the benefit of the doubt and believe you were merely confused and have thus retreated from your post and have acknowledged my superiority over you in this thread. A very honorable thing you do. Like I said. It isnt going to matter whether we use an ancient or contemporary definition of Hebrew. You still cant prove your point either way because murder applies to only illegal killing. I am sure you have. So? You are too busy arguing over moot detail. Time to do a little research on ancient abortion history, shall we? Hebrew laws were often copied by surrounding cultures and vice versa. The earliest laws that provided punishment for killing fetuses seemed to have been made in the interest of the fathers and not the fetuses themselves. The Code of Hammurabi, which was thought to have been written in the Eighteenth Century B.C.E., required that silver be paid to the father of a pregnant woman who was caused to miscarry by another person (Platt). The Hebrew Torah or Old Testament likewise requires simply a payment to the master of the woman who was caused to miscarry (Exodus 21:22-25). A Middle Assyrian law that was in force around five centuries after Hammurabis code provides the most striking example of a law protecting fetuses in the interest of the father. It punished a woman who purposely caused herself to miscarry with impalement and no burial, but fathers had the right to practice infanticide on their unwanted offspring (Lerner; Reiman). http://www.geocities.com/dnwppg/rese.../prologic.html I see you are wrong once again. I know your rhetoric like the back of my hand and if you want to squabble over petty detail about Hebrew words then have fun. My position is not only solid but Exodus 21 cannot be used to imply abortion is wrong. But it doesnt. It doesnt say a fetus is a person. It doesnt say that the perpetrator has committed such a crime (murder) to begin with. Once again, you are forging links which are not there. Judaism, as I stated over and over again, acknowledges life at first breath. The Bible gives permission to destroy fetal life in many occasions. If killing a fetus was murder then you need to find a passage that absolutely condemns killing a fetus. The Hebrews could kill the unborn babies of the enemy and a husband could abort a fetus if it was the byproduct of an affair. Sorry, the Bible isnt a one way street on the issue of preserving fetal life. ""Try again"" as I always say. You are the one who made the claimI am only agreeing with you and explaining my answer. Is that a now crime? So you now admit there isnt a direct passage on abortion. How long did it take you to figure that out? Anyone can imply that the Bible supports X position. You could even use it to support infanticide, genocide or slavery. It has been done before. Never said that I thought this. Wonderfully. As we speak, you guys elected a president who campaigns for pro-choice candidates. Hmm GOP morality doesnt exactly win you electionsit really just frightens people. Remember the Republican convention in 1996? Jerry Falwell or Robertson declaring a war on the godless? Or how about Bush in 2000 constantly having to address the fear in moderate voters about him possibly outlawing abortion? Arlen and Arnold enjoy your support.","christian-cant-support-abortion","05:19 PM","abortion-debates","195"
