Best decision of my life. This is the part where you trivialize and dismiss women.","Hunter","116989","Greetings to you, don't you get tired of being wrong all of the time. My stance on abortion does not demean women. Only an up-side down deranged liberal could believe that. Sorry about your failure to keep your husband, divorce is a sad state of affair for this country. If you think that your divorce and your pro-death view on innocent children is compatable with a walk with the Lord; you need some very serious self examination. I wish you well in that regard. You need to walk to the light, not run from it. How can any Christian believe in murdering children knowing that every baby is a gift from the Lord? Answer: A true Christian can't!!","christian-cant-support-abortion","11:14 PM","abortion-debates","271"

You have NEVER, not even ONCE, acknowledged that the reasons that women choose abortion are serious. That these women have serious issues and needs that HAVE to be addressed for a successful pregnancy to occur. Steve is pro-choice and recognizes that. But not you. All you do is demonize and preach preach preach. Not only does your stance on abortion demean women, your stance on anything that deals with women demeans women. You are a garden variety sexist. Only the truly unimaginative continually resort to stereotypes. Can you read? I didn't fail to keep my husband - he failed to keep ME. I threw his sorry, lazy, abusive XXX out and I filed for divorce. Typical misogynist - thinks a woman can never be the one who walks. Or maybe I should have just let him keep on with the abuse? Wait for him to start on our little boy? Would the your misogynistic idea of God approved of that? I bet he would - the already born don't matter to Hunter - especially the female ones and the brown ones. Further proof you can't read. We have been down this road before Hunter. Once again I ask you to show me where I said this OK with God? hmm? And I will ask you again now as I did then - where in the Bible do you get that the mistreatment, trivialization, domonization of women is OK? Actually a Christian can believe a lot of things you don't. Your ego barely fits on this board. Continually speaking for the Lord you are. I think abortion is a sad horrible thing - and wish we could get more of you lifers on board to actually doing something about it. But you don't give a damn about babies. You just like to preach. You never offer a solution. You won't even discuss ways to help these mothers. You applaud the monkey for the butchery of already born brown children in Iraq. I believe in freedom of concious and choice. So does God. That's why we have it. Who in the hell are you to trump that?","christian-cant-support-abortion","05:20 PM","abortion-debates","272"
"05-05-2005","4912",19,"Steeeeve","None","So murder is a subjective term now...I laugh at that. Your point was what again? They fact that VOR didn't prove his case and never does? I don't understand....However, maybe if you looked at the sources on that site you would see that it is in the upper 90%s (however this is clinical abortions...not underground ones).","Duo_Maxwell","117506","Yes it is. In fact, it's not even correct as murder is the unlawful killing of a person. A unborn child is not considered by law to be a person. Nor is it illegal to have a abortion. VOR is using the term wrongfully and subjectively. What is in the upper 90%? Oh yes, no proof that 90% of abortions are ""murder.""","christian-cant-support-abortion","05:23 PM","abortion-debates","273"

I haven't got my PhD yet, but I did get off of geocities. I guess no one read my whole page though. Reading on, you could see that I go on to argue that almost no one can support abortion, which would include Christians. The part of my page that was quoted is part of the history of abortion laws that I found in a book by someone who supports abortion. I admired Jeffrey Reiman's logic. I read a lot of his book thinking he was pro-life, but all the sudden, he blew it, and it didn't make any sense at all. He went from completely logical to ridiculous. Oh, he gets blasted for it on my page too. As for the ""scholarly"" status of my page, I wrote it as a senior at university. I had to have sources for pretty much everything I put in there. At the bottom of the page is a link to all my sources. I'm sure some of them have PhDs. Here's the link now: varietyreading.carlsguides.com/resedi/prologic.html I'm sorry that I'm posting on a topic that is so old, but I just thought I'd chime in. I was amused to see what my site added to the discussion just by being on geocities.","christian-cant-support-abortion","01:06 AM","abortion-debates","274"

Christians do not ""support"" abortion! No one is ""FOR"" abortion! Christians CAN support the rights of WOMEN to choose to carry a life inside their bodies, nor not. Even Mary, the mother of Jesus, was given a CHOICE! GOd did not tell her that she HAD to carry Jesus! Let's not lose sight of the fact that the ""choice"" in Pro-Choice is to give women access to clean medical facilities, as opposed to back street alley butcher shops. Abortions will NEVER go away until we make them unnecessary. Give women a DIFFERENT choice! How about funding research into artificial wombs, fetal transplants, things like that. I personally would love to see embryos transplanted into MEN -- I wonder how many ""pro-life"" men would volunteer for that experience -- Zero?","christian-cant-support-abortion","06:47 PM","abortion-debates","282"
"11-10-2009","4912",19,"Steeeeve","111128","I was watching the Bill Maher show today and they had Jane Fonda on. She mentioned that she has recently become a Christian and that HER god is one that supports a womens right to choice. Now there are so many problems with this that I don't even know where to start. Not only that, I am saying this as almost a ""newbie"" Christian as in I don't know everything there is to know about the Bible. However, I do know that the Christian God that is defined in the Bible is against abortion. Many argue that the Bible is not what the Christian God is because it has been translated into a meaningless document. How is this true when we have so many of the original scrolls? Moreever, how can one claim what God thinks if they don't have anything to base it on? For example if you say the Bible is worthless, you are a Christian, and God believes abortion is ok...then how did you come to this conclusion? The Christian God talks about how one is created before they were put in the womb. God also talks about not killing. So if you wish to be Christian and for abortion you need to rethink one of those stances. God doesn't conform to anyone.","Montanae","377707","I do agree with you. I also think that Jane either is supporting the wrong religion, or she has the wrong concept of it. God often tells us that our bodies are not ours, but his. So, if our outsides are not his, what makes us think that the insides are? Therefor, I don't think that it's right to get an abortion. Also, while ""HER"" God might be one of choice, the TRUE CHRISTIAN GOD is not. He has often told us to not kill, as it is even one of the Ten Holy Commandments. So, what makes us think that we have the right to take a baby's life? And don't confuse yourself. It might be a bunch of cells, but the cells evolve into something more. Therefor, it is considered a baby. If it's not, than why do you say that you are pregnant, when you find out that you are positive? To be pregnant means that you are with child, and your justification for getting an abortion is that it's not technically a child yet. SO does that mean that you are simply with cells? My question is not how can someone claim to know what God thinks when they have nothing to base it upon, but it is ""How can one, especially one that claims to be a Christian, claim to know what God thinks in the first place?"" We, as Christians, know that you can not tell God what to do, nor can you tell him what not to do. So, if you can't do those two things, how do you manage to know what he is thinking? I ponder this... And I agree: God doesn't conform to anyone.","christian-cant-support-abortion","07:27 PM","abortion-debates","283"
"11-22-2009","4912",19,"None","None","None","Easyrider","379634","Report: Kennedy barred from communion by bishop Nov. 22, 2009 PROVIDENCE, R.I. Roman Catholic Bishop Thomas Tobin has banned Rep. Patrick Kennedy from receiving Communion, the central sacrament of the church, in Rhode Island because of the congressman's support for abortion rights, Kennedy said in a newspaper interview published Sunday. The decision by the outspoken prelate, reported on The Providence Journal's Web site, significantly escalates a bitter dispute between Tobin, an ultra orthodox bishop, and Kennedy, a son of the nation's most famous Roman Catholic family. ""The bishop instructed me not to take Communion and said that he has instructed the diocesan priests not to give me Communion,"" Kennedy told the paper in an interview conducted Friday. Kennedy said the bishop had explained the penalty by telling him ""that I am not a good practicing Catholic because of the positions that I've taken as a public official,"" particularly on abortion. Report: Kennedy barred from communion by bishop - Yahoo! News Yes! Now do that with the rest of the Biblically-challenged, spiritually-inept Kennedy family, and all the rest of the pro-abortion Catholic democrats.","christian-cant-support-abortion","07:04 AM","abortion-debates","284"
