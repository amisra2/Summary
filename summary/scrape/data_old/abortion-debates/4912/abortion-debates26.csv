The ancients who engaged in avodah zarah, especially the Canaanites, never worshipped the objects per se but the ideal each object represented: excessive passion, self-indulgence, lust, nature, environment, gluttony, pantheism. One of the most popular and seductive gods was Baal, the Molech god. Molech, a fire god, demanded the sacrifice of a mothers child. It was a fashion of the time, just as is today the sacrifice of ones fetus to Mother feminism: abortion at any time, for any reason, even partial birth abortion. It is the sacrament. It has become the sophisticated mantra of our day that a womans right to her own body constitutes enlightenment."" (Rabbi Spero) So much for the baby killers' claim that they are ""Progressive."" Just like illicit gay sex is regressive back to Sodom and Gomorrah, abortion is regressive behavior that dates back thousands of years to immoral pagan influences.","christian-cant-support-abortion","05:13 PM","abortion-debates","376"

I think its very hard to know what that means, when life begins. Is it when a cell separates? Is it when the soul stirs? So I dont presume to know the answer to that question. (Source: 2008 Democratic Compassion Forum at Messiah College Apr 13, 2008) And in a classic display of Biblical ignorance, Obama said the following during an interview with Pastor Rick Warren at the Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California: whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective, answering that question with specificity, you know, is above my pay grade . Have you never read Psalm 139:13 or Jeremiah 1:5, Mr. President? You're supposed to be a Christian and you don't even know your own Bible. And that after 20 years of sitting in the pew in church. Astonishing! In another egregious exhibition of contempt for the sanctity of life, President Obama remarked: Look, I got two daughters 9 years old and 6 years old, he said. I am going to teach them first about values and morals, but if they make a mistake, I dont want them punished with a baby. I dont want them punished with an STD at age 16, so it doesnt make sense to not give them information. Barack Obama So, not only does Obama consider a precious, unborn baby in the womb as punishment for its mother, but he callously places the baby in the same general category as an STD both punishments. The gist of his remarks makes it quite obvious that its better in Obamas mind to exterminate the innocent baby instead. Its been said before and Ill say it again: You dont kill an innocent unborn baby for the sins or inconvenience of its parents. If they dont want the baby give it up for adoption.
