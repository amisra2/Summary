However, VOR did have somewhat of a personal attack and then said liberals resort to personal attacks...is this hypocritical? Well maybe...he never said personal attacks are that bad although it was implied. I don't know if this is enough to prove someone is a hypocrite however atleast you are providing some evidence now. However, this is the FIRST time you provided some evidence...while at the same time you said that ""because I say so"" arguements are no good. Yet before now you have used ""because I say so"" arguements...THis could be seen as being a hypocrite. The point is, we all can be hypocritical at times without meaning to be. Don't bash on him unless it is very obvious and consistent.","christian-cant-support-abortion","07:18 PM","abortion-debates","121"

Let's get back to whether a Christian can support abortion. First off I would like to say that I don't hink you have to even follow the bible exactly to be a Christian. You have to believe in Jesus and God, right? So if you believe that they created you but didn't write the bible or that they were wrong you can still be a Christian. You want to talk about murder and God? If he really said ""thou shalt not kill (or murder or whatever)"" then what about all the innocent civilians in wars that get killed? They are innocent and were murdered so the people in the military must be against the bible and thus not Christian. God certainly did enough killing or innocents, so he is a hypocrite even if he was just. The commandment says you shouldn't kill. The world's corrupt, let's just kill everyone besides one family, the rest are pure evil and don't deserve to live. Meanwhile today there are serial killers and rapists that are still alive and free. Why doesn't he kill them? I'm not sure but I don't think I know one person who is a woman who's been pregnant and been pro-life. Not saying there aren't, just don't know any.","christian-cant-support-abortion","07:18 PM","abortion-debates","122"

So if you murder 1millino people but believe in God...this wouldnt make you a Christian. and the commandment is thou shall not murder...get it right","christian-cant-support-abortion","07:22 PM","abortion-debates","124"
"04-24-2005","4912",9,"Steeeeve","None","VOR may never well be a hypocrite, however, just stating a link that has no posts on it and making us do a search is not gonna cut it. There is no reason for me to do a search because I am going to assume he is not a hypocrite. YOU are the one calling him out so YOU gotta provide the evidence. Until then, just shut up about him being a hypocrite when you aren't proving it! We have gotten so off topic here","Voice Of Reason","111721","Steeeve, little man just can't stand the truth......Calling my liberal friends Bush haters is not calling them names because its the truth......Liberal like little man hate this president so much that there is nothing he could ever say or do to satisfy them short of him dying.........That is the sad part.........","christian-cant-support-abortion","07:27 PM","abortion-debates","125"
"04-24-2005","4912",9,"None","None","None","Steeeeve","111722","lol, I still don't know if Bush Hater is a personal attack..it is like calling someone a liberal. A personal attack would imply harm wanting to be done by calling someone that. Never the less we will assume it is a personal attack and that one piece of evidence shows he is a hypocrite...My post above still stands though. THis is the first time you have provided evidence thus before these posts it was ""because I said so"" arguements....","christian-cant-support-abortion","07:27 PM","abortion-debates","126"

You've called ME when i specifically noted how Bush hasn't secured this country a Bush Hater. Instead of talking about how to protect this country, you'd rather just insult me.

I am not lazy at all, I went back and found where you called VOR a hypocrite, read the posts, and determined that you had no where proved him to be a hypocrite...you just stated it. You then expect us to believe you that he is a hypocrite by searching threw another forum which most of us aren't members. Not only that, we would have to read every post made by VOR and the context it was in inorder to figure out whether or not he was a hypocrite. This is not gonna happen because you are the one that had to provide the evidence. You now have produced ONE example of him being a hypocrite..however, I have provided one example were YOU are a hypocrite, and in fact, I can provide one example that I am hypocrite if I looked hard enough. So in a way, you are acting the way you claim VOR is acting. So is what VOR doing ok?","christian-cant-support-abortion","07:46 PM","abortion-debates","132"
