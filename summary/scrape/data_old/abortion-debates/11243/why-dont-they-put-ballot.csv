They have the church organizations. In michigan in 2004 they had petition signing sundays in churches, a state wide organization to put marriage on the ballot. So why not do the same with abortion? If these nutcases feel so strongly that abortion should be banned and they have made the case, as in the marriage initiatives, that the will of the people should be heard then why not get their butts in gear and put it to a popular vote? All I have heard from these christianists is that the people should get to vote and that the courts should not over ride the will of the people. If they turly believe that then why not put it on the ballot and let the people be heard? Could it be that, unlike marriage, the majority of people support a womans right to choose?","why-dont-they-put-ballot","02:43 PM","abortion-debates","3"

Similarly, the ongoing kerfuffle about the polygamists in Tejas is a perversion of the text of the First Amendment as it regards the free exercise of religion.

This is simply spelled out, and there isn't much room for legal manoeuvers. Where it's more open to interpretation is in deciding what basic rights are protected by it, and the degree to which it limits government powers over individuals. Government has the power to punish murderers, for example, but it is not so obvious that it can arbitrarily decree that abortion is murder, because there is no consensus over whether a foetus is a victim in the legal sense.

"06-02-2008","11243",5,"chester","312402","Every legal document changes its meaning over time. If you will, take what most people consider to be the start of the ""democratic"" form of government, the Magna Carta. When John signed it a Runnymede, it was a document designed to give the landed barons control over their lands and serfs, yet look at what it has become over 800 years. The actual words of any legal document serve as important starting points, but as starting points only. Then it's up to the judges to decide the meanings of those words in contemporary society. To do otherwise is to condemn the Constitution to a ritualistic formalism. BTW, if the landlord does not take care of a rodent or insect issue in my rental property, I may certainly change the terms of the lease. Do you think the words ""Warrant of habitability"" are forever fixed? Who or what would you have give them meaning?","Steeeeve","312406","So the words had meaning! Good for you. Now the meaning of the document hasn't changed because the only people with an authority to change meaning of what they wrote is the authors of any document. If we were bound by the Magna Carta then that would be the definition we would have to use. It is important to point out that the Magna Carta is not a legal document in our system of government. No, to do so it to give life to what the people adopted...not what 9 unelected elitists say it should be. Again, provide a founding document to support your claim. I've provided many that contradict your claims. The constitution changes meaning by amendments...not by a judge. They are fixed in the meaning of the words when the contract was signed. If you live there 10 years and you decide ""Warrant of habitability"" suddenly means a luxury lifestyle then you would be wrong and any judge would be as well.

If the Constitution were as simple to interpret and apply as you like to pretend, Steve, the courts would be out of business. Thus, for example, once basic rights such as the right to marry the spouse of one's choice, or the right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy, are recognised by a significant public consensus, then the courts act perfectly constitutionally in extending constitutional protections to individuals targeted by a tyrannical government that seeks to impose narrow religious prejudices on people who do not share them.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","07:53 AM","abortion-debates","70"

Where it's more open to interpretation is in deciding what basic rights are protected by it, and the degree to which it limits government powers over individuals.

The anti-federalist papers said this specifically and the federalists said ""no way this will happen..they are the weakest branch"". I guess the joke was on them. It may not always be easy to know what the original meaning of a provision is but you at least need to seek that out. I'm not about to say the 8th amendment is very easily understood but when it comes to the death penalty the 8th amendment clearly doesn't imply (as an example). This is because I search for what was meant by the people that wrote it. What I don't find valid is to have a judge try to discover the meaning from whatever means he/she feels it best (foreign courts, public ""opinion"", etc). There is just no validity nor is there any standard for doing so. I never said it was simple but some things certainly are. This is the same with many professionals.

"06-04-2008","11243",6,"Phyllis","312426","Where you will get disagreement, however, is with the claim that judges may appropriately update, change, etc. the Constitution. Indeed it is clear that the founders wanted a Constitution that could be changed (that was, after all, a flaw of the Articles of Confederation); but they were absolutely clear about how any changes would be made: not by judges, but by the process established in Article V. You pick an interesting example of how the Constitution ""evolved"": slavery. This is interesting because abolishing slavery did not happen as a result of judges' interpretation of Constitutional text, but rather by democratic adoption of a new amendment. Even more interesting, the foothold of slavery was actually exacerbated by the Supreme Court in Dred Scott v. Sanford. This isn't exactly correct. From the ratification of the Constitution, Abortion had always been prohibited after ""quickening"" by the common law. Statutes started to emerge after advances in science led to an increased amount of knowledge regarding the formation of the human being. The result of such knowledge led virtually every existing state to ban abortions before quickening.","lesz","312543","Thank you for your welcome back. As I didn't make precisely this claim, the disagreement doesn't apply to me. I said judges interpreted how far to apply the Constitution, for example, in deciding whether something is a basic right (or not) that is protected against attempts by government to take it away. Sometimes, extremely rarely, judges are ahead of legislative or public opinion, for example, as with Loving v. Virginia, or Griswold v. Connecticut, decisions I have no quarrel with. Usually, they tend to track it more closely, as with Roe v. Wade, where public opinion hasn't shifted much over a generation or two, and was in favour of reducing restrictions in order to save women's lives, and put reproductive decisions more firmly in women's hands. However, never do judges get the final say. Ultimately, that always rests with legislatures, though they have to find supermajorities or jump through various hoops to override judges by constitutional amendments. Of course, and no judicial decision has ever changed the letter of any Constitution, except, I suppose, where such a decision throws out some amendment to a state constitution, as in the case of Romer v. Evans in Colorado. No judge, however, could reject an amendment to the US Constitution. (I would even respectfully suggest that whenever there is a concerted effort to deny rights to people who claim them as basic, then that denial is what needs to be placed into the Constitution, so there can be no argument about it. Courts and judges, being human, will always err, but I'd prefer they err on the side of individual rights, rather than the side of government authoritarianism.) And I would reply that there is more than one way to skin a cat. I agree that judges very rarely get ahead of public or legislative opinion, but I do not think it is some sort of catastrophe when they occasionally do. Governments (including legislatures) are rarely keen to recognise the rights of individuals or limits to their own authority, after all, and the courts are a principal defence against tyranny, especially for voting minorities. In any case, the judicial decision is never final under the US system, it can be reversed (in effect) if enough legislators think it is a bad one. Right, but it wasn't until the 19th century that blanket restrictions started to be passed. Current law is generally in accord with the modern scientific consensus, where abortion is available on demand in the first trimester (before there is a brain with any significant functionality), considerably more restricted in the second (where ambiguity about the functionality of the brain exists), and very difficult to obtain in the third (where there is a chance of foetal survival outside the womb). I'm fairly comfortable with where abortion law stands now, and would neither restrict it further nor expand it. Of course, scientific advances might cause me to change that opinion, but arguments from religious morality are not very likely to.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","06:30 AM","abortion-debates","88"

If the 14th amendment was intended by its author to incorporate the bill of rights and apply earlier amendments to the states, then the 14th amendment went beyond merely guaranteeing those rights that were being denied on the basis of race, to protect, for example, the first amendment rights of freedom of the press and of religion. John Bingham's arguments suggest that the 14th amendment was intended, broadly, to protect all persons from the denial by the states of rights protected under the Bill of Rights. And indeed, proposed language that specifically named race, introduced by Thaddeus Stevens, was removed from the final version of the 14th amendment. So while it's clear to me that the framers of the 14th amendment were primarily concerned with preventing the states from denying rights on the basis of race, it's not clear that they were exclusively intending this.
