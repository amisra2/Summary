They have the church organizations. In michigan in 2004 they had petition signing sundays in churches, a state wide organization to put marriage on the ballot. So why not do the same with abortion? If these nutcases feel so strongly that abortion should be banned and they have made the case, as in the marriage initiatives, that the will of the people should be heard then why not get their butts in gear and put it to a popular vote? All I have heard from these christianists is that the people should get to vote and that the courts should not over ride the will of the people. If they turly believe that then why not put it on the ballot and let the people be heard? Could it be that, unlike marriage, the majority of people support a womans right to choose?","why-dont-they-put-ballot","02:43 PM","abortion-debates","3"

Simple as that. Additionally, prior to 1973, abortion was already settled democratically in most states. And, regardless of whether 99.9% of the people in the US approve of the court's decision in Roe, that decision would still be judicial activism, and as such, would still merit reversal by the Supreme Court.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","05:12 PM","abortion-debates","4"

You really should try to think before you speak; or perhaps you actually did, in which case we should simply conclude that you have no idea what you are talking about. Regardless, any decision that holds that something is in the Constitution, when in fact it really is not, is wrong and merits reversal no matter which judges perpetrate the wrong decision.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","10:47 PM","abortion-debates","6"

After all, the First Amendment says ""Congress shall make NO LAW abridging freedom of the press. BTW, re. Texas v. Johnson: Is a flag burning speech, and where in the Constitution does it say so? I agree with the decision, which simply goes to prove that even a blind Antonin can find a peanut now and then.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","06:34 AM","abortion-debates","8"

So it is with abortion where unborn children have no voice to defend themselves.

For example, expanding voting rights to 5 year olds would certainly expand freedom, but if a judge were to say that the constitution required expanding the vote to 5 year olds, then that would he wrong. I like freedom very much. I also happen to like law and order very much. I simply cannot bring myself to either think or live according to a view that is fundamentally inconsistent and irrational, and which would lead to a republic where a written constitution does not posses any meaning at all.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","08:54 AM","abortion-debates","10"
"05-25-2008","11243",1,"Phyllis","311831","No, we should not presume that. In fact, I support legislation banning the same because the Constitution has never, ever protected obscenity. In fact, its original import was far less protective of certain categories of speech than it even is today.","chester","311837","You can favor banning it all you want; just remember that this is exactly the same type of ""legislating from the bench"" you have decried. Can you spin the words NO LAW in any other manner than NO LAW? And Scalia and Uncle Clarence Thomas call themselves ""Textualists"". Old Nino himself said so on 60 Minutes when Leslie Stahl skewered him but good. HUMBUG!! They write their personal predilections into their opinions just as much as any other Justice. It's just that you like their biases.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","10:50 AM","abortion-debates","12"

You want the people to be able vote on such issues as abortion, and marriage, you want a tryanny of the majority.
