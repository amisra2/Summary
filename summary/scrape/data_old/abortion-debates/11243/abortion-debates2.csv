"05-25-2008","11243",2,"Phyllis","311848","I do like written constitutions very much; and our Constitution is not vague at all. In the First Amendment, the question is not whether congress may make a law, but rather what is ""the freedom of the press?"" This phrase has objective, historic meaning, and obscenity is not covered within that objective, historic meaning. Neither, by the way, is the publishing of nuclear secrets. You have gathered incorrectly, for I do not want a direct democracy. How do you suppose we got ""civil rights"" recognized in the Constitution to begin with, Matthew? Did the words just magically appear there, or did a vast majority of people vote to put them there? Oh yes, that's right, a vast majority of people voted to put them there. Darn evil democracy! I say down with majority rule!","Matthew S","311855","Actually white males in the 1700's made the constitution and the legislatures of the states, more land owning white men, voted on it. Never in the history of the US was the main body of the constitution voted upon by the people.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","05:04 PM","abortion-debates","18"

Whatever else some of the Framers may have been (slaveholders, participants in the slave trade, etc.) they were very careful wordsmiths. When they use a phrase, they knew exactly what they were saying. NO LAW to them meant no law, not a single one, despite the efforts of some to spin it to say otherwise. They might have thought differently, but it's clearly not what they said. Is there a doppelganger on this forum?","why-dont-they-put-ballot","05:43 PM","abortion-debates","19"

Consider further the example of the 19th amendment, which gave women the right to vote. Women, the minority class, could not influence this with their vote at all. And yet the evil majority (comprised only of men) voted (through their popularly elected male representatives) to extend the franchise to women. This is another stunning example that majority rule is nothing but evil. So I say again: down with majority rule!","why-dont-they-put-ballot","06:01 PM","abortion-debates","20"

Some states had religious qualifications, some had property qualifications, some had extensive citizenship qualifications, all had gender restrictions, and of course slaves had no input whatsoever. Probably not more than 25% of any state's residents could vote. The entire Constitution was a very successful laboratory experiment. BTW, can you find anything in Madison's notes to indicate that the Framers even considered the topic of pornography? The infallible will of the people stems directly from Rousseau. Do a search on <Rousseau+General Will> for confirmation.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","07:48 PM","abortion-debates","21"

It is clear from our history that the framers did not merely view faith as compatible with reason, but they also viewed faith as essential to the right use of reason; which is why they placed the basis of rights on its only logical foundation: the Creator.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","10:33 AM","abortion-debates","24"

What's the point?","chester","311933","The point is simply that each and every one of the restrictions on the publication of those things is a perversion of the plain language of the First Amendment. The fact remains that both you and I favor an ongoing reinterpretation of that text; we simply disagree as to which reinterpretations we approve of. Textualism/literalism - whatever we might call it is a sham, and for SCOTUS inJustices like Nino and Uncle Clarence to say otherwise is a bad joke. The words NO LAW remain, however, and any restriction on press, speech, or assembly is a perversion of what the Framers wrote. Similarly, the ongoing kerfuffle about the polygamists in Tejas is a perversion of the text of the First Amendment as it regards the free exercise of religion. We may perhaps both agree that polygamy should be outlawed, but let us at least be honest enough with ourselves and state up front that our opposition runs contrary to the words Free Exercise of the First Amendment.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","12:30 PM","abortion-debates","25"

Remember also, that the ""Creator"" was for a majority of the signers of the Declaration the Great Clockwinder who set the world in motion and then stepped out of the picture - the Deist ""Creator"". the idea of a personal ""God"" who interfered in the affairs of men would have been absurd to many of them. On the other hand, you can search the Constitution which declares itself to be the ""supreme law of the land"" from beginning to end and never once find the word ""God"". In fact, both Article 6 and the First Amendment welcome people of all faiths and no faith into the government, the nation, and the equal protection of the laws.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","12:37 PM","abortion-debates","26"

It's still belief in God, and a truly atheist view can have NO allowance for a creator, 'clockwinder' or not, by definition. By definition you're not tolerant of that sort of God, either . See, by bringing up the deism point you're still (as an atheist) talking about a theist position. If you're a genuine atheist then you can no more truly abide a belief in that god than any other, so it's odd you would even be bringing that up.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","12:52 PM","abortion-debates","27"

Oscar Madison reminded us of what happens when one XXX/u/me/s, although, truth to tell, when I see how some posters here have perverted the word of the Master, atheism is beginning to look better and better. As the late, great Ecumenical Patriarch of the Orthodox Church, Athenagoras. once said, ""There is more trouble with theologians than with theology."" I completely and utterly reject the absurd notion that there is only one true religion. All faiths have a part of the truth; no faith has a monopoly on truth. I am secure in the belief that the next world will be populated by good Christians, good Jews, good Muslims, good Hindus, and good followers of every faith and good people of no faith. who have understood the teaching of the Master when he said that the only things necessary are faith in the Good and good treatment of one's fellow man. I will be there, what about you?","why-dont-they-put-ballot","04:15 PM","abortion-debates","30"
