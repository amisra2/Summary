Who would ever expect anyone to give meaning to nothing? On the other hand, if Bork's premise be true, then it follows logically, the Courts have the right and the duty to interpret what IS there.

"06-01-2008","11243",5,"chester","312252","Exactly so. Glad we agree that the Constitution is what the judges say it is. Glad that we agree that it is the proper role of the judiciary to interpret the words of the Constitution. I knew you would see the light, even if you would prefer to leave the definition of such a simple term as ""NO LAW"" to the judges. That just shows Bork for the genius he really is (even if inadvertently ). Who would ever expect anyone to give meaning to nothing? On the other hand, if Bork's premise be true, then it follows logically, the Courts have the right and the duty to interpret what IS there.","Steeeeve","312390","Of course this isn't what I said. If I tell you to tell me what the 5th word is in a book you aren't deciding what it is...what it is, is already determined...you are just investigating to find that out. Yet this is not what you are proposing. You are suggesting the role of the judiciary is to make up meaning for the words in the constitution. Interpret means to explain...not to make up meaning for. Your 5th grade tactics will not fly on this forum. What you fail to realize is that if words have meaning then they don't change because you want them too. No legal document changes meaning over time. If you rent, the contact to rent can't be ""reinterpreted"" to change the amount of rent you pay just because you feel like changing the meaning of words. The idea of a ""living constitution"" is just insane, unworkable, and contrary to every founding document I've read on the matter. You can't produce one founding document to support the idea that the founders wished for their words to be interpreted differently over the years.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","11:40 PM","abortion-debates","63"

However, the founders also had the wisdom to recognise that values and culture change, and they did not mean for future generations to be tightly bound by their own slave-owning culture where women were second class citizens. The ambit of rights was never specified absolutely in the Constitution, and has evolved considerably over time. We consider things to be rights today that the founders did not. The right to choose to carry a pregnancy to term or not is one of them the founders didn't consider. When you consider that the US and state governments, in common with European governments, did not start banning all abortions till (if I recall) the 19th century, it suggests that government at the time read into the Constitution an authority to control the lives of women it did not, in fact, possess, or at least that had not been explicitly granted by the Constitution. The founders were silent on the matter. That we recognise the limitations to government authority in this sphere today is testimony to our growth as a culture away from the imposition by government of religious dogma.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","06:53 AM","abortion-debates","65"

This is simply spelled out, and there isn't much room for legal manoeuvers. Where it's more open to interpretation is in deciding what basic rights are protected by it, and the degree to which it limits government powers over individuals. Government has the power to punish murderers, for example, but it is not so obvious that it can arbitrarily decree that abortion is murder, because there is no consensus over whether a foetus is a victim in the legal sense. Now, you could write that into the Constitution, as some are trying, but that document is silent on the issue of what a human person actually is -- and as we all know, the society that produced it didn't regard slaves or women as full persons in their own right, neither did it extend full rights to everyone besides male property owners. Such issues were decided subsequently, by legislative actions, court decisions and/or constitutional amendments. Obviously, the Constitution was never intended as a means of specifying every last jot and tittle of what the government can or cannot do. The founders weren't XXXXXX. This is up to courts and legislatures, and ultimately, the voters themselves, to decide. Instead, it sets up a broad framework of relationships within which each generation gets to act out its specific problems and issues. Folk like Steve like to put on a show of being ""strict constructionists"" and call every court decision they dislike ""activist"". Court decisions they like can be as active as all hell, but they never object to judicial activism when it finds in their favour. For the Steves of the world, ""activism"" = ""I don't like it!"" The fact is, the Constitution isn't designed to resolve questions of basic human rights -- that is a proper function for other human institutions. It's there to protect individuals from excessive government power, and how that is done is up to the courts and legislatures to decide.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","07:46 AM","abortion-debates","68"

Now the meaning of the document hasn't changed because the only people with an authority to change meaning of what they wrote is the authors of any document. If we were bound by the Magna Carta then that would be the definition we would have to use. It is important to point out that the Magna Carta is not a legal document in our system of government. No, to do so it to give life to what the people adopted...not what 9 unelected elitists say it should be. Again, provide a founding document to support your claim. I've provided many that contradict your claims. The constitution changes meaning by amendments...not by a judge. They are fixed in the meaning of the words when the contract was signed. If you live there 10 years and you decide ""Warrant of habitability"" suddenly means a luxury lifestyle then you would be wrong and any judge would be as well. There is no need to discuss the differences betweens contract law and statutory law. We are strictly dealing with statutory law.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","07:53 AM","abortion-debates","69"

Thus, for example, once basic rights such as the right to marry the spouse of one's choice, or the right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy, are recognised by a significant public consensus, then the courts act perfectly constitutionally in extending constitutional protections to individuals targeted by a tyrannical government that seeks to impose narrow religious prejudices on people who do not share them.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","07:53 AM","abortion-debates","70"

You assume the person or persons that wrote and adopted an amendment had no idea what its meaning was. They obviously did. To say it is open ended is to imply you can give whatever meaning you want to it. Words have meaning and if you decide a judge can make up there meaning then the top power is not with the people but with the judges. The anti-federalist papers said this specifically and the federalists said ""no way this will happen..they are the weakest branch"". I guess the joke was on them. It may not always be easy to know what the original meaning of a provision is but you at least need to seek that out. I'm not about to say the 8th amendment is very easily understood but when it comes to the death penalty the 8th amendment clearly doesn't imply (as an example). This is because I search for what was meant by the people that wrote it. What I don't find valid is to have a judge try to discover the meaning from whatever means he/she feels it best (foreign courts, public ""opinion"", etc). There is just no validity nor is there any standard for doing so. I never said it was simple but some things certainly are. This is the same with many professionals. For example, accounting is not that hard but when you are trained in it then it is much easier to figure out the answer. So the courts should rule based on public opinion polls? This is just ignorant and way contrary to what any founding document says.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","08:06 AM","abortion-debates","72"

The courts were to be the brake on the temporary runaway passions of the electorate. To suggest otherwise to to assert that the Constitution is built on the ideas of Rousseau and not Locke. Speaking of the 8th Amendment, when it was written, branding and lopping off an ear were common punishments for crimes. Are we to be bound by that, or do you think Mr. Justice Lewis Powell was correct when he wrote about ""evolving standards of decency.""? Would you really want to be bound by what the 18th Century thought constituted ""cruel and unusual punishment""?","why-dont-they-put-ballot","10:16 AM","abortion-debates","73"
