So do you think that a fetus only feels pain at the point of birth or at some point before? Youre as slippery as a greased piglet.lol","crime-abortion-relation","01:09 PM","abortion-debates","49"
"10-16-2011","13829",4,"simone","440856","And, I'm going to give a tip of the hat to TheOlDog whom I assume is a responsible, caring, unshiftless male person who doesn't stand around flapping his mouth about other people's personal business. There are men like that. The ones who don't ceaselessly yammer and yell about other people, instead they quietly take care of their responsibilities and keep society decent and functional.","theolddog","440885","Thanks, Simone! I have three daughters and one granddaughter of child bearing age. Yes, I'm that old a dog! All of them have been raised with the idea that they know what is in their best interests, and they all are thriving. I wonder if any of the profetallifers who post here would dare to tell any of them that either they or the government are better able to determine the future of their pregnancies than they themselves are. I know that each of my wonderful women would show them the door - QUICKLY!","crime-abortion-relation","01:42 PM","abortion-debates","50"

Would your wonderful women agree that a fetus should be painfully ripped from the womb if it were that they did actually did feel pain? Maybe you are not man enough to ask the question because you sure as hell are avoiding it here. No wonder Simone likes you","crime-abortion-relation","02:19 PM","abortion-debates","51"

You speak from the perspective that it is some personal choice about one's own body. If that were agreed upon there would be no conflict, but it's not.

Just asking.","gansao","440907","Do you honestly think that a question of whether a fetus can be capable of feeling pain is a metaphysical question? Just asking. Pointing out your moral cowardice is not ad hominem when your moral cowardice is the driving point behind your assertion that because you cannot have an opinion on whether your 'wonderful women' can abort a sentient fetus so therefore no one can have an opinion on the matter on abortion except the pregnant woman. I also think that a cry of ad hominem is pretty rich coming from you considering you made this comment about me... '3. YOU claim that the prohibition gains abortion is or should be a universal, and that corresponds to YOUR values when others disagree who are just as moral and ethical as you. Ideologues more often than not believe that their word is law in the universe.'","crime-abortion-relation","04:20 PM","abortion-debates","58"

I shall not respond to any more of your comments. Mine speak for themselves. I believe that the government has no business regulating abortion or marriage between persons of the same gender in any way, shape, or form. If someone opposes abortion, let them not have one; if a person opposes same gender marriage, then by all means let that person marry someone of the opposite gender. Thanks for the attempt at dialog; sorry it could not be reasonable.","crime-abortion-relation","05:57 PM","abortion-debates","59"
