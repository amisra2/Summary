Pointing out your moral cowardice is not ad hominem when your moral cowardice is the driving point behind your assertion that because you cannot have an opinion on whether your 'wonderful women' can abort a sentient fetus so therefore no one can have an opinion on the matter on abortion except the pregnant woman. I also think that a cry of ad hominem is pretty rich coming from you considering you made this comment about me... '3. YOU claim that the prohibition gains abortion is or should be a universal, and that corresponds to YOUR values when others disagree who are just as moral and ethical as you. Ideologues more often than not believe that their word is law in the universe.' At a time when many developing nations are making strides in reducing pregnancy-related deaths, the maternal mortality rate in the United States increased from 12 deaths to 17 deaths per 100,000 live births from 1980 through 2008. .... Globally, the yearly rate of decline in maternal mortality was 1.3%, but Maldives, located in the Indian Ocean, decreased its maternal mortality rate by 8.8% from 1990 through 2008. Other nations that posted impressive improvements included Egypt, China, Ecuador, and Bolivia.","simone","440922","You are obsessed with whether or not a fetus experiences pain to the point where you don't give a damn about the following: Medical News: Study Reveals Increase in Maternal Death Rate in U.S. - in OB/Gyn, Pregnancy from MedPage Today In many cases women who die of pregnancy-related causes leave behind vulnerable young children who desperately need a mother, a primary caretaker to look after and nurture them. But motherless children are meaningless to heartless people who whine and moan about fetuses feeling pain.","crime-abortion-relation","07:34 PM","abortion-debates","61"

I have repeated asked you to answer whether you believe that a fetus can feel pain but you have repeatedly avoided the question..even to the point of telling me I think that I am Ronald Reagan for asking it . At that point I conceded that you are slightly mad The potential for fetal suffering is ONE factor in the abortion debate. There are others including the health and potential suffering of the pregnant woman. No matter how much you and the XXXXX whipped Olddog insist that any pregnant woman should be able to terminate a pregnancy at any time and for any reason there is the ethical question that your desperately keep avoiding (even by feigning madness). That is at what point do we consider the suffering of the fetus during termination as a factor as to whether the termination should take place. Your problem is that once you concede that a fetus can be sentient your argument that woman should have total control over the decision to terminate a pregnancy fails...thats why you and the dog avoids the question. Fortunately others who are wiser and braver than you have considered this. There is some agreement that the fetus should not be aborted after 24 weeks. Some believe this should cut off point should be at 20 weeks. I agree with this .I do not believe a sentient fetus should be torn apart unless there is a very good reason. Dont give me more BS about women having control over their own bodies. Once the fetus becomes sentient( and it does) then there are 2 bodies to consider not one.","crime-abortion-relation","06:20 AM","abortion-debates","63"

If you pour CO2 into a babies room while their sleeping they probably won't feel anything. Biologically the fetus is an individual human organism from conception, I don't think it's about consciousness or awareness because a newborn probably isn't aware of much, it's all really conjecture what they understand, and none of us remember. It's the principle, not whether the organism is sentient at that exact moment, but whether it as a category (species) is sentient. A sleeping person doesn't lose their rights because they can't pass the mirror test unconscious.","crime-abortion-relation","07:13 AM","abortion-debates","64"

"10-20-2011","13829",5,"simone","441152","Soooo, what exactly do the terms ""objectivism"" and ""subjectivism"" mean?","Freedom","441165","Subjective - 1.existing in the mind; belonging to the thinking subject rather than to the objectof thought (opposed to objective). 2.pertaining to or characteristic of an individual; personal; individual: a subjective evaluation. 3.placing excessive emphasis on one's own moods, attitudes, opinions, etc.; unduly egocentric. 4.Philosophy. relating to or of the natureof an object as it is known in the mind as distinct from a thing in itself. 5.relating to properties or specific conditions of the mind as distinguished from general or universal experience. It is the nice way to describe bias, it is what xcaliber infers when he says things like 'that is just your opinion'. It is what people allude to when they say things like ""says you"", ""who says?"", ""According to you"" etc... A subjective truth is an oxymoron, a subjective statement cannot be argued or debated, it is irrational. The existence of a subjective belief does not negate any truth, but the statement must be modified to become objective. This often confuses people. For instance: 1. Icecream is tasty <- subjective 2. Joe thinks icecream is tasty <- objective 3. Most people who try icecream think icecream is tasty <- objective 4. Everyone thinks icecream is tasty <- also possibly objective When people say things like 'ice cream is tasty' they ussualy mean 3. Objective means the opposite, independant and unhindered by the subject; his/her emotions, biases, illogic etc... All truth is objective, which is to say a fact of reality and not a perception alone. Our perceptions are 'correct' when they are objective, only when they are identical to the facts are they the facts. Where you could not say ice cream was tasty, you can say the speed of light is some finite value +- some error, you can say the planet most closely resembles a sphere of all the basic geometric shapes etc... Science is the essense of objectivism, it is completly founded on the search for truth about a reality that is common to all due to it's singularity. When gansao said he couldn't do it without subjectivism, he means that all he can really do is point out that some people have disagreed. An objective counter-argument would make claims about what IS not what some PERCEIVE TO BE . On a last note, definition is crucial in the communication of objective concepts as to reflect a common reality terms must have common meaning. The proof of any statement objectively will rely heavily on definitions and as such they will be ultimately circular, this does not reflect circular logic or the unreality of the component concepts but the nature of cognition and the inability to transmit pure thought.","crime-abortion-relation","04:36 PM","abortion-debates","71"
"10-21-2011","13829",5,"gansao","441160","Objectivists call a spade a spade. Subjectivists say it depends what you mean by a spade At a sales conference at Random House, preceding the publication of Atlas Shrugged, one of the book salesmen asked me whether I could present the essence of my philosophy while standing on one foot. I did as follows: Metaphysics Objective Reality Epistemology Reason Ethics Self-interest Politics Capitalism If you want this translated into simple language, it would read: 1. Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed or Wishing wont make it so. 2. You cant eat your cake and have it, too. 3. Man is an end in himself. 4. Give me liberty or give me death. If you held these concepts with total consistency, as the base of your convictions, you would have a full philosophical system to guide the course of your life. But to hold them with total consistencyto understand, to define, to prove and to apply themrequires volumes of thought. Which is why philosophy cannot be discussed while standing on one footnor while standing on two feet on both sides of every fence. This last is the predominant philosophical position today, particularly in the field of politics.","simone","441255","Piffle!

Objective reality is how things really are. Fine, but how do we know if we can see things the way they really are if our perceptions are filtered through inner mental frameworks shaped by past conditioning. Can we truly overcome our ""past conditioning"" to perceive ""how things really are""? And, the riddle of ""Nature to be commanded must be obeyed."" What the hell does that mean?

The idea of sensation -> knowledge is faulty, no one can gain knowledge through sensation; there must be a method of translation. The method of translation is reason, no perception is truly automatic, no knowledge a given; it is all the product of conceptual connections and thought. The only question that remains is whether those connections, that thought is consciously rational or left to the subconscious, to be influenced by bias and emotion. Why is reason objective? Simply put it's a mechanistic process which does not incorporate polluting factors because it's function can be precisely defined and it can be clearly observed that it does not. Reason as one's epistemology however a complete and closed set, much like faith. Outside of it, it cannot be supported because support requires reason. While reality is the ultimate judge of truth, the only correlation between reality and truth is that of logic. This is why someone with faith can happily survive every contradiction even one of facts vs belief for contradiction is itself based on logic and if one denies logic it holds no threat. Easily, it is not a matter of will; but a matter of understanding. Faith(formalized bias/subjectivism) may feel like a mountain to those infected by it; but in reality it can be cast aside like a feather but one must 'trust' that existence exists, which is to imply that there is a real world, which implies a truth independent of your 'past conditioning', which implies perception free of that. If I were to argue for objectivism to a complete mystic it would be impossible, but in this day and age no one is completely without some belief in logic. Many even call on science, which makes it extremely easy to make the case to them; either that or they start getting mystical on you. It's synonymous with reality in this context.","crime-abortion-relation","06:51 PM","abortion-debates","74"
