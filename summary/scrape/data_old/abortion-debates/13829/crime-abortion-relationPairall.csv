"10-14-2011",1,"13829","16","gansao","440737","When does a fetus become a 'person'?","theolddog","440745","The answer to that question depends very much upon which system of belief, ethics, and morals one subscribes to. For most Jews, it is at crowning during the process of birth. For the RC sect of Christians, it is at conception. Other Christian sects place it at different points along that continuum. This leads inexorably to the conclusion that there is NO one ""right"" answer. as a result, the proper course for the law is to remain silent and to leave the choice where it properly belongs - with each pregnant woman.","crime-abortion-relation","09:28 PM","abortion-debates","105"

You assert that a sentient fetus that can feel pain and stress should be painfully destroyed if the pregnant mother decides that what she wants? I am not anti abortion but I am against aborting a fetus that would suffer during a termination.","crime-abortion-relation","05:57 AM","abortion-debates","62"

Exactly so, since the choice of whether or not to accept the hypothesis that a fetus is sentient is very much a mater of discussion among those with the knowledge that gives their opinions weight.. 2. I believe in the strength of each woman's intellect that she is capable of choosing what is in her best interest, and her best interest is controlling. 3. YOU claim that the prohibition gains abortion is or should be a universal, and that corresponds to YOUR values when others disagree who are just as moral and ethical as you. Ideologues more often than not believe that their word is law in the universe.","crime-abortion-relation","06:12 PM","abortion-debates","120"

If the fetus is developed enough to suffer( and therefore sentient) it should be considered an individual and it should be very carefully considered before performing an abortion. You are the one claiming universal idealogies can you not read what you write? You are claiming that in every pregnancy from conception to term the pregnant woman should have the right to terminate the pregnancy for whatever reason she sees fit..if you do not understand that to be a universal idealogy to fit YOUR values then you really do not understand your own assertions","crime-abortion-relation","07:57 AM","abortion-debates","176"
