For most Jews, it is at crowning during the process of birth. For the RC sect of Christians, it is at conception. Other Christian sects place it at different points along that continuum. This leads inexorably to the conclusion that there is NO one ""right"" answer. as a result, the proper course for the law is to remain silent and to leave the choice where it properly belongs - with each pregnant woman.","crime-abortion-relation","09:28 PM","abortion-debates","16"
"10-15-2011","13829",2,"theolddog","440732","And just exactly WHY should one particular religious faith determine the civil law? We are a multireligious nation, and there are others who are of NO religious faith. Why should their values and behavior be dictated by something they do not accept as Gospel (Meaning intended!)P","Easyrider","440749","You mean an unborn baby is not a human being? What were you? As far as religion goes, this country wasn't founded on Buddhism or atheism, nor are the majority of Americans today anything other than Christians. We have just as much right to lobby for what we believe is right as do the imbeciles at the Wall Street demonstrations. Don't kill the innocent unborn for the sins or convenience of the parents.","crime-abortion-relation","12:12 AM","abortion-debates","17"

"10-15-2011","13829",2,"Yerominia","440644","Abortion is a crime .. it is like killing a human being and it should be considered equivalent to that..","jcsites","440759","I definitely agree with you, and since when that abortion is the solution to an increasing crime rate. It is a crime committed just before a human being is born. Taking the life of an unborn child is the greatest crime than to put a criminal to prison.","crime-abortion-relation","03:01 AM","abortion-debates","19"

The subject is not about the fetus holders( we cannot say mother because the pregnant woman is not..by your definition..a mother) personal risk. If you are saying that only the people involved in a situation should have control of the situation you are opening a rather large can of worms. You may believe that a woman can deliberately destroy a sentient potential human but others may disagree. As a young nurse, Nadine witnessed the horror of late abortions.

Exactly so, since the choice of whether or not to accept the hypothesis that a fetus is sentient is very much a mater of discussion among those with the knowledge that gives their opinions weight.. 2. I believe in the strength of each woman's intellect that she is capable of choosing what is in her best interest, and her best interest is controlling. 3. YOU claim that the prohibition gains abortion is or should be a universal, and that corresponds to YOUR values when others disagree who are just as moral and ethical as you.
