It is a guilty as the rapist and should not be allowed a chance of life. We should make sure the fetus becomes sentient and rip it to bits in the womb...it deserves no more. Bitterness and cruelty becomes you","gift-god","02:09 PM","abortion-debates","2"

Maybe God is a psychopath then. There are indications that psychopathy may be genetic, so when a psychopath rapes he is passing along his psychopathic genes. Are these genes a gift of God? Should a woman be forced to bear a psychopathic child who will go out and rape and murder? Is that the will of God? Men who commit incest are psychopaths. Priests who take advantage of children and molest them are psychopaths. Pope Benedict XVI who claims to speak for God has protected psychopathic priests who rape. Maybe God is a psychopath.","Easyrider","452009","Make sure you liberal psychopaths kill as many innocent unborn babies as you can before you die.

This is murder on a massive scale, matched only by the death count of World War II. America is committing national/racial suicide. It must stop! The Supreme Court must overturn its Roe v. Wade ruling. Conservatives John Roberts and Sam Alito are members of the Court. An Abortion Amendment needs to be introduced in Congress to make abortion unconstitutional.","gift-god","01:27 PM","abortion-debates","5"

Late term abortions need to have a really good reason to occur, not because the mother couldn't make up her mind or is having a bad day. I do believe that given the reality of what having a child means to both the young or unwed or both or even old and married or any combination that it isn't the place of some unknown idealists who feel their views are proper for everyone else in every set of circumstances. If you don't believe in abortion then don't have one. Be happy that we are far more compassionate that God when determining what a grounds for abortion and the methods used in its implementation. The fact of the matter is of those 50 million roughly half would be unable to pay taxes due to physical or economic reasons, examples causing this range from physical disabilities and incarceration to poverty and lack of education. 3 of the 4 mentioned are prevalent among young unwed mothers, followed closely by unwed or single mothers. Many conservatives yell that a women cannot have an abortion, while at the same time yelling that social programs that are in place to help mothers deal with the problems having a child creates are unfair and the recipients undeserving. It seems only fair that if you are going to make her have the baby that you should help pay for it. Otherwise make it your business when it involves you. You can also think in terms of self survival, how many of those 50 million do you think would have become Christian and how many atheist or something non-christian? Just a reminder the Bible has rules about when an abortion can occur and God has no problem with it being done up until the day the child is born.","gift-god","11:15 AM","abortion-debates","7"

Christian doctrine is used as a basis for the no exception position on abortion, but the bible permits the murder of the fetus without regard for the stage of pregnancy. The choice does not belong to the woman, but her husband and he is without blame no matter the outcome. He is not required to have any evidence nor is he limited to how often he may require his wife to submit to the procedure. Given the conditions under which an abortion can be performed under current law why is it your perceived right to determine something as personal as the decision to keep a pregnancy, while at the same time vehemently opposed to education that helps deter pregnancy, contraception which does the same and financial aid for those that follow your desires. You just make no sense.","gift-god","02:17 AM","abortion-debates","13"

It's not something a woman can take on a day to day basis to get rid of a baby she might not want. God doesn't provide for that. I know you wish he did, but he doesn't. And for the record, that which a lot of modern-day abortionists might want to get rid of are God's special creations. Exodus 4:11 - The LORD said to him, ""Who gave man his mouth? Who makes him deaf or mute? Who gives him sight or makes him blind? Is it not I, the LORD?","gift-god","08:43 PM","abortion-debates","14"
