I busted the logic of his post when I posted this: Are you talking about the same woman who was so irresponsible that she got knocked up and who now wants to kill her innocent baby? That woman?","gift-god","10:10 PM","abortion-debates","31"

He totality freaked out and made a spectacle of himself it was pathetic. Hes very easy to fool.","Easyrider","473102","Yeah, well why don't you show me the post where I supposedly made a pathetic spectacle out of myself on that, you lying imbecile? I believe at least one other person mentioned you were banned also. By the way, that whole episode just proved what a lying snake you are.","gift-god","10:13 PM","abortion-debates","32"

So what he were a Cristian too. I was just trying to help you understand that most of what you think is wrong.","gift-god","06:55 AM","abortion-debates","33"

"05-10-2013","16277",3,"Accipiter","473116","No thats not it, I dont have to prove it....","Easyrider","473132","Yeah, you do. Because you are a proven liar, and an imbecile.","gift-god","03:29 PM","abortion-debates","36"

That woman?","pappillion001","473159","Is every unwanted pregnancy due to an irresponsible woman or girl? We can go round and round but she is not killing a baby, she is not killing a legal person, but why do you think making an irresponsible person a parent is the best course of action?","gift-god","02:14 AM","abortion-debates","38"

Women who are irresponsible by getting knocked up and then wanting to kill their innocent baby shouldn't be characterized as someone who ""Knows better than you on what to do with their body / baby."" And they can always put the baby up for adoption.","gift-god","09:40 AM","abortion-debates","39"

Take your book of hillbilly theology and put it next to the toilet if you want it to be useful.","gift-god","10:52 AM","abortion-debates","40"

Even if she were irresponsible she still has a better idea concerning her life than you ever will. So what about the women that were not irresponsible? The ones that used birth control, the ones who were forced, the 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 year old girls or are they all irresponsible as well? Do you permit abortion in cases were the mother's life is at risk? What about if the baby is deformed or has genetic flaws or addicted to drugs? Adoption? There you go have her go thru pregnancy to for what? To satisfy your inconsistent morals? As a soldier you were trained to kill, criminals face capital punishment, reproductive methods typically place several fertile eggs hoping at least one will survive. All these are considered from necessary to praised, but what makes them so different?","gift-god","09:23 PM","abortion-debates","43"

It's the baby's life that we're trying to save. The fact that the mother wants it killed is just more evidence she's a morally-deranged, irresponsible woman. You don't kill the innocent baby. Period.","gift-god","11:19 AM","abortion-debates","45"
