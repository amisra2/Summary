And I'll bet America could have used a few more teachers, scientists, and even preachers so as to save a bunch of knot-heads from going to Hell.","Winston Smith","458201","So what you are saying is that it is OK to abort ""liberal"" Democrat voting babies but not Republican fetuses? If you could tell which baby would grow to become a Democrat voter and which not, would you abort the ""I vote for Obama"" fetuses ??","gift-god","06:58 AM","abortion-debates","16"

"07-06-2012","16277",2,"Easyrider","458186","Once again, the passage you refer to incorporates a test for adultery and a possible judgment. It's not something a woman can take on a day to day basis to get rid of a baby she might not want. God doesn't provide for that. I know you wish he did, but he doesn't. And for the record, that which a lot of modern-day abortionists might want to get rid of are God's special creations. Exodus 4:11 - The LORD said to him, ""Who gave man his mouth? Who makes him deaf or mute? Who gives him sight or makes him blind? Is it not I, the LORD?","pappillion001","458512","The husband can decide any time he wants to for any reason. I don't agree it should be used as a form of birth control, but I also don't think it's a choice I should make for somebody else. Women do not have to have an abortion, but they will know what is best for them, not you. No it is not God who makes people. People make people. I am sure the deaf, mute and blind people are thankful for God's blessing. How does that fit into being God's special creation?","gift-god","10:46 AM","abortion-debates","18"

Some women will decide yes and some no, why do you think you have the right to make that choice for them? Exactly what spirit is that? The one that there is no scientific evidence it exists? But let us say ok it does, where does it come from? Heaven? If so what are we doing in these temporary bodies spending all our time trying to go back from where we came from? Why were sent away? You are making less and less sense.","gift-god","05:47 PM","abortion-debates","20"

They should have known better than to believe them but they had been lied to all their lives and didn't how to tell lies from truth.
