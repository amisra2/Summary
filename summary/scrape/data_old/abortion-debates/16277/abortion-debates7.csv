A similar percentage to that of homo-sapien homo-sexuality....","Easyrider","474825","Doesn't matter. A lot of heterosexuals have a proclivity to fornicate and commit adultery, but unrepentant fornicators and adulterers will wind up in Hell too (1 Corinthians 6:9-10), along with unrepentant gay sex sinners. Gay sex is a deliberate act / sin.","gift-god","01:59 PM","abortion-debates","91"

Our actions, words, deeds are not always good. And our standard of good is completely different than God's is. Just because someone does something evil...does not mean their family also is evil. We should take responsibility for our own actions. The rapist is evil...rape is a violent act. But is the newly started human life in the womb evil? What did that life do to deserve the evil thing done to it...in this case rape. If you walked into a room full of babies and someone said ones mother had been raped...could you pick out that baby? Would it look different...would it have less of a right to live? Life is life...and a humans life starts at conception. It has all it needs to form into a human being. Although it grows in its mothers womb...it is not a part of her...as it has its own organs...DNS, fingerprints, etc.","gift-god","06:13 PM","abortion-debates","98"
