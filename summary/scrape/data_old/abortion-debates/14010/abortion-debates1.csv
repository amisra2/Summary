I think that you should go back and reread the original post because what you have suggested is not what I wrote. 2. Don't be an angry elf. 3. Of course it wouldn't have anything to do with the validity of the argument. But, in determining why someone may be predisposed toward a certain position...I think it might play a large role. It would certainly be an interesting cross sectional study to look at the incidence. I would think it would be very difficult for someone who has had an abortion, fathered an aborted child, or is very close to someone that has to step back from that experience and look at the arguments in an unbiased way. Furthermore, if they did for a split second see validity in the pro-life argument it would be such a difficult conclusion to come to because of the potential heavy emotional and psychological repercussions to deal with.","pro-choice-roots","11:54 PM","abortion-debates","5"

I am sorry to say, I experienced absolutely no regrets over the abortions because the pregnancies were not intended and an additional child would have had a negative effect upon my family.","pro-choice-roots","11:59 AM","abortion-debates","6"
"03-10-2010","14010",1,"None","None","None","simone","394041","Also, it is interesting to note that at the point in my life when one of the spontaneous abortions occurred, one of my friends told me all about the son she never wanted to have, how she had even thrown herself down a stairway in order to cause an abortion, the pregnancy survived -- frankly, it must have been enormously miserable for her son to have a mother like that. I rather think this woman should never have had kids, but it was back in a time when women had no choice about that, especially if rude religion butted into private affairs.","pro-choice-roots","12:03 PM","abortion-debates","7"

Whether it is or isn't true, it is completely irrelevant. Again, this has absolutely nothing to do with the validity of anyone's arguments. I'm glad you understand that, but when we start to introduce all of this speculation it distracts us from the valid points being made. I don't go around asking pro-lifers ""have you ever been raped? Do you know what its like to carry a rapist's child inside of you?"" for the exact same reason. These types of arguments are fallacies that distract us from the debate. If you want to make a point to support your position then make it, but don't sit there and try use our own experiences or lack thereof against us, because that is a fallacy.","pro-choice-roots","07:02 PM","abortion-debates","8"

I personally know three women who have had abortions. In my opinion, one definately made the correct choice, one did not, and one abuses the procedure and disgusts me. However, I was well established in my opinion of being pro-choice before any of them had an abortion. As to why I am pro-choice - - - I was taught to be. My grandmother raised 11 kids in a one room shack with an abusive husband who wouldn't work during a time she could not get birth control without his permission (which he would not grant), spousal rape was legal (she could not say ""no""), and divorce was unheard of. Once my grandfather died she VOLUNTEERED in a woman's health clinic that, in addition to many types of services, offered abortion. My mother had a very difficult third pregnancy, was in her 30s and decided she wanted no more children. She could not get her tubes tied without my father's consent, something he only granted after her sympathetic doctor lied to him about the health risks of further pregnancies to her. This same man walked out on his children ten years later. My body and all choices regarding it are MINE and mine alone. Without exception. These stories are part of why Easy's canned and callous ""All pro-choicers have one thing in common, they're mothers chose life"" comment enfuriates. He neglects to realize that until very recently women had little to no choice in reproductive matters at all - especially those that were married. But rest assured, I have had no abortion and have taken all needed precautions. (Am single, celibate, ""fixed"", and would just as soon throw myself off a tall cliff as clutter my life up with some fella.)","pro-choice-roots","09:21 AM","abortion-debates","9"

Where's the baby's choice? Why don't you self-absorbed egomaniacs ever think about the innocent baby that's being butchered? You don't kill an innocent baby for the sins or convenience of the parent(s). I think every time some woman aborts her baby she needs to not only view the remains of the dismembered baby she just had murdered, but then she needs to clean up the bloody abortionist's sink. Now, what does the Bible say? Psalm 139:13 - 'For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb.' Jeremiah 1:5 - 'Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations."" Of course, the question is, what divine insight does the pro-abortion crowd think they have to where they can destroy in a mother's womb that which God is somehow instrumental in creating? Choose life. Your mothers did.","pro-choice-roots","06:16 AM","abortion-debates","10"
