Jeremiah 1:5 - 'Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations."" Of course, the question is, what divine insight does the pro-abortion crowd think they have to where they can destroy in a mother's womb that which God is somehow instrumental in creating?","chester","396290","If so you believe, then so you must act, within your own family. What you need to remember is that not all Americans share your answer to what is at best a metaphysical question. Please let us know why you think your particular answer should be law in the universe? In the interim, keep your poison away from the women in my family who are of child bearing age. They are perfectly capable of making their own choices without your ""advice.""","pro-choice-roots","01:52 AM","abortion-debates","91"

We don't butcher the unborn. Nor do most of Americans share yours. See my Biblical references above. Go climb on a parking meter, dweeb.

If you want one of those, Iran might just be to your liking. 2. This Springsteen-American is staying right where he is, thank you very much.

You don't have to live in a theocracy to know murding the innocent unborn is wrong. Actually, Iran might be more to your liking since they don't value life very much either. Fly your flag, but don't think for a moment that the God who brought this nation forth approves of the mass infanticide of the innocent unborn. Godly women don't kill their unborn. They nurture them. As for poision, you're the ones who advocate death and infanticide, not me.","pro-choice-roots","06:07 PM","abortion-debates","117"

Why don't you self-absorbed egomaniacs ever think about the innocent baby that's being butchered? You don't kill an innocent baby for the sins or convenience of the parent(s). I think every time some woman aborts her baby she needs to not only view the remains of the dismembered baby she just had murdered, but then she needs to clean up the bloody abortionist's sink.","Shooterandproud","394439","Adolf Hitler was making choices about the bodies of others, kind of like what you are doing. Let this be a testament to your ignorance, that you would read the above post by Jito and still have the nerve to say something as stupid as this. Did you not hear a thing she said?
