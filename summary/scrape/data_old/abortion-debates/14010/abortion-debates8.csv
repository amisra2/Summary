"03-28-2010","14010",8,"Archangel","396274","I realize this is a waste of time since you will most likely never appreciate the truth we share with you, But the New Testament is a record of current events which was recorded by contemporaries who witnessed the events they share in it. And since Jesus is and was accepted as God in the flesh, when He referred to and testified to Adam and the Prophets who were killed by Israel throughout her history, we accept that testimony as further evidence that the bible is as accurate as we already know it to be through the personal revelation we receive from the Holy Spirit who convicts us of its truth. I wish there was someway to convince you of the truth we know, but alas, life is an individual journey and only God alone can reveal Himself to you based on the sincerity of your desire to know Him. Because of ""free will"" He will never force Himself on any of us. Only through our sincere desire and hunger to know Him will He reveal Himself to us individually. So don't ask us to prove God exists, ask God to reveal Himself to you and all you must do is believe that IF God exists, He is able to do that and He will do the rest.","Shooterandproud","396279","Wow, you're actually being rational and making a little bit of sense. Yes, some parts of the bible are true, and Jesus did exist. But there are parts of the bible that are not true. The earth was not created 6,000 years ago. Snakes never talked, or had legs. You're making the fatal assumption that because small parts of the bible are true, the whole thing is true. Been there. I've thought and thought and thought about how the universe came to be, about a higher power, etc, and no ""God"" revealed them self to me. I suspect this was because I am not looking to accept any God, I am looking for the truth. Humans contemplating what happens after death and the afterlife is like a goldfish contemplating nuclear physics. No matter how much we try to know or we think we know, our small brains do not have the capacity to contemplate such things.","pro-choice-roots","09:28 PM","abortion-debates","106"

You fail to appreciate that we all live by faith in our respective world views, and you can't prove yours absolutely anymore than I can prove mine.

There is proof that most of the stuff didn't happen. Unless God did a hell of a clean up job, a literal flood would've left some serious evidence (besides the Grand Canyon). I don't know if the big bang actually happened, and I have no recollection of ever saying the big bang was true. But, there is evidence that suggests the Bing Bang did happen, but there is NO evidence that suggests the world was created in spontaneously in 7 days. That's true, which is why I don't buy into it. Faith shouldn't be a punishment-reward type of thing. The ""heaven"" and ""hell"" philosophy is undeniable proof that much of your religion came from the ""shallow imaginings of man"". Punishment and rewards are flawed concepts created by flawed humans. There is no way in hell that a loving, omnipotent God would use a concept that is both flawed and human in nature. I would be a lot more sympathetic to your religion had it not created a place like hell, where all the ""bad people"" go. It doesn't matter who you are. Using fear as a means of control is not right, and not like a loving God. Throw Hell and believing literally in the bible out the window, and I could actually see myself as somewhat of a Christian.","pro-choice-roots","10:24 PM","abortion-debates","109"

If you can't that's your key to understanding the truth you already got. You have no idea how pertinent that is. The resurrection is the crux of Christianity. Jesus said he would raise himself from the dead (""Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it again."" He was speaking of the temple of his body). If Christ can do that, and if he is risen, then what he says, and the premise of Christianity, are solid. That would include Jesus' statements on Genesis, what the prophets prophesied, etc. But it looks like you can't bust the resurrection, so you're weak. If it were such a sham you, WITH YOUR BRILLIANT MIND, should be able to bust it in a heartbeat. But you can't, can you? Also, did you answer Archangel's question about where in the Bible it says the world is 6,000 years old? That's another hairbrained argument you people buy into because you haven't done your due-diligence and studied the issue.","pro-choice-roots","07:53 AM","abortion-debates","113"

I won't try to force any of the women in your family into aborting their pregnancies, and you don't tell the women in my family they may not if they so choose. Sounds like a win-win situation.

If evidence serves your agenda then you accept it as rational, otherwise you reject it as bogus. And you think the Grand Canyon is the only evidence of Noah's Flood? The global flood catastrophe is one of the key facts of all history. Not only is there a mass of geological evidence,it has left an indelible impression on the memory of the entire human race. An analysis of some 600 individual flood traditions reveals a widespread concurrence on essential points: the prior corruption of mankind, a flood warning unheeded by the masses, a survival vessel, the preservation of up to eight people with representative animal life, the sending forth of a bird to determine the suitability of reemerging land, significance in the rainbow, descent from a mountain, and the re-population of the whole earth from a single group of survivors. Especially remarkable is the persistence of that biblical name Noah. And this is particularly so when you consider the ultimate language differences between peoples, and the extreme local distortions which (developed in flood legends. Yet the name survived virtually unchanged in such isolated places as Hawaii (where he was called Nu-u), the Sudan (Nuh), China (Nu-Wah), the Amazon region (Noa), Phrygia (Noe) and among the Hottentots (Noh and Hiagnoh). : SUDDEN APPEARANCE: Are you aware that ""ALL CULTURES BEGAN SUDDENLY"" and were fully developed? A long preliminary period is not supported by archaeology. Before cities on earth, there was nothing. There was no transition whatsoever between the ancient civilizations and any primitive forebearers. They were at their peak from the beginning. : ...Great cities, enormous temples, pyramids of overwhelming size. Colossal statues with tremendous expressive power. Luxurious tunnels and tombs. Splendid streets flanked by magnificent sculpture, perfect drainage systems. A decimal system at the very start. A ready-made writing, already perfected. A well established naming system (in which each Pharaoh had as many as five names). Society already divided into specialist classes. An army, civil service and hierarchy minutely organized. A court exhibiting all the indications of well-defined precedence and form. Egypt came from a clearly established civilization. The only conclusions that can be drawn from the evidence is that,1 Each of the first civilizations appeared suddenly, already fully developed. 2) That a connection existed between them. 3) Their footprints led back to the Middle East mountains where Noah and his family left the Ark. : The sudden appearance of civilization is itself a memorial to history's one great catastrophe. More importantly, the flood is a historical event of tremendous testimonial importance to modern man...... : You have no idea if it happened yet you have never opposed those who have defended it as a rational theory, and you also defend it as rational right here. But it is an imagined 15 BILLION year distant event which cannot be proven at all yet you accept it as rational. That is my point and it is undeniable that your as inconsistent in your world view in your condemnation of the bibles explanation as one can be. This is totally your opinion which makes clear that you don't like the idea that you will be held responsible for rejecting the savior who died for your sins. God makes it clear that you don't have to accept His offer of salvation but don't accuse him of not existing just because you reject His TRUTH. And be sure that in the end, His truth will be the only truth that matters and your rejection of it will feel as foolish to you then as it appears to me now. When will you learn that denying God and His absolute laws will never excuse you from the repercussions for doing so?
