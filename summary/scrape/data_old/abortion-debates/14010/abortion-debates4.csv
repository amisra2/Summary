Shame on you people.","Shooterandproud","395124","Something that is inanimate can't choose anything, even if it did have the freedom. Scientifically, it is alive, but it can't think (like plant or cellular life). Therefore, this point is ridiculous. Is being honest while debating too much to ask of you people?","pro-choice-roots","02:27 PM","abortion-debates","47"

"03-18-2010","14010",4,"Archie","None","The relevant question is ow, do you believe that the right to end a human life in the womb when you can look in the mirror and see that you were once in that same position, should be considered from a scientific point of view only, or from the perspective that this is a viable human being who just requires the opportunity to develop in order to become as much the person that you have become?","iangb","395250","Because sperm is equally a potential human being. Potentiality is pointless, what matters it what is , not what could be .","pro-choice-roots","04:25 PM","abortion-debates","52"
"03-20-2010","14010",4,"Archangel","395382","How open minded of you. If a woman chooses to murder her unborn child, you approve of it. Forget about defending an innocent human being when a woman's choice to kill it is the other option to consider. You keep repeating your lie as if it's true, but it isn't true. An unborn human being is no more a parasite than any other type of mammal which shares a common type of gestation in order to develop into its kind of creature. A parasite is a foreign body which intrudes upon a healthy host and leaves that host either weaker or dead since it literally consumes it as it feeds upon it. And that parasite never grows into the host which it is infecting. I posted a link which explains what a parasite is yet you continue to misrepresent them. Are you ignorant or just stubborn? And see the last bolded sentence? Apply that statement to the unborn baby you are promoting the death of if its mother chooses to be selfish and kills it for the sake of her personal convenience. I don't blame the Jews, as in the Jewish people, for Jesus death at all. Crucifixion was a Roman form of execution in case you didn't know it. I do blame the religious hypocrites who called for his death since He was totally innocent of any crime at all, much less one worthy of death. But the Jews didn't have the legal authority to execute anyone which is why they took Him before Pilate and the Herod with their false accusations. You are guilty of applying the same fallacious arguments as all atheists in that you attempt to indict all christians for the past crimes of the catholic church throughout its early history. You will find that I'm not an apologist for the church or men who claim religion in any way. I defend Christ only since only He is worthy of Praise and Glory due to His perfect sacrifice for us in order to redeem Humanity from our fallen state. Remember that Jesus prayed ""Father forgive them for they know not what they do,"" so if He forgave His murderers who were contemporaries at the time, who am I to condemn all Jews today? The very proposition is ludicrous and reflects the reasoning which could only be justified by a godless atheist who lacks all wisdom and spiritual understanding.","Easyrider","395392","Amen, Archangel. If the stiff-necked, pro-infanticide crowd hadn't murdered 50 million innocent babies (and ultimate taxpayers) since Roe vs. Wade, they'd be able to pay cash for their stinking Obama health care fiasco.","pro-choice-roots","04:15 AM","abortion-debates","55"

Jesus was preaching about a new kingdom at hand (that wan't Roman) and riling up an occupied people during a time they traditionally celebrate their freedom from oppression (Passover). Historical documents paint Pilate as quite the bastage and here he was in Jerusalem, during Passover, nowhere near home and he had a trouble maker in his midst. Not that the Jewish powers didn't have their hand in it, they surely did, but Jesus certainly was doing enough to tick off Rome and I doubt Pilate blinked an eye about crucifying him.","pro-choice-roots","04:32 PM","abortion-debates","58"

I was once a little sperm swimming around in my father's testicles too, that doesn't make sperm ""human beings"".","pro-choice-roots","07:05 PM","abortion-debates","59"
