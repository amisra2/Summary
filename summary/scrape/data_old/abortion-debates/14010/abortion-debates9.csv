Were you sarcastic when you proclaimed your belief in talking snakes and literal floods?","JPSartre12","396316","My kind? What kind is ""my kind""? College educated? upper middle class? White?

"03-29-2010","14010",9,"chester","396314","Your rant is totally off base and irrelevant to those of us who do not equate abortion with infanticide. Spare us your phony rage.","Easyrider","396351","And your belief is contrary to God's will, as I previously documented. One day you will be held to account for it. There's nothing phony about it. Just wish I could legally deport you.","pro-choice-roots","04:53 PM","abortion-debates","122"

If you want one of those, Iran might just be to your liking. 2. This Springsteen-American is staying right where he is, thank you very much. This Springsteen-American has just as much right to fly the flag of the USA outside his house as you do - more in fact. 3. This Springsteen-American has enough confidence in the women of his family to make choices that are in their best interest without any help from the likes of you. Keep your poison away from them!","pro-choice-roots","04:59 PM","abortion-debates","123"

You don't have to live in a theocracy to know murding the innocent unborn is wrong. Actually, Iran might be more to your liking since they don't value life very much either. Fly your flag, but don't think for a moment that the God who brought this nation forth approves of the mass infanticide of the innocent unborn. Godly women don't kill their unborn. They nurture them. As for poision, you're the ones who advocate death and infanticide, not me.","pro-choice-roots","06:07 PM","abortion-debates","124"

"03-29-2010","14010",9,"Archangel","396294","We believe it just as we believed that it was right for the world to intervene against Hitlers legally sanctioned Holocaust against the Jews during WW2 in Germany. Are you actually saying that we had no right to impose our moral will on him as he attempted to exterminate a complete people according to the laws of his land? After all capo, the ovens and gas chambers in the camps were completely legal in Germany, I guess that means that in your reprobate mind we had no legal or moral right to intervene and impede their lawful activity, right?","Shooterandproud","396368","That's called the false analogy fallacy.

You endorse mass infanticide and defend the woman's right to murder their own children while simplifying the issue to one of ""choice"", but you fail to see that for the dead and murdered babies you are taking every choice they will ever make away from them as you destroy their every hope, dream and joy which life has/had for them. Congratulations, you are a monster in good standing with a most shallow, selfish and vacuous world view that promotes mass murder of one segment of our population for the personal convenience of another segment of our population to the tune of approximately 1.4 million babies per year in America alone. A combined number which reflects a much higher death count than Hitlers Holocaust did, yet you are completely oblivious to that reality. Excellent, Arch!! You nailed it.","pro-choice-roots","07:38 PM","abortion-debates","134"
