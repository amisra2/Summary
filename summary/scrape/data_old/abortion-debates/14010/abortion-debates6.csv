"03-22-2010","14010",6,"Easyrider","395575","This health care vote by the pro-infanticide crowd was an abomination. Stupak and his spineless ""comrades"" caved in. Stupak shifted the responsibility to say ""no"" on abortion to a pro-infanticide, serial liar (Obama). Evidently Stupak & Company didn't have enough of a spine to stand up themselves and defend the innocent unborn. I have more respect for the Viet Cong we fought in Vietnam than I do those butchers of Capitol Hill who enable the shedding of innocent blood. I hold them in absolute contempt, and I hold those milquetoast Christians who voted for Stupak and Obama in a similar contempt. Even Joe Lieberman, if he voted for it, is a contemptable human being for not knowing or following his own faith (Judaism - note Jeremiah 1:5 and Psalm 139;13, etc.). These people are disgusting individuals and should be voted out of office as soon as possible. Snakes.","jitobear","395634","I thought the bill only allows federally funded abortion in the cases of rape and serious health/life risk to the mother?????","pro-choice-roots","07:16 PM","abortion-debates","76"
"03-22-2010","14010",6,"None","None","None","Easyrider","395648","The recent passage of the Democrat Health Care bill identified, once and for all, which political party cannot be trusted with the lives of Americas most helpless individuals the innocent unborn. Since Roe vs. Wade, and for the last forty-plus years, spiritually-challenged Democrats have sacrificed on the altars of political correctness and convenience, the lives of some 50 million future American citizens, teachers, scientists, health care professionals, and taxpayers enough souls to actually fund, in full, the Pelosi Reid and Obama Health Care bill. And while many Republicans and Independents over the decades have likewise abrogated their moral responsibilities to the unborn, their moral turpitude pales in comparison to the left wing Capitol Hill Butchers and their like-minded constituents. On Sunday, March 21, 2010, when supposed pro-life Michigan Representative Bart Stupak and company abrogated their personal responsibilities and duty to protect the unborn, and shamefully transferred that obligation into the hands of a pro-infanticide serial prevaricator by the name of Barack Obama, the fate of the unborn was sealed. Barack Obama: Abortion-Enabler-in-Chief Barack Obama the most prolific, pro-infanticide president in American history says that abortions need to be more rare. If theres nothing wrong with abortion, then why do they need to be more rare? Mr. President? And if there is something wrong with abortion, then why isnt the Abortion-Enabler-in-Chief pro life? Can anybody answer that? Michelle Obama, can you answer that for your spiritually challenged husband? Besides apologizing for America, what did they teach you in that church you attended for the last twenty years? Did they ever teach you what the Word of God says about abortion? Did you ever crack open your Bibles and read them with the same diligence and thoroughness as Saul Alinskys Rules for Radicals? And if you did read it, why havent you taken it seriously? What does the Bible say about abortion? And if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so that she has a miscarriage, yet there is no further injury, he shall surely be fined as the womans husband may demand of him; and he shall pay as the judges decide. But if there is further injury, then you shall appoint as a penalty life for life. (Exodus 21:22-23) Straight from the Jewish Torah, God immediately confirms the value of human life in a mothers womb for Jews and Christians alike. Next, life in the womb according to Gods divine plan: Jeremiah 1:5 Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations. Psalm 139:13 For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mothers womb. Of course, the question here is: What divine insight does the pro-abortion crowd think they have to where they can destroy in a mothers womb that which God is somehow instrumental in creating? Mr. President? Michelle Obama? Anyone? That was a future prophet to the nations in the womb. And the pro-infanticide crowd wants to pretend that instead of a baby with a divine plan, its nothing more than an unviable tissue mass. Are you kidding? Well, God is not fooled. Infanticide down through the Ages When Moses the Lawgiver was expected, they killed the babies (Exodus chapter 1). When Jesus was born, King Herod ordered the babies to be killed again (Matthew chapter 2). And now that the Lords return is imminent, the Butchers of Capitol Hill are again working unabashedly to extinguish the lives of the innocent. The fact is that God has a plan for everyone, no matter how insignificant they may appear to be. The Bible is full of personal accounts of people who trusted in God, and who then went on to achieve great things. God respects life. We should also. Now, a question for the Obama Christian and Jewish sycophants: Why did you vote for and support a man who condones, defends, and enables the horrendous, unbiblical act of genocide against the innocent unborn? Is that not one of the most grievous practices in the whole universe to rip apart the innocent unborn in a mothers womb? And you feel proud about that man? And yourselves? Let me give you a clue: Youre part of the problem for supporting him. You too have blood on your hands. And Im guessing youre probably too prideful to repent of it and change your thinking. I have more respect for the secular humanists and the bloody Viet Cong of the Vietnam war than I do the black, white, and Hispanic (etc.) Christians and Jews who voted for the Abortion-Enabler-in-Chief. The secularists generally dont know right from wrong in this instance, but the Obama Christians and Jews should know better. But what about the right of the mother to have dominion over her own body, you ask? To that I ask, What about the right to life of the innocent baby in that mothers womb? Who is its champion? The fact is that you dont kill an innocent baby for the sins or personal convenience of the parent or parents. You have a greater responsibility than that. If the mother is ill, then try to save the baby. If not, pray to God for the answer. And so today, the slaughter continues. A presidential directive will not stop the flow of abortions for long, if at all. Another president can come in and quickly reverse the directive. Or more likely, people will point to the fact that the Health bill, as law, trumps the power of a presidential directive, and will ignore Obamas initiative altogether. If Obama thought highly of the innocent unborn, hed veto the bill and do it over. And if Stupak and Company had any lasting moral character to begin with, they wouldnt have let things get this far. America, we need to reverse course and protect and respect the innocent unborn. Theres no other way around it. For the God who established America can darn well take our country from us and bring divine Judgment to our shores. Dont think he wont. We are treading on very thin ice and there surely will be a personal and national price to pay for our continued, callous disregard of innocent life. America, repent and turn from your ungodly ways before its too late. And in November, vote the Butchers of Capitol Hill the hell out of office, and anyone who looks like them. May God have mercy on our country. (RighterReport.com)","pro-choice-roots","09:38 PM","abortion-debates","77"
