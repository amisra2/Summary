I also don't think they need to fund things like plastic surgery (minus repair for serious defects/burn victims etc.), viagara, etc.","MarieAntoinette","396100","I can't believe you really believe that, jitobear. Let's say there's a single mom mom working minimum wage at McDonald's with 3 children to support, and she gets pregnant (whether or she used birth control responsibly is not at issue -- because of her right to privacy -- and because that's pretty hard for anyone else to know about, anyway). There's no health issue, but she wants an abortion. You're telling the board you think that's like the government paying for viagra or botox injections? Or there's a level of irony that is passing ... ? Frankly, though, I don't know why men's viagra should even be in a private insurance pool that women pay into.

How sick and twisted are these people to even think of allowing such a thing? Chemical castration drugs I could understand, but making it ok for convicted sex offenders to get free viagra shows clearly the level of intelligence and moral oversight these people retain. They also voted down an amendment by Grassley which would have forced Obama and Congress to own the same healthcare bill they passed for us and of course it was defeated the the ungodly hypocrite majority who refuses to be locked into what they feel is good enough for the surf class they are creating with this debacle of a bill. Oh, the Senate also voted to preserve all of the sweetheart and backroom deals which Obama promised had been taken out before the House came up with their sham of a vote to go against the will of ""we the people"" once again. Senate Democrats rejected an amendment last night offered by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) that would have required the President, Vice President, cabinet members, top White House staff, and the congressional leadership and committee staff who drafted the proposal to purchase their health insurance through the government exchanges like everyone else. As a result, President Obama will not have to live under the Obama healthcare reforms, and neither will the congressional staff who helped to write the overhaul, Grassley said. The message to the people at the grassroots is that its good enough for you, but not for us. Senate Democrats also voted 57-42 in favor of providing Viagra to sex offenders and 54-43 to give a ringing endorsement of the backroom, sweetheart deals for individual states such as Louisiana that remain in the bill. (I single out Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisianas $300 million sweetheart deal simply because of the prime comic relief afforded by her attempts to defend her actions from the Senate floor.)

If a woman can't afford an abortion, and/or access to abortion as a legal medical procedure has become so out-of-reach, her right to choose has been taken away from her. And lower income women (and in this example, a lower income woman who is already supporting other children) are often those who need access to this kind of medical procedure the most.","pro-choice-roots","04:06 PM","abortion-debates","99"

And since Jesus is and was accepted as God in the flesh, when He referred to and testified to Adam and the Prophets who were killed by Israel throughout her history, we accept that testimony as further evidence that the bible is as accurate as we already know it to be through the personal revelation we receive from the Holy Spirit who convicts us of its truth. I wish there was someway to convince you of the truth we know, but alas, life is an individual journey and only God alone can reveal Himself to you based on the sincerity of your desire to know Him. Because of ""free will"" He will never force Himself on any of us. Only through our sincere desire and hunger to know Him will He reveal Himself to us individually. So don't ask us to prove God exists, ask God to reveal Himself to you and all you must do is believe that IF God exists, He is able to do that and He will do the rest.","pro-choice-roots","08:28 PM","abortion-debates","103"
