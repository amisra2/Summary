But once the female egg is fertilized by a mans sperm, vwala, it grows into not only a sentient being, but a miniature person who reflects the physical traits of both of his parents. A truly remarkable creation. The inevitable answer you will get is that atheists don't believe in the soul. But the answer is, that where there is life in that growing fertilized egg, so is there a soul at conception.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","07:09 PM","abortion-debates","35"

A fertilized egg cannot accomplish this without a uterus. I can make a man out of clay that physically resembles a person, however physical resemblance is not what makes a person a person. Its what's on the inside. A ""soul"" is a mental existence. There is no ""soul"" until the third trimester.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","07:38 PM","abortion-debates","37"
"09-09-2008","11563",3,"Galactababe","323061","Shooterandproud: I've taken a health class. More than that, I've given birth to two wonderful children and understand biology. Sperm contains HALF of the DNA necessary to combine with the other HALF of the DNA contained within a female's egg to produce human life. That new DOUBLE-helix of life, with all of its unique individual genetic markers, cannot occur without input from male and female. Sperm is not clay, but it is not viable life. Now if you want to get into the issue of human cloning and whether it is possible to clone a human being from sperm alone, I think you are entering extremely controversial and dangerous ground, completely different from abortion.","chester","323068","I'm not sure that your point is correct. ""Soul"" is a theological concept, not a legal one. Faiths can and do differ as to whether or not such a thing exists at all. Read carefully, that was the crux on Mr. Justice Blackmun's original opinion on Roe . He argued quite elegantly that, in light of the theological differences among faiths, it was not the job of the civil law to favor one theory over another, and that, therfore, the decision must needs be left to the pregnant woman. Since you are one who clearly favors the pro-choice position, I respect both: A) The fact that you believe that there is such a thing as a ""souls"" B) That it exists from the moment of conception C) That, for you the preferred choice is that women carry their pregnancies to term and D) You respect the right of other women to make other choices. Those points are, in a nutshell, the essence of the pro-choice position.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","09:01 AM","abortion-debates","40"
"09-09-2008","11563",3,"Galactababe","323074","Chester: Ah, well that's because lawyers are the exception to the rule because THEY HAVE NO SOULS! Kidding aside, the FACT that the soul is a theological concept, and I will grant you that, does not give lawyers/judges the right to rule in favor of those who wish to destroy a soul, as they can neither prove nor disprove its existence. Just because the pregnant mother may not believe in a soul, doesn't mean it doesn't exist.","chester","323076","Neither does it give lawyers/judges the right to take into account the fact that there are religious differences of opinion on the topic. As John F. Kennedy's confessor, Richard Cardinal Cushing of Boston said, ""Any faith which depends on the force of law to compel obedience to its tenets is weak."" Mr. Justice Blackmun had it spot on in Roe when he said that the law must needs not intrude on questions of theology. Therefore he concluded quite rightly, that this was a matter for each woman to choose for herself. But you knew that and have stated it on this forum previously.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","10:44 AM","abortion-debates","42"
"09-09-2008","11563",3,"Galactababe","320577","McCain wants Roe vs. Wade overturned. I agree. At the very least, the age of ""viability"" should be revised downwards to 20 weeks.","chester","323077","Babe, Here's just one example of your commitment to the pro-choice side of the debate.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","10:50 AM","abortion-debates","43"
"09-09-2008","11563",3,"Galactababe","323085","Chester: WRONG! Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; Abortion denies the growing human life the right to free exercise thereof when it becomes of age to be cognizant of religion. Why? Because it will never ""come of age"". I remember what I said. AT THE VERY LEAST . That doesn't mean I don't believe that life begins at conception, but that in order to reach some sort of compromise, the law as it stands needs to be overturned or revised to favor life more than it does currently.","chester","323086","Please, babe, your second paragraph is a real stretch. Surely even you recognize that. Surely you also recognize that ANY deviation from the ""no abortion under any circumstances"" mantra espoused by Palin, Randall Terry, and others is a pro-choice position.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","12:11 PM","abortion-debates","45"
