"09-18-2008","11563",15,"Phyllis","324195","No, because even if privacy is fundamental within the meaning of substantive due process (a proposition I would dispute), extending that to encompass abortion is not plausible because abortion cannot possibly be thought to be a component of the kind of privacy that is deeply rooted in this nation's tradition and history. How do we know? Because abortion was restricted in virtually every state from the early 1800s until 1973.","Sigma","324206","""Kind of privacy""? I'm not certain what you mean. Several aspects of personal life have been consistently part of privacy and have been protected by SCOTUS. For example: Loving v. Virginia . If not found within the Fourteenth Amendment's liberty clause and the implicit right to privacy, where would the basis for the decision be found that the State could not infringe upon a person's right to marry another of a different race? And since Loving, the Supreme Court has consistently held that the personal rights recognized in the case are protected by the right to privacy. In Carey v. Population Services (involving the right to contraception) and Zablocki v. Redhail (involving the right to marry), the Supreme Court held: While the outer limits of this aspect of privacy have not been marked by the Court, it is clear that among the decisions that an individual may make without unjustified government interference are personal decisions relating to marriage, Loving v. Virginia ; procreation, Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson ; contraception, Eisenstadt v. Baird ; family relationships, Prince v. Massachusetts [and] Meyer v. Nebraska . Procreation, conception, marriage, family life. All of these reasonably and rationally relate to the decision whether or not to terminate your pregnancy. It absolutely flows naturally with other protected areas of private life. Just looking at the two cases of Griswold v. Connecticut and Eisenstadt v. Baird , right to contraception cases, whether or not you have a child is a personal and private decision constitutionally protected from governmental interference. In Eisenstadt v. Baird , the Court extended the marital right to privacy in Griswold to unmarried individuals and explained that: if the right to privacy means anything, it is the right of an individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child. All of these necessarily include the freedom to decide whether or not to terminate the pregnancy.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","09:14 PM","abortion-debates","215"
"09-18-2008","11563",15,"Shooterandproud","324197","How is it that you can legally kill a burglar that invades your house, however for some reason when something invades your body you have no right to kill it?","Phyllis","324207","You can only legally kill a burglar if you have good reason to believe that your life is in danger. Should you arrive one day at your house and discover a burglar who clearly poses no threat to your person, you may not legally kill him though he walk out with all your earthly possessions. Yes, the burglar may be infringing upon your liberty, but you may not kill him because of that. If you must analogize it to the burglar, than it would apply this way. Most pro-life people agree that abortions that are necessary to save the mother's life are acceptable. What most pro-lifers do not agree with is that abortion is acceptable in situations where only a person's liberty or property might be infringed, but where it would not be necessary to save her life.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","09:19 PM","abortion-debates","216"
"09-18-2008","11563",15,"Archangel","324198","Agreed Phyllis, we are guaranteed the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as Americans. But can it be shown where the Constitution allows us privacy when it conflicts with the rights of others?","Sigma","324208","The Fourteenth Amendment allows this, Archangel . Interestingly enough, while there is no right to life in the Constitution there is a right to liberty.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","09:20 PM","abortion-debates","217"
"09-18-2008","11563",15,"Phyllis","324209","That's not exactly accurate.","Sigma","324210","Actually what I said is exactly accurate. A right to life has been interpreted to exist due to those Amendments, but the language of the Constitution does not explicitly give any right to live. Merely that the State cannot take away your life without Due Process. So, then, if Archangel wishes to go down this line of reasoning, the State is constitutionally bound to not violate our freedom but has no constitutionally supported interest in keeping the fetus alive (merely that the State is bound to not kill the fetus).","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","09:33 PM","abortion-debates","219"
"09-18-2008","11563",15,"Phyllis","324213","So, too, with respect to liberty. The Constitution does not explicitly give any the right to liberty; it merely states that the State cannot take away your liberty without Due Process. But the same interest that you say the state has regarding the right to life is the same interest that the state has in preserving liberty. Thus, so long as due process has been applied, any liberty can be deprived by the State.","Sigma","324214","Right, that's the point. While the language is similar in both cases, the two rights (not to be deprived of liberty and not to be deprived of life) do not apply equally in this issue. While the woman's liberty is protected by the Constitution, the life of the fetus is not. At least, if one takes Archangels simplistic view of the Constitution. Whether the protection the Constitution affords can be stripped is somewhat moot. There are no clash of rights within the Constitution. Aye, but re: abortion only one of those has any relevance. Namely, the State's interest in preserving liberty. However, speaking solely of what the Constitution protects, obviously liberty is the more important right in this issue than life. Ultimately, and obviously, Archangels simplistic view of the Constitution is false and there are additional checks before a State can violate certain liberties but this does illustrate some interesting points.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","10:38 PM","abortion-debates","221"
"09-18-2008","11563",15,"Phyllis","324186","Only a buffoon could believe that the federal constitution forbids states from regulating abortion through their legislative processes. Just because something is a philosophical question does not mean that a law cannot enact one philosophical view over another. The entire Federal Constitution is the embodiment a philosophical view, and it is the law.","chester","324217","Still no answer to the core question, we see. One more <SIGH!> time: Please tell us why you believe the government is better able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is. It's time once and for all for you to stop your ridiculous Jesuitical word games and answer the question or admit once and for all that you either can't or won't. Put up or shut up. Fish or cut bait. Tinkle or get off the pot. Now go ahead and attack those instead of answering, clown.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","11:29 PM","abortion-debates","222"

The pro-choice folks here have no objection to those profetallifers who would apply the ""no abortion"" rules within their own families, but we have strong objection to having the law make that choice for our families. I have 3 daughters of child bearing age, and two granddaughters who soon will be. I will fight to the last to keep the decision of whether or not they carry their pregnancies to term where it belongs - with them. If they choose to give birth, I will love them and their child(ren); if they choose abortion, I will love them just as much. Just keep the law out of the decision.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","11:59 PM","abortion-debates","225"
