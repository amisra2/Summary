This is because the mother's auto-immune system (her internal defence mechanisms) will recognise the new embryo as a foreign body and attack it. The amniotic membrane isolates the young embryo from all biological interaction with its parent, thus protecting it from attack. link Yes you keep harping about it being a parasite And here's something debuting your ""parasite"" theory How is abortion so much morally higher than drowing a baby in a toilet or ripping it into pieces. Answer: Its a minature developing human being. if its a parasite we need to admit that we were parasites too wouldn't we! A fetus or a parasite?","Colonel Ingus","328229","Gee that's nice, too bad for you no one here is arguing what the placenta does . DOH!!! If you would have read what was WRITTEN, instead of just what you wanted to read , you would have seen that the placenta PROTECTS the ZEF so that it could grow inside the woman. Without a placenta every pregnancy would end up as a miscarriage. Read 'em and weep Einstein: You spend so much time whining that you didn't even take a minute and ask yourself - if the placenta isn't protecting the ZEF - then why doesn't the ZEF just get its nutrients DIRECTLY from the womans blood supply. Way to go hot shot I don't have to, researchers have already confirmed this fact If I would have wanted to read some rhetoric from a anti-choice web site , I would have done it myself. Try again, and maybe this time stick to actual medical sources. Ta-ta Of course it is! One is a functioning BORN human being. The other is a wad of cells. If you can't distinguish the difference between the two then I suggest you get an education on the topic. Please note : they won't let you whine in class Translation : It's only a potential human being. Yes, key word WERE Glad you're catching on What do you mean by "" or ""? Both are the SAME thing","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","05:50 PM","abortion-debates","541"
