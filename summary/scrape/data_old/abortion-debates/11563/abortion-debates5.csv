If there is a person from the moment of conception, and if ""ensoulment"" occurs at that moment, which twin gets it when there are identical twins? I love it when the profetallifers get snared in their own rhetoric.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","08:11 AM","abortion-debates","62"

"09-10-2008","11563",5,"Galactababe","323213","Archangel: Actually, I thought the answer was quite obvious: In the case of identical twins, the actual moment of ""conception"" is the splitting of the egg where two separate "" human beings"" begin to form. When such a beautiful and amazing event occurs, each being is individually endowed with their soul. As the aunt of identical 5 yr old twin girls, I can tell you that just because they look alike, doesn't mean their personalities, ""essences"" or souls are identical.","Archangel","323216","Exactly, anyone who has known identical twins, knows all too well how unique they are as individuals. And so does chester know that also, yet he asks such a childish question because he thinks he can somehow trap us and confound our beliefs. That's why I didn't answer his question. I'm really trying not to feed the trolls.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","09:21 AM","abortion-debates","66"

However the endowment of their souls while in utero, undoubtedly eternally makes them soul sisters.","chester","323220","Are you really that ignorant of basic biology? I seriously doubt it. Identical twins occur when the now-fertilized egg divides. Thus the question stands.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","10:59 AM","abortion-debates","67"

Conception(fertilization) takes place prior to the division of a single fertilized ovum into the two identical twins. If two souls are standing by then clearly the moment of conception is not when the souls enter the body. At least in the case of identical twins.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","11:23 AM","abortion-debates","69"

Obviously He's not going to deliver a soul to a single fertilized egg that will imminently and darn near immediately become two human beings, silly rabbits! Precision and productivity is what God does best, therefore delivering only one soul when two are needed would be a mistake, now wouldn't it? But, the hapless young mother who doesn't want to lose her youthful figure by carrying twins should have the right to kill them anyway whether they have received their souls or not, isn't that what you were just about to add?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","01:43 PM","abortion-debates","71"

And God doesn't know jack as he/she is similarly a product of the human imagination. Just ask Him, He'll tell you Himself.
