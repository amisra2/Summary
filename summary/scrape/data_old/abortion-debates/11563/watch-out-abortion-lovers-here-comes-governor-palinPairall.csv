And, yes, if I am in a persistent vegetative state, I have authorized my family to direct my physicians to pull the plug. I'm not there.","Archangel","325384","What is not only illogical but patently false is the assertion that the unborn baby is making his mother a slave of any kind. Did that baby force her to conceive it? Is that baby the equivalent of a tumor as the pro abortionists claim them to be? NO, it is an unborn human being who just needs the time to grow and develop in order to be a sentient being just as we are as we type on these keyboards. That explains everything about how irrational you are! But based on your posts though, I think they already pulled the plug.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","10:03 PM","abortion-debates","110"

What is incredible is that it is completely lost on you that you just called me an idiot.

If you wish, I'll even pay for the Geek Squad guy to come to your house and fix your ""Ignore"" button. And, yes, I would rather cavort with the Devil in Hell than spend eternity your version of Heaven. And Archie, please, PLEASE don't bother telling me where you think I'm going. Don't ever be so presumptuous as to think you know the mind of God.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","08:12 AM","abortion-debates","95"

It doesn't mean that I'm going anywhere. Fear not yon sinner, your day will come. And you will rue the day you made this claim. As disgusting and repulsive as I find what you represent, I still mourn you for what awaits you.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","06:42 PM","abortion-debates","71"

I would no longer be. The only reason any of this will matter is if we believers in God and His promises are right, and the death of this body represents the beginning of eternal life, whether it be with Him, or apart from Him is our individual choices.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","10:22 PM","abortion-debates","81"
