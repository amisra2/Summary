Do the words ""preferred choice"" mean something other than, ""Of all the possible choices, this is the one I prefer""?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","04:10 PM","abortion-debates","184"
"09-17-2008","11563",13,"Galactababe","324028","Now why don't you tell us why women shouldn't accept the responsibility of bringing a life into this world after they've spread their legs to breed? Hmmmm? Why should the government ALLOW them the convenience of using abortion as birth control because they were too lazy, ignorant or careless to use protection in the first place?","chester","324034","Because it's none of my, your, or the law's business.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","04:12 PM","abortion-debates","185"

Besides, consent to sex is not consent to raise a child. Never has been. Your side ultimately is interested in controlling the sex lives of women. It's not about innocent lives. Try standing outside the clinic with checks instead of signs and I'll believe your motives.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","04:35 PM","abortion-debates","186"
"09-17-2008","11563",13,"Ryuuichi","324009","I don't but I find it amusing how so many pro-choicers use pro-life arguments when talking about a male's right to choose.On other forums I've seen its hilarious. They start whining about how men would abuse this (like women don't already) and how it makes the irresponsible (as if the women who do the same thing are somehow above being irresponsible especially those who use it as birth control.) I'm waiting for attitudes like that to bit them in the butt eventually and abortions only be made accessible under the conditions of rape, incest and danger to the mother. [Note when talking about irresponsibility and abuse the latter three conditions weren't included] Well at least the pro-lifers would be happy. Though its a woman's body. You make a choice over your own body and reproduction rights. Their YOUR rights. Neither the government or your partner who got you pregnant/you got pregnant should have any say over your choice to become a mother/father. Are those not basic human rights?

As well as when you want to do it?","Shooterandproud","324063","If I drive a car, am I responsible for becoming injured when rammed by a drunk driver? If I take a walk, am I responsible for being hit by a car? Should I therefore be denied medical attention because I need to be ""responsible""? I really don't get it when people say they want women to be ""responsible"" and carry the baby to term. How is that responsible? Its not what the woman wants, so why punish her with it? To teach her a lesson?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","10:00 PM","abortion-debates","187"

They are stuck in the days of The Scarlet Letter. Of course in that novel, Hester and little Pearl bonded into a warm mother/daughter relationship. Be that as it may, they sit like avenging Arthur Dimmesdales, wishing, hoping, and praying for the women involved to be punished for their ""wayward"" ways by being forced to raise a child they never wanted in the first place - except, of course, if the unmarried, pregnant teen is the daughter of the Governor of the Igloo State. Note the link, however. In these cases, the focus is on the woman, not the now-born, newborn child. They could care less about him/her once she is born. That's why I will persist in calling them profetallifers.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","05:30 AM","abortion-debates","188"
"09-18-2008","11563",13,"Galactababe","324089","I find it rather amusing watching males of our species contemplate pregnancy as some sort of torture or punishment. Get this through your heads - it's NOT! My mother-in-law always said she was happiest and felt the best when she was pregnant - and she had 11 children. If a woman willingly engages in unprotected sex and gets pregnant, then she must BEAR the consequences - 40 week gestation period. After the baby is born, she has a new choice to make, be a mother to the child or give it up for adoption. We've already established there are tens of thousands of couples wanting to adopt.","chester","324097","Get this through YOUR head, sweetie. We are very glad about how your mother-in-law felt. However, your grandmother is not the paradigm for all women. Now tell us why you feel the woman MUST bear the child iif she feels differently from her if not as punishment. BTW, you're still sidestepping the question of why you feel that the government is the better determinant of the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is. Would you have wanted the government to tell your prolific mother-in-law that she MUST abort? After all, that's the logical consequence of the government telling a different woman that she must NOT abort. Doesn't giving the government that much power make your skin crawl? It surely does mine. Also, is the best you can do re. abortion for birth control a 1971 ""study""? Even if it were the case, it is still none of my, your, or the government's business. Many years ago, I was one of those people ""wanting to adopt"". He's my older son, and I still favor abortion rights.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","09:14 AM","abortion-debates","191"
"09-18-2008","11563",13,"Galactababe","324089","Sinjin Why don't you find me a statistic on the % of all abortions that take place as a result of failed birth control? (not lack of) If it turns out to be a rather small percentage (which I expect), I will give it further consideration as another case for exception.","sinjin","324132","Would any percentage require you to support abortion in the case of accidental impregnation? And how about a number from you for the percentage of women using abortion as their primary form of birth control? And while your at it, tell me why it would be okay to presume to countermand the will of God in cases of rape or incest?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","11:50 AM","abortion-debates","193"
"09-18-2008","11563",13,"Galactababe","324102","BECAUSE IT'S NOT PUNISHMENT! It is accepting responsibility for her actions and nurturing the result of those actions through to completion. You don't care about the PUNISHMENT (death) to the growing life inside her though, do you? Toss it in the bio-waste pail! Very nice.","chester","324133","Your Honor, I move that the above statement be excluded as non-responsive to the question of why this witness believes that the government is better able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is. Further, since she has already firmly declared herself to be in the pro-choice camp, I wish to have her declared a hostile witness. She may not feel that carrying a fetal parasite for nine months is punishment, but she has no right to speak for all women.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","12:02 PM","abortion-debates","194"
