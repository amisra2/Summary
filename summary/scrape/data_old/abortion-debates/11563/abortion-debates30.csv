AND DON'T EVEN BRING UP THE CENSUS OR THE CONSTITUTION BECAUSE ONE IS DEALING WITH POPULATION AND THE OTHER ISN'T DEALING WITH THE QUESTION OF WHEN LIFE IS CONCEIVED, SO TO USE IT AS EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING IN THIS DEBATE IS FALLACIOUS.","chester","325562","For exactly the same reason that YOU arbitrarily choose to define personhood as the moment of conception. It is a metaphysical question with no right answer. This being the case, as Mr. Justice Blackmun put it so eloquently in that marvel of Judicial Restraint known as Roe v. Wade , it is not the business of government to give one particular theory precedence over another. It is most definitely the province of each pregnant woman to make that choice for herself, based on her values and morals.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","07:17 AM","abortion-debates","436"

It is the only obvious and rational conclusion we can come to. It is at conception that the fertilized egg contains the unique DNA which determines all of its very distinct human characteristics and abilities, both physically and intellectual. And it is at that point that it starts to grow, so there is no doubt that it is truly alive at conception. And we all know in this age of science that the human gestation process lasts precisely 9 months and that child will grow in the same way that every single other living person has grown to become the people we are right now to the tune of 7 BILLION HUMAN BEINGS ON EARTH RIGHT NOW, so we know the formula works and how it works. So to dishonestly argue that there was ever a time that we weren't human is truly an arbitrary claim and absolutely dishonest because every one of us knows without a doubt ""what"" the end result of a fertilized egg in a woman's womb ends up becoming if just allowed to complete its development cycle. If it is truly not the business of the Government to give one particular theory precedence over another, then by what standard do they dare choose to rule in favor of legalizing abortions? It is likened to admitting that one doesn't know if someone committed a crime or not, but agreeing that killing that person just to be safe is the only way to go. It makes no moral or ethical sense at all. If the High Court believed as you say, they never should have touched this issue and allowed abortions to take place according to US Law. How dare they admit they can't determine the issue of when life begins, yet they rule in favor of ending it. That is precisely why Roe V Wade is considered the epitome of Judicial Activism. No matter how you slice it cap0, you're on the wrong side of this issue and are promoting a doctrine of death.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","10:21 AM","abortion-debates","437"

You make it sound as if the Court mandated abortion, which it did not do at all, but which it would undoubtedly have the right to do someday if it outlawed them tomorrow. That's not what the Court did at all. What the Court said was that it was not the function of the law to choose one theory of when personhood begins over another. It was, therefore, the right of each pregnant woman to determine the future of her pregnancy based on her values and morals","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","11:20 AM","abortion-debates","438"
"09-29-2008","11563",30,"Archangel","325618","The silence is deafening chester. No cap0, I'm not turning Roe on its head at all. And I'm not asserting that they mandated abortions. I'm pointing out that if they in fact accept and believe that they are unable to determine when personhood begins, then by what authority do they permit the life of the unborn to be so violently ended? If the Court ruled that if a fetus is in medical distress within the womb, because we can't prove personhood, it is valid to make no extreme attempts to medically save it. That would be consistent with not knowing if its a person. But this ruling allows for pro-active intervention to END the life of a perfectly normal and developing child. That is not standing aside, but is actively ending a life before it has officially been deemed not to be a person. It doesn't matter at all who is given the authority to end the child's life, that is secondary to the issue being discussed. I thought the rule was to err on the side of caution where a question remained whether life existed, or not.","chester","325625","This is still based on the erroneous theory that ROE mandated acceptance of one theory of personhood over another. Again, what the Court decided was to leave the decision where it properly belongs - with the woman. If a particular pregnant woman chooses to believe that personhood commences at conception, then she must do all within her power to save her child/fetus if it is in distress. On the other hand, if a different woman holds to a different metaphysical concept of personhood, the Court said that it will not stand in the way of her making a different choice regarding the future of her pregnancy. You and those who believe as you do are asking the Courts to render a legal opinion on a metaphysical issue. There the Courts, and the nation, go at our peril.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","04:11 PM","abortion-debates","442"
"09-29-2008","11563",30,"Archangel","325628","I am expanding on that assertion that you make and saying that if the LAW is unable to determine when personhood begins, then it doesn't have the moral authority to give women the right to arbitrarily abort perfectly healthy unborn children.","Another opinion","325630","Jumping in to the discussion to make one point: law does not determine what is legal . It determines what is illegal . If there is no law about an issue, then the default is for actions regarding that issue to be legal. Therefore, if, by your arguement, the law cannot rule on personhood because it doesn't know, then the law cannot rule on abortion - which, by default, would leave it legal.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","04:48 PM","abortion-debates","444"

The issue is exactly one of, as you put it, ""standing aside"". The Court declared that there a re many and varied metaphysical answers to the question of when personhood begins. This being the case, the Court simply declared that it was not going to be placed in the position of choosing among them. The choice had to rest where it most properly belongs, with the pregnant woman. If she felt that ""personhood"" waas conferred at conception, she had the right to mold her actions accordingly; if another woman felt that it was conferred at birth, she, too had the right to mold her actions in conformity with her beliefs as well. The problem is, as I see it, that you wanted the Court to choose from all these metaphysical beliefs the one that most nearly comports with your own. That the Court wisely refrained from doing.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","06:20 PM","abortion-debates","448"

"09-29-2008","11563",30,"Phyllis","325541","If you're going to make claims like this, you better be prepared to back them up. It is plenty deniable. I deny it. In some instances, animals have legal protections, which are not the same things as rights. It would be if there was a near 100% certainty that he would recover within 9 months, assuming he only needed to be left alone for that time. I don't see why this matters. I'm not sure why physical and emotional harm are valid reasons to end a person's life. For example, some non-abusive parents discipline their children by inflicting pain. I would not say that this is a valid reason to end the parents' life. Similarly, some relationships involve much emotional pain. But that wouldn't justify ending the life of one of the parties. I'm not at all clear what this distinction between the physical and the spiritual. It seems rather unlike you to rely on spiritual propositions. And I don't. But at least we need not pretend that this debate hinges on whether the fetus is a person in possession of the right to live. You are applying one epistemological standard when it comes to the existence of a Creator, and another standard when it comes to the existence of anything else. Philosophically speaking, it is impossible to prove the existence of anything to the degree of certainty you seem to be demanding of a Creator. For example, you say mental existence is somehow morally significant. But, you in fact could not appeal to any moral principle to justify that claim that you could prove exists.","Shooterandproud","325649","I may have made a misstatement. You may not have come out and claimed women are nothing more than life support machines, however you clearly failed to factor in that women are living beings. My mistake. Yes, they are the same. Even though not all protections are rights, rights sure are protections. All you're doing is calling the exact same thing a different name. Correct, however again, women are not life support machines. Their rights must be taken into account. Then I suggest you read the first amendment. If I try to hit you in the groin with a baseball bat as hard as I can, are you entitled to use lethal force to defend yourself from me? Spiritual may have been the wrong word. Mental existence is physical, however we think of it as spiritual (some refer to it as a ""soul""). My idea has not changed. You're right, this debate is not just about the fetus. Indirect observation can be used also, (the existence of the atom). The creator argument does not have one shred of evidence behind it, and basing laws on something that is completely unprovable is foolish. If the creator argument can be employed, then why can't the tooth fairy argument?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","06:33 PM","abortion-debates","450"
