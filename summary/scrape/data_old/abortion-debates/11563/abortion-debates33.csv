"10-10-2008","11563",33,"None","None","None","Archangel","327172","A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: THE PRO-ABORTION AGENDA OF JUSTIFICATION THROUGH DEHUMANIZATION To those people who are attempting to rationally debate the issue of ABORTION with these pro-death secular humanists and atheists, it is very important that you understand their true agenda and modus operandi for justifying the procedure which murders unborn babies while still in their mothers wombs. The method for justification requires that they dehumanize the unborn children which is why they will refer to them as ZEFs and Zygotes. And is why they will use comparisons to the fertilized and unfertilized chicken egg, which we eat for breakfast. You see, either way, when debating this issue on such a simplistic level, they win by default because they have already lowered the standard of debate to that of a chicken egg. So, by just understanding the shallowness of their tactics, we win by not allowing them to dehumanize our human offspring to the status of an inhuman analogy. Remember that these people are attempting to justify the murder of our very own human offspring. And they know that as well as you and I do. What they must do is both justify their stance and maintain a clear conscience so they don't have to live with the guilt that they are in fact defenders of a pro murder philosophy. That is why no matter what common sense arguments you use with them, no matter how obvious and rational your reasoning, they will never accept or concede that their position is not only false and irrational, but is criminal and a pro-death philosophy which supports and encourages genocide. After all, it is painfully obvious that any doctrine which not only allows, but enables the killing of 1.4 million members of one particular class of American consistently, year after year can be described as nothing other than genocide. That is why they must dehumanize the unborn, because they don't want to admit that they are proponents of the Great American Genocide. So forgive them for their irrational debating style which results in them offering the most infantile and ignorant arguments in their attempts to justify their sociopathic and shortsighted gospel of death and destruction of our most innocent and silent demographic, who have no personal voice of their own with which to defend themselves. What better a group to victimize than the absolute weakest among us? And they are even out of sight, so also out of mind of the masses. If they can only be dehumanized, then justifying their extermination should be easy according to the proponents of this MULTI BILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL INDUSTRY. So by understanding the rationale of these opponents of life for the unborn, you are more prepared to deal with the ignorance and shallowness of their inane attempts to justify such human carnage on such a massive scale. Just understand that these proponents of ABORTION are also victims since they have been raised in a selfish and self centered Society to believe that personal responsibility is a thing of the past, so demanding that the innocent child pay with its very life, the price for the sins of its mother/parents is just fine. And if they can moralize it by dehumanizing the baby so they can feel as though it is justified, then all the better.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","09:35 AM","abortion-debates","488"
