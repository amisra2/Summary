You can still have passionate sex, even promiscuous wild sex and still make the odds against pregnancy slight( maybe not STDs though) Yes the man should be sensible and responsible but the woman is the 'keeper of the gate' so to speak and should be the one in control for her own sake. Modern society gives women all the tools to control whether they become pregnant or not and it is amazing that there are so many unwanted pregnancies in the USA and Europe. I really am not being sexist when I say that it is the responsibility of the woman to ensure that the act of lovemaking does not make her pregnant, it is just sensible because is is going to happen to THEM not the feckless father. Coersion, rape , etc is another horrible factor but must be debated seperately, I believe. Should there be abortion on demand? If you say no, there is a thousand examples where this has ruined lives. If you yes then another thousand answers that have ruined lives in a different way. So you can't really make a wise decision on abortion. You can say that it can be permissable within certain conditions but this is still allowing it . Once it is allowed the perameters will almost certainly be expanded. The problem is that we try to make our laws to fit everyone not make everyone fit our laws . I hope this makes sense!","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","07:06 AM","abortion-debates","271"

I can't help it if you and your minor sidekick are too stupid to comprehend my answer. One more time, I'll type it slowly so you can ""get"" it. If Roe vs. Wade is overturned and restrictions on abortions are put BACK IN PLACE, it is not the government deciding what to do with a pregnant woman's body, it is the government re-establishing safeguards against the murder of a developing human which cannot defend itself.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","07:19 AM","abortion-debates","272"

You are literally wasting time and bandwidth even attempting to reason with them. But welcome to the forum. This message will also be posted in your personal profile message section. And once again, welcome to the forum.","chester","324596","Just because you can't or won't answer the question doesn't make it anything other than a valid question. You profetallifers refuse to answer because to do so would mean that your position is untenable, that you need crutch of the force of law rather than the power of persuasion to have your warped POV predominate.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","09:41 AM","abortion-debates","285"
