"09-23-2008","11563",22,"chester","324774","Thanks for a thoughtful analysis. The counter is that the law is not in the business of making metaphysical distinctions. There are many in this country who believe there is a new person from the moment of conception. Others would place ""personhood"" at some point in fetal development. There are still others who say that personhood = birth. All are sincerely held but ultimately unprovable assertions. In light of this, I say that it ill behooves any government to favor one metaphysical construct over another; it must maintain strict neutrality and leave the decision to the one person capable of making a choice about her particular pregnancy - the woman herself.","Archangel","324787","There is nothing metaphysical about the very natural growth process that takes place within a woman's womb once the egg is fertilized and amazingly enough, like clock work, 9 months later a baby which is a reflection of both its parents is born. Weird huh? And it happens millions of times per year all over the world in every culture, religious group and creed. Some might even call the process of human pro-creation a scientific FACT due to its regularity and the literal BILLIONS of times the experiment has been successfully repeated and personally observed by virtually everybody who has ever lived. You see chester, that is why the dung you spew is such an incredibly pathetic testimony of the shallowness and lies that you so proudly represent in every post you write about abortions. Because you must attempt to justify the murder of the only innocent party in that process of legalized infanticide. And then you have the nerve to accentuate your utter shallowness by placing this at the top of each post: Choice - an all-American family value! As if the right to kill our unborn children was not only decreed to us by the founders, but it's a positive family value like baseball and apple pie. You deny that life starts at conception yet you can't refute that once that egg and seed germinate and become fertilized, it then grows into a sentient being. If life didn't exist in that egg at conception, it would never grow into a thinking human being with hopes and dreams and potential just as you allegedly had before you lost your soul and decided that it required a breath of air before one deserved to be called a human being. What is so incredibly shallow about the pro-abortionist is that you yourselves, like all of us went through the same exact gestational process that we all went through in order to be typing on these keyboards. Yet how easily you support denying the innocent unborn their rights to life when they are perfectly healthy and in no way threatening their mothers lives either. You support a woman's right to choose to use abortion as a method of birth control. And you're even proud of what you represent. You don't even have the moral center to be ashamed of your pro-death philosophy. I could go on, but it would just be a waste of time.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","01:38 AM","abortion-debates","316"
"09-23-2008","11563",22,"Jay56","324785","I have based my argument on biological distinction, which for me puts the line at conception. If one were to try and argue where life begins or when a fetus is viable, then the metaphysical paradox kicks in. I counter this by stating that at conception life does not begin anywhere, but that life continues from a living egg and living sperm joining to create a unique and separate being.","chester","324803","Jay, Those of us who believe in choice have no problem whatsoever with the choice you make here. If so you and yours believe, then so you and yours must act according to your inner light. What we object to is the concept that one size fits all. Just as you must be free to act on your beliefs, so must others be free to act on theirs. The irrational ravings contained in the post that follows yours is a prime example of our objections. That poster fails to realize that once we give the government the power to ban abortion today, we also give to that government the power to require them tomorrow. We go there at our peril.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","04:19 AM","abortion-debates","317"

It is interesting to see how McCain/Palin have gotten a 34% boost in approval ratings with women on women's issues since Palin was picked. Despite Chester's rantings about women's rights, it would appear that the majority of voting age women in this country do not favor abortion and really do favor traditional family values, something the looney left fear as many in that camp are incapable of developing traditional family relationships on their own. The resulting anger and hatred espoused by the Liberal media and Obama supporters of a beautiful family like the Palins, shows just how skewed their moral values really are.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","08:21 AM","abortion-debates","318"

And for Paulsen to even CONSIDER bailing out foreign banks in this package is outrageous. This election boils down to Americans deciding between Country First and the New World Order. I would think you would be thrilled with the socialist buyout, Chester. It's right up your alley. Me, I bought stock on Friday. It's doing well. And no, PO (PU) doesn't have a nice ring to it.

Anything that slaps down the absurd emphasis on American exceptionalism has my vote. We're not God's anointed, no matter what Palin's pastor and Jim Bramlett might say. There is only one race - the human race. BTW, I definitely like the idea of punishing the fat cats for getting us into this mess in the first place, and I find it extremely immoral that they get bailed out by the government while at the same time the poor schnnok who got sweet talked into a bad mortgage is told he has to suffer the consequences of his bad decision. Then again, when has money ever NOT run this country. I seriousl hope that this is the first shot in returning to a government of, by, and for the people. If this be socialism, by all means let's have more of it.

You justify murder for convenience sake while admitting you have no conscience at all regarding the loss of innocent life. You so ignorantly claim that we must embrace the right to kill our perfectly healthy unborn progeny in order to prevent the Government from ever having the power to demand we do it. A more twisted way of rationalizing and justification for willful infanticide is hard to comprehend, once again confirming that you are a true reprobate. I realize you wont directly respond to anything I say here, just as you didn't respond directly to my post above. Because we all know that you completely ignore any truth placed in front of you as you sit back and insult the author.

"09-24-2008","11563",22,"Galactababe","324968","Sigma: Allow me to educate you. The following is a link to a variety of recent polls conducted on the subject. With the exception of CNN (Commie News Network) you will see that when you factor in the ""unsure"" or ""undecided"", the pro-life and pro-choice are pretty much a dead heat. A clear majority of Americans oppose late term abortion. And, since this thread relates to Gov. Palin, I found the Quinnipiac poll to be very telling which asked voters if they disagreed with a political candidate on the issue of abortion could they vote for them anway, a whopping 69% responded ""yes"". http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm","Archangel","324980","And don't forget that proponents of abortion can skew poll results by asking questions that get the answers they want. For example, I was polled once and the question regarding abortion was, ""Do you support the woman's right to end her pregnancy in the event of rape or incest?"" We all know that the majority of Americans would answer YES to that question. But to then extrapolate from that that I would support abortion on demand is totally false, but that is what that poll was used to do. So let's not think for a minute that the opposition is either honest or truthful in supporting their criminal agenda. They understand the importance of perception, even if that perception is based on a lie.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","08:38 AM","abortion-debates","330"
