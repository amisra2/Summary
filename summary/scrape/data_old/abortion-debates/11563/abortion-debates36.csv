If the profetallifers here want to say it's a person from the moment of conception - GOOD!! If some posters here equate personhood with birth - GOOD!! If some here want to equate a ZEF with a parasite - GOOD!! If still others say that ""personhood"" is conferred at some point in ZEF development - GOOD for them as well. The Pro-choice group has a big tent - just so long as no one tries to impose her/his will through law on anyone else.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","04:05 PM","abortion-debates","529"

"10-15-2008","11563",36,"Colonel Ingus","328144","Glad to see that you agree that it's a FACT ...the same that a ZEF is not a baby ( yet ). Well done. Your reasoning skills appear to be improving","Ryuuichi","328147",">_> I know see why pro-lifers tend to have to resort to screaming. Its like you people are deaf not that they're any better. *sighs* I give up you keep calling it a parasite. That doesn't make it true but that will make it easier for the government to completely take away our reproduction rights. After all having parasites invading women's bodies after being created by a man (because after all her eggs don't help create the baby) is a health concern. The only thing we can do is perform sterialization on everyone except the elite (because the pay not to be steralized) we grow babies in machines and give them to surrogate parents to raise.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","01:09 PM","abortion-debates","537"

We're proud of you. See what you can learn when you don't visit those anti-choice web sites? I know it may be hard for you to chew gum and think about more than one thing at a time but couldn't you have at least taken a minute and read what was said the previous couple of thread pages? Only a simpleton could take two completely different subjects and confuse them.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","01:10 PM","abortion-debates","538"

Not to mention the fact that a woman's own body sees it as a parasite , which is the who entire reason for her body having a placenta and producing Neurokinin B So to summarize, if someone as an individual wants to ignore the FACTS, then that's fine, but the FACTS of the matter have been DOCUMENTED and the womans own body PROVES it is true that a ZEF is a parasite.

Thanks for playing along. Do not stand in an upright position until the ride comes to a full stop It is a parasite when you don't want it. It is a baby when you do. This is a dangerous precipice to draw near to. Once you fall into the pit of granting value to human life based upon what you desire about that life, then you cannot complain when someone stronger than you deems your life less valuable and seeks to destroy it for the same rationale. You cannot retreat into the ""viability"" option and the inherent value of human life at this point, because the antagonist needs only to strip you of your humanity by describing you in sterile and cold words in order to justify his action.","Ryuuichi","328160",">_> She has a placenta to feed and protect the child. How about you do some research. *sighs* Yes you keep harping about it being a parasite now, and don't forget to continue missing the obvious! http://www.pregnancy-info.net/about_placentas.html And here's something debuting your ""parasite"" theory: http://www.l4l.org/library/notparas.html http://www.renewamerica.us/columns/huston/060803 If you've read the links I have a question. How is abortion so much morally higher than drowing a baby in a toilet or ripping it into pieces. Answer: It isn't. So honestly get off your high horse. I'm fine with abortion its just this holier than thou attitude that irks me on both sides. Its a minature developing human being. Abortion is stopping its development and killing it. Whoopie de doo oh wait but acknowledging that would sort of eliminate the whole anti death penatly argument wouldn't it? Don't want that! But if its a parasite we need to admit that we were parasites too wouldn't we! I guess the human race is a parasitic. It would seem genocide was the way to go after all! O_O http://sistertoldjah.com/archives/20...09/its-a-baby/ As the sister states what were you in your mother? A fetus or a parasite? Seriously I'm dying to know. And you should mull over this quote for a while it might enlighten you somewhat. I already know this but you probably haven't realised it yet:","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","01:54 PM","abortion-debates","540"
