"10-12-2008","11563",35,"Galactababe","327634","I don't care if you don't believe the 10 or so links I posted. I had a very good friend many decades ago, who when we were teenagers, had an abortion. She suffered such severe depression afterwards she attempted suicide. The patient was in a private room. I even remember the room number, 724. That was one of the gold coast rooms. The woman, in her early or mid-thirties, was married to someone really important, with a lot of connections. She came in with severe pelvic sepsis and she died. I remember her so vividly because she was one of the most beautiful women I had ever seen. She was also one of the sickest . She was ashen. When I first saw her, she was still conscious and lucid. I think she suspected she might die. She had kidney failure. Then all her other systems failed as well. She got ecchymosis-red blotches all over her skin. Her blood vessels were just breaking underneath her skin, sort of like what happens when you bruise yourself, but this was happening all over her body without anyone even touching her. It was due to a disturbance of her coagulating mechanism as a result of the overwhelming sepsis. She died two or three days after she was admitted. I remember thinking, "" My God! How could anyone do that to this beautiful woman ?"" But I completely misunderstood what I was looking at. In those days the tendency was to treat the woman as the helpless victim of this monster called the abortionist. I completely missed the fact that she had obviously sought it out, and with her connections, it would have been one of the better ones that money could buy. I was so shocked by what had happened to her and the way she died that I actually was physically ill. My political ideas in those days were pretty primitive. Like most medical students, I was just trying to survive it all. However, primitive though I was, she did touch something at some level in me. I was angry that she had died, and I was angry at the system that let her die. As I said, in those days I thought the solution was to jail the abortionist. It took me another twenty years to fully understand that it was the system and not the abortionist who killed her. The system forced her away from the medical community and into the shadowy world of the illegal abortionist. By the time she got to a doctor, it was too late. The system, and especially the lawmakers who left her with no choice , killed her just as surely as if they had held the catheter or coat hanger. I'm still angry. It was all so unnecessary.","Colonel Ingus","327655","Obviously you do, or you wouldn't have posted your biased rant Is that the best you can do is post anecdotes? No wonder you're so uneducated on this topic, you're still living in the 70's When ( and if ) you ever wake up you might notice that in TODAYS world women are counseled much better then they were decades ago. Imagine that. So if it's anecdotes that you want to post, then here is one from a doctor who witnesses an innocent woman die before abortion was legal in this country. Try and read it and imagine her as being your friend decades ago Lest We Forget this is the real reason why we fight to support womans rights. Pro-Choice = My body, my choice. Your body, your choice.

Feelings of regret after abortion are rare . Indeed, the most common emotional response after abortion is relief. Post-abortion stress syndrome PASS or PAS sounds scientific, but don't be fooled it's a made-up term. Not recognized as an official syndrome or diagnosis by the American Psychiatric Association , the American Psychological Association, or any other mainstream authority , it is a bogus affliction invented by the religious right . link","Colonel Ingus","327818","Take your head out of the sand.

"10-13-2008","11563",35,"Ryuuichi","327589","Parasites don't turn into different beings when they grow. To hide itself from attack by the mother's immune system, the placenta secretes Neurokinin B containing phosphocholine molecules. This is the same mechanism used by parasitic nematodes to avoid detection by the immune system of their host. link","Colonel Ingus","327835","Well thank you for publicly showing your ignorance on what the woman's placenta is for Apparently neither you nor archangel ever took even a rudimentary sex education class, so we'll try to bring you up to speed in this Cliff Notes version. My apologies to Cliff Notes Without a placenta a woman's body would attack the ZEF just like any other parasite . Now I know that your question is either something that either you just made up , or that like a parrot, you are just repeating because you read it on a anti-choice web site and think that it means something, but unfortunately for you what you said has NOTHING to do with the actual DEFINITION of the word 'parasite'. Never-the-less, it's easy enough to shoot down your claim. In your anti-choice simplistic way of thinking you seem to think that there is only one classification of parasite, but that is not the case. Parasites vary in the ways they use their hosts. A ZEF would technically be known as a endoparasite . Liver fluke, Schistosoma, Haemonchus, Eye Flukes and Ascaris all start out as being a parasite - and then change into something else. Leeches will feed on the blood or tissues of their hosts, but when released in water survive as free-living organisms. There is no rule that says that a parasite needs to stay a parasite it's entire life cycle. Apparently you didn't know that. You would have if you would have researched what a parasite was . Any lights going on yet above your head? No? Then it's time for you to learn some BASICS about how a woman's body actually works. Another clear biological clue that a ZEF is a parasite is that when invaded by a parasite, a host characteristically triggers its immune response. This immune response is a cellular reaction that works to destroy the invading parasite. In-fact some parasites are so clever that they've come up with a way to 'trick' the immune response, known as Neurokinin B ( more on this later ). When a woman first becomes pregnant, that is EXACTLY what a woman's body does. Her immune system tries to attack the developing Zygote. IN-FACT it is the whole reason why the ZEF needs to be separated from the woman's blood supply via the placenta ( there's that word again ) Once the egg is fertilized that process creates a barrier around the egg that protects it from the mothers immune system. Imagine that. If a mother has an immune disease, the chances of miscarriage can be higher. This is medical fact. In-fact one of the reasons why women have miscarriages is because a woman's body detects the ZEF as a parasite and her body gets rid of it. Maybe you didn't know this but many women get colds around the time of implantation. The reason why is because the immune system of a pregnant woman is suppressed while she is first becoming pregnant to help prevent embryo rejection during implantation. That BIOLOGICAL FACT right there PROVES that a woman's body 'sees' a ZEF as a parasite.

The Placenta attaches to the mothers uterine wall from the child's naval and is the means by which the child is fed nutrients from the mothers body. It is the very organ by which you claim the infant is a parasite since if the baby wasn't fed, it would die. If it died, obviously the body would attack it as a foreign intruder. But there is no such antibodies in a woman which naturally attacks a baby. Only someone with your extremely limited knowledge could take so much space writing off topic gibberish. You really need to get educated regarding the simple realities of what procreation is. And oh yeah, this link: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7081298.stm say's placenta's ACT like parasites, it doesn't say they are parasites at all. Do you understand the difference between Acts like and is something? It appears that comprehension is above your pay grade. Just as this sentence is totally ignorant and just shows how you're reaching for straws here. You said: If a mother has an immune disease, the chances of miscarriage can be higher. This is medical fact. In-fact one of the reasons why women have miscarriages is because a woman's body detects the ZEF as a parasite and her body gets rid of it. IF THE MOTHER HAS AN IMMUNE DISEASE? that proves somehow that the baby is a parasite? The disease is an unnatural side affect of the pregnancy experience and is not the babies fault. So your claim is blaming the baby for some frailty in the ""mothers"" immune system which is categorized as a DISEASE .","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","10:09 PM","abortion-debates","520"
