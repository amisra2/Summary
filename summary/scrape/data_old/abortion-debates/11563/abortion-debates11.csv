BTW, you DO know, of course, that if you must resort to personal imprecations , that you have lost the substantive debate. Face facts, the world has changed, and your choices are either to change with it or go extinct. That's the way of evolution and the world, you old dinosaur you. We who favor a woman's right to choose and the right of same gender folks to marry are the future; you represent the dustbin of history. We will not be content to live in your closet.","Archangel","323773","How in the world is accurately describing and exposing the lies and mischaracterizations that you spew in any way considered an ad hom? You just refuse to make any sense at all. And would you please learn proper word usage to describe what you intend to say? In other words, show where I made any imprecations at all above. And just so you know what the word means, here's the definition of it. imprecation - the act of calling down a curse that invokes evil (and usually serves as an insult); ""he suffered the imprecations of the mob"" malediction curse, execration, condemnation - an appeal to some supernatural power to inflict evil on someone or some group Can you show where I even attempted to place a curse of any kind on you? That's anti christian ya know. Regarding the bolded, I actually agree with you in part. The only problem that you're too spiritually dead to appreciate is that, that future will lead to our destruction as a civilization. You see cap0, that's why traditionalists like us stand against your reprobate value system. We are actually attempting to save you immoral atheists from your own self destruction.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","01:05 PM","abortion-debates","152"

Man I'm so sick of the argument you don't believe in god therefore you are immoral. I could arguably say I'm more moral than you since I'm not scared of some Santa Claus in the sky! There's nothing wrong with abortion. I do agree with some people than when people expect the goverment to pay for it they should be laughed right out of the office. You want an abortion pay for it out of your pocket not mine. Also the abortion as birth control irritates me but I wouldn't try to make it illegal. It is there right to render themselves infertile after all. Though I wonder why no one has brought up an abortion like option for men yes its a women's right to choose but I don't agree that if a woman gets pregant a man should have to suck it up and pay for the child. He should get the same option as a woman. To terminate (his relationship and any ties with the child not the child itself that is the woman's body after all) the child so that no matter what she does she can't force any money out of him. (Has seen the pregant trick used to ensnare decent men too often) I mean right to choose shouldn't just be with women. Equality after all.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","05:25 PM","abortion-debates","157"

It has forever been the cry of those who, just as King Cnut tried in vain to hold bck the tide, try to stem the progress of civilization.

"09-15-2008","11563",11,"Galactababe","323769","How pathetic that you consider those who abort children and couples who cannot biologically produce children together to be ""the future"". Sounds to me as though they are rather bent on elimination of their kind.","chester","323828","Seems to me we have more to fear from overpopulation than underpopulation. If you're really worried, please don't be; hard working immigrants will make up the difference.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","05:30 PM","abortion-debates","159"

So far, not a single one of the profetallifers here has put forth a single rationale as to why if should be the government. That excludes you, babe, because you made it clear that you are both on the pro-choice side and soft on ""crime"".","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","07:48 PM","abortion-debates","163"
