"09-04-2008","11563",1,"iangb","322514","I have no issue with this, wrt abortion. What I have an issue with is that a fertilised egg cannot 'persue happiness', or enjoy any particular liberty - partly because it is still inside the mother, but largely because, as a mere minute collection of cells, it is not self-aware. What you have with a fertilised egg is not a 'man', but something that will eventually (possibly) become a 'man'.","charlie horse","322516","Part of the problem with the abortion issue goes with our perception of the value of animal life in general. We see a fly and swat it. We see a rat and set a dog on it. We see a cockroach and stamp on it. Pests. No problem. But when elephants trample villages, or other warm-blooded mammals become pests, there's an outcry about the destruction method. We don't see giant sledgehammers swatting elephants! - practicalities aside. Destruction has to be humane. And when it suits our purposes. It seems that cuddly, warm-blooded, embryo look-alikes get more emotional feeling than flies, cockroaches, mosquitos et al. From a strictly 'argument' point of view, emotion shouldn't enter the picture. If pro-lifers/anti-abortionists looked at the issue dispassionately and rationally (difficult, I know), then they may well end up with a different viewpoint. How do we take the emotion out of argument?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","12:22 PM","abortion-debates","4"

Every law we make is because of emotions, however logic and reason are the primarily what are used when deciding to or not to enact a law. Making a law that says anyone who bullies another should be sent to a work camp and spend their lives there is based on emotion, however it is not logical. The law against murder however, is to deter more murders from happening and therefore stopping murders, preventing emotional distress. This is logical, because society would degrade if murder were legal. Making abortion illegal however, is based soley on emotion. Sure, seeing things that slightly resemble humans being killed can be emotionally disheartening, however when logic, reason, and science are used you will discover that these little creatures have no mental existence. Therefore, there is no reason for them to have rights, because mental existence is the basis for rights.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","06:40 PM","abortion-debates","14"

With nationalized health care the government will determine the medical treatments women get in their healthcare. They will be making decisions for women in many many many more health issues than pregnancy. I am against national healthcare and believe that women (even men for that matter) can make decisions for themselves regarding their own health. With regard to abortion - which is the killing of a human life - I think there should be a law against killing 8 month old babies who are inside a womb as there are laws against killing 7 month old babies who have been outside of the womb for .0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 00000000000000000000000000000000001 seconds. Just as there are laws against killing 4 year olds, 10 year olds, 46 year olds and so on. As I am sure you know there were laws against abortion in the past before a few judges decided to decisionalize whether or not 40,000,000+ people get to continue living or are allowed to be killed. Personally, I disagree that 3 or 4 judges should be allowed to stand between a baby and their obstetrician and pediatrician. You asked, ""Why do they have such a deep distrust of a woman's ability to make decisions?"" There is no magical deep distrust of a woman's ability to make decisions that exists with those who are pro life. This is a wrong perception. I fear you have been led astray by the liberal feminist pro abortion movement to equate women's rights and feminism with abortion rights. They would have you believe they are one and the same but they are not. Governor Palin is an amazing example and proof that women's rights + feminism are not the same as abortion rights.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","09:00 PM","abortion-debates","19"

I think the choice to give life and carry it to term, regardless of how that life came to be (with the exception of rape victims) should become the preferred choice, because it is the right thing to do.

However, there should continue to be HS health classes, and yes 4th and 5th grade students should learn the basic reproductive functions their bodies will soon be capable of.

Alaska does not currently receive federal Title V funds. As of 2002, the Kaiser Family Foundation publication that I mentioned earlier reported that Alaska was in a category of states requiring only that abstinence be stressed, but not necessarily to the exclusion of so-called comprehensive sex education. On the other hand, Alaska also did not require contraception information in sex ed classes at that time. (PDF here.) Of course, just because Alaska is not receiving federal Title V funding does not mean the state is not practicing abstinence-only sex education, but I cant prove it one way or the other on line. Alaska curriculum standards (available as a PDF here) contain nothing more specific than the requirement that students understand the physical and behavioral characteristics of human sexual development and maturity and understand the ongoing life changes throughout the life span and healthful responses to these changes. (As a side note that everyone should keep in mind when we talk about curriculum standards, it is often a stretch to assume that there is any connection between what the bureaucrats dream up and what teachers actually do behind their closed classroom doors, although one might reasonably assume that, the more potentially controversial a subject, the more likely most teachers would be to follow district policy.)","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","07:03 AM","abortion-debates","147"

Obviously people don't give a darn about many of the laws in this country and do as they damn please anyway. However, there are repercussions, depending on which choice a pregnant woman makes. If she chooses to murder a defenseless, voiceless baby, is she claiming self-defense? Or is she pleading temporary insanity at the time of conception? I think the decision should be made under conditions where our government makes it easier to get pre-natal care and place babies into the adoption system with less red tape. I think the choice to give life and carry it to term, regardless of how that life came to be (with the exception of rape victims) should become the preferred choice, because it is the right thing to do. Not because God says so, not because pro-lifers say so, but because we all need to be responsible for our actions. Please note that you make no qualification for rape and incest victims. In fact you make a point of saying it's your preferred choice ""regardless of how that life came to be"". Well, guess what, it's my preferred choice as well. But it is a choice, not the only choice, and by saying that, you clearly believe that, although they may not be your PREFERRED choice, other choices should exist.

Under Substantive Due Process, without a compelling State need to restrict the woman's freedom or violate her privacy disallowing abortion was not justified and so was struck down. Privacy is ""implicit in the concept of ordered liberty"". Justice Potter Stewart, a judge on the Roe v Wade case said in his concurring opinon: Several decisions of this Court make clear that freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. . . . As recently as last Term, in Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.

"09-18-2008","11563",15,"Phyllis","324195","No, because even if privacy is fundamental within the meaning of substantive due process (a proposition I would dispute), extending that to encompass abortion is not plausible because abortion cannot possibly be thought to be a component of the kind of privacy that is deeply rooted in this nation's tradition and history. How do we know? Because abortion was restricted in virtually every state from the early 1800s until 1973.","Sigma","324206","""Kind of privacy""? I'm not certain what you mean. Several aspects of personal life have been consistently part of privacy and have been protected by SCOTUS. For example: Loving v. Virginia . If not found within the Fourteenth Amendment's liberty clause and the implicit right to privacy, where would the basis for the decision be found that the State could not infringe upon a person's right to marry another of a different race? And since Loving, the Supreme Court has consistently held that the personal rights recognized in the case are protected by the right to privacy. In Carey v. Population Services (involving the right to contraception) and Zablocki v. Redhail (involving the right to marry), the Supreme Court held: While the outer limits of this aspect of privacy have not been marked by the Court, it is clear that among the decisions that an individual may make without unjustified government interference are personal decisions relating to marriage, Loving v. Virginia ; procreation, Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson ; contraception, Eisenstadt v. Baird ; family relationships, Prince v. Massachusetts [and] Meyer v. Nebraska . Procreation, conception, marriage, family life. All of these reasonably and rationally relate to the decision whether or not to terminate your pregnancy. It absolutely flows naturally with other protected areas of private life. Just looking at the two cases of Griswold v. Connecticut and Eisenstadt v. Baird , right to contraception cases, whether or not you have a child is a personal and private decision constitutionally protected from governmental interference. In Eisenstadt v. Baird , the Court extended the marital right to privacy in Griswold to unmarried individuals and explained that: if the right to privacy means anything, it is the right of an individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.

Most pro-life people agree that abortions that are necessary to save the mother's life are acceptable.

While the language is similar in both cases, the two rights (not to be deprived of liberty and not to be deprived of life) do not apply equally in this issue. While the woman's liberty is protected by the Constitution, the life of the fetus is not. At least, if one takes Archangels simplistic view of the Constitution. Whether the protection the Constitution affords can be stripped is somewhat moot. There are no clash of rights within the Constitution. Aye, but re: abortion only one of those has any relevance. Namely, the State's interest in preserving liberty. However, speaking solely of what the Constitution protects, obviously liberty is the more important right in this issue than life. Ultimately, and obviously, Archangels simplistic view of the Constitution is false and there are additional checks before a State can violate certain liberties but this does illustrate some interesting points.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","10:38 PM","abortion-debates","221"

Yes, the burglar may be infringing upon your liberty, but you may not kill him because of that. If you must analogize it to the burglar, than it would apply this way. Most pro-life people agree that abortions that are necessary to save the mother's life are acceptable.

At this point I really don't care. If she gets pregant and decided to keep it she should be on her own. That's her decision, no help from the government, no help from anyone that doesn't willing want to give it. If she wants to get a abortion the same rules apply. Fine let's not waste time or resources being responsible for people who deem themselves responsible enough to handle consequences. That's it I really don't give a hoot anymore. Our government should mind its own business and let people float or sink on their own. I don't see why it even interferes as much as it did. Our taxes shouldn't be wasted trying to support someone else's decision. Something personal that belonged to only them. They should dig that money out of their own pocket and deal with their business. This whole pro-life and pro-choice argument wouldn't even matter if the gov't realised that. I suppose a fetus isn't a human being then? I suppose for the first year of your life you weren't a human being just something else. Something freakishly inane and strange. A non-being if you will. You were a parasite that was most likely willing placed into your host. Then that host decided to keep you for who knows what reason and either raise you or give you to another to be raised. Abortion is simply the destruction of the parasite. So in the end I guess a human being life is nothing more than a statstic eh? The destruction of a parasite feeding on the earth. Not that I really care. Some kid offs himself *shrug* another statistic, some woman was raped and butched *shrug* another statistic it makes no difference anymore. The Twin Towers *shrugs* Terriost attacks are common everywhere else. Global Warming? People are bound to go exinct...we just have a rough timeline now. Raids and genoicide? So what who cares their just people who are inconviencing me. My country wastes money trying to help them. They are merely an inconvience therefore they are expendable. All human life is expendable. We are no more important than dogs or cats. We place far to much value on ourselves as well as far to much importance. Human beings can destroy the world Feh! The only thing that will be destroyed are human beings. Though yes now that I've come to my senses I see there really isn't an issue it's a woman's choice, her body. If the woman wants to kill her child let her do it. Just let her do it out of her own pocket. If I man wants to abandon his child let him do that as well. The government shouldn't intervene in family matters at all wheter abuse, incest, neglect or rape is going on its none of their business. That is personal business after all especially if the victim denies it. So where is the line for personal business and the government's business.

Truly there isnt. The entire pro-choice mentality is denying that there should be legal consequences for choosing to terminate. There is nothing wrong with thinking that abortion is unpleasant or that women should choose to keep their pregnancies. It is just important to recognize the difference between disagreeing with what a woman does with her life and controlling a womans life. This is a philosophical question, is it not? I enjoy hearing different opinions on the subjects so, please, share your thoughts, Ryuuichi . There is a man who had his brain removed from his body. His brain is still fully conscious and can see and talk out of special equipment. His body is kept alive, and is unchanged besides the missing brain. Where is the person, the being ?

You can still have passionate sex, even promiscuous wild sex and still make the odds against pregnancy slight( maybe not STDs though) Yes the man should be sensible and responsible but the woman is the 'keeper of the gate' so to speak and should be the one in control for her own sake. Modern society gives women all the tools to control whether they become pregnant or not and it is amazing that there are so many unwanted pregnancies in the USA and Europe. I really am not being sexist when I say that it is the responsibility of the woman to ensure that the act of lovemaking does not make her pregnant, it is just sensible because is is going to happen to THEM not the feckless father. Coersion, rape , etc is another horrible factor but must be debated seperately, I believe. Should there be abortion on demand? If you say no, there is a thousand examples where this has ruined lives. If you yes then another thousand answers that have ruined lives in a different way. So you can't really make a wise decision on abortion. You can say that it can be permissable within certain conditions but this is still allowing it . Once it is allowed the perameters will almost certainly be expanded.

It is the means we would necessarily have to use to save that life that is immoral to some (myself included).

Because that's what governments do. Why is the government a better determinate of how fast I drive, how much I drink, or who I kill. Governments are by nature designed to limit our personal freedoms and use violence, if necessary, to enforce it. It's all part of how we get along. In a democracy that seems to pride itself on erring toward the freedom side of the equation, we get to argue among ourselves, come to a grudging consensus, draw lines, and pass laws. If I have a sickly infant, can't afford the extensive medical care, why shouldn't I be allowed to euthanize my child. Who would know my situation better than me. Well, people have argued about this, come to a grudging consensus, drawn lines (no killing the baby), and passed laws (try it and we'll fry your a$%). So getting back to the topic at hand, we still seem to be arguing among ourselves. The very grudging consensus is somewhere around the end of the 2nd trimester (the line), and we're even arguing over who gets to write the law (state or federal). This is what living in a democracy is about, having a say in which personal freedoms are limited and how it effects the common good (others). Your question presumes that only one party is involved, the pregnant woman. My response is that two parties are involved and government should be involved to protect the common good (aka little Zef). I state that the grounds on which I find Zef to be a second party as follow; Zef has a separate and unique DNA profile, different from the mother's. And in some cases Zef may even have a different blood type than the mother. Zef can be classified by forensic (DNA) means as a human being. The biological relationship between mother and child is symbionic in nature, qualifying as two enities and not one.. So I have therefore come to the conclusion that Zef is a separate, unique human being and therefore, Zef's human rights should be preserved.

Agreed: No one can prove or disprove a metaphysical belief, hence the term meta (beyond) physics (the observable). Any government would be ill advised to base laws on metaphysical perceptions. There are many in this country who believe there is a new person from the moment of conception. Others would place ""personhood"" at some point in fetal development. There are still others who say that personhood = birth. I personally put ""personhood"" as having held a job for at least 3 years. All are sincerely held but ultimately unprovable assertions. In light of this, I say that it ill behooves any government to favor one metaphysical construct over another; it must maintain strict neutrality and leave the decision to the one person capable of making a choice about her particular pregnancy - the woman herself. I have based my argument on biological distinction, which for me puts the line at conception. If one were to try and argue where life begins or when a fetus is viable, then the metaphysical paradox kicks in. I counter this by stating that at conception life does not begin anywhere, but that life continues from a living egg and living sperm joining to create a unique and separate being. With that being said; we as a society need to resolve some fairly massive sociological problems first. A major shift in perception (how we view the problem) and action (what we are willing to do about it) must occur. Unfortunately, we are also sorely lacking in wisdom. Unwanted pregnancies are going to happen. What are alternate ways to deal with it. How do we minimize the cost in both lives and emotions. Until this is resolved, a change in laws will cause more harm than good and prove unsuccessful. My goal is probably the same as most people here.

Yes, laws prohibiting stealing limits the liberty of one person while protecting the liberty of another. In the end it is a wash. Slavery is so abhorrent not only just because of the loss of freedom, but the dominion over another person in pervasive and complete ways. Basic decisions such as: who I have babies with, do I have a baby now, do I give blood, am I an organ donor, do I eat now or later, what do I eat, when do I sleep and other decisions that seem more fundamentally personal are decided by an outside agency. This strips more than freedom away, it strips dignity and, in some sense, humanity away. This is where the comparison comes from. Perhaps it is wrong to draw a similarity between the complexity that was slavery to this more simple issue, but I think that the horror that many women view the necessarily draconian measures that would have to be put in place to effectively administer a complete moratorium on abortion to be similar in many important respects to slavery. I think it is. Currently there are many safe and effective measures to terminate pregnancy. These would have to be actively denied to pregnant woman who do not wish to be pregnant, effectively making it a requirement that pregnant women must continue their pregnancies by law.

"09-25-2008","11563",25,"Phyllis","325132","As I have been trying to point out, whether the fetus is a human being is not the consequential assumption/fact here. The most consequential question comes before that: why would it matter if it is a human being--the ""so what?"" of the question. So am I. So are you. I don't know why this is the line. Mental existence, in practical terms, is totally meaningless to, say, a one day old infant. What do you understand ""mental existence"" to be, and why do you think it is the threshold one must attain in order to have rights? And, while you're at it, what do you mean by ""rights?"" No. What we have from the moment of conception is a biologically distinct, developing being that is human. If left in its natural environment, this little cell will develop, not into a human being, but into a particular kind of human being: a fetus; then infant; then adolescent; then teen; and then adult. This is not potential human life. This is human life. What we have prior to conception is a sperm or egg. These are not developing human beings. They have no more potential in themselves to develop into, say, an infant than asphalt does. If left in their natural environment, neither the sperm nor the egg will ever enter this process of development. I simply cannot see how one can say there is no difference in these two entities. The difference is abundantly clear. I realize there could be genuine questions of whether the embryo has moral value; but I do not think there can be any serious discussion about whether the embryo is manifestly different from an egg or sperm.","Shooterandproud","325156","Well, if it wasn't a human being it would not have the same rights as a real human being. Fair enough, but we are a mentally existent bunch of dividing cells. We are not just an empty body. A fetus would be more comparable to a severed body part, or a brain dead person. Well, if mental existence isn't the basis of rights, then what is? If something does not mentally exist, then why should they deserve rights? They cannot be harmed or pleased, they don't give a care what happens around them. They are non mentally existent. Should a blade of grass have rights? I won't argue that it is human life. There are all kinds of human life, just like you, me, my kidney, and my skin cells. However a mere set of proteins is not the basis of rights, it is mental existence. I think most would agree. You do grasp this concept, right? I agree with this, however if left in its natural environment a tumor will also develop. Just because something may be natural is not grounds for allowing it to grow at the cost of someone else. Of course the embryo is different, however a mere difference is not the basis for any rights. Let me give a scenario. An alien decides to come to earth for some reason. He has a universal translator on him, and speaks our language. He looks radically different, however he can make conversation and perform everyday tasks. He is sentient, and he has feeling and can feel pain. He brings along with him a plant species from his planet. The plant is obviously not sentient, and is very much like earth plants. Which alien deserves rights, the plant or the sentient alien and why?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","12:49 AM","abortion-debates","371"
"09-25-2008","11563",25,"Phyllis","325165","But why should we think that human beings have rights in the first place? That was what I was trying to get at. 1) Except that a severed body part will never continue along the line of development into an infant, child, adolescent, and then adult. 2)I also maintain that if we knew, with the same level of certainty that we know a fetus will ""recover"" from its brain dead state within 9 months, that a brain dead individual would essentially make a full recovery within nine months, we would not allow him to be removed from life support. Rights exist by virtue of what something is, not by virtue of what it possesses. Being a human being is the criteria for possessing human rights. You say one cannot be a human being without mental existence. I'm still not sure what you mean by this. Nor am I clear about what you mean by the word ""rights."" I will call attention to the brain dead example. I will suppose that a brain dead individual would not possess a mental existence within your meaning. If we knew that he would recover within 9 months, I would say he has the right not to be unplugged from the machine that would be sustaining his life in the interim. It would be immoral for us to do so if there were such a substantial certainty that he would make a full recovery by leaving him alone for a few months. Human beings do not possess rights because they deserve them. They possess rights simply because they are human beings. We don't give human beings their rights; we recognize rights that they already possess. And you think a one day old infant can be harmed and pleased? That they care what happens around them? We could administer anesthesia to an infant such that he be aware of neither harm nor pleasure. And an infant clearly has no care for what goes on around him. He has no self-awareness at all. You are asking the wrong question. The question is not whether something should have rights. The question is whether something does have rights. I don't sit in my castle and think about who I think I will give rights to; I possess no such power, and neither does any other person or government institution. Rights holding things possess those rights independent of you, me, or government. It's hard to grasp when I don't know exactly what you mean by either ""mental existence"" or ""rights."" You've used the term mental existence a lot, but I am not clear on exactly what you mean by it, or why you think it is a morally significant quality. I am equally unclear of what you mean by ""rights,"" because you have asked the question ""should X have rights?"" That question is nonsensical based on my understanding of what a human right is. So, if you could explain these terms more concretely, it might help me understand your view a little better. In my reply to you, I've had to make some assumptions about your terms that may not be true. That is not what I said. I did not say that, left in its natural environment, the fetus will develop. No, what I said is that, left in its natural environment, the fetus, a human being at one stage of development, will continue developing into more advanced stages. It will not develop into a human being because it already is that. It simply will enter into a more advanced stage, ultimately resulting in an infant, adolescent, teenager, then adult. This is not the argument I made. I was purely using the nature argument to demonstrate that a fetus is clearly different from an egg or sperm. And since you seem not to have understood that, I've used the nature argument again to demonstrate that the fetus is, in itself, compellingly different than a severed body part or a tumor. I do not think it is clear that either alien has rights. The question is not who deserves rights. Rights are inherent entities that and entity possesses by virtue of being what it is. Classical theory of rights based the possession of rights squarely on the existence of a Creator. The question for me, therefore, is would not be whether the alien deserves rights; rather it would be whether the Creator has endowed aliens with rights.","Shooterandproud","325173","Ok. Well, I would think it is to make everyone happier in general. I'm not quite sure what the basis of rights is, but they sure to make life better. 1) I am personally not concerned with what it may become. I am concerned with what it is in this state of development. 2) This would only be true if women were life support machines. When this brain dead person is harming someone else, does the person being harmed have rights? Right, but what if doesn't exist? It may exist physically, but it does not exist mentally. Then why do animals have rights, but plants lack them? That is true, however saying this is implying that women are just life support machines. If this brain dead person was somehow hooked up to someone else to keep him alive, then should the other person have the right to say ""I want off!""? Again, why do animals have rights? Yes and no. If you poke an infant, he will cry. If you bounce him up and down on your lap, he will (usually) start laughing. That does not mean that the infant does not mentally exist. I get what you're saying, however who then has these rights? Why a cat? Why not a fern? Mental existence is the quality of existing mentally. You would agree that a tree does not exist mentally? If I chopped your head off, would your body exist mentally? Wouldn't the morally significant part be your head? This is really something hard to explain, and AO does a better job than I. This is more of a question for him. What do you mean by this? I am only concerned about the stage in which it is at a certain point in time. Not what it could be, should be, or would be. These things are all different, however the principle is the same. Should something in a given point that lacks a mental existence have the rights to override a woman's right to her own body? Then we have to disagree here. Rights are for the protection of an individual from persecution. The alien is an individual, and it has rights no matter what color its skin is, or what its DNA says. The fact that it mentally exists, and can think for itself is the important part. If it can think and feel, it mentally exists. In a debate, religion must not be used as an argument for those who don't believe, or for political discussions. Rights were made to protect people from persecution and suffering.

That is an aberration of modern day atheists who have falsely and fraudulently injected that belief into the National psyche. What the founders were so serious about and intent on protecting the American people from was the unwanted imposition of some Government sponsored, endorsed, or required religion that the Federal Government mandated the people belong to or submit to. They rightfully understood that to force any religious beliefs on the people would represent the ultimate intrusion upon their thought life.

History is full of sorry examples, and I will not go into them. Laws have been written and repealed, all based on overall popular perceptions and religious beliefs. My argument has been based in biological distinctiveness. I can state for a fact, that a new born has the same biological distinctiveness at birth as when it was conceived. The same DNA coding. You can, in-fact, take a recently conceived embryo out of one mother and transfer it to another mother. The biological distinction remains, and you don't even have to use anti-rejection medication. I have also stated that the distinction occurs at conception, it doesn't start as ""body part"" and it does not develop over so many weeks. So why do we draw the line at X number of weeks? I have heard many arguments on the rights of the mother, and the limiting effect the abortion laws have. In spirit, in an ideal world, I whole heartedly agree with you on the pro-choice side. I am very much a civil libertarian. The only justifiable reason to curtail the rights of person is when they curtail or eliminate the rights of another. I have heard many arguments on the burden an unwanted pregnancy places on the mother, both financial and emotional and I empathize. I also heard this little voice in the back of my head. It's an old Joe Stalin quote from the 40's; ""A single death is a tragedy, a million is a statistic"", and lately, I have been thinking like a statistician. We draw lines based on empathy. There is a lot of wisdom in old Joe's quote. If it is happening to someone close, a single death is a tragedy. If is common place, happening outside of sight, to strangers, it's a statistic. A new born is cute, cuddly and scores high on empathy points. A fetus, in the early stages of development, is unseen, except by surgical means and scores low on empathy points, yet it is the same being, the same biological entity. We draw lines based on empathy. I have a unque and interesting personal perspective on this issue. I was born in 1956, when the line was drawn on date night, somewhere around 3rd base. The argument was about condoms at that time. A decade later, it was towards the end of the 2nd trimester. I was also born under one of the worst possible circumstances, to one of the worst possible mothers, and served the next 5 to 6 years as one of those unwanted children. Had it been a decade later, I am certain I wouldn't be writing this post, because anyone with any sense would have gotten her to a clinic.

Response: You do bring out my inner anarchist, I would love to see governments declared obsolete. The realist in me wouldn't want to live there. I'm way too trusting and a lousy shot to boot.

I have offer a biological argument as a definition of what constitutes a human being and all I hear are personal opinions based on proximity to a birthing canal, time in the ""oven"", and legal precedence.

If you were interested in a very brief overview, I would suggest the Declaration of Independence. If you were looking for something more detailed, I would suggest John Locke's Second Treatise on Civil Government . The short of it is that rights theory originated with the existence of rights being grounded in a Creator. 1) Again, the example of development demonstrates nothing more than the fact that an embryo is clearly different from a tumor or severed body part. It is not meant to show anything more than that simple fact. 2) I have said nothing about women as life support machines The brain dead example I gave was meant to suggest nothing more than the fact that a brain dead individual in the scenario I gave would (where we would have reason to believe he would fully recover) have rights, but no mental existence. Animals do not have rights; in some instances they have legal protections. But so do some plants and land. Do not confuse legal protections with moral rights. This is a bit off the scope of our subject. You may want to be careful with how you handle this hypothetical. If it would be immoral to remove the life support from a person who is brain dead in the scenario I gave (that is, in the event we would expect him to recover fully), then his rights are not a function of his mental existence. Well, at least it seems I've been clear in what I've said, which is a relief because when talking about theory, its easy to lose folks. The answer I would give to this question is that our Creator has endowed human beings with rights, and has not so endowed cats, ferns, etc. I would encourage you to sit down for a few minutes and really read through the Declaration of Independence. I know you've probably read it before as a historical document. But try to read it as a philosophical document. It is undisputed that it articulates the historical foundation of the concept of human rights, and I think it powerfully does so. I'd be interested to see what you think of this. You said earlier that you are not sure what the basis of our rights is. If you read the Declaration of Independence, you will know the historical answer to that question. Well, that makes it pretty hard to argue against the point. Maybe consider my example of the brain dead patient who will recover. That might help you and I understand what ""mental existence"" means, and more importantly, why it is morally significant. I was merely asking you what a ""human right"" is. That was all. The reason that I asked is that you have said some things that suggest that you believe human rights are divisible from human beings; that is, they do not possess their rights inherently. I got this idea from the fact that you have asked ""who should have rights?"" and ""does such-and-such deserve rights?"" To be clear, I am not saying that a fetus will develop into a human being. That being said, I was using the nature argument to demonstrate one thing, and only one thing: that a human embryo is quite clearly separate and distinct from either a tumor, skin cell, severed body part, etc. Therefore, trying to morally equivocate the embryo with a tumor on the basis that they are the same is not a valid inference. Let me phrase it this way: it indeed might be true that the embryo has no more moral value than a tumor. But if that is the case, it is not because the embryo is inherently the same as a tumor. It would have to be for some other compelling reason. Is that really the question? I would suggest it is not. Many people have argued that even if the fetus had a right to live, its right to live still wouldn't override a woman's right to her own body. I do not adhere to such dogmatic statements dismissing out-of-hand the validity of claims which appeal to a Creator. Neither would the framer's of the Declaration of Independence, which, as I have said, articulates (both historically and logically) the foundation of human rights.","Shooterandproud","325533","I have read the Declaration of Independence, and I understand what rights are. However, rights are moot if there's no one to enjoy then. One must consider that no everyone believes in a ""creator"" One must also consider the first amendment: freedom of religion. I am not denying that it is different, however in principle its the same. All three are groups living human cells that lack a mental existence. I am not concerned with what it may become, because under the right conditions a sperm may become a human being too. I am only concerned with what it is at a given period. Except of course when you compared women to life support machines in your last post. A brain dead individual is legally dead, and has no rights. You can have whatever opinion you want on ""moral rights"", however it is undeniable that animals have legal rights. You can word it however you want, however it will not change the simple fact that you cannot do whatever you want to an animal. A) It is not immoral to remove a brain dead person from life support. B) It is not off topic, and you still haven't answered my question. Would it be morally right to kidnap someone and hook them up to a dying person for 18 years? Again, you cannot assume that everyone in this country shares your religious belief. I do not take every historical document as literally as you do (the bible, the constitution, etc.) especially when its over hundreds of years old. The fundamental question remains, why have rights when there is no one to enjoy them? You make a good point, however a brain dead person that may recover is not physically and emotionally harming anyone. Here's a new question: What makes us humans better than other living organisms? The only more ""moral value"" an embryo has to a tumor is that it may have a mental existence. Physically you're right, they are different, however ""spiritually"" they are equivalent when you factor out the potential of an embryo. I agree with that. You can call my statement whatever you want, however I still stick to it. It would be equally ridiculous if I said ""I am right because the fairies say so, end of discussion"". Unless I can prove the existence of these fairies, the point is moot. The same applies to a creator. I do hold the Declaration of independence with weight, however it does not mean I adhere literally to every statement it makes. As I have stated above, it would be foolish to employ the use of the ""creator"" argument, because no one can know for sure if this ""creator"" exists. We must stick to what we already know.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","08:42 PM","abortion-debates","420"

Pro-choice advocates like to point out that there is a waiting list for adoption. There is a long waiting list for adoption, but only for healthy white babies. The waiting list for a baby with dark skin, eyes and hair is much shorter. There is no waiting list at all for babies with fetal alcohol syndrome, drug dependancies etc. If a woman does not want her child and would prefer to have an abortion, we can force her to carry it to term or have an illegal abortion, but how will we force her to stop drinking, smoking and using drugs? If we try to make doctors turn women in for harming their fetus, we will have women getting no prenatal care and having even sicker babies that no one wants. Teenage girls can get an abortion and have no one know she was pregnant, but once she's forced to carry the baby to term, there is social pressure that will be brought to bear to keep the baby. Most teenage girls who get pregnant are not going to have the economic and emotional support that Gov Palin's daughter will get from her family. I'm sure her and her husband to be will still go to college, will have a decent place to live, and will have good childcare for their baby. That is not an option for many if not the majority of girls in the same situation. Most of these girls will end up dropping out of school and becoming dependant on our failing social welfare system. We can force women/girls to have the baby, but we can not force them to be good, dedicated and attentive mothers. We already have plenty of examples of what bad, inattentive, abusive parents can do to a child and we would be legislating that we put more children in that situation. The economic costs of outlawing abortion would also be huge. The majority of abortions are not being chosen by married, financially stable women. We will have to shoulder the costs of prenatal care, childbirth, foodstamps, housing assistance, and unfortantely incarceration in our prisons for many of the children we will force mothers to bring into the world. The same people who want to outlaw abortion also commonly rail against welfare mothers and high taxes. We will get more of both if this ever goes through. Finally, this is a religious question because I only know the answer for my own religion. If a baby miscarries, what happens to that babies soul? We don't believe that the baby is sentenced to eternity in hell. We believe that it returns to heaven and is given another chance at life.

An interesting first post. I will deal with these points as they are fresh opinions here. It seems like you're saying that killing the healthy unborn child is preferable to holding irresponsible women culpable for their abusive and inattentive behavior. Since when do we make excuses for the criminal and even kill the victim in anticipation of their bad behavior? Don't you see how backward that type of thinking is? I'm not sure if you're aware of this but the abortion industry is a multi BILLION dollar annual industry. That means that the American people are spending that much for this type of birth control, which in literally 94% or so of cases, that is all abortions represent. And that is irresponsible women avoiding the need to take responsibility for their irresponsible actions. As a Born Again Believer, I can assure you it is more than a religious question for us. It is a quality of life issue, and a value of life issue. And in no way do I believe that when an unborn child is murdered in the womb that God sends him to hell. I can't imagine where you got such an idea. But neither do I believe that God has a revolving door in Heaven where aborted babies are recycled like we recycle plastic or paper. The bible very clearly say's that we have one life, and then the judgement. Of course aborted babies, like children who die before reaching the age of accountability aren't judged at all. So that isn't an issue for them. But they have still been deprived of the life that God intended for them, and He will hold the responsible parent(s) accountable for stealing that life from her own child. This is life and death of human beings we are talking about here kimara. It's not about economics, convenience or just personal responsibility. It's about valuing what is precious and vital to our humanity. It is our very offspring, our progeny. We valued that continuation of ourselves at one time. But this generation has become so selfish that we prefer to destroy our offspring with the excuse that if you make us bear it we will abuse it and raise criminals so better that we kill it in the womb while it is perfectly innocent and without any blemish or the stain of human sin. Can you grasp how utterly contemptible such an attitude is? From posts here, I fear most can't grasp that truth anymore. I'm not yelling at you kimara, I'm just venting.

That would be consistent with not knowing if its a person. But this ruling allows for pro-active intervention to END the life of a perfectly normal and developing child. That is not standing aside, but is actively ending a life before it has officially been deemed not to be a person.

In some instances, animals have legal protections, which are not the same things as rights. It would be if there was a near 100% certainty that he would recover within 9 months, assuming he only needed to be left alone for that time. I don't see why this matters. I'm not sure why physical and emotional harm are valid reasons to end a person's life. For example, some non-abusive parents discipline their children by inflicting pain. I would not say that this is a valid reason to end the parents' life. Similarly, some relationships involve much emotional pain. But that wouldn't justify ending the life of one of the parties. I'm not at all clear what this distinction between the physical and the spiritual. It seems rather unlike you to rely on spiritual propositions. And I don't. But at least we need not pretend that this debate hinges on whether the fetus is a person in possession of the right to live. You are applying one epistemological standard when it comes to the existence of a Creator, and another standard when it comes to the existence of anything else. Philosophically speaking, it is impossible to prove the existence of anything to the degree of certainty you seem to be demanding of a Creator. For example, you say mental existence is somehow morally significant. But, you in fact could not appeal to any moral principle to justify that claim that you could prove exists.","Shooterandproud","325649","I may have made a misstatement.

Correct, however again, women are not life support machines. Their rights must be taken into account. Then I suggest you read the first amendment.

It had nothing to do with women at all, either explicitly or implicitly. You do realize that some plants have legal protections as well? Are you willing to call these rights? They are not rights in either instance. The First Amendment clearly does not bar legislatures from enacting legislation based on morality. What I am legally entitled to do is use the force that is reasonably necessary to repel your attack.

But they are something that everyone wants, and they benefit the people who have them without harming others. The mental existence exists through indirect observation. If mental existence isn't morally significant, then what makes us any better than other life forms? You are correct that the existence of rights cannot be proven, but they are damn good to have. Why give them up if they are only doing good in the world? Unless this is a joke, why doesn't mental existence matter?

"09-30-2008","11563",31,"Phyllis","325809","No, I didn't. Before you repeat that charge again, forcing me to dryly reply that you are wrong, I suggest that you come up with some evidence and post it. Ok. If you want it that way, the only reason animals have legal protections is to benefit us humans. Sometimes people's moral views are based on their religious beliefs. Enacting laws thus informed is not barred by the First Amendment. These kind of questions are difficult to answer in the general abstract as you have posed them. The answer is, if I reasonably believed that deadly force was necessary to repel your attack, then I am legally justified in using the deadly force. If I could not reasonably believe that deadly force was necessary, and yet I use it anyway, that would not be legally justified. I would suggest that it is people who deny the existence of rights, but then pretend like they really do exist, who are living in a fantasy world. Are you sure about that? Can you really tell with any kind of certainty the exact moment when a fetus goes from having no mental existence to actually having it? The fact that we are human beings. And that term, as I use it, means simply: membership in the human family. The point is that you have a completely different standard when evaluating claims regarding religion than you do any other type of claim. That is very inconsistent. What makes you think they are doing any good? Do you only mean by that phrase that you, personally, happen to like them? What happens if some other civilization views them as good, but only if they can annihilate an entire race of people in gas chambers? What could you possibly appeal to? Morality is out; these propositions can't be proved. Rights are out; they don't exist. Where do we go from there? On what basis could we claim that, regardless of what the Nazi's believed about the Jews, they were wrong? On what basis could we claim that, regardless of what Southern slave owners believed about blacks, they were wrong? I am trying to show you that there are a lot of assumptions that seem to be built into your mental existence argument. I am trying to get at those assumptions to show you that some of them would present the exact same problem that you have with Creator-based arguments. So, what I was getting at is what makes mental existence morally significant? The answer to that is unprovable. You said that laws based on unprovable claims would be foolish; and yet you are arguing that laws should be based on this unprovable claim. I submit that the difference in these two scenarios has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that one person has a head, and the other does not. Suppose we knew with a great deal of certainty that the headless body on life support would fully recover within a couple of weeks if he remained on the life support. I would say that it would be wrong to disconnect him, and that he has the exact same rights as the person whose arm was cut off, but otherwise is completely fine. In real life, these brain-dead scenarios involve individuals who will not recover. Society has therefore come to the conclusion that disconnecting the life support is acceptable. However, I think it is pretty clear that if some advance in science came up with a cure for brain-deadness, and brain-dead folks started fully recovering, society would come to a completely different conclusion.","Shooterandproud","325820","""I also maintain that if we knew, with the same level of certainty that we know a fetus will ""recover"" from its brain dead state within 9 months, that a brain dead individual would essentially make a full recovery within nine months, we would not allow him to be removed from life support."" Nope. Abuse of animals is illegal, and it does not benefit or harm humans to not abuse animals. True, however morality should not play a major role in our laws, since many people have different morals. Universally accepted morals however (illegality of murder, theft) should be ok to legislate. And so relating this to a fetus, is there any other way to prevent it from inflicting harm on you (besides drugs, obviously)? I don't deny their existence, I just deny that somehow any group of cells with a certain type of protein sequence has more rights than a different group of dividing cells with a different protein sequence. Science can prove that. I believe that scientists have put mental development at around 21 weeks. Human, maybe. Being? No. A being implies an existence. You may have misread my post. I said that the existence of rights could not be proven. Why is what the nazis did wrong? Because those people did not wish to be gassed. Why is murder wrong? Because people don't wish to be murdered. If people don't want unnecessary harm caused to them, then they have the right to not. I believe in rights as something anything with a mental existence has, no matter what kind of DNA is in its cells. Whether it be human, elephant, or even Kling-On. If it has a mental existence, it should have legal protections from harm. I have already told you that something that cannot be proven should not be legislated. I cannot prove that humans have rights, however they contribute to the happiness and functionality of a society. What more do you want? I am asking that laws be based on common sense, not an unprovable claim. I would think that mental existence being the basis for rights should seem quite obvious. Have you read my last analogy? Ok, what if the headless body would fully recover? It could obviously not move, and not grow another head. It would be just a group of living cells and nothing more. Does it still have rights? I say no. I agree, but that's just because they will recover. Does a permanently brain dead individual have rights? It is a living human, however the only difference between it and regular human is a mental existence. What I was getting at is that you can lose any part of your body and still retain your rights, however this is not true of the head: the center of the mental existence.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","09:54 PM","abortion-debates","461"

The method for justification requires that they dehumanize the unborn children which is why they will refer to them as ZEFs and Zygotes. And is why they will use comparisons to the fertilized and unfertilized chicken egg, which we eat for breakfast. You see, either way, when debating this issue on such a simplistic level, they win by default because they have already lowered the standard of debate to that of a chicken egg. So, by just understanding the shallowness of their tactics, we win by not allowing them to dehumanize our human offspring to the status of an inhuman analogy. Remember that these people are attempting to justify the murder of our very own human offspring. And they know that as well as you and I do. What they must do is both justify their stance and maintain a clear conscience so they don't have to live with the guilt that they are in fact defenders of a pro murder philosophy. That is why no matter what common sense arguments you use with them, no matter how obvious and rational your reasoning, they will never accept or concede that their position is not only false and irrational, but is criminal and a pro-death philosophy which supports and encourages genocide. After all, it is painfully obvious that any doctrine which not only allows, but enables the killing of 1.4 million members of one particular class of American consistently, year after year can be described as nothing other than genocide. That is why they must dehumanize the unborn, because they don't want to admit that they are proponents of the Great American Genocide. So forgive them for their irrational debating style which results in them offering the most infantile and ignorant arguments in their attempts to justify their sociopathic and shortsighted gospel of death and destruction of our most innocent and silent demographic, who have no personal voice of their own with which to defend themselves.

"10-12-2008","11563",35,"Galactababe","327634","I don't care if you don't believe the 10 or so links I posted. I had a very good friend many decades ago, who when we were teenagers, had an abortion. She suffered such severe depression afterwards she attempted suicide. The patient was in a private room. I even remember the room number, 724. That was one of the gold coast rooms. The woman, in her early or mid-thirties, was married to someone really important, with a lot of connections. She came in with severe pelvic sepsis and she died. I remember her so vividly because she was one of the most beautiful women I had ever seen. She was also one of the sickest . She was ashen. When I first saw her, she was still conscious and lucid. I think she suspected she might die. She had kidney failure. Then all her other systems failed as well. She got ecchymosis-red blotches all over her skin. Her blood vessels were just breaking underneath her skin, sort of like what happens when you bruise yourself, but this was happening all over her body without anyone even touching her. It was due to a disturbance of her coagulating mechanism as a result of the overwhelming sepsis. She died two or three days after she was admitted. I remember thinking, "" My God! How could anyone do that to this beautiful woman ?"" But I completely misunderstood what I was looking at. In those days the tendency was to treat the woman as the helpless victim of this monster called the abortionist. I completely missed the fact that she had obviously sought it out, and with her connections, it would have been one of the better ones that money could buy. I was so shocked by what had happened to her and the way she died that I actually was physically ill. My political ideas in those days were pretty primitive. Like most medical students, I was just trying to survive it all. However, primitive though I was, she did touch something at some level in me. I was angry that she had died, and I was angry at the system that let her die. As I said, in those days I thought the solution was to jail the abortionist. It took me another twenty years to fully understand that it was the system and not the abortionist who killed her. The system forced her away from the medical community and into the shadowy world of the illegal abortionist. By the time she got to a doctor, it was too late. The system, and especially the lawmakers who left her with no choice , killed her just as surely as if they had held the catheter or coat hanger. I'm still angry. It was all so unnecessary.","Colonel Ingus","327655","Obviously you do, or you wouldn't have posted your biased rant Is that the best you can do is post anecdotes?

Without a placenta every pregnancy would end up as a miscarriage. Read 'em and weep Einstein: You spend so much time whining that you didn't even take a minute and ask yourself - if the placenta isn't protecting the ZEF - then why doesn't the ZEF just get its nutrients DIRECTLY from the womans blood supply. Way to go hot shot I don't have to, researchers have already confirmed this fact If I would have wanted to read some rhetoric from a anti-choice web site , I would have done it myself. Try again, and maybe this time stick to actual medical sources. Ta-ta Of course it is! One is a functioning BORN human being. The other is a wad of cells. If you can't distinguish the difference between the two then I suggest you get an education on the topic.
