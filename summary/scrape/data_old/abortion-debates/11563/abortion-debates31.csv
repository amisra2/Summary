"09-30-2008","11563",31,"chester","325643","Not so at all. The issue is exactly one of, as you put it, ""standing aside"". The Court declared that there a re many and varied metaphysical answers to the question of when personhood begins. This being the case, the Court simply declared that it was not going to be placed in the position of choosing among them. The choice had to rest where it most properly belongs, with the pregnant woman. If she felt that ""personhood"" waas conferred at conception, she had the right to mold her actions accordingly; if another woman felt that it was conferred at birth, she, too had the right to mold her actions in conformity with her beliefs as well. The problem is, as I see it, that you wanted the Court to choose from all these metaphysical beliefs the one that most nearly comports with your own. That the Court wisely refrained from doing.","Archangel","325701","Your denials are shallow and without merit cap0. You constantly revert from the courts decision to the woman's choice, while dancing around the issue of ethics and morality as you ignore even considering the rights of the unborn. You have tunnel vision that refuses to focus on the whole picture as that would require that you admit how wrong this pro-death doctrine is. Attempting to rationalize with you or your ilk is a waste of time.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","10:59 AM","abortion-debates","452"

Be that as it may, your myopia prevents you from seeing that the Roe decision was a masterpiece of judicial restraint. You want the Courts to choose one metaphysical theory of the origin of personhood over all others, never mind whose conscience, morals, and values get stepped on in the process. That the Court wisely decided not to do. If one woman's value system equates personhood with conception, she is free to act on that theory; if another woman's value system equates personhood with birth, she is equally free to act on that theory. For the rest of us, it is none of our concern. I personally think that equating a ZEF with a person in being and forcing a woman to be a slave to the ZEF is abhorrent , but, as a man, I don't have a dog in the fight.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","12:28 PM","abortion-debates","453"

"09-30-2008","11563",31,"Phyllis","325794","I didn't even do that. The brain-dead example was only meant to illustrate a point about mental existence. It had nothing to do with women at all, either explicitly or implicitly. You do realize that some plants have legal protections as well? Are you willing to call these rights? They are not rights in either instance. The First Amendment clearly does not bar legislatures from enacting legislation based on morality. What I am legally entitled to do is use the force that is reasonably necessary to repel your attack. If we are going to play it that way, then the existence of rights has not one shred of evidence behind it. Neither does the proposition that mental existence is morally significant. Like basing laws on the existence of rights? Or like basing laws on the proposition that mental existence somehow matters?","Shooterandproud","325804","You compared a fetus being sustained by a woman to a brain dead man being sustained by a life support machine. No, because they only reason these plants have protections is to benefit us humans. It does on religion. And if you shoot me and I just happen to die? Right, there is no evidence behind rights. But they are something that everyone wants, and they benefit the people who have them without harming others. The mental existence exists through indirect observation. If mental existence isn't morally significant, then what makes us any better than other life forms? You are correct that the existence of rights cannot be proven, but they are damn good to have. Why give them up if they are only doing good in the world? Unless this is a joke, why doesn't mental existence matter? Does a headless body kept alive on life support have the same rights as someone who's arm was cut off?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","06:36 PM","abortion-debates","458"
"09-30-2008","11563",31,"Phyllis","325809","Sometimes people's moral views are based on their religious beliefs. Enacting laws thus informed is not barred by the First Amendment.","chester","325814","The Taliban would certainly agree with you on this, as would the Ultra-Orthodox Jewish Rabbis in Israel who impose their religious views on marriage and divorce on the rest of the Israelis. Sharia or Talmudic law as the basis for the civil law would, I'm sure, set your teeth on edge. Why not say what you mean. Enacting laws based on the beliefs of certain Christian sects should not be barred by the First Amendment. Basing the civil law on religion can lead to many consequences, most of them negative.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","08:30 PM","abortion-debates","460"
"09-30-2008","11563",31,"Phyllis","325809","No, I didn't. Before you repeat that charge again, forcing me to dryly reply that you are wrong, I suggest that you come up with some evidence and post it. Ok. If you want it that way, the only reason animals have legal protections is to benefit us humans. Sometimes people's moral views are based on their religious beliefs. Enacting laws thus informed is not barred by the First Amendment. These kind of questions are difficult to answer in the general abstract as you have posed them. The answer is, if I reasonably believed that deadly force was necessary to repel your attack, then I am legally justified in using the deadly force. If I could not reasonably believe that deadly force was necessary, and yet I use it anyway, that would not be legally justified. I would suggest that it is people who deny the existence of rights, but then pretend like they really do exist, who are living in a fantasy world. Are you sure about that? Can you really tell with any kind of certainty the exact moment when a fetus goes from having no mental existence to actually having it? The fact that we are human beings. And that term, as I use it, means simply: membership in the human family. The point is that you have a completely different standard when evaluating claims regarding religion than you do any other type of claim. That is very inconsistent. What makes you think they are doing any good? Do you only mean by that phrase that you, personally, happen to like them? What happens if some other civilization views them as good, but only if they can annihilate an entire race of people in gas chambers? What could you possibly appeal to? Morality is out; these propositions can't be proved. Rights are out; they don't exist. Where do we go from there? On what basis could we claim that, regardless of what the Nazi's believed about the Jews, they were wrong? On what basis could we claim that, regardless of what Southern slave owners believed about blacks, they were wrong? I am trying to show you that there are a lot of assumptions that seem to be built into your mental existence argument. I am trying to get at those assumptions to show you that some of them would present the exact same problem that you have with Creator-based arguments. So, what I was getting at is what makes mental existence morally significant? The answer to that is unprovable. You said that laws based on unprovable claims would be foolish; and yet you are arguing that laws should be based on this unprovable claim. I submit that the difference in these two scenarios has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that one person has a head, and the other does not. Suppose we knew with a great deal of certainty that the headless body on life support would fully recover within a couple of weeks if he remained on the life support. I would say that it would be wrong to disconnect him, and that he has the exact same rights as the person whose arm was cut off, but otherwise is completely fine. In real life, these brain-dead scenarios involve individuals who will not recover. Society has therefore come to the conclusion that disconnecting the life support is acceptable. However, I think it is pretty clear that if some advance in science came up with a cure for brain-deadness, and brain-dead folks started fully recovering, society would come to a completely different conclusion.","Shooterandproud","325820","""I also maintain that if we knew, with the same level of certainty that we know a fetus will ""recover"" from its brain dead state within 9 months, that a brain dead individual would essentially make a full recovery within nine months, we would not allow him to be removed from life support."" Nope. Abuse of animals is illegal, and it does not benefit or harm humans to not abuse animals. True, however morality should not play a major role in our laws, since many people have different morals. Universally accepted morals however (illegality of murder, theft) should be ok to legislate. And so relating this to a fetus, is there any other way to prevent it from inflicting harm on you (besides drugs, obviously)? I don't deny their existence, I just deny that somehow any group of cells with a certain type of protein sequence has more rights than a different group of dividing cells with a different protein sequence. Science can prove that. I believe that scientists have put mental development at around 21 weeks. Human, maybe. Being? No. A being implies an existence. You may have misread my post. I said that the existence of rights could not be proven. Why is what the nazis did wrong? Because those people did not wish to be gassed. Why is murder wrong? Because people don't wish to be murdered. If people don't want unnecessary harm caused to them, then they have the right to not. I believe in rights as something anything with a mental existence has, no matter what kind of DNA is in its cells. Whether it be human, elephant, or even Kling-On. If it has a mental existence, it should have legal protections from harm. I have already told you that something that cannot be proven should not be legislated. I cannot prove that humans have rights, however they contribute to the happiness and functionality of a society. What more do you want? I am asking that laws be based on common sense, not an unprovable claim. I would think that mental existence being the basis for rights should seem quite obvious. Have you read my last analogy? Ok, what if the headless body would fully recover? It could obviously not move, and not grow another head. It would be just a group of living cells and nothing more. Does it still have rights? I say no. I agree, but that's just because they will recover. Does a permanently brain dead individual have rights? It is a living human, however the only difference between it and regular human is a mental existence. What I was getting at is that you can lose any part of your body and still retain your rights, however this is not true of the head: the center of the mental existence.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","09:54 PM","abortion-debates","461"
