I think Chester is nibbling at my ankle as I type!","chester","324600","Yet one more refusal to answer a very simple question. Is there no profetallifer out there with the courage to answer? The question won't go away.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","10:06 AM","abortion-debates","287"

"09-22-2008","11563",20,"chester","324596","Just because you can't or won't answer the question doesn't make it anything other than a valid question. You profetallifers refuse to answer because to do so would mean that your position is untenable, that you need crutch of the force of law rather than the power of persuasion to have your warped POV predominate.","Archangel","324606","I/we have answered this question. You just don't like the answer so you continue to ask it over and over again. Debating anything with you or penfold is like debating with a wall.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","10:30 AM","abortion-debates","289"

Debating anything with you or penfold is like debating with a wall.","chester","324613","Yet one more attempt at equivocation and diversion. Why is the government a better determinant of the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is? BTW, we're not going away. To do so would leave the forum as the exclusive playground of the hard right radical religious fringe.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","11:08 AM","abortion-debates","290"
"09-22-2008","11563",20,"gansao","324574","Define 'woman'. 15 year old girl 'knocked up ' by boyfriend. 35 year old happlily married woman . Sorry to be evasive but it does make a difference.","Sigma","324622","Unwanted pregnancies can happen in as many circumstances as there are women to experience those circumstances. Do you believe abortion justified in any circumstances?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","11:56 AM","abortion-debates","291"
"09-22-2008","11563",20,"None","None","None","Galactababe","324624","Chester: You are such a hypocrite. You never apologized for your gross misrepresentation of my position in which you claimed I made no exceptions for victims of rape, and now you go so far as to call the amount of fines I proposed ""paltry"" when you ranted about how only the ""rich"" will be able to afford abortions in my plan. It should be against the law for people like you to adopt children or teach children in our classrooms. You are a treasonous, duplicitous, Marxist who should move to Cuba or Venezuela until you ride off into the sunset. So keep asking your stupid disingenuous question over and over like a drunken parrot. You can lick your wounds on Nov. 5th when your socialist Messiah limps back to Chicago, soundly defeated. I still have faith that the majority of Americans can't possibly be stupid enough to elect Obama/Biden.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","11:57 AM","abortion-debates","292"

Yes I am afraid that I do believe that abortion is sometimes justified.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","12:08 PM","abortion-debates","294"
"09-22-2008","11563",20,"None","None","None","Penfold","324643","The serial insultive attacks by Archie in this thread alone, are indicators of his disdain for moderation or that he believes himself above reproach or censure. Let us hope that he learns the lesson that this is not so, sooner rather than later.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","12:55 PM","abortion-debates","295"

Why do you believe it is justified in some but not other circumstances?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","01:17 PM","abortion-debates","296"
"09-22-2008","11563",20,"None","None","None","gansao","324657","This is at least a starting point. sigma It is the first time that I have been asked a direct question, so you could call it a starting point ,yes. Why do you believe it is justified in some but not other circumstances? sigma Because I think that bringing a pregnancy to full term is not always the best thing to do.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","01:35 PM","abortion-debates","297"
"09-22-2008","11563",20,"gansao","324657","Because I think that bringing a pregnancy to full term is not always the best thing to do.","Sigma","324665","Aye, this I could divine simply from the belief that abortion is sometimes justified More specifically, though. What is the dividing line in your beliefs? What would make disallowing abortion justified and what would make it allowable?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","01:58 PM","abortion-debates","298"

"09-22-2008","11563",20,"gansao","324667","I take it that you think abortion is wrong in any circumstances.","Sigma","324674","Oh, no, far from it. I'm very pro-choice. Generally I think it is morally justifiable to restrict abortion once the fetus has a sufficiently complex brain to allow for consciousness and at that point few women would have reason to seek an abortion anyway so it kinda works out.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","02:19 PM","abortion-debates","300"
