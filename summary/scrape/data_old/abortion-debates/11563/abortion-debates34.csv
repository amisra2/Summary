I don't share your philosophy/religion. I cannot tell another person how to view a fetus based on my faith alone. Neither can you. Well, you can but it carries no authority.","Archangel","327204","First point out where I referred at all to supernaturalism at all. You are creating a strawman argument by implying that I have argued something I haven't argued at all. Everyone here knows where I stand as a born again christian, but that aspect of my character isn't needed in proving why a fertilized human egg is also a human being. That evidence is self evident in that this microbial egg grows into a sentient being which is a genetic reflection of both of his parents. So, right down to the molecular level this brand new life form, though it be unique, is also a part of something bigger than itself from the moment of its conception. This is scientifically undeniable as it has been observed in laboratory conditions millions of times. Yet here we are with secular humanists and atheists who demand scientific and clinical evidence for everything they will claim to accept as valid, yet they will claim this unborn child is subhuman, a parasite or that even though it grows from a single egg to a human being, that it can't be defined as ALIVE or HUMAN. The absolute hypocrisy, double standards and irrational thought processes required in order to argue such foolishness belies all reason and common sense. Yet here your side is as consistent as the XXXXXX that they must be, and you included; defending the absolute indefensible at every level of rationality. Congratulations sinjin, the irrational double standards and hypocrisy that defines the LOONEY LEFTY'S remains firmly intact.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","11:44 AM","abortion-debates","496"

Secondly, I don't deny the fetus/zygote is human or alive at any point in the process. But a ""being"" means something specific and certainly does not apply before a certain point. ""A part of something bigger than itself"" is exactly the sort of meaningless nonsense to which I refer. Potential is specious when we're talking about what it may or may not be at a specific point in development. The reasoning used to justify unplugging the ""brain dead"" is essentially the same. ""Nobody home anymore"" and ""nobody home yet"".","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","11:55 AM","abortion-debates","497"
"10-10-2008","11563",34,"Ryuuichi","326847","I grew up on a farm where we had a henhouse with a bunch of hens and a rooster or two. Yet that fact doesn't change the fact that it is a chicken egg and if it survives will become a chicken.","Colonel Ingus","327213","Those were a different breed of chicken, domestic hens are specially bred for abundant egg production ( it's all about money ) and lay one egg every 26 - 28 hours every 4 - 6 days. These domesticated chickens will lay eggs even when they've had no contact with a rooster. This however doesn't change the fact that Ryuuichi was wrong . They said: When in fact it should have read: "" Yet that fact doesn't change the fact that it is a chicken egg - and if it survives will remain just a chicken egg . "" Simple rule of thumb - No matter which angle you look at the topic of abortion, the facts never support anti-choicers","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","12:11 PM","abortion-debates","498"

"10-10-2008","11563",34,"None","None","None","Archangel","327255","A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: THE PRO-ABORTION AGENDA OF JUSTIFICATION THROUGH DEHUMANIZATION To those people who are attempting to rationally debate the issue of ABORTION with these pro-death secular humanists and atheists, it is very important that you understand their true agenda and modus operandi for justifying the procedure which murders unborn babies while still in their mothers wombs. The method for justification requires that they dehumanize the unborn children which is why they will refer to them as ZEFs and Zygotes. And is why they will use comparisons to the fertilized and unfertilized chicken egg, which we eat for breakfast. You see, either way, when debating this issue on such a simplistic level, they win by default because they have already lowered the standard of debate to that of a chicken egg. So, by just understanding the shallowness of their tactics, we win by not allowing them to dehumanize our human offspring to the status of an inhuman analogy. Remember that these people are attempting to justify the murder of our very own human offspring. And they realize that as well as you and I do. What they must do is both justify their stance and maintain a clear conscience so they don't have to live with the guilt that they are in fact defenders of a pro murder philosophy. That is why no matter what common sense arguments you use with them, no matter how obvious and rational your reasoning, they will never accept or concede that their position is not only false and irrational, but is criminal and a pro-death philosophy which supports and encourages genocide. After all, it is painfully obvious that any doctrine which not only encourages, but enables the killing of 1.4 million members of one particular class of American consistently, year after year, can be described as nothing other than ""genocide"". That is why they must dehumanize the unborn, because they don't want to admit that they are proponents of the Great American Genocide. So forgive them for their irrational debating style which results in them offering the most infantile and ignorant arguments in their attempts to justify their sociopathic and shortsighted gospel of death and destruction of our most innocent and silent demographic, who have no personal voice of their own with which to defend themselves. What better a group to victimize than the absolute weakest among us? And they are even out of sight, so also out of mind of the masses. If they can only be dehumanized, then justifying their extermination should be easy according to the proponents of this MULTI BILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL INDUSTRY. So by understanding the rationale of these opponents of life for the unborn, you are more prepared to deal with the ignorance and shallowness of their inane attempts to justify such human carnage on such a massive scale. Just understand that these proponents of ABORTION are also victims since they have been raised in a selfish and self centered Society to believe that personal responsibility is a thing of the past, so demanding that the innocent child pay with its very life, the price for the sins of its mother/parents is just fine. And if they can moralize it by dehumanizing the baby so they can feel as though it is justified, then all the better.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","01:51 PM","abortion-debates","500"

Try to come up with a less transparent excuse next time Well if they are more educated on the matter than you are, then what does that make you? You are entitled to your opinion but I think you'll find that even most educated people under the same circumstances wouldn't know that a special breed of chicken was used. That makes it an honest mistake, whether you realize it or not.

I was just trying to make a point that a fertailized egg grows into a certain animal depending on where it came from. >_> You people blew that way out of proportion. And if a fetus is a parasite then that makes us all parasites. Parasites don't turn into different beings when they grow. So if you're willing to realise that everyone on this planet including you are a parasite then its perfectly fine to go ahead and call a fetus a parasite.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","03:42 PM","abortion-debates","507"

That's like saying that a chrysalis is a chrysalis for life and doesn't turn into a caterpillar and then a butterfly. Do you anti-choicers not understand the very BASICS of life cycle? Unfortunately for you that's not part of the official definition. Try to bend it, twist it, manipulate it as you wish, but a parasite has a very defined definition , and a fetus meets that definition","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","03:57 PM","abortion-debates","508"
