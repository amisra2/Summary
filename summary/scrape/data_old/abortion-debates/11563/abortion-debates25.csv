I also agree that there are cases where a fetus should be aborted! I just think that that the definition of a ' person with rights' should be rolled back as technology allows us to make that fetus viable! In ancient times a crippled baby would be left out to die, not because the ancient people were nasty b*stards but because only the strong survived! We live in a world where technology allows us to do things that we could not contemplate just a few years ago! If we can save a premature baby but are willing abort a fetus that is at the same stage or later then maybe we should take a long look at ourselves. Please excuse my bad writing, I am tired .","Shooterandproud","325122","If a woman in the first trimester wishes to abort, but there is the technology to make this fetus viable on its own, I say go for it. But, I doubt the technology exists to make a couple of dividing cells a viable human being. Phyllis You assume that the fetus is a human being, which is still a debate that needs to take place and be resolved before anyone claims it has the right to override ones right to their own body. A fetus is a group of dividing cells, and IMO without a mental existence it cannot be considered a human with rights. Terminating an early fetus destroys the potential for a life to exist, however so does using contraception. I fail to see much difference.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","06:55 PM","abortion-debates","361"

What Mr. Justice Blackmun said, and what gets lost in all the profetallife bombast, bluster, and bloviation was that the question of when a human person begins is a metaphysical construct and that the Court would not assume the role of deciding whose construct was to be the preferred one in the law. If you note, that's exactly what the pro-choice movement has been saying all along. This is a matter for each woman to decide on her own without the coercive effect of the law coming into play. The profetallifers are fried because they felt then and they still feel now that the Court should have chosen their particular POV above all others. THAT would have been judicial activism in the extreme.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","09:29 PM","abortion-debates","368"

"09-25-2008","11563",25,"Phyllis","325132","As I have been trying to point out, whether the fetus is a human being is not the consequential assumption/fact here. The most consequential question comes before that: why would it matter if it is a human being--the ""so what?"" of the question. So am I. So are you. I don't know why this is the line. Mental existence, in practical terms, is totally meaningless to, say, a one day old infant. What do you understand ""mental existence"" to be, and why do you think it is the threshold one must attain in order to have rights? And, while you're at it, what do you mean by ""rights?"" No. What we have from the moment of conception is a biologically distinct, developing being that is human. If left in its natural environment, this little cell will develop, not into a human being, but into a particular kind of human being: a fetus; then infant; then adolescent; then teen; and then adult. This is not potential human life. This is human life. What we have prior to conception is a sperm or egg. These are not developing human beings. They have no more potential in themselves to develop into, say, an infant than asphalt does. If left in their natural environment, neither the sperm nor the egg will ever enter this process of development. I simply cannot see how one can say there is no difference in these two entities. The difference is abundantly clear. I realize there could be genuine questions of whether the embryo has moral value; but I do not think there can be any serious discussion about whether the embryo is manifestly different from an egg or sperm.","Shooterandproud","325156","Well, if it wasn't a human being it would not have the same rights as a real human being. Fair enough, but we are a mentally existent bunch of dividing cells. We are not just an empty body. A fetus would be more comparable to a severed body part, or a brain dead person. Well, if mental existence isn't the basis of rights, then what is? If something does not mentally exist, then why should they deserve rights? They cannot be harmed or pleased, they don't give a care what happens around them. They are non mentally existent. Should a blade of grass have rights? I won't argue that it is human life. There are all kinds of human life, just like you, me, my kidney, and my skin cells. However a mere set of proteins is not the basis of rights, it is mental existence. I think most would agree. You do grasp this concept, right? I agree with this, however if left in its natural environment a tumor will also develop. Just because something may be natural is not grounds for allowing it to grow at the cost of someone else. Of course the embryo is different, however a mere difference is not the basis for any rights. Let me give a scenario. An alien decides to come to earth for some reason. He has a universal translator on him, and speaks our language. He looks radically different, however he can make conversation and perform everyday tasks. He is sentient, and he has feeling and can feel pain. He brings along with him a plant species from his planet. The plant is obviously not sentient, and is very much like earth plants. Which alien deserves rights, the plant or the sentient alien and why?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","12:49 AM","abortion-debates","371"
"09-25-2008","11563",25,"Phyllis","325165","But why should we think that human beings have rights in the first place? That was what I was trying to get at. 1) Except that a severed body part will never continue along the line of development into an infant, child, adolescent, and then adult. 2)I also maintain that if we knew, with the same level of certainty that we know a fetus will ""recover"" from its brain dead state within 9 months, that a brain dead individual would essentially make a full recovery within nine months, we would not allow him to be removed from life support. Rights exist by virtue of what something is, not by virtue of what it possesses. Being a human being is the criteria for possessing human rights. You say one cannot be a human being without mental existence. I'm still not sure what you mean by this. Nor am I clear about what you mean by the word ""rights."" I will call attention to the brain dead example. I will suppose that a brain dead individual would not possess a mental existence within your meaning. If we knew that he would recover within 9 months, I would say he has the right not to be unplugged from the machine that would be sustaining his life in the interim. It would be immoral for us to do so if there were such a substantial certainty that he would make a full recovery by leaving him alone for a few months. Human beings do not possess rights because they deserve them. They possess rights simply because they are human beings. We don't give human beings their rights; we recognize rights that they already possess. And you think a one day old infant can be harmed and pleased? That they care what happens around them? We could administer anesthesia to an infant such that he be aware of neither harm nor pleasure. And an infant clearly has no care for what goes on around him. He has no self-awareness at all. You are asking the wrong question. The question is not whether something should have rights. The question is whether something does have rights. I don't sit in my castle and think about who I think I will give rights to; I possess no such power, and neither does any other person or government institution. Rights holding things possess those rights independent of you, me, or government. It's hard to grasp when I don't know exactly what you mean by either ""mental existence"" or ""rights."" You've used the term mental existence a lot, but I am not clear on exactly what you mean by it, or why you think it is a morally significant quality. I am equally unclear of what you mean by ""rights,"" because you have asked the question ""should X have rights?"" That question is nonsensical based on my understanding of what a human right is. So, if you could explain these terms more concretely, it might help me understand your view a little better. In my reply to you, I've had to make some assumptions about your terms that may not be true. That is not what I said. I did not say that, left in its natural environment, the fetus will develop. No, what I said is that, left in its natural environment, the fetus, a human being at one stage of development, will continue developing into more advanced stages. It will not develop into a human being because it already is that. It simply will enter into a more advanced stage, ultimately resulting in an infant, adolescent, teenager, then adult. This is not the argument I made. I was purely using the nature argument to demonstrate that a fetus is clearly different from an egg or sperm. And since you seem not to have understood that, I've used the nature argument again to demonstrate that the fetus is, in itself, compellingly different than a severed body part or a tumor. I do not think it is clear that either alien has rights. The question is not who deserves rights. Rights are inherent entities that and entity possesses by virtue of being what it is. Classical theory of rights based the possession of rights squarely on the existence of a Creator. The question for me, therefore, is would not be whether the alien deserves rights; rather it would be whether the Creator has endowed aliens with rights.","Shooterandproud","325173","Ok. Well, I would think it is to make everyone happier in general. I'm not quite sure what the basis of rights is, but they sure to make life better. 1) I am personally not concerned with what it may become. I am concerned with what it is in this state of development. 2) This would only be true if women were life support machines. When this brain dead person is harming someone else, does the person being harmed have rights? Right, but what if doesn't exist? It may exist physically, but it does not exist mentally. Then why do animals have rights, but plants lack them? That is true, however saying this is implying that women are just life support machines. If this brain dead person was somehow hooked up to someone else to keep him alive, then should the other person have the right to say ""I want off!""? Again, why do animals have rights? Yes and no. If you poke an infant, he will cry. If you bounce him up and down on your lap, he will (usually) start laughing. That does not mean that the infant does not mentally exist. I get what you're saying, however who then has these rights? Why a cat? Why not a fern? Mental existence is the quality of existing mentally. You would agree that a tree does not exist mentally? If I chopped your head off, would your body exist mentally? Wouldn't the morally significant part be your head? This is really something hard to explain, and AO does a better job than I. This is more of a question for him. What do you mean by this? I am only concerned about the stage in which it is at a certain point in time. Not what it could be, should be, or would be. These things are all different, however the principle is the same. Should something in a given point that lacks a mental existence have the rights to override a woman's right to her own body? Then we have to disagree here. Rights are for the protection of an individual from persecution. The alien is an individual, and it has rights no matter what color its skin is, or what its DNA says. The fact that it mentally exists, and can think for itself is the important part. If it can think and feel, it mentally exists. In a debate, religion must not be used as an argument for those who don't believe, or for political discussions. Rights were made to protect people from persecution and suffering. If something does not care if it is persecuted, and is incapable of suffering, what is the point of rights?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","09:50 AM","abortion-debates","374"
