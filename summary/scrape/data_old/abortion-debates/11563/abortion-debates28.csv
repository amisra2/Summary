"09-28-2008","11563",28,"None","None","None","Jay56","325510","The core issue here is where do we draw the line on what qualifies one as a ""human being"". History is full of sorry examples, and I will not go into them. Laws have been written and repealed, all based on overall popular perceptions and religious beliefs. My argument has been based in biological distinctiveness. I can state for a fact, that a new born has the same biological distinctiveness at birth as when it was conceived. The same DNA coding. You can, in-fact, take a recently conceived embryo out of one mother and transfer it to another mother. The biological distinction remains, and you don't even have to use anti-rejection medication. I have also stated that the distinction occurs at conception, it doesn't start as ""body part"" and it does not develop over so many weeks. So why do we draw the line at X number of weeks? I have heard many arguments on the rights of the mother, and the limiting effect the abortion laws have. In spirit, in an ideal world, I whole heartedly agree with you on the pro-choice side. I am very much a civil libertarian. The only justifiable reason to curtail the rights of person is when they curtail or eliminate the rights of another. I have heard many arguments on the burden an unwanted pregnancy places on the mother, both financial and emotional and I empathize. I also heard this little voice in the back of my head. It's an old Joe Stalin quote from the 40's; ""A single death is a tragedy, a million is a statistic"", and lately, I have been thinking like a statistician. We draw lines based on empathy. There is a lot of wisdom in old Joe's quote. If it is happening to someone close, a single death is a tragedy. If is common place, happening outside of sight, to strangers, it's a statistic. A new born is cute, cuddly and scores high on empathy points. A fetus, in the early stages of development, is unseen, except by surgical means and scores low on empathy points, yet it is the same being, the same biological entity. We draw lines based on empathy. I have a unque and interesting personal perspective on this issue. I was born in 1956, when the line was drawn on date night, somewhere around 3rd base. The argument was about condoms at that time. A decade later, it was towards the end of the 2nd trimester. I was also born under one of the worst possible circumstances, to one of the worst possible mothers, and served the next 5 to 6 years as one of those unwanted children. Had it been a decade later, I am certain I wouldn't be writing this post, because anyone with any sense would have gotten her to a clinic. The core question for me is; Do I have the right to exist?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","03:57 PM","abortion-debates","412"

If you had been born black and in the South you would have had to sit in the back of the bus or at a desk in a segregated school. If you had been born black in 1956, your parents more than likely would not have been able to vote. If you were black, or the child of working class parents and you had graduated high school in 1956, more than likely you would not have gone to college. If you had been female and graduated from high school in 1956, you more than likely would have been confined to pink collar professions - nursing, teaching, or secretarial - if you had managed to get an education after that graduation. If you had been 10-years old in 1956, you would have been subject to a vast panoply of childhood diseases that today's physicians cannot even pronounce, much less diagnose. Fortunately, we do not live in, nor are we governed by, the mores and values of 1956. Now, since your question seems to be quite straight-up, let me propose one to you. Do you think that the government is better able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is? If so, why?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","04:44 PM","abortion-debates","413"

The reference to the year 1956 is the year I was born, and does not carry any desire to put on a pair of penny loafers and turn back the hand of time, or shall I say progress. It is just my personal time line. I also now realize that decade maybe a hot button to people on both sides of the issue and will refrain from referring to it. All I was trying to say, is that under my particular circumstances, with today's laws, my little blob of cells, er.. my moms little blob of cells wouldn't be around very long, and we wouldn't be having this conversation. That is why I give empathy points toward my, ugh, moms little blob of cells. As to your last question, here's where we left off; Chester Jay, Those of us who believe in choice have no problem whatsoever with the choice you make here. If so you and yours believe, then so you and yours must act according to your inner light. What we object to is the concept that one size fits all. Just as you must be free to act on your beliefs, so must others be free to act on theirs. The irrational ravings contained in the post that follows yours is a prime example of our objections. That poster fails to realize that once we give the government the power to ban abortion today, we also give to that government the power to require them tomorrow. We go there at our peril. Response: You do bring out my inner anarchist, I would love to see governments declared obsolete. The realist in me wouldn't want to live there. I'm way too trusting and a lousy shot to boot. So we strike a balance and empower governments to make rules on the big stuff, like the taking human lives. Now we get to my last post. I see a pregnant lady and I see two lives. You see a pregnant lady and you see one. I wish to understand why? I have offer a biological argument as a definition of what constitutes a human being and all I hear are personal opinions based on proximity to a birthing canal, time in the ""oven"", and legal precedence. As for legal precedence goes, once you allow a government to define who and what is human, there is no telling where that line may be drawn. We go there at our peril.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","06:58 PM","abortion-debates","415"

"09-28-2008","11563",28,"Phyllis","325334","Modern rights theory is not only very important to understanding what rights are, but it is also very fascinating. If you were interested in a very brief overview, I would suggest the Declaration of Independence. If you were looking for something more detailed, I would suggest John Locke's Second Treatise on Civil Government . The short of it is that rights theory originated with the existence of rights being grounded in a Creator. 1) Again, the example of development demonstrates nothing more than the fact that an embryo is clearly different from a tumor or severed body part. It is not meant to show anything more than that simple fact. 2) I have said nothing about women as life support machines The brain dead example I gave was meant to suggest nothing more than the fact that a brain dead individual in the scenario I gave would (where we would have reason to believe he would fully recover) have rights, but no mental existence. Animals do not have rights; in some instances they have legal protections. But so do some plants and land. Do not confuse legal protections with moral rights. This is a bit off the scope of our subject. You may want to be careful with how you handle this hypothetical. If it would be immoral to remove the life support from a person who is brain dead in the scenario I gave (that is, in the event we would expect him to recover fully), then his rights are not a function of his mental existence. Well, at least it seems I've been clear in what I've said, which is a relief because when talking about theory, its easy to lose folks. The answer I would give to this question is that our Creator has endowed human beings with rights, and has not so endowed cats, ferns, etc. I would encourage you to sit down for a few minutes and really read through the Declaration of Independence. I know you've probably read it before as a historical document. But try to read it as a philosophical document. It is undisputed that it articulates the historical foundation of the concept of human rights, and I think it powerfully does so. I'd be interested to see what you think of this. You said earlier that you are not sure what the basis of our rights is. If you read the Declaration of Independence, you will know the historical answer to that question. Well, that makes it pretty hard to argue against the point. Maybe consider my example of the brain dead patient who will recover. That might help you and I understand what ""mental existence"" means, and more importantly, why it is morally significant. I was merely asking you what a ""human right"" is. That was all. The reason that I asked is that you have said some things that suggest that you believe human rights are divisible from human beings; that is, they do not possess their rights inherently. I got this idea from the fact that you have asked ""who should have rights?"" and ""does such-and-such deserve rights?"" To be clear, I am not saying that a fetus will develop into a human being. That being said, I was using the nature argument to demonstrate one thing, and only one thing: that a human embryo is quite clearly separate and distinct from either a tumor, skin cell, severed body part, etc. Therefore, trying to morally equivocate the embryo with a tumor on the basis that they are the same is not a valid inference. Let me phrase it this way: it indeed might be true that the embryo has no more moral value than a tumor. But if that is the case, it is not because the embryo is inherently the same as a tumor. It would have to be for some other compelling reason. Is that really the question? I would suggest it is not. Many people have argued that even if the fetus had a right to live, its right to live still wouldn't override a woman's right to her own body. I do not adhere to such dogmatic statements dismissing out-of-hand the validity of claims which appeal to a Creator. Neither would the framer's of the Declaration of Independence, which, as I have said, articulates (both historically and logically) the foundation of human rights.","Shooterandproud","325533","I have read the Declaration of Independence, and I understand what rights are. However, rights are moot if there's no one to enjoy then. One must consider that no everyone believes in a ""creator"" One must also consider the first amendment: freedom of religion. I am not denying that it is different, however in principle its the same. All three are groups living human cells that lack a mental existence. I am not concerned with what it may become, because under the right conditions a sperm may become a human being too. I am only concerned with what it is at a given period. Except of course when you compared women to life support machines in your last post. A brain dead individual is legally dead, and has no rights. You can have whatever opinion you want on ""moral rights"", however it is undeniable that animals have legal rights. You can word it however you want, however it will not change the simple fact that you cannot do whatever you want to an animal. A) It is not immoral to remove a brain dead person from life support. B) It is not off topic, and you still haven't answered my question. Would it be morally right to kidnap someone and hook them up to a dying person for 18 years? Again, you cannot assume that everyone in this country shares your religious belief. I do not take every historical document as literally as you do (the bible, the constitution, etc.) especially when its over hundreds of years old. The fundamental question remains, why have rights when there is no one to enjoy them? You make a good point, however a brain dead person that may recover is not physically and emotionally harming anyone. Here's a new question: What makes us humans better than other living organisms? The only more ""moral value"" an embryo has to a tumor is that it may have a mental existence. Physically you're right, they are different, however ""spiritually"" they are equivalent when you factor out the potential of an embryo. I agree with that. You can call my statement whatever you want, however I still stick to it. It would be equally ridiculous if I said ""I am right because the fairies say so, end of discussion"". Unless I can prove the existence of these fairies, the point is moot. The same applies to a creator. I do hold the Declaration of independence with weight, however it does not mean I adhere literally to every statement it makes. As I have stated above, it would be foolish to employ the use of the ""creator"" argument, because no one can know for sure if this ""creator"" exists. We must stick to what we already know.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","08:42 PM","abortion-debates","420"
