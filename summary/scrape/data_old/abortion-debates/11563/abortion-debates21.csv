I personally think that it should only be allowed in exceptional circumstances ie If the baby would be extremely handicapped( this is a debate in itself) and if the mothers health was compromised by bringing the baby to term. 'Unwanted' pregnancies would not be terminated ,not only for the sake of the unborn child but there are many childless couples who are struggling to adopt to make this socially acceptable on any level. Also I believe that the abortion should be done at a very early stage.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","02:36 PM","abortion-debates","301"

This seems to say, essentially, that a pregnant woman is required to stay pregnant for the sake of others who are unable to have children. Is this the morally correct route to take?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","03:05 PM","abortion-debates","302"
"09-22-2008","11563",21,"None","None","None","gansao","324695","Without dressing it up..yes I do. but not if it compromises her health, physically or mentally. Surely there must be a point where we consider a pregnant woman effectively two people. Should we really dismember a feeling foetus unless we HAVE to( a bit emotive perhaps) ? I am sure that many women would object to me having this view but I still believe it to be right. I would very interested to see your views on this.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","03:21 PM","abortion-debates","303"

Imo that's akin to saying: ""should we remove an organ or not"" (not to say the fetus is in any way an organ, it's to make a point). Whatever we do or do not wish to do is contingent on the desires of the person in question that we necessarily and quite greviously affect in order to fulfill what we wish to do. Even to save a life I think we have to take a good long look at the means we use to achieve that end. Certainly ensuring the life of the fetus is a noble goal, even to those who do not morally consider it equivalent to you and I. It is the means we would necessarily have to use to save that life that is immoral to some (myself included). To those who are pro-life, it seems that the rights and desires of the woman are secondary to the cause of saving that life, while those who are pro-choice would say that the rights and desires of women are more important than even the goal of saving a life.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","03:35 PM","abortion-debates","304"

Chester: You will never get a response to your main question. It would be like asking a religious nut to prove the existence of God. To all pro-lifers: Is a fetus worth as much as a real human being? What value does it have? It is at a very early stage in development, it lacks human characteristics, it lacks a brain. Terminating a fetus is morally comparable to the couple deciding not to have sex. It is preventing a human from existing, however no human being exists to be terminated. I do not deny that cells exist, however mentally it is nothing. Mental existence is the basis for all rights. It is why a cat has rights, but a plant does not. A simple arrangement of proteins are not sufficient to override the inalienable right to one's own body.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","08:14 PM","abortion-debates","310"
"09-22-2008","11563",21,"None","None","None","Jay56","324772","OK Chester, Interesting question, very well stated; ""Why is the government a better determinant of the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is?"" Because that's what governments do. Why is the government a better determinate of how fast I drive, how much I drink, or who I kill. Governments are by nature designed to limit our personal freedoms and use violence, if necessary, to enforce it. It's all part of how we get along. In a democracy that seems to pride itself on erring toward the freedom side of the equation, we get to argue among ourselves, come to a grudging consensus, draw lines, and pass laws. If I have a sickly infant, can't afford the extensive medical care, why shouldn't I be allowed to euthanize my child. Who would know my situation better than me. Well, people have argued about this, come to a grudging consensus, drawn lines (no killing the baby), and passed laws (try it and we'll fry your a$%). So getting back to the topic at hand, we still seem to be arguing among ourselves. The very grudging consensus is somewhere around the end of the 2nd trimester (the line), and we're even arguing over who gets to write the law (state or federal). This is what living in a democracy is about, having a say in which personal freedoms are limited and how it effects the common good (others). Your question presumes that only one party is involved, the pregnant woman. My response is that two parties are involved and government should be involved to protect the common good (aka little Zef). I state that the grounds on which I find Zef to be a second party as follow; Zef has a separate and unique DNA profile, different from the mother's. And in some cases Zef may even have a different blood type than the mother. Zef can be classified by forensic (DNA) means as a human being. The biological relationship between mother and child is symbionic in nature, qualifying as two enities and not one.. So I have therefore come to the conclusion that Zef is a separate, unique human being and therefore, Zef's human rights should be preserved. Counter arguement please.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","10:03 PM","abortion-debates","311"

There are many in this country who believe there is a new person from the moment of conception. Others would place ""personhood"" at some point in fetal development. There are still others who say that personhood = birth. All are sincerely held but ultimately unprovable assertions. In light of this, I say that it ill behooves any government to favor one metaphysical construct over another; it must maintain strict neutrality and leave the decision to the one person capable of making a choice about her particular pregnancy - the woman herself.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","10:34 PM","abortion-debates","312"

"09-23-2008","11563",21,"None","None","None","Jay56","324785","The counter is that the law is not in the business of making metaphysical distinctions . Agreed: No one can prove or disprove a metaphysical belief, hence the term meta (beyond) physics (the observable). Any government would be ill advised to base laws on metaphysical perceptions. There are many in this country who believe there is a new person from the moment of conception. Others would place ""personhood"" at some point in fetal development. There are still others who say that personhood = birth. I personally put ""personhood"" as having held a job for at least 3 years. All are sincerely held but ultimately unprovable assertions. In light of this, I say that it ill behooves any government to favor one metaphysical construct over another; it must maintain strict neutrality and leave the decision to the one person capable of making a choice about her particular pregnancy - the woman herself. I have based my argument on biological distinction, which for me puts the line at conception. If one were to try and argue where life begins or when a fetus is viable, then the metaphysical paradox kicks in. I counter this by stating that at conception life does not begin anywhere, but that life continues from a living egg and living sperm joining to create a unique and separate being. With that being said; we as a society need to resolve some fairly massive sociological problems first. A major shift in perception (how we view the problem) and action (what we are willing to do about it) must occur. Unfortunately, we are also sorely lacking in wisdom. Unwanted pregnancies are going to happen. What are alternate ways to deal with it. How do we minimize the cost in both lives and emotions. Until this is resolved, a change in laws will cause more harm than good and prove unsuccessful. My goal is probably the same as most people here. I would love to see abortions end because they are no longer needed. Thank your response Chester, I think in some areas we agree on more than we disagree.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","12:38 AM","abortion-debates","315"
