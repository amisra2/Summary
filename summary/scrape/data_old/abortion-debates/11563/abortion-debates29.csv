I'm way too trusting and a lousy shot to boot. So we strike a balance and empower governments to make rules on the big stuff, like the taking human lives. Now we get to my last post. I see a pregnant lady and I see two lives. You see a pregnant lady and you see one. I wish to understand why? I have offer a biological argument as a definition of what constitutes a human being and all I hear are personal opinions based on proximity to a birthing canal, time in the ""oven"", and legal precedence. As for legal precedence goes, once you allow a government to define who and what is human, there is no telling where that line may be drawn. We go there at our peril.","chester","325535","Your last two paragraphs say it all IMNSHO. If we permit the government to ban abortion today; we grant that government the right to require them tomorrow. As we both agree, there the government goes at its, and our, peril.

Yet you continue to ask it. WHY??? If you refuse to accept the answer given? And that answer is that it's the Governments responsibility to protect the innocent from the murderous intent of those attempting to kill them. And you cannot deny that the unborn are completely innocent of creating the situation that exists. That is solely the fault of the parents who conceived him. So why must the innocent babies death be the solution for a situation the babies took no part in creating? Now, why not answer that question without declaring that a baby that we know will become as sentient as you and I are if only allowed to complete its gestation, is not human!!!

I have PERSONALLY experienced several miracles in my life I am alive several times because of them (and no not man made miracles either). One of which was when my father, stepmother, and baby brother were killed and I was supposed to be there with them FACT IS: If it weren't for God - I wouldn't care if your fetus was killed or you for that matter ... OH - look what happens there without God .... what is the difference in one murder or another? THINK ABOUT THAT ... anti God Democrats are for the poor - the poor live in the ghetto and more murder happens in the ghetto. So the godless democrat's are the cause for many types of murder EXCEPT those who deserve the death sentence ...","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","11:06 PM","abortion-debates","425"

Until then, I will choose the rights of a person in being over a potentiality each and every time. The law must never make a woman a slave to her fetus. Remember that the government to which today you would give the power ban abortions has the inherent power to someday require them. Doesn't that terrify you? It surely does me.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","12:05 AM","abortion-debates","427"

Pro-choice advocates like to point out that there is a waiting list for adoption. There is a long waiting list for adoption, but only for healthy white babies. The waiting list for a baby with dark skin, eyes and hair is much shorter. There is no waiting list at all for babies with fetal alcohol syndrome, drug dependancies etc. If a woman does not want her child and would prefer to have an abortion, we can force her to carry it to term or have an illegal abortion, but how will we force her to stop drinking, smoking and using drugs? If we try to make doctors turn women in for harming their fetus, we will have women getting no prenatal care and having even sicker babies that no one wants. Teenage girls can get an abortion and have no one know she was pregnant, but once she's forced to carry the baby to term, there is social pressure that will be brought to bear to keep the baby. Most teenage girls who get pregnant are not going to have the economic and emotional support that Gov Palin's daughter will get from her family. I'm sure her and her husband to be will still go to college, will have a decent place to live, and will have good childcare for their baby. That is not an option for many if not the majority of girls in the same situation. Most of these girls will end up dropping out of school and becoming dependant on our failing social welfare system. We can force women/girls to have the baby, but we can not force them to be good, dedicated and attentive mothers. We already have plenty of examples of what bad, inattentive, abusive parents can do to a child and we would be legislating that we put more children in that situation. The economic costs of outlawing abortion would also be huge. The majority of abortions are not being chosen by married, financially stable women. We will have to shoulder the costs of prenatal care, childbirth, foodstamps, housing assistance, and unfortantely incarceration in our prisons for many of the children we will force mothers to bring into the world. The same people who want to outlaw abortion also commonly rail against welfare mothers and high taxes. We will get more of both if this ever goes through. Finally, this is a religious question because I only know the answer for my own religion. If a baby miscarries, what happens to that babies soul? We don't believe that the baby is sentenced to eternity in hell. We believe that it returns to heaven and is given another chance at life. If that is the case, why would a loving God punish the soul of an innocent and not give the soul of a baby whose mother chose abortion the same chance at life?

"09-29-2008","11563",29,"Archangel","325551","Regarding the bolded, PROVE THAT ASSERTION! We all know ""WITHOUT ANY DOUBT AT ALL"" that if we allow that unborn child to complete its gestation cycle in which it matures to the point of physical independence from its mother, then it is considered a person.","chester","325553","That's all the distinction that is needed; it's physically independent. At that point, and ONLY at that point, does it become a person subject to the protection of the law. If you doubt that, read the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution.

An interesting first post. I will deal with these points as they are fresh opinions here. It seems like you're saying that killing the healthy unborn child is preferable to holding irresponsible women culpable for their abusive and inattentive behavior. Since when do we make excuses for the criminal and even kill the victim in anticipation of their bad behavior? Don't you see how backward that type of thinking is? I'm not sure if you're aware of this but the abortion industry is a multi BILLION dollar annual industry. That means that the American people are spending that much for this type of birth control, which in literally 94% or so of cases, that is all abortions represent. And that is irresponsible women avoiding the need to take responsibility for their irresponsible actions. As a Born Again Believer, I can assure you it is more than a religious question for us. It is a quality of life issue, and a value of life issue. And in no way do I believe that when an unborn child is murdered in the womb that God sends him to hell. I can't imagine where you got such an idea. But neither do I believe that God has a revolving door in Heaven where aborted babies are recycled like we recycle plastic or paper. The bible very clearly say's that we have one life, and then the judgement. Of course aborted babies, like children who die before reaching the age of accountability aren't judged at all. So that isn't an issue for them. But they have still been deprived of the life that God intended for them, and He will hold the responsible parent(s) accountable for stealing that life from her own child. This is life and death of human beings we are talking about here kimara. It's not about economics, convenience or just personal responsibility. It's about valuing what is precious and vital to our humanity. It is our very offspring, our progeny. We valued that continuation of ourselves at one time. But this generation has become so selfish that we prefer to destroy our offspring with the excuse that if you make us bear it we will abuse it and raise criminals so better that we kill it in the womb while it is perfectly innocent and without any blemish or the stain of human sin. Can you grasp how utterly contemptible such an attitude is? From posts here, I fear most can't grasp that truth anymore. I'm not yelling at you kimara, I'm just venting. As i said, welcome to the forum, don't let my diatribe drive you away.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","01:24 AM","abortion-debates","431"

THANK YOU!!","Jay56","325556","Your Welcome, As stated above, the realist in me rejects anarchy and does allow government to make rules on the big issues, like the taking of human lives. We agree philosophically, but disagree on a practical level. The protection of human life is the most fundamental human rights and trumps my libertarian outlook. I think we both agree that government has no business in defining what or who is human. This is defined by nature, biology. I have heard no counter argument to my assertion that a unique human being is formed at conception, as defined by their unique DNA coding, so I guess we are in agreement. As stated in my original post #311 ""... that Zef is a separate, unique human being and therefore, Zef's human rights should be preserved."" So in direct response to your question; Why is the government a better determinant of the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is?"" Because that is what a good government does, only intercede on the big issues and guarantee basic human rights.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","01:32 AM","abortion-debates","432"
"09-29-2008","11563",29,"chester","325553","That's all the distinction that is needed; it's physically independent.","Archangel","325557","But it is anything but physically independent of its Mother, and you refuse to face that. It is totally and completely dependent upon it's mother for years to come or else it will die. And for a solid half of the world, where no baby formula exists, it is reliant on its mothers breast for food and its most basic survival. So it remains physically attached to its mother for between 1 and 3 more years after birth. The poorer the Country, the longer the reliance to the breast. SO I REPEAT, WHY DO YOU ARBITRARILY DECIDE THAT BIRTH IS THE MOMENT WHEN PERSONHOOD IS DESERVED OR EARNED?
