But isn't it still silly to argue about what a hypothetical (unprovable, unfalsifiable) GOD would or would not wish or do? Especially considering that such a being could do anything at all - ANYTHING given the omni-potent, and omniscient assumptions on its nature? Best to check the premises before arguing about angels! And even if GOD did not want abortions today who could possibly say that it would not want them tomorrow on a whim? Noboy at least no humans!","Winston Smith","281681","Look I have no idea if there is a God or not; but definitely not the kind of Biblical anthropomorphic God.

"08-31-2007","9979",10,"Winston Smith","281680","so for some heaven would be better than for others? what a ridiculous idea? since when do souls have eyes or limbs? So if you died senile you remain in heaven senile and feeble? If you are right, it would be ideal to die young and healthy how do you know all this? I hope you are right for the sake of the dogs though.","richbrmly","281687","No no, I am not selling anything. I have a concept or theory and its completely open for debate. What we all know, is that we must live with ourself, even now. The point really is, we are the product of chance, fantastic chance that just happened to fall in place or there is no chance anywhere. One or the other when you boil it all down. If a spark which is inert as things can get can bring about a universe with you in it. Then why can't a spark that is you, create a universe under the same conditions? The issue is perspective. Size and time are relative to the observer. Your size and awareness in time places things in perspective for you at the moment. All dimensions start from a origin. All I am saying is, ""Can't there be other centers? In other words; in a one dimensional world, everything is a straight line. On that line you are in union with things on the line. One line can never detect other lines, they would have to become aware of an added dimension to travel to it. Their Origin is different and they can never cross. Every dimension has this issue. Why not Time? we all share the same time. If all the other dimensions can have different origins why not time? We should never think in terms of limits. Oddly enough, there is room for every thought to become a world. Age has no meaning, only spirit does. Sparks become you, and we seem to have the proof as best we can tell. Theories are not religions. I'm not starting a religion, only adding that limiting the thoughts of one would be foolish. If time can take a single cell and become a man. Where are the limits? I love truth. Truth is everything. If I'm wrong about something. Ok. No need to start a war over it. What ever is right, is fine with me. But, its as Dogmatic to say, there is no God as to say there is one. Takes the same faith and Dogma. If Religion is your enemy, why become a Zealot? If we can get off one another's backs long enough. We will find the truth. All we need is time. Time seems to be a negative to all life yet here we are. And it took time to get here. You tell me, what are our limits? I have zero issues with the faithful in any case. I have issues with the leaders. They aways seem to point out the flaws in others and miss the horrors in the mirror. The truth should always be good enough. Never condemn yourself to one way of thinking when that is exactly the issue you have with others.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","09:52 AM","abortion-debates","137"

Thinking should never be a crime and your points are valid. If we are to focus on one man's family beyond all others, we're as far from a God as a wolf who focus's only on his own pack. I agree with you. I think the book is worthy of reading as long as your wise enough to ask the right questions. I find the bible to have some great insight as well complete foolishness. I find Genesis to be as scientifically advanced as foolish in many cases. Reading about an earth without form is amazing when considering it came from a sheep herder. And if your read the sequence of animals created you'd think your talking to Darwin. Good is good no mater the author. If Buddha said something Good and Good is God. Then God should get some credit in my mind. I truly believe Buddha, Jesus and Ghandi would be amazed at one another. They share one thing in common, They are human after all.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","10:44 AM","abortion-debates","138"

Jesus was thought to be one and his enemies, religious rivals, fostered this illusion with deadly results. It is ironic that hundreds of years later Christianity would become a unifying force for the Roman Empire which considered Jesus a threat. The saying of Jesus that his kingdom is not of this world is paralleled in the Buddha rejection of greed and all material things. This world of ours where the worth of a person is measured in the amount of silver coins he earns as a living, is so divorced from the teachings of Buddha and Jesus as it was thousands of years ago. The Pharisees won in the long run.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","08:53 AM","abortion-debates","139"

Nothing is going to upset American Christians more than a quote from Jesus. Its very disturbing to say the least. And what is the big issue with any quotes from Jesus? States can not in act law or govern with the original teachings of Jesus. It can't happen. Loving your enemy is a poor way to run a country, if your listen to the Christians. Forgiveness lacks the controls needed to operate a penal system. And peace makers can never retain control over boundaries outside your state. How can anyone follow Jesus and expect a return of the Jewish state to allow the return of Jesus? Only the old testament laws can allow this kind of latitude. There is no sect on the earth more against the teachings of Jesus than the Christians. They are in direct opposition to them. The issue really boils down to the problems of developing a Christ like Kingdom on earth. The laws fail in a secular world. So, the only way the Christians could overcome the teachings of the founder is to expand the base principles to include the old testament values and laws. Which is really odd understanding that Jesus was clear about the law, that no man can live by it. The first Christians where so against the old system than Paul even wrote that any man that takes circumcision must face the old law and is forever removed from the grace of Christ. This is pretty dramatic.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","09:56 AM","abortion-debates","140"
"09-01-2007","9979",10,"None","None","None","richbrmly","281791","I go just one step further and explain something Jesus was sayng that has been spun by the Christians. Jesus said that a rich man has as much chance going to heaven as a camel has in passing through the eye of a needle. Well, this is a negative for a powerful Christian theocracy, in fact it kills it before it can begin. For the last two centuries it has been common teaching in Sunday School that there is a gate in Jerusalem called the eye of the needle through which a camel could not pass unless it stooped and first had all its baggage first removed. After dark, when the main gates were shut, travellers or merchants would have to use this smaller gate, through which the camel could only enter unencumbered and crawling on its knees! Great sermon material, with the parallels of coming to God on our knees without all our baggage. A lovely story and an excellent parable for preaching but unfortunately unfounded! From at least the 15th century, and possibly as early as the 9th but not earlier, this story has been put forth, however, there is no evidence for such a gate, nor record of reprimand of the architect who may have forgotten to make a gate big enough for the camel and rider to pass through unhindered. Now, the eye of the needle gate never existed in Jesus time to start with. Second. how would it make sense for Jesus to say its as hard as passing through a gate that was used all the time? Kinda stupid to say to start with. If the gate was there and people got their camals through, it would be kind of stupid to make a statement on its difficulty when people did it all the time. The needle in Matthew and Mark is a rafic. In Luke it is a belone. But both are synonyms for needles used in sewing, but Luke's is more likely to be used by a surgeon than a seamstress. Meaning that clearly Jesus was talking about a small needle.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","10:58 AM","abortion-debates","141"

Meaning that clearly Jesus was talking about a small needle. Makes sense in Aramaic An alternative linguistic explanation is taken from George M Lamsa's Syriac-Aramaic Peshitta translation2 which has the word 'rope' in the main text but a footnote on Matthew 19:24 which states that the Aramaic word gamla means rope and camel, possibly because the ropes were made from camel hair. Evidence for this also comes from the 10th century Aramaic lexicographer Mar Bahlul who gives the meaning as a ""a large rope used to bind ships"". (cf. http://www.aramaicnt.org/HTML/LUKE/evidences/Camel.html ) Some have even suggested a pun in Aramaic between camel and gnat or louse from the Aramaic kalma 'vermin, louse'. Just as the apocryphal Acts of Peter and Andrew3 refers the saying to a literal camel and needle, so we are not meant to reason away the apparent difficulty of getting a camel through a needle's eye. For the difficulty is not apparent it is real, and not be solved by textual trickery but by taking the ludicrous language at face value. What we have instead then, I believe, is a beautiful Hebrew hyperbole, as in the tree sticking out of one's eye whilst one is removing a speck in another's eye! Indeed, Jewish Talmudic literature uses a similar aphorism about an elephant passing through the eye of a needle as a figure of speech implying the unlikely or impossible: ""They do not show a man a palm tree of gold, nor an elephant going through the eye of a needle.""4 This first instance concerned dreams and their interpretation and suggested that men only dream that which is natural or possible, not that which is unlikely ever to have occurred to them. "" who can make an elephant pass through the eye of a needle.""5 In this case, the illustration concerns a dispute between two rabbis, one of whom suggests that the other is speaking ""things which are impossible"". The camel was the largest animal seen regularly in Israel, whereas in regions where the Babylonian Talmud was written, the elephant was the biggest animal. Thus the aphorism is culturally translated from a camel to an elephant in regions outside of Israel. The aim is not, then, to explain away the paradox and make the needle a huge carpet needle for, elsewhere, the Jewish writings use the ""eye of the needle"" as a picture of a very small place, ""A needle's eye is not too narrow for two friends, but the world is not wide enough for two enemies.""6 . The ludicrous contrast between the small size of the needle's eye and the largest indigenous animal is to be preserved for its very improbability. Jesus' hearers believed that wealth and prosperity were a sign of God's blessing (cf. Leviticus and Deuteronomy). So their incredulity is more along the lines that, ""if the rich, who must be seen as righteous by God by dint of their evident blessing, can't be saved, who can be?"". Later Christians have turned this around to portray wealth as a hindrance to salvation, which it can be but no more so than many other things, when the message is that salvation is impossible for all men for it comes from God alone. But beyond impossibility is possibility with God for, elsewhere, a Jewish midrash records: ""The Holy One said, open for me a door as big as a needle's eye and I will open for you a door through which may enter tents and [camels?]""7 In other words God only needs the sinner to open up just a crack for him and God will come pouring in and set up room for an oasis. God only needs a 'foot in the door', so to speak. This is similar to the Talmudic use of two Hebrew letters, one which represents God holiness ('Q' Qoph, as in qadsh 'holy') and another representing evil ('R' Resh, as in ra' 'evil'), in a story told for the purpose of teaching the Hebrew alphabet and Jewish morals. It is said that 'q' has a separated opening in order that should 'r' repent he may enter into God's holiness through the small opening. A brief survey of sermons or search on the Internet reveals how many perpetuate the myth of the small gate in Jerusalem. Victorian travellers to the Holy Land even claim to have been shown it. The inaccuracy may appear harmless but it is neither good scholarship nor good exposition. The exaggerated and contrasted size is deliberate and is not an overt judgement on riches or poverty. Jesus reflects on how hard it often is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God. The riches are a distraction and hard to share if one is too attached to them. The disciples' incredulity is that if even the rich cannot be saved, who can? But the verdict is that even the rich, not only the rich, will find it impossible to save themselves but with God all things are possible. http://www.biblicalhebrew.com/nt/camelneedle.htm","JPSartre12","281793","[/quote] I am naturally suspicious of people that quote someone elese's work word for word but don't ascribe authorship to it, leaving people to ASSume that it was an original thought.

My fault, does not condemn my concept as much as Jesus teachings which where around before he preached are not condemned. The point is made though. Your argument is that Jesus didn't mean what he said or that Luke failed in his reconstruction of the quote still kills the current miss leading the church follows.
