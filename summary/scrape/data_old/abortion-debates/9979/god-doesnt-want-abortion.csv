Genesis 19:24-25 24 Then the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrahfrom the LORD out of the heavens. 25 Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, including all those living in the citiesand also the vegetation in the land. Joshua 6:21 21 They observed the ban by putting to the sword all living creatures in the city: men and women, young and old, as well as oxen, sheep and asses.

I would agree. This one certainly seems to be out of context, as reading a mere 2 verses farther yields the statement that ""[Menahem] did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. Are you then suggesting that what Menahem did was wrong? I would agree. And so, apparently, does God. God, by definition, cannot murder. And God, simply because he is God, can kill anyone he chooses in whatever manner he chooses. Perhaps you wish to sit in judgment of God; but you yourself would have to be God in order to do this. And I don't know about anyone else, but I highly doubt that God would be so asinine as to misspell the word ""describes."" Well, I have disagreed. But supposing that you are right (and you are not as I have shown), then you have successfully shown that abortion is frowned upon in Scripture. The verses you quote ALL describe the actions in those verses negatively. Congratulations, you proved what you were trying to disprove.","ShadowPikachu","267126","So, you have no problem with the fact that this is abortion and was caused by god? So, none of those women who slept with men were pregnant at the time? So, you have no problem with the fact that this is abortion and was caused by god? Guess I didn't read the following verses (mainly because they are under another heading) - I just looked for places with ""ripped up"" after I saw it in the previous part - my bad on this one, but the others still stand. Lovely God you worship there - killing innocent children, the foetuses you so worship, etc. BTW, aren't you and Steeve the ones who usually get all hung up when semantics come into the debate? If I'm wrong, sorry, but you are certainly bringing semantics now. First off, God is asinine enough to kill what your ilk calls ""innocent foetuses"", etc., so I wouldn't put anything past him. Secondly, I see you are falling into the usual O.P. of your ilk: when without an argument, attack the opponent on a simple spelling error (especially when the one letter is right next to the one intended on the keyboard ""n"" is right next to ""b"" last time I checked). Really Phyllis, get an actual argument instead of attacking your opponent on spelling errors. Actually, no, they do NOT. The first three ALL describe God causing them - are you saying the bible is describing God's actions negatively? Or are you saying that killing your precious foetuses is just fine as long as the persons carrying them are ""wicked"".

However the question does arise as to why GOD would permit it to be possible if he did not want it. Aside from that, I generally consider abortion to be a decision to be taken by the woman up till the third trimester at which time the community interest and interests of the state begin to become significant. Nobody should be FORCED to have an abortion, but nobody should be forced NOT to have one within the first two trimesters. Its a personal choice driven by health, lifestyle, and moral beleifs.

"06-06-2007","9979",2,"Phyllis","267177","I have said that I do not agree with you that the quotes you provided deal with abortion. But, I have assumed it for the sake of argument. With that caveat in place...I don't have a problem with God killing people that he made. It goes beyond the text to assume that there were. answered above. OK. This is not semantics. God, because he is God, can lay down rules for his creatures to follow. And God, because he is God, can punish his creatures for not obeying those rules. This is not semantics. It simply is not possible for God to commit murder. God is subject to no law, and therefore cannot kill a person in violation of any law. And it is a gross misunderstanding to suggest that God kills innocent people. There are no innocent people according to Scripture (which appears to be the standard established in this thread). And I don't worship fetuses, as doing so would be idolatry. No, that was not an argument. It was an illustration of a point. The point was this: that in order to stand in moral judgment of God, you would have to be of higher moral character than God. In other words, you would have to be God in order to judge God. Now, the point I made is that this is highly unlikely, as any being claiming to be God would not misspell words, no matter how closely the letters are on the keyboard. To be clear, I was not attacking you (at least I didn't intend to) by calling out your spelling mistake. I was trying to illustrate a point. And the point was this: you are not perfect, and therefore, you are not God. And if you are not God, then you really cannot stand in moral judgment of God. I think you have missed the point. The verses you cited all describe the actions as a judgment. That is to say, it is a punishment. Punishments carry with them a negative connotation. The Jews would not have understood those verses to be positive. In other words, the abortions (as you call them) were a bad thing to and not a good thing. They were a negative and not a positive.","ShadowPikachu","267198","So bereaving them when they conceive children and causing their wombs to miscarry - no that wouldn't be abortion, now would it? Guess anyone can just do chemical abortion or take herbal medicines to cause abortion and you would not be able to call that abortion. Actually you have answered nothing. And yes, it goes beyond ""the text"", but are you rational enough to realize that when women have sex with men, they might get pregnant, and that among a large group as referenced, it is ludicrous to say that there were not pregnant women? If you do not have that rationality or at least the credibility to say so, we have nothing further to discuss - you just can't convince religious extremists (Christian OR Muslim) As I said, semantics (just as when your ilk claims abortion is murder and when we say no, it really is not and then you guys bitch and moan about us getting into semantics) Actually, foetuses, which your ilk claims are living humans, have done nothing that can possibly be sinful. And you might not worship them, but it sure looks like it to everyone else. Yes, I said that it wasn't an argument - it was an attack on my person, on my misspelling a word. And no, I am not God, and neither are you, and neither were the writers of the Bible (which, only through Circular Logic is Gods Word) And yet, you and your ilk are the first to moan about not killing a foetus that is the result of a rape/incest case now, since it is God doing it, the poor little foetuses (in the women who are being punished) dont matter.

"06-06-2007","9979",2,"Phyllis","267231","There is a manifest and obvious difference between God causing a miscarriage (which may or may not be the case in the passages you quoted), and a doctor doing the same. It is as simple as this: in the first example the Creator is dealing with his creatures as he sees fit. In the second instance, one creature is dealing with another creature as the former sees fit. I have said that God is obviously free to do as he pleases. But it does not follow from that fact that you are free to do as you please. God can righteously and justly kill human beings. Human beings, on the other hand, cannot righteously nor justly murder other human beings. On the one hand you admit that your conclusion relies on an assumption that rests completely outside of the text. And then you fault me for not being ""rational"" enough to realize the obvious fact that there were pregnant women among the group. Now that is most inconsistent. The reality is that if the Bible is to be taken literally in this instance, then it ought to be taken literally in other instances as well. And when it is taken literally in other instances, we find that God is quite a miraculous God. He very well could have ensured that no one was pregnant at the time. It just goes beyond the text, and to form a conclusion based upon a biased assumption is, well, biased. I say, and maintain, that this passage does not speak to abortion at all, and to say that it does, to quote you, ""goes beyond the 'text.'"" It goes beyond the facts that are given. I doubt you know very much about me or my ilk. I am not playing semantics, though I will always maintain that words have meaning. And in this case the being we call ""God"" simply cannot murder because of the nature of God and the nature of murder are wholly inconsistent. There you go talking about my ilk again. More conclusions that are not based in fact. But I will say this: you seem to have an interesting view of what it is to worship something. You can continue to distort if you want. But that doesn't make the distortion correct. There you go again talking about things of which you cannot possibly know. I mean seriously, do you really think you know anything about me? What are you even talking about here? The pro-life position is simply that only the Creator of life has the authority end life. If you buy a boat, and proceed to destroy it with a sledgehammer, no one has a claim against you. But if you buy a boat, and I destroy it with a sledgehammer, then you have a claim against me. It's a principle of ownership. The creatures belong the the Creator. There you go again. Is this the fourth time now?","ShadowPikachu","267233","Yep, lovely god you worship - free license to either commit or ""order"" abortions (as he did to Moses in one passage I quoted) and genocide (when your ilk is supposedly against abortion and such). You can try to justify it all you like - it is unjustifiable if you are against abortion. And, as I said this before, I will now say it again as you remain irrational: If you do not have that rationality or at least the credibility to say so, we have nothing further to discuss - you just can't convince religious extremists (Christian OR Muslim) This will be my last post to you unless you have the integrity to agree that some of the women (of a whole people) would have been pregnant.

Here's the complete passage of 2 Kings 15:16 that he refers to. Note the bolded verse. 2Ki 15:15 Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and the conspiracy which he led, indeed they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 2Ki 15:16 Then from Tirzah, Menahem attacked Tiphsah, all who were there, and its territory. Because they did not surrender, therefore he attacked it. All the women there who were with child he ripped open. 2Ki 15:17 In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem the son of Gadi became king over Israel, and reigned ten years in Samaria. 2Ki 15:18 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not depart all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin. So typically, the part SP neglected to share in his account is that God didn't order or condone of the acts of Menahem, for he did evil in the sight of the Lord.","JPSartre12","267588","You will find a decided lack of honesty when dealing with particular people in this forum, AA.

So I went back and checked out the Hosea passage in context and notice that he did it again. Chapters 8 and 9 are Gods judgement on Israel for their lack of faithfulness and Idolatry as the people of God.Here is what SP posted. Hsa 9:11 As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird-- No birth, no pregnancy, and no conception! Hsa 9:12 Though they bring up their children, Yet I will bereave them to the last man. Yes, woe to them when I depart from them! Hsa 9:13 Just as I saw Ephraim like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place, So Ephraim will bring out his children to the murderer."" Hsa 9:14 Give them, O LORD-- What will You give? Give them a miscarrying womb And dry breasts! Hsa 9:15 ""All their wickedness is in Gilgal, For there I hated them. Because of the evil of their deeds I will drive them from My house; I will love them no more. All their princes are rebellious. Hsa 9:16 Ephraim is stricken, Their root is dried up; They shall bear no fruit. Yes, were they to bear children, I would kill the darlings of their womb."" Hsa 9:17 My God will cast them away, Because they did not obey Him; And they shall be wanderers among the nations. Note the prophecy regarding the loss of their homeland in the bolded. Now here in Chapter 11 we see the Lords Fatherly Love, or as Paul Harvey would say, the rest of the story. Hsa 11:1 ""WHEN Israe was a child, I loved him, And out of Egypt I called My son. Hsa 11:2 As they called them,[fn1] So they went from them;[fn2] They sacrificed to the Baals, And burned incense to carved images. Hsa 11:3 ""I taught Ephraim to walk, Taking them by their arms;[fn3] But they did not know that I healed them. Hsa 11:4 I drew them with gentle cords,[fn4] With bands of love, And I was to them as those who take the yoke from their neck.[fn5] I stooped and fed them. Hsa 11:5 ""He shall not return to the land of Egypt; But the Assyrian shall be his king, Because they refused to repent. Hsa 11:6 And the sword shall slash in his cities, Devour his districts, And consume them, Because of their own counsels. Hsa 11:7 My people are bent on backsliding from Me. Though they call to the Most High,[fn6] None at all exalt Him. Hsa 11:8 ""How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I set you like Zeboiim? My heart churns within Me; My sympathy is stirred. Hsa 11:9 I will not execute the fierceness of My anger; I will not again destroy Ephraim. For I am God, and not man, The Holy One in your midst; And I will not come with terror.[fn7] Hsa 11:10 ""They shall walk after the LORD. He will roar like a lion. When He roars, Then His sons shall come trembling from the west; Hsa 11:11 They shall come trembling like a bird from Egypt, Like a dove from the land of Assyria. And I will let them dwell in their houses,"" Says the LORD. Hsa 11:12 ""Ephraim has encircled Me with lies, And the house of Israel with deceit; But Judah still walks with God, Even with the Holy One[fn8] who is faithful.

A woman can become impregnated at nearly a yearly rate. Breast feeding does not slow this process. Any female that gets a disease that harms her immune system or requires a treatment that stuns said system has a high potential of losing her life if a fetus is gestating in her. How many women while pregnant discover they have cancer? Age is a factor in a woman being able to carry a fetus to term. 15 years and younger have physical issues that can do harm to them. Women over 50 or in Menopause can actually become pregnant and their bodies would have a tuff time carrying to term. Abortions happen in Mexico, where it is all but outlawed. The Mexican legislators who voted to decriminalize abortion cited the brutal effects of this gap between theory and practice: an estimated 5,000 women die in Mexico every year from botched back-street or self-administered abortions; a further 150,000 have to be treated in hospital every year and 1.5 million abortions happen every year. The penalty for a woman seeking an abortion is 1 to 5 years in prison. Everywhere on the earth where abortion is outlawed it still happens. The penalty in Saudi Arabia for performing an abortion is death, yet there are doctors that do it and get this penalty. Why? Nearly every picture you have ever seen regarding an abortion has been a lie. I know, the end justifies the means I guess. But most pictures are of donated fetuses preserved from a college. Most where still born. A Fetus just to the second trimester is only 3.5 inches long. And the brain has just over enough neurons to cause a heart to beat which happens 17 weeks into a pregnancy. Not enough brains for even a heart beat for 3 months. The Mortality rate on births before birth control was over 20%. This means the baby died and or the mother every five births. You dont want life. Pro-life is far from being for life. You want to make the choice of who should die. And if the fetus can not come to term then both should die. Because that is what Pro-life means; it means you take the choice from the woman and her medical staff. NO ONE is pro-abortionThat is sick. People are pro-choice, meaning they can not determine who should live or die. That is the choice of the host and her medical professionals who are sworn by oath to do something you can not seem to do. Defend life. A Fetus can not live without a host. It is parasitic in nature and requires service from a host. One thing any child should be guarantied in life is it gestated in a host that cared about its birth. Of the last five serial killers in the U.S. they had one thing in common among themselves; Just one common thing. They where adopted. Really really.. Fetal gestation requires a person to care for themselves. The fetus has a thin membrane between it and a slow death. Anyone can cause a failure in gestation; the path is as simple to follow as a double yellow line down a highway. Abortion can not be stopped. It has been here even before GOD talked to Moses. Mary whom Jesus defended was a prostitute that had no children. You tell me, how on earth does that happen?? As for the Bibles punishment for aborting a fetus?? Well, I am pro-choice but I think the bibles penalty for causing an abortion on a woman that actually wants the fetus to become a child to be pretty weak. Exodus 21[22] If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. The guy that causes a woman to abort?? Oh he is fined...Loses some cash. That will teach him. Funny thing though Pro-life people...I thought the fetus was a human??? Oh and Exodus is the mouth of God stuff, burning bush stuff. Funny, Pro-choice people would have a cow over this. I think prison should be required for the potential that was lost alone.

A dream requires energy, I think it takes around 300 calories to dream. Its costly get the theater we get when we go to sleep. Even with all that against a life after death, I still have hope. The hope is in a few facts; the conservation of energy, the knowledge that mater has only energy as a term and everything else is a constant, and that time more than likely is cyclic in many ways. Right now we share time, will we always do so? We don't know where mater comes from. All we know is that its based on energy which is something we can use.

I am very interested in what we discover in DNA. 80% of our DNA does nothing really. Wouldn't it be a blast to discover someone actually wrote a book after all? As far as a fetus, when it dreams its a living soul. I think the mother's life is the greatest consideration naturally. 4 women die every day in child birth, just in the United States. Last year over 4 million births happened and 1.3 million women where hurt during the process. They where given choice and chose to carry to term. 1.2 million women chose not to carry to term. If the choice is removed the deaths and injuries will clearly go up. Seems choice is the best option in my mind. When all is said and done; A fetus is a parasitic animal that requires a cooperative host. The host has to cooperate for a viable child to come into being. The path to the fetus is so simple to follow a child could do an abortion. Only a thin membrane protects the fetus. In Mexico there where nearly a million abortions when it was illegal. 800,000 hospitalized women with 8000 deaths. If you see a baby, you see the evidence that a mother cared enough to take care of herself and carry it to term. We all deserve to know that much from our mothers at least. We can't strap people down and force them to host something they want to forgo. Choice makes sense.

What we all know, is that we must live with ourself, even now. The point really is, we are the product of chance, fantastic chance that just happened to fall in place or there is no chance anywhere. One or the other when you boil it all down. If a spark which is inert as things can get can bring about a universe with you in it. Then why can't a spark that is you, create a universe under the same conditions? The issue is perspective. Size and time are relative to the observer. Your size and awareness in time places things in perspective for you at the moment. All dimensions start from a origin. All I am saying is, ""Can't there be other centers? In other words; in a one dimensional world, everything is a straight line. On that line you are in union with things on the line. One line can never detect other lines, they would have to become aware of an added dimension to travel to it. Their Origin is different and they can never cross. Every dimension has this issue. Why not Time? we all share the same time. If all the other dimensions can have different origins why not time? We should never think in terms of limits. Oddly enough, there is room for every thought to become a world. Age has no meaning, only spirit does. Sparks become you, and we seem to have the proof as best we can tell. Theories are not religions. I'm not starting a religion, only adding that limiting the thoughts of one would be foolish. If time can take a single cell and become a man. Where are the limits?

We will find the truth. All we need is time. Time seems to be a negative to all life yet here we are. And it took time to get here. You tell me, what are our limits? I have zero issues with the faithful in any case. I have issues with the leaders. They aways seem to point out the flaws in others and miss the horrors in the mirror.

Nothing is going to upset American Christians more than a quote from Jesus. Its very disturbing to say the least. And what is the big issue with any quotes from Jesus? States can not in act law or govern with the original teachings of Jesus. It can't happen. Loving your enemy is a poor way to run a country, if your listen to the Christians. Forgiveness lacks the controls needed to operate a penal system. And peace makers can never retain control over boundaries outside your state. How can anyone follow Jesus and expect a return of the Jewish state to allow the return of Jesus? Only the old testament laws can allow this kind of latitude. There is no sect on the earth more against the teachings of Jesus than the Christians. They are in direct opposition to them. The issue really boils down to the problems of developing a Christ like Kingdom on earth. The laws fail in a secular world. So, the only way the Christians could overcome the teachings of the founder is to expand the base principles to include the old testament values and laws. Which is really odd understanding that Jesus was clear about the law, that no man can live by it. The first Christians where so against the old system than Paul even wrote that any man that takes circumcision must face the old law and is forever removed from the grace of Christ.

Jesus said that a rich man has as much chance going to heaven as a camel has in passing through the eye of a needle. Well, this is a negative for a powerful Christian theocracy, in fact it kills it before it can begin. For the last two centuries it has been common teaching in Sunday School that there is a gate in Jerusalem called the eye of the needle through which a camel could not pass unless it stooped and first had all its baggage first removed. After dark, when the main gates were shut, travellers or merchants would have to use this smaller gate, through which the camel could only enter unencumbered and crawling on its knees! Great sermon material, with the parallels of coming to God on our knees without all our baggage. A lovely story and an excellent parable for preaching but unfortunately unfounded! From at least the 15th century, and possibly as early as the 9th but not earlier, this story has been put forth, however, there is no evidence for such a gate, nor record of reprimand of the architect who may have forgotten to make a gate big enough for the camel and rider to pass through unhindered. Now, the eye of the needle gate never existed in Jesus time to start with. Second. how would it make sense for Jesus to say its as hard as passing through a gate that was used all the time? Kinda stupid to say to start with. If the gate was there and people got their camals through, it would be kind of stupid to make a statement on its difficulty when people did it all the time. The needle in Matthew and Mark is a rafic. In Luke it is a belone. But both are synonyms for needles used in sewing, but Luke's is more likely to be used by a surgeon than a seamstress.

Meaning that clearly Jesus was talking about a small needle. Makes sense in Aramaic An alternative linguistic explanation is taken from George M Lamsa's Syriac-Aramaic Peshitta translation2 which has the word 'rope' in the main text but a footnote on Matthew 19:24 which states that the Aramaic word gamla means rope and camel, possibly because the ropes were made from camel hair. Evidence for this also comes from the 10th century Aramaic lexicographer Mar Bahlul who gives the meaning as a ""a large rope used to bind ships"". (cf. http://www.aramaicnt.org/HTML/LUKE/evidences/Camel.html ) Some have even suggested a pun in Aramaic between camel and gnat or louse from the Aramaic kalma 'vermin, louse'. Just as the apocryphal Acts of Peter and Andrew3 refers the saying to a literal camel and needle, so we are not meant to reason away the apparent difficulty of getting a camel through a needle's eye. For the difficulty is not apparent it is real, and not be solved by textual trickery but by taking the ludicrous language at face value. What we have instead then, I believe, is a beautiful Hebrew hyperbole, as in the tree sticking out of one's eye whilst one is removing a speck in another's eye! Indeed, Jewish Talmudic literature uses a similar aphorism about an elephant passing through the eye of a needle as a figure of speech implying the unlikely or impossible: ""They do not show a man a palm tree of gold, nor an elephant going through the eye of a needle.""4 This first instance concerned dreams and their interpretation and suggested that men only dream that which is natural or possible, not that which is unlikely ever to have occurred to them. "" who can make an elephant pass through the eye of a needle.""5 In this case, the illustration concerns a dispute between two rabbis, one of whom suggests that the other is speaking ""things which are impossible"". The camel was the largest animal seen regularly in Israel, whereas in regions where the Babylonian Talmud was written, the elephant was the biggest animal. Thus the aphorism is culturally translated from a camel to an elephant in regions outside of Israel. The aim is not, then, to explain away the paradox and make the needle a huge carpet needle for, elsewhere, the Jewish writings use the ""eye of the needle"" as a picture of a very small place, ""A needle's eye is not too narrow for two friends, but the world is not wide enough for two enemies.""6 . The ludicrous contrast between the small size of the needle's eye and the largest indigenous animal is to be preserved for its very improbability. Jesus' hearers believed that wealth and prosperity were a sign of God's blessing (cf. Leviticus and Deuteronomy). So their incredulity is more along the lines that, ""if the rich, who must be seen as righteous by God by dint of their evident blessing, can't be saved, who can be?"". Later Christians have turned this around to portray wealth as a hindrance to salvation, which it can be but no more so than many other things, when the message is that salvation is impossible for all men for it comes from God alone. But beyond impossibility is possibility with God for, elsewhere, a Jewish midrash records: ""The Holy One said, open for me a door as big as a needle's eye and I will open for you a door through which may enter tents and [camels?]""7 In other words God only needs the sinner to open up just a crack for him and God will come pouring in and set up room for an oasis. God only needs a 'foot in the door', so to speak. This is similar to the Talmudic use of two Hebrew letters, one which represents God holiness ('Q' Qoph, as in qadsh 'holy') and another representing evil ('R' Resh, as in ra' 'evil'), in a story told for the purpose of teaching the Hebrew alphabet and Jewish morals. It is said that 'q' has a separated opening in order that should 'r' repent he may enter into God's holiness through the small opening. A brief survey of sermons or search on the Internet reveals how many perpetuate the myth of the small gate in Jerusalem. Victorian travellers to the Holy Land even claim to have been shown it. The inaccuracy may appear harmless but it is neither good scholarship nor good exposition. The exaggerated and contrasted size is deliberate and is not an overt judgement on riches or poverty. Jesus reflects on how hard it often is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God. The riches are a distraction and hard to share if one is too attached to them. The disciples' incredulity is that if even the rich cannot be saved, who can? But the verdict is that even the rich, not only the rich, will find it impossible to save themselves but with God all things are possible. http://www.biblicalhebrew.com/nt/camelneedle.htm","JPSartre12","281793","[/quote] I am naturally suspicious of people that quote someone elese's work word for word but don't ascribe authorship to it, leaving people to ASSume that it was an original thought.

As for God, it appears you and I defined God differently so I will not answer the original question to avoid arguing semantics.","richbrmly","285270","With Respect to the Middle Eastern God (God of Moses, Christians, Muslims); life has a very low value. Children are killed for punishment. Women are killed for simply looking the wrong direction (turned to salt). God has ordered the deaths all family members and cities of peoples many times. In reality; Human life is momentary. All living organisms die, and you will die. There is no way to prevent a person from dieing. The question is what makes a being, thats the real question. Your bones will be replaced cell for cell four times. Your skin is in constant death throws. Sperm, eggs, blood cells give up life and have no function or reason for being more than not. Your personality has a lot to do with the chemistry of your brain, and a drug can alter your aggression level, conscientiousness and mood. The question can never be the value of life, because no life is saved. All life is doomed and this allows many religions to toy with life after death concepts. Logically if life is after death, then the question of taking life would never even be raised. One could not take life. All religions understand life is lost and in placing value on life, seek to preserve their own. No one joins a religion to lose their lives, they seek to preserve it. All faiths provide promises of a better and longer life with the sacrifice of living out their current lives in worship and ceremony. I would ask a religious person if they have considered the real value of the current life they lead? Is it reasonable to sacrifice treasure and time to a faith when that time could have been used for the benefit of their offspring? Its a reasonable question. To argue life can be taken is to understand life is fragile and easily disturbed. The higher the value placed on life requires the understanding that life indeed ends. The Wright brothers plane will still fly, its just over 100 years old (very young considering its the first) and no human can match that longevity. Humans live on average 80 years. Very short period of time for life and with that knowledge its value is limited because it can't be kept. Sparks are pretty and have value simply from producing light though they last a very short period of time. You will not last much longer as I will not. 80 is a very small number. All peoples place value on beings. When we determine life has lost its ability to be called a being; I.E. brain dead, we lose the desire to preserve it unless we find value is using for the benefit of beings. We use parts of whole humans for other humans. We do this when a human has lost its being. Man places higher values on higher levels of conscientiousness. A dolphin has a higher value to us that an ant. We tend to eat cows because they have very small minds and are unaware of loss even when a sibling's life is taken right in front of them. Nature allows and has mechanisms for abortion. Women have to care for them selfs or these mechanisms will undermine the gestation process. Clearly if there is God the mechanisms for abortion are authored there.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","08:04 AM","abortion-debates","202"

I disagree. If the question was ""what makes us a being"" then logically, brain dead people, those who cannot communicate, and people with various other disorders would make them life unworthy of life. For instance, a feral child is not a human as it cannot communicate or feel empathy for other humans. A brain dead person is not a human as it cannot think or communicate. A fetus is not a human as it is incapable of doing any of the above. The question to be asked is ""What is the value of human life?"" A fetus serves the greatest purpose of all. Regardless of whether it is life or not, it has the potential to become a living, conscious being. new flesh and blood. I don't understand the relevance of life-span and death of humans in this discussion. Yes, every organism dies, but is that a justification for killing? ""It's going to die anyways in fifty years or so, let's kill it now."" Doesn't sound like it constitutes a valid argument, Imho. Very true, but that value is entirely subjective. A lot of people eat cows and not cats and dogs because of the utility of doing so, despite cows and dogs being nearly identical cognitively. Can you substantiate your claim that a cow will be unaware of their calf's life is taken right in from of them? Cows are not stupid animals and even if they were, the intelligence of the animal should not matter. It is still a living, conscious being. I have read briefly about natural abortion processes such as miscarriage. I'm not saying that abortion is wrong because it is done unnaturally, but that it is wrong because of the value of life inside the woman.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","05:05 PM","abortion-debates","203"

I disagree. If the question was ""what makes us a being"" then logically, brain dead people, those who cannot communicate, and people with various other disorders would make them life unworthy of life. For instance, a feral child is not a human as it cannot communicate or feel empathy for other humans. A brain dead person is not a human as it cannot think or communicate. A fetus is not a human as it is incapable of doing any of the above. The question to be asked is ""What is the value of human life?"" A fetus serves the greatest purpose of all. Regardless of whether it is life or not, it has the potential to become a living, conscious being. new flesh and blood. I don't understand the relevance of life-span and death of humans in this discussion. Yes, every organism dies, but is that a justification for killing? ""It's going to die anyways in fifty years or so, let's kill it now."" Doesn't sound like it constitutes a valid argument, Imho. Very true, but that value is entirely subjective. A lot of people eat cows and not cats and dogs because of the utility of doing so, despite cows and dogs being nearly identical cognitively.

I don't think that's what we're really seeking. I think what we're seeking is an experience of being alive, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonances within our own innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive. Why should anyone listen to the Gibranlike bleatings of that anti-Semite?","god-doesnt-want-abortion","07:13 PM","abortion-debates","206"

Right now in labs all over the country, what you call human is in freezers waiting to be flushed, or used in research, or given to a person that can gestate them. Lets say your right tdocher. Your believes should call you into action today tdkocher, your female family members can save these lives right now. All they have to do is gestate them. Let the embros gestate in their bodies and go to term. By your own moral code, if you don't, your allowing their deaths because its very clear your females can save them today. Don't you dare ask them or give them a choice tdocher, you force them by your moral law. Prove to me and the world they are living humans tdocher. You can do that very simply by saving what you can. You can save a boat load of them by simply using all your females over and over again. If you don't do this your a lier or the lifes of these embros has no meaning to any of your females. I am very interested in how many you save. Let us know.","Tdkocher","300401","First of all I believe your K key is broken because your misspelled my name three times. Second, I never said anything about control or power. I believe that you shouldn't die just because you were concived during rape. Because someone decided to give there egg up dosen't mean that someone else should have to bear the child. We could either have the mother come back and get the egg or have it born and be a ""testube"" baby.
