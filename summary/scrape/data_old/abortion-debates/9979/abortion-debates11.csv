Why is it that the US allows for the most abortions yet our mortality rate is so high? I see no relationship but it seems you do...please explain. Also, the chances of at least one person dying during an abortion is almost 100% the way I look at so your numbers don't mean much.","richbrmly","281938","Total proof? Course not. We can only see what the factors where during the prohibition and relate the factors to countries under it.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","04:03 PM","abortion-debates","151"

"09-02-2007","9979",11,"richbrmly","281796","I am naturally suspicious of people that quote someone elese's work word for word but don't ascribe authorship to it, leaving people to ASSume that it was an original thought. Here's the real author of the above. http://www.biblicalhebrew.com/nt/camelneedle.htm Now, adding to the disingenuous nature of the post, it continues on to show how a rich man CAN attain Heaven. One post is disingenuous while the nature of another under the same standards is not? Authorship should be covered clearly when a work is to be published. The quote ascribes to my concept before the search for the quote and naturally it was used. The quote came where you have stated. My fault, does not condemn my concept as much as Jesus teachings which where around before he preached are not condemned. The point is made though. Your argument is that Jesus didn't mean what he said or that Luke failed in his reconstruction of the quote still kills the current miss leading the church follows. I would also add that every educated Preacher knows the issues around the quote and they have interests in containing it. As you must have.","JPSartre12","281977","My ""interest"" is in exposing frauds. I try not to get into arguments about religion and gay rights.

No fraud. though fraud requires gain like a grade or money. The material was free. Why we both could copy it. I took actual data. A collection of facts presented in a paragraph. The original writer didn't make up the facts, they where gathered. I didn't steal a new comic book character or Story. The writer can switch protections on, but that wasn't the case. the writing was free to the public and its how we got there. I took data someone else gathered. No fraud involved, that would be illegal. If I did as you have lied, and committed fraud, I'd be liable. And you seem smart enough to know this is not the case. I should have stated where the information was copied. I admitted that. Sorry, about your anger over the message. But its not my message after all. Its as I said, ""Nothing upsets a Christian more, than quoting Jesus!"" Buddhists like the quotes better. Now, I know the message burns but I didn't write that as well. As far as argument, I agree you have no leg to stand on and backing away is very wise indeed.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","12:25 AM","abortion-debates","157"

Race: the reason is lame, races are here do to births. Quality of care, This is an issue isn't it. what would be the greatest differing factor in the care of a pregnant woman? What would alter her health the most? You know the answer and I have stated it. Age: Ok, but what would be the fix for the issue Steven? Choice Steven. It would have altered the outcome. Course these are factors. What has caused the factors to suddenly come in to play? You can not call age a factor when our birth rates have consistently out performed our death rates. So to say I have altered their conclusions would be a lie on your part. No, the same in all respects Steven. The only real question that remains is; why the sudden thrust into chances these individuals took? My conclusion Steven....Is completely sound.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","11:18 AM","abortion-debates","160"

Aside from my name not being ""Steven"", I find your conclusion to be nothing more than wanting a certain conclusion and finding bogus reasoning to get there. In this case the conclusion stated is not even remotely close to what you think it is yet you seem to want a different conclusion but have no evidence, no reasoning, and pretty much nothing other than belief to get a conclusion from those given facts. I wish Another Opinion would respond to this as we both agree that based on given facts you need reason and evidence to at least come to some reasonable conclusion.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","02:02 PM","abortion-debates","161"

More women are dieing TODAY which a FACT...(can not be spun).....Than when your pretty boys took over. People have reasons Steve (if not Steven)...The reasons your playing your game of calling me a lyer on...WOULD not change if abortion where outlawed. Are you catching up yet?? The reasons listed are based on what KILLED THE WOMEN.... Their choice killed them and YOU CAN NOT ASK A DEAD WOMAN why she made the NEGATIVE choice. But lets be honest Steve...Lets hold ourself to the same standards...one time and be honest. You know; you can not say their life threatening choices where NOT made because your media blitzes on fetal worth. In fact, if you can be as honest as I am for one moment, you would have to admit your Dogmatic connections to fetuses having souls and being children would have to have the effects we are seeing. The effects would have to be as the outcome currently is.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","03:02 PM","abortion-debates","162"

You can't ask dead people why they chose what they did steve. The reasoning and conclusions are sound. We (you and I) know that. A fetal brain doesn't even have enough brain to feel pain or anything, before 20 to 24 weeks; nothing there. Thats 5 months of gestation for those who don't want to do the math. There are faithful people out there that believe what they are told in Church. They buy into all the information a theologian sells them to the determent of their own lives. You have what is here, the woman, and you have what could possibly be, the fetus. Many people are buying the dogma and giving their lives to it.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","03:57 PM","abortion-debates","164"

Again, please show me a correlation between pro-life legislation and increase in mortality rates in pregnancy. You already failed to show the 10,000 deaths a year number and you changed the debate on that one too. It is becoming clearer and clearer that you aren't here to debate or offer reasonable discussion as Another Opinion and I believe we should have here but you just want to offer a close-minded view with bogus facts. If this how you want to continue posting then so be it but count me out and I'll just add you to the ignore list now.
