That's when a new person emerges. At any rate, that is exactly the heart of Justice Blackmun's original opinion in Roe. He declared that precisely because there is no objective standard that the law must remain silent on the subject and let each woman come to her own conclusion. IMHO, that was very forward thinking in 1973.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","07:34 AM","abortion-debates","196"
"09-18-2007","9979",14,"chemist99a","284321","I know very well that a fertilized egg is not a person and I know that a four week old fetus is also not a person. If a woman is raped and she elects to have an abortion early on its clear that no person is killed in the process.","Zardoz","284428","You do realize that you didn't answer the question on LIFE. Instead, you obsfucate with comments on 'person'. Life does begin at conception. Personhood begins when ever someone arbitrarily says it does. 3rd trimester. Woman's own choice. Sometime arond age 4. Never... Personhood is far more subjective than life.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","07:57 AM","abortion-debates","197"
"09-18-2007","9979",14,"chemist99a","284435","Really? And do you think an egg or sperm are dead? That somehow LIFE is generated when one brings two dead objects together? How is that supposed to work? And just where in the process from progenitor cells to the egg and/or sperm does death occurr? And how does fertilization somehow restore life to the system?","Zardoz","284458","At no time did I state the component parts of this seperate, human life, were dead. Thanks for not making such assumptions. We're talking, I remind you, about HUMAN life. Not sperm life. Not egg life. You really need to follow the specific issues here. You'd fail miserably in a court of law...unless you have razzle dazzle...","god-doesnt-want-abortion","01:09 PM","abortion-debates","199"

Are your sperm/eggs from some other species? Are they lizard life? elephant life? What kind of life do they have (and you admit they do) outside of human life? Sorry but sperm and egg are human and they are alive, how can you deny both statuses? Oh yes if both sperm and egg are living matter then the claim ""Life begins at conception"" is patently false. I will assume you modify that phrase now to be ""Human Life begins at conception"" but that is also clearly false on the face of it.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","02:56 PM","abortion-debates","200"

Children are killed for punishment. Women are killed for simply looking the wrong direction (turned to salt). God has ordered the deaths all family members and cities of peoples many times. In reality; Human life is momentary. All living organisms die, and you will die. There is no way to prevent a person from dieing. The question is what makes a being, thats the real question. Your bones will be replaced cell for cell four times. Your skin is in constant death throws. Sperm, eggs, blood cells give up life and have no function or reason for being more than not. Your personality has a lot to do with the chemistry of your brain, and a drug can alter your aggression level, conscientiousness and mood. The question can never be the value of life, because no life is saved. All life is doomed and this allows many religions to toy with life after death concepts. Logically if life is after death, then the question of taking life would never even be raised. One could not take life. All religions understand life is lost and in placing value on life, seek to preserve their own. No one joins a religion to lose their lives, they seek to preserve it. All faiths provide promises of a better and longer life with the sacrifice of living out their current lives in worship and ceremony. I would ask a religious person if they have considered the real value of the current life they lead? Is it reasonable to sacrifice treasure and time to a faith when that time could have been used for the benefit of their offspring? Its a reasonable question. To argue life can be taken is to understand life is fragile and easily disturbed. The higher the value placed on life requires the understanding that life indeed ends. The Wright brothers plane will still fly, its just over 100 years old (very young considering its the first) and no human can match that longevity. Humans live on average 80 years. Very short period of time for life and with that knowledge its value is limited because it can't be kept. Sparks are pretty and have value simply from producing light though they last a very short period of time. You will not last much longer as I will not. 80 is a very small number. All peoples place value on beings. When we determine life has lost its ability to be called a being; I.E. brain dead, we lose the desire to preserve it unless we find value is using for the benefit of beings. We use parts of whole humans for other humans. We do this when a human has lost its being. Man places higher values on higher levels of conscientiousness. A dolphin has a higher value to us that an ant. We tend to eat cows because they have very small minds and are unaware of loss even when a sibling's life is taken right in front of them. Nature allows and has mechanisms for abortion. Women have to care for them selfs or these mechanisms will undermine the gestation process. Clearly if there is God the mechanisms for abortion are authored there.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","08:04 AM","abortion-debates","202"

I disagree. If the question was ""what makes us a being"" then logically, brain dead people, those who cannot communicate, and people with various other disorders would make them life unworthy of life. For instance, a feral child is not a human as it cannot communicate or feel empathy for other humans. A brain dead person is not a human as it cannot think or communicate. A fetus is not a human as it is incapable of doing any of the above. The question to be asked is ""What is the value of human life?"" A fetus serves the greatest purpose of all. Regardless of whether it is life or not, it has the potential to become a living, conscious being. new flesh and blood. I don't understand the relevance of life-span and death of humans in this discussion. Yes, every organism dies, but is that a justification for killing? ""It's going to die anyways in fifty years or so, let's kill it now."" Doesn't sound like it constitutes a valid argument, Imho. Very true, but that value is entirely subjective. A lot of people eat cows and not cats and dogs because of the utility of doing so, despite cows and dogs being nearly identical cognitively. Can you substantiate your claim that a cow will be unaware of their calf's life is taken right in from of them? Cows are not stupid animals and even if they were, the intelligence of the animal should not matter. It is still a living, conscious being. I have read briefly about natural abortion processes such as miscarriage. I'm not saying that abortion is wrong because it is done unnaturally, but that it is wrong because of the value of life inside the woman.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","05:05 PM","abortion-debates","203"

I don't think that's what we're really seeking. I think what we're seeking is an experience of being alive, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonances within our own innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive.

Right now in labs all over the country, what you call human is in freezers waiting to be flushed, or used in research, or given to a person that can gestate them. Lets say your right tdocher. Your believes should call you into action today tdkocher, your female family members can save these lives right now. All they have to do is gestate them. Let the embros gestate in their bodies and go to term. By your own moral code, if you don't, your allowing their deaths because its very clear your females can save them today. Don't you dare ask them or give them a choice tdocher, you force them by your moral law. Prove to me and the world they are living humans tdocher. You can do that very simply by saving what you can. You can save a boat load of them by simply using all your females over and over again. If you don't do this your a lier or the lifes of these embros has no meaning to any of your females. I am very interested in how many you save. Let us know.","Tdkocher","300401","First of all I believe your K key is broken because your misspelled my name three times. Second, I never said anything about control or power. I believe that you shouldn't die just because you were concived during rape. Because someone decided to give there egg up dosen't mean that someone else should have to bear the child. We could either have the mother come back and get the egg or have it born and be a ""testube"" baby. We've been able to that about as long as Roe vs. Wade has been around.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","09:15 PM","abortion-debates","207"
