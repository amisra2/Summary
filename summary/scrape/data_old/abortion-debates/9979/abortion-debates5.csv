I mean, you defend them like your life depends on it so what was I to think. And why is stating that you debate like a woman bigoted when you are in fact a woman ? In addition to being emotional and irrational as a debater, are you also in denial ? This is so incredible it was worth quoting and responding to as it finally explains how irrational your debating style is I almost want to take you off ignore given this info. I really didn't know you were a woman, but at least it clarifies why you're so off the wall . Thanks for clearing that up, really.","ShadowPikachu","267712","I called you a misogynist, dip . Read the dang post . I said your misogyny and your bigotry run hand in hand with your brand of Christianity (your bigotry due to how you treat gays). It was in reply to this lovely statement from you: when I stated that I was a woman. Get a reading comprehension, AA. Do you know what misogyny means? Maybe that's your problem. As to me defending gays, I am friends with several, and basically feel disgusted at the way they are treated by people like you and the way they are denied the same rights of marriage that I just obtained with my husband. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Spelling and grammar for this post has been checked and cleared +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++","god-doesnt-want-abortion","12:11 PM","abortion-debates","61"

"06-09-2007","9979",5,"chemist99a","267699","JP in reply to LES said: If there was no stigma attached to homosexuality, it's possible that we could all be on the verge of extinction by now. As it is, the limited scope of homosexuality in the US has prevented an AIDS epidemic here. Had a much greater number of Americans been engaging in unsafe homosexual sex acts, then we could be presiding over the death of a nation right now. So you believe that if there were no stigma attached to homosexuality that there would be more homosexuals? Do you really believe that the proportion of homosexuals in the US is controlled by social stigma? Do you think absent that stigma many more males would be homosexual? What do you think the percentage would rise to - 30%, 70% ? In general I do not think stigma has much to do with biological traits. In addition its entirely possible that the stigma attached to homosexuality ended up making the epidemic in the US worse in two ways. First the US public health resources were kept out of the fray early on by that stigma. Secondly homosexuals would not openly discuss their relationships with doctors etc because of that stigma. It may be that the stigma allowed the disease to penetrate deeper into the population than it would have otherwise.","JPSartre12","267718","I think, no, I KNOW, that the stigma associated with homosexuality decreased the amount of ""hooking up"" that occurred in the past, therefore, the number of potential circumstances for spreading HIV. Do you want to destroy your remaining credulity by disputing that assertion? And if bathhouses and gay bars were more commonly accepted at the time, the death toll in the US would be staggering now. Or do you want to disute that as well?","god-doesnt-want-abortion","12:21 PM","abortion-debates","63"

"06-09-2007","9979",5,"ShadowPikachu","267727","STILL waiting. Feel free to join in, JP and AA. Are you afraid to address this, Phyllis and Chloe?","Phyllis","267735","Not afraid. It just seems that the thread has been hijacked. I frankly do not want to read through several posts of trite bickering to find the posts that I would need to respond to. I tried to stop this last night in my post regarding the pointless attacks on your motives. But somehow my post failed to stop that. Also, in my opinion, discussions of homosexual issues belong in the gay rights thread. And this thread is not about who's smarter or who can argue better or who is the superior gender. So, in short, if the thread settles down, I may feel inclined to join the discussion again.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","01:35 PM","abortion-debates","67"
"06-09-2007","9979",5,"ShadowPikachu","267739","It would be interesting, then, to see if Phyllis and Chloe would be serial killers, rapists, child molesters, drunkards, etc. if their precious religious text was silent on the subject. When I hear claims of morality coming from a certain Holy book, I am feel I slight chill of fear in my spine when I realize that a few words in the book are the only things keeping these people in line and from becoming ravening madmen/women. Sad, really.","Phyllis","267797","As far as I know, the only claim I have made is that secular ethics is a contradiction in terms. This was specifically in response to snakespit, who is an atheist. I do not know if you are an atheist or not. If you are not, then you and I have at least some common ground to work from, and the response I made to snakespit should not make you feel any chills in your spine. But, if you are not an atheist, I would certainly think that snakespit's position ought to cause a chill in your spine. If you remove God from the picture of moral discussion, you remove the possibility that there are any such things as moral truths; the possibility that there are, in fact, right answers to moral questions. You are stuck with mere preferences. An atheist prefers behavior X, and therefore he deems behavior X as ethical. Because there is no ultimate moral truth, there is no possible way to question the assertion. The only possible response, if you disagree with the atheist, is to say you prefer behavior Y. But in so doing, you establish personal preferences as the criteria for ethical behavior, which justifies the atheist in his assertion.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","07:00 PM","abortion-debates","69"

Why do you think that GOD is necessary to have moral values. For example I am an atheist, but I hold high moral values. I would not kill, steal, etc etc. Many societies with very different religions appear to hold similar basic moral postions on acceptable human behavior. Human beings are quite capable of setting the boundaries on acceptable human behavior without an immaterial ruler of the universe being involved. Of course you may disagree, but I think you are overestimating the utility of your GOD in the formation and maintence of morality. Theology is not necessary to have ethics and its not necessary to the production of a moral code either.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","07:16 PM","abortion-debates","70"

I can look to my Atheist friends to see that God is not needed for moral truths. I can look to Buddhism, Hinduism, Manicheanism, etc. to see that God is not needed for moral truths. When I look at my Atheist and Wiccan friends, I see more morality than most ""Christians"" outside of my own Church. And no, there is no chill in my spine with Snakespit's position - the only chill occurs when I hear people claim that God is somehow needed to have moral truths - it brings to my mind the reality that without people like that having the bible, they'd somehow be unable to control themselves and start murdering and raping anything in sight - THAT is what sends chills down my spine. I think it is quite sad that a person cannot see moral truths on their own and need a book to tell them it (I certainly examine each and every moral law in the Bible, and weigh it based on rational and critical thinking, and THEN deciding whether or not it is practical or even necessary to follow)","god-doesnt-want-abortion","07:56 PM","abortion-debates","71"

First, the tenets that I mentioned about seem a reasonable starting point to discuss a secular basis of ethics. Human beings, through their ability to empathise, are capable of determining ethical grounds. Human beings, through logic and reason, are capable of deriving normative principles of behaviour Can you gainsay these? Second, you imply that God makes it crystal clear what is ethical. Even within Christianity, there are huge disagreements on morality. You then seem to forget there are other Gods than yours. Which one is right? Lastly, there are many examples of societies that have moral codes with no gods like you describe. Not to mention the very moral atheists among us, like chemist. We have the capability of agreeing upon on what is moral; we do it all the time without any god.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","08:22 PM","abortion-debates","73"
