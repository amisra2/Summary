If your a scientist you'll know he is your brother because of the massive similarities you have with him and the identical ancestors your share. Also the basic fact is that if your life experiences where to match his, you'd nearly be identical to him philosophically. After all; what is the difference between a Palestinian and a Jew? The answer is nothing.","Winston Smith","277281","Then why are they killing each other, suicide by another name?","god-doesnt-want-abortion","abortion-debates","100","01:36 AM"
"","08-28-2007","9979","richbrmly","279557","A soul has a consciences, it can be emotionally moved from different states of being. This is how the Bible can say ones soul is moved; saddened; joyous. Etc. I think therefore I am. Meaning a soul is emotional and so it really has no body. The soul is what we ask the Lord to preserve. 1Peter 1[9] Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls. Hamburger does not have a soul, it is dead meat. People eat brains and all the pieces of an animal. No soul. The soul is consciences. Under some conditions it can return, not after death or before a brain though. We know that to be impossible. Fetuses do not get emotional; there is no mind to speak of. No soul there to trouble. If youre on a machine and a doctor determines your brain is dead, the soul is not there. The body could see hell or heaven and there is no emotional effect. No soul for that. Read the Bible. Dont listen to fools; youre a person with a soul. Use it.","Winston Smith","281332","you seem to know a lot about something that exists only in your imagination. archangel knows also everything about dragons. when does the soul takes abode in a human being according to you? can we detect this happenning? any pictures of souls?","god-doesnt-want-abortion","abortion-debates","116","09:43 PM"

It is the thinking part of the body, the part that feels emotion. What is the worth of reincarnation if you lose your memories? The Christian hope is the salvation of the soul. It is real and detectable, we have advanced a great deal on our knowledge of the mind. At any point your memories die, you die and body lives on. We have seen this in nature as well. People have lost their memories and become someone else with independent likes and dislikes. The only connection to the past is the similarity in appearance.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","abortion-debates","117","08:07 AM"

Drugs can alter the mind and soul. People can be made angry, afraid, happy, and so depressed they can hardly breath. By chemicals. The soul is fleeting just as the bible describes. Some People believe the soul lives on. Houdini desperately wanted to believe this and memorized a word for his wife. Takes thought for such an event. People look for ghosts that have some connections to a place because of the events in their past. The memories they hold. We have a soul, anytime we can think. If we can not think, we have no soul. Christianity calls death sleeping. They have pushed the hope past the soul and added the body. The body is dead, but they believe it will live yet again.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","abortion-debates","118","08:21 AM"

Many animals can only respond to the moment. A cow forgets the capture of its young in minutes. Many of the grazing animals are very limited in spirit. A fish has little emotional baggage. Some animals though; I would agree, have a soul and it can be troubled. Elephants even visit graves. Water Buffalo remember attack strategies of their enemies and counter them; clearly for the benefit of the herd. Any animal that feel for another and remember has the chain of a soul. A soul can provide pain without fiscal damage. The pain from a soul can incapacitate an animal as completely as a bullet into the brain. A Dog can be shaped by the memories an owner provides it. A Dog can be a very friendly or a monster. All souls can be shaped by outside forces and this is the chief reason why man must care for more than himself. In the end, it all affects him. Like the Dog that has become a monster.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","abortion-debates","124","10:42 PM"

If your eyes die, you don't see paradise. If a Religious man truly believed there was life after death, he would believe the greater gift is death, not life. A dream requires energy, I think it takes around 300 calories to dream. Its costly get the theater we get when we go to sleep. Even with all that against a life after death, I still have hope. The hope is in a few facts; the conservation of energy, the knowledge that mater has only energy as a term and everything else is a constant, and that time more than likely is cyclic in many ways. Right now we share time, will we always do so? We don't know where mater comes from. All we know is that its based on energy which is something we can use. Logically knowing energy comes from mater, then we should consider the reverse to be true somehow as well. To make a long story just a bit shorter, I believe we are lonely beings indeed. I think in death, all you have after that is you. You have to live with yourself. That is the purest form of judgment I can imagine. A good person will treat themselves well and if your a judgmental war monger, all you'll have to battle is yourself. The sweetest thing, or the most evil thing you have ever encountered in your dreams truely came from you. So it might be exceptionally wise to guard your soul after all. You soul may be creating a world your going to have to live in. The whole universe was started from the spark of a tiny singularity. Maybe we have misled our self by the concept that the bang was big. Its easy to change the perspective of anything. Even a universe. So, I believe a dog does have a soul. And it will get everything it deserves like every other being. In an odd way I have great faith. If you tell me how something works I'll then know how God did it. I think we can find God. Judging from who are, I think he wants to be found.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","abortion-debates","131","09:55 PM"

So if you died senile you remain in heaven senile and feeble? If you are right, it would be ideal to die young and healthy how do you know all this?

What we all know, is that we must live with ourself, even now. The point really is, we are the product of chance, fantastic chance that just happened to fall in place or there is no chance anywhere. One or the other when you boil it all down. If a spark which is inert as things can get can bring about a universe with you in it. Then why can't a spark that is you, create a universe under the same conditions? The issue is perspective. Size and time are relative to the observer. Your size and awareness in time places things in perspective for you at the moment. All dimensions start from a origin. All I am saying is, ""Can't there be other centers? In other words; in a one dimensional world, everything is a straight line. On that line you are in union with things on the line. One line can never detect other lines, they would have to become aware of an added dimension to travel to it. Their Origin is different and they can never cross. Every dimension has this issue. Why not Time? we all share the same time. If all the other dimensions can have different origins why not time? We should never think in terms of limits. Oddly enough, there is room for every thought to become a world. Age has no meaning, only spirit does. Sparks become you, and we seem to have the proof as best we can tell. Theories are not religions. I'm not starting a religion, only adding that limiting the thoughts of one would be foolish. If time can take a single cell and become a man. Where are the limits? I love truth. Truth is everything. If I'm wrong about something. Ok. No need to start a war over it. What ever is right, is fine with me. But, its as Dogmatic to say, there is no God as to say there is one. Takes the same faith and Dogma. If Religion is your enemy, why become a Zealot? If we can get off one another's backs long enough. We will find the truth. All we need is time. Time seems to be a negative to all life yet here we are. And it took time to get here. You tell me, what are our limits? I have zero issues with the faithful in any case. I have issues with the leaders. They aways seem to point out the flaws in others and miss the horrors in the mirror. The truth should always be good enough. Never condemn yourself to one way of thinking when that is exactly the issue you have with others.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","abortion-debates","137","09:52 AM"
"","08-31-2007","9979","Winston Smith","281681","Look I have no idea if there is a God or not; but definitely not the kind of Biblical anthropomorphic God. That was not God but simply an extrapolation of humankind. Something more akin to a Super Jewish Patriarch and this concept of God has stayed with us since","richbrmly","281690","Winston, your a wise man. Thinking should never be a crime and your points are valid. If we are to focus on one man's family beyond all others, we're as far from a God as a wolf who focus's only on his own pack. I agree with you. I think the book is worthy of reading as long as your wise enough to ask the right questions. I find the bible to have some great insight as well complete foolishness. I find Genesis to be as scientifically advanced as foolish in many cases. Reading about an earth without form is amazing when considering it came from a sheep herder. And if your read the sequence of animals created you'd think your talking to Darwin. Good is good no mater the author. If Buddha said something Good and Good is God. Then God should get some credit in my mind. I truly believe Buddha, Jesus and Ghandi would be amazed at one another. They share one thing in common, They are human after all.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","abortion-debates","138","10:44 AM"
"","09-01-2007","9979","Winston Smith","281782","You are right those three have a lot in common. But one of them was a political activist and rightly so. Jesus was thought to be one and his enemies, religious rivals, fostered this illusion with deadly results. It is ironic that hundreds of years later Christianity would become a unifying force for the Roman Empire which considered Jesus a threat. The saying of Jesus that his kingdom is not of this world is paralleled in the Buddha rejection of greed and all material things. This world of ours where the worth of a person is measured in the amount of silver coins he earns as a living, is so divorced from the teachings of Buddha and Jesus as it was thousands of years ago. The Pharisees won in the long run.","richbrmly","281784","Oh yes Winston they did. In fact, if you really want to upset a Christian, all you have to do is quote Jesus. Think about that. Nothing is going to upset American Christians more than a quote from Jesus. Its very disturbing to say the least. And what is the big issue with any quotes from Jesus? States can not in act law or govern with the original teachings of Jesus. It can't happen. Loving your enemy is a poor way to run a country, if your listen to the Christians. Forgiveness lacks the controls needed to operate a penal system. And peace makers can never retain control over boundaries outside your state. How can anyone follow Jesus and expect a return of the Jewish state to allow the return of Jesus? Only the old testament laws can allow this kind of latitude. There is no sect on the earth more against the teachings of Jesus than the Christians. They are in direct opposition to them. The issue really boils down to the problems of developing a Christ like Kingdom on earth. The laws fail in a secular world. So, the only way the Christians could overcome the teachings of the founder is to expand the base principles to include the old testament values and laws. Which is really odd understanding that Jesus was clear about the law, that no man can live by it. The first Christians where so against the old system than Paul even wrote that any man that takes circumcision must face the old law and is forever removed from the grace of Christ. This is pretty dramatic.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","abortion-debates","140","09:56 AM"

Bravo!","richbrmly","283138","no no...your the one that wants to ban things. Your getting there though. keep thinking. Choice has given us over 4 million babies last year. Very healthy, happy families. If you really wanted to limit abortion as a pro-choice person does, you'd put your money where you mouth is. Health care directly prevents these issues. Old women can be given birth control with the young. Abortion would drop more than your want for law. Lets play honest, your worship of money far exceeds your issues with abortion. pro-choice wants to save life. Its what it does.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","abortion-debates","175","04:51 AM"

You can call my foreskin a child too if you wish. Seems the cells there can make you a baby too. You save life winston...The lesson is all of it is you can't force people to gestate something unless your willing to tie them down. You willing to tie them down? Abortion happens...Been happening.. People will have to wait 6 months and use the Moses abortion solution. Beat them til they abort. Aborting is easy. Easy as making a pie. Women actually have to take care of themselves. If you look at population and ratios to abortion. Its higher in Israel. Mexico...where its been illegal winston...Out lawed. The only thing you going to do when you take a way choice...Is kill.
