"06-06-2007","9979",1,"Matthew S","267071","nonsense and here are some quotes. Exodus 11:5. And every firstborn in the land of the Egyptians shall die, from the firstborn of Pharao who sitteth on his throne, even to the firstborn of the handmaid that is at the mill, and all the firstborn of beasts. Genesis 19:24-25 24 Then the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrahfrom the LORD out of the heavens. 25 Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, including all those living in the citiesand also the vegetation in the land. Joshua 6:21 21 They observed the ban by putting to the sword all living creatures in the city: men and women, young and old, as well as oxen, sheep and asses. Genesis 6:13 And God said to Noah, I have determined to make an end of all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them with the earth.","Phyllis","267075","This is obviously not talking about abortion. This is obviously not talking about abortion.

"06-06-2007","9979",1,"Phyllis","267120","Are you suggesting that abortion is a judgment of God? I would agree. Obviously not about abortion. Are you suggesting that abortion is a judgment of God? I would agree. This one certainly seems to be out of context, as reading a mere 2 verses farther yields the statement that ""[Menahem] did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. Are you then suggesting that what Menahem did was wrong? I would agree. And so, apparently, does God. God, by definition, cannot murder. And God, simply because he is God, can kill anyone he chooses in whatever manner he chooses. Perhaps you wish to sit in judgment of God; but you yourself would have to be God in order to do this. And I don't know about anyone else, but I highly doubt that God would be so asinine as to misspell the word ""describes."" Well, I have disagreed. But supposing that you are right (and you are not as I have shown), then you have successfully shown that abortion is frowned upon in Scripture. The verses you quote ALL describe the actions in those verses negatively. Congratulations, you proved what you were trying to disprove.","ShadowPikachu","267126","So, you have no problem with the fact that this is abortion and was caused by god? So, none of those women who slept with men were pregnant at the time? So, you have no problem with the fact that this is abortion and was caused by god? Guess I didn't read the following verses (mainly because they are under another heading) - I just looked for places with ""ripped up"" after I saw it in the previous part - my bad on this one, but the others still stand. Lovely God you worship there - killing innocent children, the foetuses you so worship, etc. BTW, aren't you and Steeve the ones who usually get all hung up when semantics come into the debate? If I'm wrong, sorry, but you are certainly bringing semantics now. First off, God is asinine enough to kill what your ilk calls ""innocent foetuses"", etc., so I wouldn't put anything past him. Secondly, I see you are falling into the usual O.P. of your ilk: when without an argument, attack the opponent on a simple spelling error (especially when the one letter is right next to the one intended on the keyboard ""n"" is right next to ""b"" last time I checked). Really Phyllis, get an actual argument instead of attacking your opponent on spelling errors. Actually, no, they do NOT. The first three ALL describe God causing them - are you saying the bible is describing God's actions negatively? Or are you saying that killing your precious foetuses is just fine as long as the persons carrying them are ""wicked"". Sorry, but you need to get an argument, Phyllis. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Spelling and grammar for this post has been checked and cleared +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++","god-doesnt-want-abortion","02:12 PM","abortion-debates","8"

However the question does arise as to why GOD would permit it to be possible if he did not want it. Aside from that, I generally consider abortion to be a decision to be taken by the woman up till the third trimester at which time the community interest and interests of the state begin to become significant. Nobody should be FORCED to have an abortion, but nobody should be forced NOT to have one within the first two trimesters. Its a personal choice driven by health, lifestyle, and moral beleifs. It should be left that way.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","06:21 PM","abortion-debates","10"

I refuse to bend the knee to any being which seems hellbent on destroying my species and myself let alone condemning me for sins which he allows himself to committ. I say the devil take him.

Here's the complete passage of 2 Kings 15:16 that he refers to. Note the bolded verse. 2Ki 15:15 Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and the conspiracy which he led, indeed they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 2Ki 15:16 Then from Tirzah, Menahem attacked Tiphsah, all who were there, and its territory. Because they did not surrender, therefore he attacked it. All the women there who were with child he ripped open. 2Ki 15:17 In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem the son of Gadi became king over Israel, and reigned ten years in Samaria. 2Ki 15:18 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not depart all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin. So typically, the part SP neglected to share in his account is that God didn't order or condone of the acts of Menahem, for he did evil in the sight of the Lord.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","07:16 PM","abortion-debates","12"

Believers should be allowed to choose NOT to have abortions if that is what they wish. Those who come to different moral conclusions should not be forced to comply with the believers beliefs. Its personal choice which should win out, since no consensus is even possible as to what is morally correct in this issue.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","08:22 PM","abortion-debates","13"
