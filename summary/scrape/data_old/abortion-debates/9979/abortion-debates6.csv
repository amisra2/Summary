Why do you think that GOD is necessary to have moral values. For example I am an atheist, but I hold high moral values. I would not kill, steal, etc etc. Many societies with very different religions appear to hold similar basic moral postions on acceptable human behavior. Human beings are quite capable of setting the boundaries on acceptable human behavior without an immaterial ruler of the universe being involved. Of course you may disagree, but I think you are overestimating the utility of your GOD in the formation and maintence of morality. Theology is not necessary to have ethics and its not necessary to the production of a moral code either.","GrannyM","267822","I'm an agnostic, re whether or not there is something spiritual ""out there."" But surely there is a basis for morality in our existence as a complex social species. This basis has been variously phrased, but personally, I prefer Hillel's view: ""Whatever is hateful to yourself, do not do to another."" This underlies my own moral vision, and is the basis upon which I test my actions and my life. There are so many gods in this world; so many sacred texts proposing eternal truth. ""Whatever is hateful to yourself, do not do to another;"" ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"" - This stricture is found in virtually all of them. There is no need for any specific religion to hold to this. It is fundamental.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","09:02 PM","abortion-debates","76"

If you're wrong, you don't get to call me a bigot unless you beat me in a formal debate. If you win, both AA and I will be banned from the board because it's against the forum's rules to post as two people. So if you're in agreement, contact the admin and register a complaint. Or better yet, post your complaint here so all can see just how foolish it is. The admin can tell by the ISP whether both accounts post from the same location, so there won't be any question. So, go for it. I'm getting weary of your nonsense.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","09:12 PM","abortion-debates","78"

Don't believe me? look at the rules: Forum Rules And no, an ISP does not tell that much (they don't go by ISP, they go by IP) - I have been to an airport on their public network and the IP was blocked here and I couldn't post - any place like that or a workplace or such uses (for purposes such as these forums) the same generic IP and if one person on the network is blocked, it soon has to be reversed if others log on (they have to ban by user, not by the IP). I've had experience back when I ran a small debate board that went under in 2004 due to inability to keep it funded and attract new people. So quit your garbling about something you don't really know about (both the fact that there is nothing in the rules against it, and the fact that there is nothing that can be done really anyway). And sorry, I don't make rigged wagers.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","09:30 PM","abortion-debates","79"

The author is a clairvoyant psychic who sees, and talks to, babies from before conception until birth. It discusses the ""prebirth contract"" between an expectant mother and her baby, which is completely amazing! The book includes a chapter on abortion. It doesn't sugar-coat the sadness of an abortion, but gives insight about what really happens afterward, spiritually speaking. And offers hope that unborn spirits may return, if invited. It really helped me free myself from the abortion mania, pro and anti. In what civilized society would we even debate whether or not to kill an unborn spirit? Peace and happiness to you! J. L.

Its a technique no doctor would offer or provide due to the lack of health benefits to the host. Most of the #### (Don't care if its in the bible, still ####) is why I can't call myself a Christian but I follow the teachings of John the Beloved who at least for me, has defined God. And most the book (bible) does not follow the definition I accept as God for me. It if doesnt dream, it can not have a soul or be a being by any definition Ive understood; spiritual or humanistic. The real question for me at least is: When does the fetus begin to dream?

One powerful thing about Jesus especially with respect to the area he came from is; He painted the picture of a God you could not place on war banner and parade it into a battle. A God that cared for the heart of man and even the children. It maybe an oxymoron, but I am beginning to believe that to be a Christian, you simply can't become a Christian anymore. Is it that a Christian has to decide Darwin had no credibility yet answer every doctors question regarding family history? If there where any faith, a man would simply say; ""Oh, so thats how God did it!"". Personally, I believe if God where actually going to talk to man, he wouldn't give law. That is already in us. He would have taught us how to make a band aid and saved millions of human lives. Maybe explained why we should wash our hands. Something simple we could have actually used and gained a real benefit from. If anything is older than the Bible, its clearly law.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","03:49 PM","abortion-debates","85"

If man has proven anything through out time, his has proven his willingness to listen too and do as God would have him do. Its why people will actually strap a bomb to their chest. They truly believe they are doing the good work of a God. So if man is so willing to follow the wishes of a God then where is the problem? God talking to man; if God wants man to do as he would wish. In other words the only problem is God. It seems to me; If there is a God (I believe there is), one could clearly believe he does want to be found by realizing why a God would build a human with a massive five pound brain . There is no scientist in the world that doesn't ask himself if he can find some meaning to life in what he researches.
