Psychology is true what you said not a science based argument so it cant be used for any true argument because its not science but thank you for agreeing with me that its not scientific and therefore invalid in any debate.","Easyrider","463010","If it's your claim that there's a lack of evidence for the resurrection of Jesus Christ (so it must be bogus) then your lack of conclusive DNA evidence to identify man's immediate, direct-line ancestor has to also falsify the idea of human evolution. Psychology is science-based. It wasn't always, delving into subjects like Phrenology and some of Freud's unfalsifiable hypotheses, etc., in earlier times. But it's scientifically-based now. I have a B.S. in Psych and a great deal of the curriculum were courses like Tests and Measurements, Physiology, Statistics, Collegiate Biology, Animal and Human Behavior, Pseudoscience and the Paranormal, Classical and Operant Conditioning, Childhood Development, Abnormal Psychology, and so on. We also had to design our own scientific studies. Mine was testing the hypothesis that older students achieved better grades / results than younger students. This turned out to be true but the results in favor of older students were minuscule and not significant to any large degree. The population randomly sampled was that of a major Southern collegiate student body.","why-would-anyone-choose-have-child-over-there-own-education","08:59 AM","abortion-debates","92"

The second thing you learn is that psychology is not a science you cannot make facts based on it. Sorry as a chemical engineer we do not accept it as a science I have a Associates in chemtech Associates in Science Associates in history Bachelors in Engineering Bachelors in Chemistry Bachelors in chemical engineering and about 7 months away from a masters in Chemical Engineering for almost ten years I have studied the sciences and you dont bring psych in to the lab you would be laughed at. Getting a degree in it is kinda dumb but I think thats how real scientist feel we make fun of psych majors constantly. Scientist will create something Engineers will build it Psychologist will ask you about your mother hahahaha.","why-would-anyone-choose-have-child-over-there-own-education","05:05 PM","abortion-debates","93"

That was taught in Pseudoscience and the Paranormal, amongst other courses. When did you take the class? You're absolutely wrong. Psychology - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia You're ignorant of the scientific foundation of Psychology, probably because you never studied it. Have you ever heard of the ""Psych Lit Database?"" It's a major computer database of scientific studies in psychology. You can find it in most libraries. Suggest you expand your limited awareness of it and educate yourself. I also recommend the next time you're at a major university to go see the Chair of Psychology and have him/her explain to you what you're missing out on. As far as the arrogance of scientists goes, here's a little gem for you: ""For the scientist that has lived by his faith in the power of reason, the story ends like a bad dream. He has scaled the mountain of ignorance. He is about to conquer the highest peak. As he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greated by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries."" ~Robert Jastrow, God and the Astronomer And FYI, Dr. Robert Jastrow was the founding director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies.

So think whatever you want, it doesn't mean you know what you're talking about. Listen, you claim to be of great intellect (though I see you are way short on wisdom). If the resurrection of Jesus Christ is such a load of hooey then provide your credible evidence that falsifies it. I seriously doubt you have ever read the Bible in full so you are without merit on that subject as far as I'm concerned. <chuckle> Don't confuse intelligence with wisdom. They're not the same thing. Once again, if you're as smart as you claim, you can show me the refutation for the resurrection of Christ. That ought to be a no-brainer for you.

Jesus wants are brains I told them to cut off the head they never listen. hahahaha That is pretty much what your claiming the solid scientific evidence is that once your dead your dead. Know you have to prove he was resurrected before I can disprove that cause as it stands right now there is no evidence that dead can be Resurrected unless you count when peoples heart stops for a few minutes and stuff like that. So scientifically speaking it was impossible there's your proof. There is nothing else to disprove unless we start making assumptions and we all know we don't do that. You claim you have degrees so you know you have to provide as possibility with in reason of what we know as scientific fact or theory. By all current knowledge we can assume dead people are dead, resurrection is an impossibility, and therefore jesus=dead=still dead. Now to dispute this you need real science and proof that it was possible 2000 years ago to bring the dead back to life. You cant say god did it or divine miracle because thats assuming again and we dont assume in science.","why-would-anyone-choose-have-child-over-there-own-education","09:24 PM","abortion-debates","98"

On the other hand, I have multiple, independent historical accounts of the resurrection. I have the Old Testament prophecies it would happen: Prophecies of the Resurrection And, I have the changed lives of the Apostles, including the Apostle Paul, that attest to it. The New Testament also alludes to 500 witnesses of the resurrected Christ. So, you have nothing to hang your hat on. That is unless you have something else.
