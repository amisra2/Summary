The primary reason for unwanted pregnancy is from misuse (I know it is not that complicated). Men and women who had a higher education were less likely to have unwanted pregnancies and had a 34% swing in proper use of prevention methods.

They are only a victim of their own negligence. Also since when has common sense been a philosophy? 34% eh?Where did you find that piece of guesswork? I know... a survey.

A true deist was one who believed God created the universe and then sat back and (1) did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations and, (2) did not give (divine) revelation to man. Dr. M. E. Bradford of the University of Dallas conducted a study of the Founding Founders to look at this deist issue (whether the Founding Fathers were deists or Christians). He discovered the Founders were members of denominations as follows: twenty-eight Episcopalians, eight Presbyterians, seven Congregationalists, two Lutherans, two Dutch Reformed, two Methodists, two Roman Catholics, and three deists. - Reference: M. E. Bradford, A Worthy Company: Brief Lives of the Framers of the United States Constitution (Marlborough, NH: Plymouth Rock Foundation, 1982), ivv. Benjamin Franklin said the following during the Constitutional Convention: I've lived, Sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing Proofs I see of this Truth That God governs in the Affairs of Men . And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his Notice, is it probable that an Empire can rise without his Aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the Sacred Writings, that except the Lord build the House they labor in vain who build it. I firmly believe this, and I also believe that without his concurring Aid, we shall succeed in this political Building no better than the Builders of Babel: We shall be divided by our little partial local interests; our Projects will be confounded, and we ourselves shall become a Reproach and Bye word down to future Ages. - Speech to the Constitutional Convention (June 28, 1787) Its pretty obvious that Franklin believed in a God who did involve himself in the affairs of men and nations, and Franklin also alludes to the New Testament as Sacred Writings which also reveal Gods revelation to man. Washington was an open promoter of Christianity. For example, in his speech on May 12, 1779, he claimed that what children needed to learn above all was the religion of Jesus Christ, and that to learn this would make them greater and happier than they already are; on May 2, 1778, he charged his soldiers at Valley Forge that To the distinguished character of patriot, it should be our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of Christian; and when he resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the military on June 8, 1783, he reminded the nation that without a humble imitation of the Divine Author of our blessed religion we can never hope to be a happy nation. Washington's own adopted daughter declared of Washington that you might as well question his patriotism as to question his Christianity. In addition, the inscription on Washington's tomb at Mount Vernon is this: WITHIN THIS ENCLOSURE REST THE REMAINS OF GENL. GEORGE WASHINGTON."" Over the door of the inner tomb is inscribed: ""I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE."" Thomas Jefferson was hardly speaking from a strict deist standpoint when he said: ""Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice cannot sleep forever."" (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781) Now, why should Jefferson tremble for his country if God does not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations? Ant then there's this: ""I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who lead our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessities and comforts of life."" (Monday, March 4, 1805, in his 2nd Inaugural Address) Remember, a strict deist was one who believed God was like a watchmaker, who wound up the universe and thereafter did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. Jefferson obviously believed otherwise, and he was referencing the Biblical God. Definitely not a deist. So it's not my worldview of the country's founding fathers that is skewed - it's yours. There is a God and when you try to write him out of the American story then you are not being honest about the foundations of this country.
