A true deist was one who believed God created the universe and then sat back and (1) did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations and, (2) did not give (divine) revelation to man. Dr. M. E. Bradford of the University of Dallas conducted a study of the Founding Founders to look at this deist issue (whether the Founding Fathers were deists or Christians). He discovered the Founders were members of denominations as follows: twenty-eight Episcopalians, eight Presbyterians, seven Congregationalists, two Lutherans, two Dutch Reformed, two Methodists, two Roman Catholics, and three deists. - Reference: M. E. Bradford, A Worthy Company: Brief Lives of the Framers of the United States Constitution (Marlborough, NH: Plymouth Rock Foundation, 1982), ivv. Benjamin Franklin said the following during the Constitutional Convention: I've lived, Sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing Proofs I see of this Truth That God governs in the Affairs of Men . And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his Notice, is it probable that an Empire can rise without his Aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the Sacred Writings, that except the Lord build the House they labor in vain who build it. I firmly believe this, and I also believe that without his concurring Aid, we shall succeed in this political Building no better than the Builders of Babel: We shall be divided by our little partial local interests; our Projects will be confounded, and we ourselves shall become a Reproach and Bye word down to future Ages. - Speech to the Constitutional Convention (June 28, 1787) Its pretty obvious that Franklin believed in a God who did involve himself in the affairs of men and nations, and Franklin also alludes to the New Testament as Sacred Writings which also reveal Gods revelation to man. Washington was an open promoter of Christianity. For example, in his speech on May 12, 1779, he claimed that what children needed to learn above all was the religion of Jesus Christ, and that to learn this would make them greater and happier than they already are; on May 2, 1778, he charged his soldiers at Valley Forge that To the distinguished character of patriot, it should be our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of Christian; and when he resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the military on June 8, 1783, he reminded the nation that without a humble imitation of the Divine Author of our blessed religion we can never hope to be a happy nation. Washington's own adopted daughter declared of Washington that you might as well question his patriotism as to question his Christianity. In addition, the inscription on Washington's tomb at Mount Vernon is this: WITHIN THIS ENCLOSURE REST THE REMAINS OF GENL. GEORGE WASHINGTON."" Over the door of the inner tomb is inscribed: ""I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE."" Thomas Jefferson was hardly speaking from a strict deist standpoint when he said: ""Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice cannot sleep forever."" (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781) Now, why should Jefferson tremble for his country if God does not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations? Ant then there's this: ""I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who lead our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessities and comforts of life."" (Monday, March 4, 1805, in his 2nd Inaugural Address) Remember, a strict deist was one who believed God was like a watchmaker, who wound up the universe and thereafter did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. Jefferson obviously believed otherwise, and he was referencing the Biblical God. Definitely not a deist. So it's not my worldview of the country's founding fathers that is skewed - it's yours. There is a God and when you try to write him out of the American story then you are not being honest about the foundations of this country.

Women in this situation, poor and uneducated continue the statistic, being a part of it and having children in it as well. Or I got it from The Guttmacher Institute, considered the most reliable information concerning abortion followed by the report put together from the CDC and US Census. Since almost every study involves a survey, it helps to legitimize the study when the participants are actually asked for information, it hardly seems reasonable to discount a study for having a survey. Here are some other facts along with a link to the site and publications Eighteen percent of U.S. women obtaining abortions are teenagers; those aged 1517 obtain 6% of all abortions, teens aged 1819 obtain 11%, and teens younger than age 15 obtain 0.4%.[6] Women in their 20s account for more than half of all abortions; women aged 2024 obtain 33% of all abortions, and women aged 2529 obtain 24%.[6] Non-Hispanic white women account for 36% of abortions, non-Hispanic black women for 30%, Hispanic women for 25% and women of other races for 9%.[6] Thirty-seven percent of women obtaining abortions identify as Protestant and 28% as Catholic.[6] Women who have never married and are not cohabiting account for 45% of all abortions [6] About 61% of abortions are obtained by women who have one or more children. [6] Forty-two percent of women obtaining abortions have incomes below 100% of the federal poverty level ($10,830 for a single woman with no children).[6] Twenty-seven percent of women obtaining abortions have incomes between 100199% of the federal poverty level.* [6] The reasons women give for having an abortion underscore their understanding of the responsibilities of parenthood and family life. Three-fourths of women cite concern for or responsibility to other individuals; three-fourths say they cannot afford a child; three-fourths say that having a baby would interfere with work, school or the ability to care for dependents; and half say they do not want to be a single parent or are having problems with their husband or partner.[7] Knowledge about contraceptive methods is a strong predictor of use among young adults: Among unmarried women aged 1829, for each correct response on a contraceptive knowledge scale, the odds of currently using a hormonal or long-acting reversible method increased by 17%, and of using no method decreased by 17%.[6] Guttmacher Institute: Home Page And one of the most common results of having sex?

Women in this situation, poor and uneducated continue the statistic, being a part of it and having children in it as well. . Or I got it from The Guttmacher Institute, considered the most reliable information concerning abortion followed by the report put together from the CDC and US Census. Since almost every study involves a survey, it helps to legitimize the study when the participants are actually asked for information, it hardly seems reasonable to discount a study for having a survey. Here are some other facts along with a link to the site and publications Eighteen percent of U.S. women obtaining abortions are teenagers; those aged 1517 obtain 6% of all abortions, teens aged 1819 obtain 11%, and teens younger than age 15 obtain 0.4%.[6] Women in their 20s account for more than half of all abortions; women aged 2024 obtain 33% of all abortions, and women aged 2529 obtain 24%.[6] Non-Hispanic white women account for 36% of abortions, non-Hispanic black women for 30%, Hispanic women for 25% and women of other races for 9%.[6] Thirty-seven percent of women obtaining abortions identify as Protestant and 28% as Catholic.[6] Women who have never married and are not cohabiting account for 45% of all abortions [6] About 61% of abortions are obtained by women who have one or more children. [6] Forty-two percent of women obtaining abortions have incomes below 100% of the federal poverty level ($10,830 for a single woman with no children).[6] Twenty-seven percent of women obtaining abortions have incomes between 100199% of the federal poverty level.* [6] The reasons women give for having an abortion underscore their understanding of the responsibilities of parenthood and family life. Three-fourths of women cite concern for or responsibility to other individuals; three-fourths say they cannot afford a child; three-fourths say that having a baby would interfere with work, school or the ability to care for dependents; and half say they do not want to be a single parent or are having problems with their husband or partner.[7] Knowledge about contraceptive methods is a strong predictor of use among young adults: Among unmarried women aged 1829, for each correct response on a contraceptive knowledge scale, the odds of currently using a hormonal or long-acting reversible method increased by 17%, and of using no method decreased by 17%.[6] Guttmacher Institute: Home Page . And one of the most common results of having sex? Ding Ding Ding that is correct Reproduction. My point is you are putting personal will power up against nature. Based on results Nature wins a whole lot more than will power.","gansao","462583","[QUOTE=pappillion001;462575] Your response was this....

There was no official position of authority or office to oversee the religious needs of the country, nor federal laws requiring religious observance.

I think my point was they, despite their convictions, viewed religion as something that had no place in in government. That it was something for the individual and not the state and the reason religion is excluded from The US Government? The faith of the founding fathers is clear by the wording of DOI and Bill of Rights, they all prayed attended church regularly, yet not so much as a token position of authority. Because they recognized throughout history including their own time religion was inflexible. It was a restrictive obstacle to progress and the type of freedom the founders had fought for. They had no intention after the war to trade one intolerant master for another. With close to 2 billion members you would think there would be at least one Christian led nation besides the Vatican, but there is not. What keeps those highly religious people who are a majority in a number of countries from following in the footsteps of Muslims who do? There was God's way and God's law and that was it. The definition of murder has changed often from the acceptance of revenge killings and sanctuary cities to 1st, 2nd and 3rd degree murder, manslaughter voluntary and involuntary, special circumstances, insanity and self defense and negligence are just some examples of the evolution of what is murder. The Church did indeed enact taxes when it held authority from prostitutes to goods and services and tithing to indulgences. They lost the ability to tax when they lost their authority to rule. From what? Sumerian to Judaism to Catholicism to Islam to Protestant or Lutheran, Baptist, Mormon? Does it matter? A branch splits and they condemn each other as not following faithfully. Someone experiences divine revelation and starts something new but the requirements to obey what God commands, to submit to God remains the same. God is always eternal and gave his rules that are not open to debate or revision a very long time ago. At best the name changes people don't vote and determine what God's law is to be. Because mandates from government are based on the needs of the people whether honestly made or not. They may be discussed and overturned, modified or challenged. It may be near impossible to have our government vote to make murder legal in all circumstances, but it could happen. Secular law permits divorce and does not require a women to marry her rapist. Instead of giving guidelines on the treatment of slaves it prohibits the practice. Religion has a place in society, but not in government. It does not accept that other Gods exist and therefore has a wedge that cannot be overcome. Religions accept other religions because they have to, not because they want to.","why-would-anyone-choose-have-child-over-there-own-education","03:31 AM","abortion-debates","54"

Please read the following testimony. Healing After Abortion | The Official Jennifer O'Neill Site You should also read the following: What does the Bible say about when life begins? And if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so that she has a miscarriage, yet there is no further injury, he shall surely be fined as the womans husband may demand of him; and he shall pay as the judges decide. But if there is further injury, then you shall appoint as a penalty life for life. (Exodus 21:22-23) Straight from the Jewish Torah, God immediately affirms the value of human life in a mothers womb. Next, a divinely appointed prophet from the womb : Jeremiah 1:5 Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations. Other prophets and Biblical personalities ordained from their mothers wombs: Samson: Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me and his appearance was like the appearance of the angel of God, very awesome. And I did not ask him where he came from, nor did he tell me his name. But he said to me, `Behold, you shall conceive and give birth to a son, and now you shall not drink wine or strong drink nor eat any unclean thing, for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death. (Judges 13:6-7, see also Judges 16:17) John the Baptist : For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no wine or liquor; and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, while yet in his mothers womb. (Luke 1:15) Jesus, the Son of God: Then the angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall call His name JESUS. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David. And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end. Luke chapter 1 The Apostle Paul : But when He who had set me apart, even from my mothers womb, and called me through His grace, was pleased (Galatians 1:15) It is clear in scripture that in some way, God creates life in a mothers womb. Psalm 139:13 For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mothers womb. Of course, the question for the pro-abortion crowd, is: What divine insight does the pro-abortion crowd think they have to where they can destroy in a mothers womb that which God is somehow instrumental in creating? You don't know who's in there, or what their divine purpose is. Choose life. Your mother did.","why-would-anyone-choose-have-child-over-there-own-education","07:57 AM","abortion-debates","57"

The so-called right to abortion has pitted mothers against their children and women against men. It has sown violence and discord at the heart of the most intimate human relationships. It has aggravated the derogation of the fathers role in an increasingly fatherless society. It has portrayed the greatest of gifts a child as a competitor, an intrusion, and an inconvenience. It has nominally accorded mothers unfettered dominion over the independent lives of their physically dependent sons and daughters But I feel that the greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion, because it is a war against the child a direct killing of the innocent child murder by the mother herself.
