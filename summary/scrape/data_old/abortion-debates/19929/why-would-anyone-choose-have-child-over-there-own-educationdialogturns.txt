Pregnancy happens sometimes its just the moment or misinformation on how to properly use contraceptives.

Less than we have now the average family size in america is 1.7-2.3 children in this country. Parents who have an education than have children are more likely to have kids that obtain a 4 year degree. But if they chose to keep those children there more likely to drop out of school without a degree and there children are more likely to not attend a higher education school. So essentially same amount of children just at different times and better starts in live results in better education and a better population as a whole.
Turn No:6
Easyrider:
I don't think so. The kids have options - they can go into the military out of high school and go to college on the G.I. Bill. Many parents go back to college later in life to become teachers, etc. And we know that there's tons of kids who can get education loans if they want. When coupled with low-cost state colleges there's not a lot of reasons for kids not to advance in life if they want to. And out of 40 - 50 million aborted babies, there's a lot of potential geniuses who can make huge differences in society. Besides, abortion is the murder of an innocent unborn baby, and it's an abomination in the eyes of God. There will likely be a price to pay for these acts come the Judgment Seat of God.
Turn No:7
captainrolfe:
Your argument makes assumptions based on opinion not fact. According to the National Center Of Education children from families that both parents obtained a four year degree are more likely to attend a 4 year college and obtain a degree. If you put the children before college parents don't get degrees children are less likely to be in school. And when you include that families size in this country is 1.7 to 2.3 children no more or less children would of been created because on average these families would have had children anyway just at a later time in life. So family planning for high school and college students puts more kids in school and creates better more educated communities.

There were very few deists among the founders. A true deist was one who believed God created the universe and then sat back and (1) did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations and, (2) did not give (divine) revelation to man. Dr. M. E. Bradford of the University of Dallas conducted a study of the Founding Founders to look at this deist issue (whether the Founding Fathers were deists or Christians). He discovered the Founders were members of denominations as follows: twenty-eight Episcopalians, eight Presbyterians, seven Congregationalists, two Lutherans, two Dutch Reformed, two Methodists, two Roman Catholics, and three deists. - Reference: M. E. Bradford, A Worthy Company: Brief Lives of the Framers of the United States Constitution (Marlborough, NH: Plymouth Rock Foundation, 1982), ivv. Benjamin Franklin said the following during the Constitutional Convention: I've lived, Sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing Proofs I see of this Truth That God governs in the Affairs of Men . And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his Notice, is it probable that an Empire can rise without his Aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the Sacred Writings, that except the Lord build the House they labor in vain who build it. I firmly believe this, and I also believe that without his concurring Aid, we shall succeed in this political Building no better than the Builders of Babel: We shall be divided by our little partial local interests; our Projects will be confounded, and we ourselves shall become a Reproach and Bye word down to future Ages. - Speech to the Constitutional Convention (June 28, 1787) Its pretty obvious that Franklin believed in a God who did involve himself in the affairs of men and nations, and Franklin also alludes to the New Testament as Sacred Writings which also reveal Gods revelation to man. Washington was an open promoter of Christianity. For example, in his speech on May 12, 1779, he claimed that what children needed to learn above all was the religion of Jesus Christ, and that to learn this would make them greater and happier than they already are; on May 2, 1778, he charged his soldiers at Valley Forge that To the distinguished character of patriot, it should be our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of Christian; and when he resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the military on June 8, 1783, he reminded the nation that without a humble imitation of the Divine Author of our blessed religion we can never hope to be a happy nation. Washington's own adopted daughter declared of Washington that you might as well question his patriotism as to question his Christianity. In addition, the inscription on Washington's tomb at Mount Vernon is this: WITHIN THIS ENCLOSURE REST THE REMAINS OF GENL. GEORGE WASHINGTON." Over the door of the inner tomb is inscribed: "I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE." Thomas Jefferson was hardly speaking from a strict deist standpoint when he said: "Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice cannot sleep forever." (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781) Now, why should Jefferson tremble for his country if God does not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations? Ant then there's this: "I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who lead our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessities and comforts of life." (Monday, March 4, 1805, in his 2nd Inaugural Address) Remember, a strict deist was one who believed God was like a watchmaker, who wound up the universe and thereafter did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. Jefferson obviously believed otherwise, and he was referencing the Biblical God. Definitely not a deist. So it's not my worldview of the country's founding fathers that is skewed - it's yours. There is a God and when you try to write him out of the American story then you are not being honest about the foundations of this country.

Never take history from a christian the take what politician to say as truths as at all times and not gaining political advantage. Benjamin Franklin was a prefound diest and liked to contradict himself for the humor in it read his biography he was a profound womanizer had many illegitimate children and purely believed in science received and loved Thomas Jeffersons bible. Thomas Jefferson was a profound deist rewrote the bible taking out all the miracles in it saying he took out the diamonds in the dunghill thats right are president rewrote the bible a gift that is given to all new congress members. He also was quoted as saying I dont care if a man believes in one god or 10. John Adams was a diest till he ran against Jefferson in congress only changing his views to pander a political advantage a thing he was not successful at Jefferson won despite that they remained friends and in several letters between the two later the discuss his bible that shows Jesus not as the son of God but equal to Plato just another philosopher. You dont even have to explain Washington if you've taken fourth grade history you know he didnt believe in the divinity of god to any degree but believed showing some humility on your believe in sciences is a great attribution to pander to lesser minds read his biography as well.

Numerous examples that he was a Christian can be seen in the following link. WallBuilders - Issues and Articles - Was George Washington a Christian?

You can't get into Jefferson's mind to make that claim - that he just attended church out of political considerations.

I have a B.S. in Psych and a great deal of the curriculum were courses like Tests and Measurements, Physiology, Statistics, Collegiate Biology, Animal and Human Behavior, Pseudoscience and the Paranormal, Classical and Operant Conditioning, Childhood Development, Abnormal Psychology, and so on. We also had to design our own scientific studies. Mine was testing the hypothesis that older students achieved better grades / results than younger students.

Is that what I said? I think my point was they, despite their convictions, viewed religion as something that had no place in in government. That it was something for the individual and not the state and the reason religion is excluded from The US Government? The faith of the founding fathers is clear by the wording of DOI and Bill of Rights, they all prayed attended church regularly, yet not so much as a token position of authority. Because they recognized throughout history including their own time religion was inflexible. It was a restrictive obstacle to progress and the type of freedom the founders had fought for. They had no intention after the war to trade one intolerant master for another. With close to 2 billion members you would think there would be at least one Christian led nation besides the Vatican, but there is not. What keeps those highly religious people who are a majority in a number of countries from following in the footsteps of Muslims who do? There was God's way and God's law and that was it. The definition of murder has changed often from the acceptance of revenge killings and sanctuary cities to 1st, 2nd and 3rd degree murder, manslaughter voluntary and involuntary, special circumstances, insanity and self defense and negligence are just some examples of the evolution of what is murder. The Church did indeed enact taxes when it held authority from prostitutes to goods and services and tithing to indulgences. They lost the ability to tax when they lost their authority to rule. From what? Sumerian to Judaism to Catholicism to Islam to Protestant or Lutheran, Baptist, Mormon? Does it matter? A branch splits and they condemn each other as not following faithfully. Someone experiences divine revelation and starts something new but the requirements to obey what God commands, to submit to God remains the same. God is always eternal and gave his rules that are not open to debate or revision a very long time ago. At best the name changes people don't vote and determine what God's law is to be. Because mandates from government are based on the needs of the people whether honestly made or not. They may be discussed and overturned, modified or challenged. It may be near impossible to have our government vote to make murder legal in all circumstances, but it could happen. Secular law permits divorce and does not require a women to marry her rapist. Instead of giving guidelines on the treatment of slaves it prohibits the practice. Religion has a place in society, but not in government. It does not accept that other Gods exist and therefore has a wedge that cannot be overcome. Religions accept other religions because they have to, not because they want to.
