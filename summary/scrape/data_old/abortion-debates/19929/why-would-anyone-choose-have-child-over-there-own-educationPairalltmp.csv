Orthodox remains constant as God never changes. Political force Sure it can. Murder is murder and theft is theft, but what constitutes murder differs and the penalty varies same with theft. Tax laws change several times in a person's lifetime same with many other laws. It might and it might not, it might get worse but religion stays the same. Man might try and add to it not enforce divine law, but that is technically not permissable. Usually to do so involves some type of divine retribution. Laws that are are unpopular can be overturned. People can appeal a law or attempt to get a pardon, not so with religion. God judges when you die and not before.","why-would-anyone-choose-have-child-over-there-own-education","abortion-debates","47","05:55 PM"

To imply that they believed in a type of secular justice among men that was more fluid than the morals presented in the bible is a bald faced lie. When was the definition of murder changed last, and where does the doctrine of any christian religion establish absolute taxes? Religion that is unpopular is always changed. What I want to know is why you think mandates from government are inherently more consistent with freedom than mandates from a church. You did imply it when you said the founding fathers knew that religion could never allow freedom.","why-would-anyone-choose-have-child-over-there-own-education","abortion-debates","49","07:56 PM"

I think my point was they, despite their convictions, viewed religion as something that had no place in in government. That it was something for the individual and not the state and the reason religion is excluded from The US Government? The faith of the founding fathers is clear by the wording of DOI and Bill of Rights, they all prayed attended church regularly, yet not so much as a token position of authority. Because they recognized throughout history including their own time religion was inflexible. It was a restrictive obstacle to progress and the type of freedom the founders had fought for. They had no intention after the war to trade one intolerant master for another. With close to 2 billion members you would think there would be at least one Christian led nation besides the Vatican, but there is not. What keeps those highly religious people who are a majority in a number of countries from following in the footsteps of Muslims who do? There was God's way and God's law and that was it. The definition of murder has changed often from the acceptance of revenge killings and sanctuary cities to 1st, 2nd and 3rd degree murder, manslaughter voluntary and involuntary, special circumstances, insanity and self defense and negligence are just some examples of the evolution of what is murder. The Church did indeed enact taxes when it held authority from prostitutes to goods and services and tithing to indulgences. They lost the ability to tax when they lost their authority to rule. From what? Sumerian to Judaism to Catholicism to Islam to Protestant or Lutheran, Baptist, Mormon? Does it matter? A branch splits and they condemn each other as not following faithfully. Someone experiences divine revelation and starts something new but the requirements to obey what God commands, to submit to God remains the same. God is always eternal and gave his rules that are not open to debate or revision a very long time ago. At best the name changes people don't vote and determine what God's law is to be. Because mandates from government are based on the needs of the people whether honestly made or not. They may be discussed and overturned, modified or challenged. It may be near impossible to have our government vote to make murder legal in all circumstances, but it could happen. Secular law permits divorce and does not require a women to marry her rapist. Instead of giving guidelines on the treatment of slaves it prohibits the practice. Religion has a place in society, but not in government. It does not accept that other Gods exist and therefore has a wedge that cannot be overcome. Religions accept other religions because they have to, not because they want to.","why-would-anyone-choose-have-child-over-there-own-education","abortion-debates","54","03:31 AM"

You condone murder, you are an accessory. You want some advice istolebunnies? Get a degree if you want a degree, pregnancy is not fatal. Do not use your own goals as en excuse to commit homicide.","pappillion001","462649","If you believe abortion is wrong then don't have one when faced with the choice, but don't shove your belief down someone else's throat as if you understand her circumstances. If you have the personality to accomplish being a parent and having a career or changing your vision for your life without missing a beat then good for you give yourself a pat on the back as you don't represent every women in the world. It is one thing as a man to make the statement it is quit another to be faced with time running out to make a decision. Only she can decide what is the best choice for her. Anybody who thinks otherwise is arrogantly presumptuous. Your opinion concerning murder, a child and an accessory is just that your opinion. To push it as if it were fact is emotional blackmail. Let her make her choice based on facts both what she will give up and what she will gain honestly and without personal beliefs determining for her. She is the one that will deal with her choice for the rest of her life, while you will have forgotten she existed within a year.","why-would-anyone-choose-have-child-over-there-own-education","abortion-debates","55","03:58 AM"
"","09-21-2012","19929","Freedom","462646","Quite true, but the question isn't whether you can find someone who will tell you it's right; it's whether it's right. If you don't want to be judged leave the planet, that's how humanity is and if you think you've found someone who doesn't judge you are wrong. The people who will supposedly 'not judge' you have already judged abortion morally permissible or they would indeed make it their business. There is no escaping the fact that judgements must be made, and if they are not made rationally they can be wrong .","pappillion001","462650","Or they can be right. Who is in a better position to make that judgement you or her? You can't say because you don't know her, but you are more than willing to assume she is not and make it for her. That is emotional decision making not rational decision making. By the way since when is because everybody does it it must be ok not a fallacy?","why-would-anyone-choose-have-child-over-there-own-education","abortion-debates","56","04:46 AM"
