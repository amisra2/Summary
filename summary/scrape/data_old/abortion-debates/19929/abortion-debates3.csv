Dont try and take tid bits of history and make your own truth its history it cant be changed. If you want to contradict that these men put science before god.

"09-19-2012","19929",3,"Easyrider","462568","There were very few deists among the founders. A true deist was one who believed God created the universe and then sat back and (1) did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations and, (2) did not give (divine) revelation to man. Dr. M. E. Bradford of the University of Dallas conducted a study of the Founding Founders to look at this deist issue (whether the Founding Fathers were deists or Christians). He discovered the Founders were members of denominations as follows: twenty-eight Episcopalians, eight Presbyterians, seven Congregationalists, two Lutherans, two Dutch Reformed, two Methodists, two Roman Catholics, and three deists. - Reference: M. E. Bradford, A Worthy Company: Brief Lives of the Framers of the United States Constitution (Marlborough, NH: Plymouth Rock Foundation, 1982), ivv. Benjamin Franklin said the following during the Constitutional Convention: I've lived, Sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing Proofs I see of this Truth That God governs in the Affairs of Men . And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his Notice, is it probable that an Empire can rise without his Aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the Sacred Writings, that except the Lord build the House they labor in vain who build it. I firmly believe this, and I also believe that without his concurring Aid, we shall succeed in this political Building no better than the Builders of Babel: We shall be divided by our little partial local interests; our Projects will be confounded, and we ourselves shall become a Reproach and Bye word down to future Ages. - Speech to the Constitutional Convention (June 28, 1787) Its pretty obvious that Franklin believed in a God who did involve himself in the affairs of men and nations, and Franklin also alludes to the New Testament as Sacred Writings which also reveal Gods revelation to man. Washington was an open promoter of Christianity. For example, in his speech on May 12, 1779, he claimed that what children needed to learn above all was the religion of Jesus Christ, and that to learn this would make them greater and happier than they already are; on May 2, 1778, he charged his soldiers at Valley Forge that To the distinguished character of patriot, it should be our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of Christian; and when he resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the military on June 8, 1783, he reminded the nation that without a humble imitation of the Divine Author of our blessed religion we can never hope to be a happy nation. Washington's own adopted daughter declared of Washington that you might as well question his patriotism as to question his Christianity. In addition, the inscription on Washington's tomb at Mount Vernon is this: WITHIN THIS ENCLOSURE REST THE REMAINS OF GENL. GEORGE WASHINGTON."" Over the door of the inner tomb is inscribed: ""I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE."" Thomas Jefferson was hardly speaking from a strict deist standpoint when he said: ""Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice cannot sleep forever."" (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781) Now, why should Jefferson tremble for his country if God does not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations? Ant then there's this: ""I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who lead our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessities and comforts of life."" (Monday, March 4, 1805, in his 2nd Inaugural Address) Remember, a strict deist was one who believed God was like a watchmaker, who wound up the universe and thereafter did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. Jefferson obviously believed otherwise, and he was referencing the Biblical God. Definitely not a deist. So it's not my worldview of the country's founding fathers that is skewed - it's yours. There is a God and when you try to write him out of the American story then you are not being honest about the foundations of this country.

Almost all men of the period were religious. They prayed, went to church and raised their families and had a great respect for the values presented by religion. Despite this and having the ability and support religion was specifically excluded from participation in government. There was no official position of authority or office to oversee the religious needs of the country, nor federal laws requiring religious observance. Ask yourself why would these deeply religious men who possessed the will, the power, and had the support of the people who were also religious, intentionally prohibit any role of religion into government? Their religion is irrelevant. They understood from the lessons of history and events that were playing out at the time that religion never has and never will be make freedom a possibility. Religion permits only one view, no compromise and cannot be questioned.","why-would-anyone-choose-have-child-over-there-own-education","07:25 PM","abortion-debates","32"

The Jefferson bible written by Jefferson according to a letter he wrote to John Adams was how he felt about Christianity and im talking about the actual one he wrote taking out the miracles in this letter he wrote it is the greatest collection of morals that any man could live by and he also included in the same letter that I took out anything that any sensible man with mind or reason could believe in.

"09-20-2012","19929",3,"pappillion001","462575","Your response was this.... ''Oddly, if you move forward with this kind of philosophy statistically abortions will decrease. The primary reason for unwanted pregnancy is from misuse (I know it is not that complicated). Men and women who had a higher education were less likely to have unwanted pregnancies and had a 34% swing in proper use of prevention methods. I didnt feel the need to respond to the blatantly obvious but I notice you felt the need to repeat it and ignore the other points I made regarding the OP Somehow you felt the need to preface your post with 'oddly' which was odd and seemed to think that my post represented a philosophy which makes you even odder. Then you asserted that the primary reason for unwanted pregnancy was' misuse' of contraceptives...wow who'd of thought that? I apologise, it was informed guesswork. It would take a special kind of idiot not to assume that people who were capable of higher education would be less likely to ' misuse' contraceptives( misuse..jeez) and an even more special kind of idiot to think that quantifying it made it appear more authoritative. I notice that you felt the need for even more guesswork from the Guttmacher institute....would it really matter it were a 35 or 33% swing? Maybe to you. You said.... 'Civilization has been trying abstinence as a method of birth control for thousands of years and just can't get past a brain hardwired to reproduce.' ..if that wasnt your point then why post it? Your point was wrong... One of the most common results of prolonged sexual activity without contraception in fertile human beings is reproduction . The fact that human use contraception must have given you a clue that we are NOT hardwired to reproduce..we are hardwired to have sexual relationships. Maybe you didnt read the OP title. The fact that this thread is primarily about avoiding reproduction may have gone over your head. Maybe there are some surveys that will substitute for common sense","pappillion001","462632","[QUOTE=gansao;462583] I see where the confusion and opportunity for you to become a bit lippy come from. I was not at all clear that I was referring to women staying in school instead of becoming a parent. That although the short term is an abortion the long term would be fewer since statistically it is young poor uneducated women who end up pregnant. Most people would consider non-use or force as the primary reasons, not preventitive methods used incorrectly Now you are just being the dimwit you spoke of earlier. It isn't stupid people who get pregnant, many are capable but choose to not have an abortion. Where does your information come from? That thing you sit on? I don't need to make it appear authoritive, it already is and has far more credibility than what you spew out of whichever of your orifices that is in control for the day. What an incredibly stupid response. It was in response to your asseretion that people should just abstain from sex. Good luck. The vast majority of people from the age where sex becomes of interest until they want to have children will find themselves for various reasons doing so. To think that overcoming by force of will is ridicoulus. It was stupid for you to suggest that as an overall primary method to not become pregnant. Sure it is the most reliable but you are fighting nature and are going to lose. Why do you think nature compels people to have sex? If the best you have is semantics as a rebuttal then you are wasting time, mine and yours. I will let this slide since I wasn't clear on my first response.","why-would-anyone-choose-have-child-over-there-own-education","05:37 PM","abortion-debates","45"
