Morals should be based on the general satisfaction of doing good deeds and helping others. The way you put god as a punisher instead of a teacher is truly wrong. A desire for knowledge is what makes the human race great; science and technology are advancing at unheard of rates solving problems on global scales and you dont see divinity in that you prefer a neanderthal god thats a warlord that will punish instead of love, kill instead of nourish, and torture instead of teach. If there is a god (or gods) no one should fear her/him because if you had to than she/he wouldnt be a god. I truly feel sorry you worship a demonized version of perfection.","why-would-anyone-choose-have-child-over-there-own-education","08:36 AM","abortion-debates","83"

Curiosity discovered atomic theory fear led to its use of weapon. Fear tears a a human apart and created the greatest atrocities we have done as a species. As for proving the existence of god you obviously have a very limited understanding how scientific theories are done. First you observe a repeatable occurrence in nature such as evolution we know and can see things evolve. Than you make hypothesis to try and explain the observation. The hypothesis is repeatable tested and if tests show and uphold your hypothesis you get a theory. You don't work from the opposite end henceforth god doesn't exist until you can prove that it does. The lack of evidence isnt evidence.","why-would-anyone-choose-have-child-over-there-own-education","03:47 PM","abortion-debates","86"

That study show that people who are put in situations of great fear causes powerful reactions I can argue that the fear of losing something in a fire has the love of the object as the motivator not fear. And furthermore the love of stuff makes us create new things to further protect ourselves and the things we love a seriously doubt Mr. Tesla was afraid when he made some of the greatest inventions of our generation it was curiosity.

Psychology is true what you said not a science based argument so it cant be used for any true argument because its not science but thank you for agreeing with me that its not scientific and therefore invalid in any debate.","why-would-anyone-choose-have-child-over-there-own-education","10:12 PM","abortion-debates","90"
