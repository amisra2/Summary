We should encourage are youth to attend college, we should tell youth its ok to want to grow up and be someone important. There is nothing wrong with putting off a family for a career even if it involves the hard choice of having an abortion. As a society we should support this for the good of are children and are country. There is such a huge need for educated workers these days that telling a women she cant choose to continue her education is the most immoral thing I have ever heard. If you ever get an abortion to further your education you did the right thing.","why-would-anyone-choose-have-child-over-there-own-education","10:12 PM","abortion-debates","1"

No doubt the same applies in the US. Woman that become pregnant at college are XXXXXX not victims.If they use contraceptives and make sure that their boyfriend keeps a prophylactic on his penis then the chances of pregnancy are remote. I agree that they should have abortions though. They should be given the aborted fetus to take home in carrier bag to show them the consequences of their idiocy. Contraception is not rocket science. Ask a rocket scientist.","why-would-anyone-choose-have-child-over-there-own-education","05:42 PM","abortion-debates","6"

The primary reason for unwanted pregnancy is from misuse (I know it is not that complicated). Men and women who had a higher education were less likely to have unwanted pregnancies and had a 34% swing in proper use of prevention methods. Civilization has been trying abstinence as a method of birth control for thousands of years and just can't get past a brain hardwired to reproduce.","why-would-anyone-choose-have-child-over-there-own-education","08:49 PM","abortion-debates","13"
