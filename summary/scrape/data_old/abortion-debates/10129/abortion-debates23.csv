I have a woman here, her doctor has told her that due to her heart defect, she has a 80% chance of making it term and surviving the birthing process. That not bad odds. She has a good chance; clearly. Lets play God here. Its so much fun being the righteous God like enforcer of the intentions of a living God. Plus the fact that she may have far to many self interests and not see the issue clearly. Lets together as a group, decide if she should carry her fetus to term. What say you? Does she risk her very life or not? The odds are clearly in favor of complete gestation. If you say to force her to carry to term, then she could clearly die. But your pro-life opinion is intact. If you say no, she could carry the fetus anyway because she wants a child. Danger here. If you say, Give her a choice, I'm going to freak. No No...No choice here. Thats my argument! Besides, if your going to be Pro-death....opps, I mean life. You had better give me a percentage of risk a woman must undertake to carry to term. Your enforcement so your percentage. What say you?; Oh God on earth. What is the enforced percentage of risk? Now think...Think clearly, specially since your going to act like a God. Because the 80% swings everyday, and your judgment on her and others lifes can not be taken back, specially after they have died. Where do we the God's of her life, determine the braking point of chance should be? Can you hear her praying yet? She had better be praying to you. God is not going to give a percentage.","abortion-euthanization","09:48 AM","abortion-debates","331"
"08-23-2007","10129",23,"Another opinion","279937","Ok, so if everything has some elements of ""faith"", then wouldn't you agree that some beliefs rely more on ""faith"" than others and that there is a gray scale of faith vs proven certainty, where the amount of evidence determines that gray scale? This relates to the analogy of the murder trial since the more evidence one has for guilt, the more probable that guilt is. Or do you deny this? One thing we disagree on is that you really believe in a concept of ""natural rights"" presumably ""endowed by our creator"" which may be a nice concept to think about and makes for nice rhethoric in the Declaration of Independence but it is not the legal basis on which our country is founded (the legal basis is the Constitution) and is very problematic since different people come to different conclusions on natural rights. For example, those on the pro-choice side would view a right to ones body as a natural right - an inherent part of liberty. Instead of believing in some abstract natural rights, I acknowledge that it is the people of a country that ultimately determine rights, where the founders were wise enough to make it difficult for people to vote their rights away (by requiring a large majority to do so). Since it is people who make these decisions, my stress of empathy is that, directly or indirectly, empathy was the main emotion that people appealed to in claiming rights. Couples want to have their love and lifelong committment ackowledged in marriage - which also gives respectibility to their union. Without it, their relationship would not be the same. Since most people see the positive aspects of marriage, they would also not deny it to others. When it comes to the question of support for gay marriage, both of those moral stances play a role - reciprocity in treating gay couples just like any other couples who are in love, and empathy in acknowledging that gay couples have most of the same feelings and needs as straight couples. The opposite arguments are essentially based on a negative view of gays - either through religion (""God says homosexuality is immoral"") or through the general homophobia of this culture. I, personally, have no problem with gay marriage but, acknowledging that it is difficult to change a culture overnight, I would be more of a supporter of civil unions at this point. Oh, so it is not skin, after all, but the genetics that determine skin color. Then, how about Italian Americans or Greek Americans - who are relatively dark skinned compared to WASPs, would they have been considered inferior to WASPs because of their skin color, which is genetic? A main point is that differentiating people based purely on skin color and nothing else, leads to many complicated inconsistencies. Another main point is that people do not just randomly spit out rules but they nearly always feel the need to justify those rules - even the slaveholders. They did not claim that it was only dark skin itself that made the difference - they were prejudiced against the race that inherently had black skin for a number of reason (some reasons were interpreted quotes from the bible). In the idealized case, rational discussion could have laid bare the falsehood of many of these assertions. Well, people certainly do fight for their own rights, but when it comes to the rights of others or decisions about others, then they are swayed by both emotional value judgements and reason. In that example, I was speaking of the idealised case where people would engage in rational discussion and allow themselves to be held accountable to it. I fully realize that reality is not that way and some people will continue to believe that ""2 + 2 = 3"" if it suits them, no matter what rational arguements are presented. I bring up the idealized case simply to show what that ideal could have achieved - in order to try to convince you and others in this culture to try to hold up rational arguement as an ideal. Rational discussions can get rid of a lot of the bogus reasoning that has caused injustice, as long as it is fully participated in. That is why I mainly refer to rational ""discussion"" not rational ""debate"". Debate, in my view, is when people try to convince others - either in the opposition or in an audience - of their point of view. It says nothing about their open-mindedness in having their own minds changed. In order to fully participate in rational discussion, I would claim that you also have to be willing to have your mind changed - something that is difficult for many people to do due to ego, self-interest, or other issues. That open-mindedness is critical to having effective rational discussions. Without it, not much gets accomplished - as can be seen on so many debates on 4forums.com as well.","Steeeeve","280071","That's actually kind of a hard question to answer. I'm sure it's true but if you have elements of faith then without knowing the truth you don't know how wrong you could be. You know, this is really an aside anyway. The only point to this was we all have faith and I'd say we have a lot more than you probably think we do. At least you can see my views are not limited to just me. But aside from that I'd say the DoI reflected the views of the people who mainly wrote the constitution. Furthermore, the constitution's man goal was to set up a system of government and only in the amendments did they get into making some rights harder to reach. Interestingly, the constitution doesn't need to define terms like ""liberty"" as it clearly states how this word can be defined (due process). So the idea was the let the people decide what they want liberty to mean in hopes of achieving natural rights. Obviously there are disagreements on what they are. as stated above I agree our rights are basically codified by laws and voted on by the people. This doesn't disprove or prove a natural rights idea though. But I stress again it is hard to promote empathy if you are not empathic to the being to start with. Furthermore, it implies the right already exists outside of empathy and therefore you have to show how it is given to both parties. meh, we might want to get off this topic since this isn't the gay rights forum but I tend to disagree with a lot said here. Is it not? I'm pretty sure they limited it to just Africans. No it doesn't. If you are going to claim that my argument has to be ""you gain rights the lighter your skin gets"" then why couldn't I claim your argument is ""you gain rights the more developed your brain gets""? That would lead to the same complicated inconsistencies. Well I'm a firm believer that they knew it was wrong but it seems they did just make rules based upon a belief. Yes some spit out certain claims from science to the Bible and yet ""rational discussion"" didn't solve this. The idea that they were weak-minded then and we are so perfect now is foolish. Thinking hasn't changed much since then. doubtful If everyone thought 2 + 2 = 3 would you say it does (abstractly)? You weren't one to defend me when I was getting rid of the bogus reasoning that goes like this: ""Don't push your beliefs on me"". In fact, I challenge you to call people on your side when they give a bogus reasoning and I'll do the same (which I tend to do anyway). That aside, I have never disagreed that rational discussion is bad, in fact, I think it is good but I'd disagree that it would lead anywhere but having two separate belief structures. I also disagree that it is full proof as it is extremely limited to ability to comprehend and numerous other factors. Of course open mindedness is hard to prove. All I can say is I used to be pro-choice and was convinced otherwise....the hardly proves anything though.","abortion-euthanization","10:04 AM","abortion-debates","332"

Of course you know that I do not think that Roe v. Wade has any constitutional merit, but that is an entirely different discussion than I am having here. When someone tells me I can't do X, then I want to know why I can't do X. This is the conversation I am trying to have with the chemist. It's a conversation about first principles--a political theory if you will.","Sigma","280089","Your pardon. From what I quoted it seemed that you believed we lived in a democracy and that ""if a majority of people choose one thing, then the minority is subject to that choice"". Excluding legal reasons, it would depend on what sort of values you base your ethics upon. A misogynist would not respond to arguments that disallowing abortion unjustifiably harms women, for example, because women don't matter to such a person. A person who bases his ethics upon religious dogma would also not respond to reasoned arguments since dogma needs no rationale. Disallowing abortion benefits no thinking, feeling creature while at the same time harming a thinking, feeling creature. If you consider the taking way of choice harm.","abortion-euthanization","11:51 AM","abortion-debates","338"
"08-23-2007","10129",23,"None","None","None","richbrmly","280092","The state is not the author of morality. The state has no concept of the mind of God and can not control many aspects of peoples lives. The state can not determine you mindset. Can't check and see if your thoughts only moral. The state by biblical standards can not marry anyone. The, ""what God has united"", aspect. Does this effect a couple united by God? Course not. Jesus said anyone that sleeps together are married without any contract. So, marriage happens under that aspect at very high rate. The state allows many things that are not moral. Completely immoral. A male can watch a sexual act in film. A person can use a condom in the commission of a sexual act. A father can legally have sexual relations with their daughter if she is of a consenting age. Now, some of you don't do this kind of stuff. I don't do it. The state can not dictate morality; if it could, then there would be no morality because it would be law. Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should do it. Smoking, drinking, abnormal sexual relations with even a spouse. I don't tell people to abort a fetus. Never have I even suggested it. I can't decide what percentage of risk anyone should take under any conditions and so I am pro-choice. I can tell you what my decisions would be. If I where pregnant and had a 20% risk of the loss of my life, I would carry to term. Pray like a Muslim at Ramadan and take the risk. I can't tell you to do that though.","abortion-euthanization","12:29 PM","abortion-debates","339"

It was a bit hard to follow. You appear to be raising a scenario whereby the mother's life would be at risk. These types of cases are rare indeed. Only 4% of abortions in 2004 were performed for the sole reason if maternal health issues. Of that 4%, it is not clear how many were actually necessary to preserve the life of the mother (although it is known to be much lower than the full 4%). But for the sake of argument, we can simply assume that the entire 4% were performed to save the life of the mother. It is estimated that 1.3 million abortions occur every year in the United States. Therefore, about 52,000 abortions are performed for the purpose of maternal health (even less for the purpose of preserving maternal life). It seems odd to me that someone who thinks that those 52,000 abortions should be permitted would then advocate for policies that lead to 1.3 million abortions. If you think abortions should be permitted for health reasons, then you should advocate policies that allow abortions only for that reason. Supporting abortion in the so-called hard cases should not lead one to conclude that 1.3 million abortions should be permitted. My own view is that in issues where maternal life is jeopardized by pregnancy (a very, very rare circumstance), the physician ought to save the life that can be saved. This approach would typically preserve the life of the mother at the costly expense of killing a human life. Although advances in medical knowledge has reduced the likelihood of an either-or scenario. In the vast majority of cases, both lives can be preserved medically. You can see from my response that my view on abortion is not based on hypothetical scenarios which are devoid from the facts. I prefer to examine the facts first and then make a conclusion. I do not develop a conclusion first and then search for the facts to justify that conclusion.","abortion-euthanization","01:58 PM","abortion-debates","342"

And the doomed will be greater than your odds because people will still have the abortions. It happens in every country on the earth. A Doctor is being executed in Saudi Arabia now, if it hasn't already happened. Here is the basic problem, if your arguing abortion should be permitted for health reasons then you'll need a percentage of risk or the courts will be flooded with people having actual health reasons for an abortion. Still need the God like percentage of chance. How many times will the Doctor be wrong? 800 women died last year in childbirth. Someone was wrong or they took your advice. Cancer actually happens. Heart defects are real. Tons of scenarios and by the way. I am pro-choice so the scenarios are not my issue. Your for law to prevent access, so they are yours to ponder.
