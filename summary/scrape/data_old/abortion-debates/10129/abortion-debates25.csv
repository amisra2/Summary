And of course 1/2 give or take of the voters would be disqualified if relevant issues come up to a vote. Perhaps we should start an effort to amend the constitution to incorporate your idea! I don't think we really need to. The SCOTUS has told the nation that the right to privacy is encompassed by the 9th Amendment.","abortion-euthanization","05:02 AM","abortion-debates","361"

Because if you where not counting the fetus, we are not at odds.","Steeeeve","280277","Counting for what? This makes no sense. I'm not sure how a stone is unborn either. counting them as persons? Well they are.","abortion-euthanization","10:02 AM","abortion-debates","362"
"08-24-2007","10129",25,"richbrmly","280148","I agree with you. Do I want abortion to used for birth control? no... As you say, I agree things need to be looked at on a case by case bases; thats what choice is unless there are criteria. But again I agree, I can't set the criteria as well. You and I surely don't want the deaths back. Be it 10,000 or 80,000. Clearly we agree. Progress.","Steeeeve","280280","Not only is Phyllis right in calling you what you are but you clearly ignore reality. You were already called on using incorrect facts once...you might as well say ""denying abortion will cause 10000000 bagillion deaths a day""","abortion-euthanization","10:06 AM","abortion-debates","363"
"08-24-2007","10129",25,"thecap0","280204","I see that many of you are busily discussing angels on the head of a pin questions. My view is that no man ought to have any opinion whatsoever on a woman's decision of whether or not to terminate a pregnancy unless and until she asks him.","Steeeeve","280282","And the logic behind this opinion is.... Out of the 20+ people that came in here using that argument not one reasonable one has stuck with it. They normally will change their reasoning for being pro-choice to something dealing with development of the unborn because the argument that ""I can't decide things that effect other people"" is just ridiculous.","abortion-euthanization","10:11 AM","abortion-debates","364"

I was called on using incorrect facts and your shooting out words like bagillion? You need to know when you in a dream. Reality is scary I understand that. I can't make a blind man see steve, if I could I would. Seems you can't make an aware man sleep as well.","abortion-euthanization","11:24 AM","abortion-debates","365"

"08-24-2007","10129",25,"None","None","None","richbrmly","280330","Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs (United States) Two to three women die in the U.S. every day from pregnancy complications, and over 30 percent of pregnant women nearly 1.2 million women each year experience some type of illness or injury during childbirth beyond what would be expected in a normal delivery. This works out to be around 1 in every 4 women carrying a fetus to term. Most pregnancy-related complications are preventable (abortable, or serviceable). The most common are: ectopic pregnancy, premature labor, hemorrhage, blood clots, high blood pressure, infection, stroke, amniotic fluid in the bloodstream, diabetes and heart disease U.S. Government data matches this claim. Two to three women each day, dieing Before the advent of abortion the numbers where staggering higher. Like in Mexico where if you use population and death rates, your jaw would drop. Naturally we would face the same stats but at a much higher dayly rate. This is why; If the country is to outlaw abortion, then we would have to come up with a risk factor (factor means ratio) for those women we would allow the liberty of choice. I know and you know you can get the numbers; A boat load of agences record and monitor this. But your mind is fogged and your concept of women having equal liberties to live are muted at best.","abortion-euthanization","03:36 PM","abortion-debates","369"

Why wouldn't we? Because we outlawed abortion before, and it was not necessary to come up with some abstract concept of risk ratio. Your claim that we would need one makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. All that I have said really boils down to this: if you support abortion for the purpose of preserving maternal life, fine. Advocate for policies that would encompass that scenario. There is no need to condone, endorse, and support 1.3 million abortions annually in order to ensure that a very small number of women are able to obtain life saving medical treatment. It would be tantamount to saying that killing another person is justifiable in certain circumstances. Therefore, we must not prohibit anyone from killing another person in any cicumstance. That is bogus logic. And in keeping with the spirit of your spurious conclusion about a risk ratio requirement, consider this: we are able to make a distinction in the law between murder and self-defense without specifying an arbitrary risk ratio. It is not necessary to know what percentage chance a person had of surviving an attack in order to distinguish between a killing (or injury) in self-defense, and a killing (or injury) for no justifiable reason at all. But if you truly believed in this risk ratio nonsense, then you would be advocating the need for a specification of risk ratio in our self-defense statutes. And you would be so concerned at the absence of such a ratio that you would be pro-choice as to the question of whether one should be permitted to murder or not.","abortion-euthanization","03:53 PM","abortion-debates","370"
"08-24-2007","10129",25,"chemist99a","280339","Actually you would. If Abortion should be outlawed in the US do you think thats the end of the issue? Its gonna come back to the courts if its legislative action (which is what I think you advocate) and its likely to do so even if its judicial action. When it reaches the courts you can bet any amount of money that the pro-choice advocate will bring up the issue of risk/benefit ratio. When that happens the pro-""life"" advocate will be driven to either provide a counter estimate, impeach the pro-choice etstimate, or accept the pro-choice estimate. So if you wish to keep the ban in place you had darn well be able to defend it in an rational and analytical enviornment of the court room. Things are not what they used to be you know. We also once allowed slavetry in the US. If we restored it I think the Stuff would rapidly hit the proverbial fan. Same with Abortion.","Phyllis","280340","I have not read this yet, but I did want to let you know that I edited the post you quote here.

Your mothers, sisters and daughters will have live by the factors your subscribe too. I want to know how much risk you children should be exposed to. The numbers I am giving are real as you know. You might also know these numbers have increased, NOT decreased because there are women actually believing what your selling. They have over doubled. I have daughters...A mother. I can not abort a fetus.. I am a male. So my fight is for family because I place value on them. A Fetus is not worth a mother, she has children at home. Even the Bible is clear on the mater. I understand there are Jehodists that put their religion over their family. And for them, what can I do? Nothing, I am not saying we should force women in danger of carring to term to abort. Your saying they should carry and your loved ones will have to live or die by what you have tought them. The deaths happen. Clearly they happen. Your saying the state must prevent choice. But you also clearly say the state must consider health risks...You can't do that with a blanket statement like that. 1.3 million women last year had a health risk and carried to term. They made a choice. when does the issue of choice happen? Lets say for your daughter. When should she be allowed by law to have a choice??","abortion-euthanization","04:38 PM","abortion-debates","374"
