After all violation of any of the bill of rights provisions are considered violations of the constitution. And I would also add that separation of church and state via the provision that congress shall pass no bill respecting an establishment of religion was indeed included within the core of the constituion. I shall stick to this viewpoint unless and until you can convince me that somehow the amendments are somehow inferior to the body of the document.","Steeeeve","275081","I never said they were inferior but thanks the for strawman. But if everything is the core of the constitution then why not just say ""constitution""? Once again ""separation of church and state"" 1) doesn't mean what you think it means and 2) Isn't in the constitution.","abortion-euthanization","12:32 PM","abortion-debates","151"
"07-23-2007","10129",11,"chemist99a","275041","As to abortion and imposition of views. The issue is whether the view of the woman is being imposed on another person whose rights are superior to her own. Two issues. Is the fetus a person? Rationally (but not scientifically) before entering the third trimester NO. If you take this veiw then abortion is and should be the province of the woman. That ends that chain. Part II. The fetus IS a persoon. Does its rights take priority over the woman? Rationally NO. The fetus is neither competent to assert its rights nor is it independent of its host. Under such an arrangement its the Hosts choice as to whether to accept the arrangement or not - its not the choice of the fetus. Even if you accord some rights to the fetus the human being represented by the woman should have priority - not the other way round. If abortion is to be outlawed one would have to conclude that the fetus IS a person, AND that the rights of the fetus are overwhelmingy superior to those of its womb provider. This is neither logical nor advisable.","Steeeeve","275085","If you want to assert things that are not logical then we need look no further than your post quoted above. You made an unfounded claim that ""rationally"" the fetus is not a person for starters. You then assumed the fetus is a person for the Part II but made another random claim. You claimed that the rights of the fetus are not above the womens...I agree. But from there you conclude that this means the womens is above the fetus. This I find not true. I treat all people as equals no matter their abilities and apparently you don't. Therefore, if they are equals and life is a fundamental right then at the very highest level they do not have a right to kill one another. Of course I assume life is a right above all and perhaps you don't. A scary world if you think otherwise though.","abortion-euthanization","12:40 PM","abortion-debates","152"
"07-23-2007","10129",11,"Another opinion","274994","I am also not presenting an argument ""don't impose your beliefs on me"". As I am repeating over and over and over and over (and you just don't seem to get), I am presenting an argument ""don't impose your UNSUPPORTED beliefs on me"" (unsupported being unsupported by rational debate). Furthermore, once again, you also are limiting who you claim is a person (i.e. someone with rights) by saying that unfertilized eggs don't have rights.","Steeeeve","275124","Again, I don't know what an ""unsupported"" belief is. There is no doubt that people who are against abortion have a belief that is just as valid as yours (in terms of support). Furthermore, the argument was again ""don't impose your beliefs on me"" as an argument. You jumped when while chemist was failing to argue why it was a good idea. You can't change the claim after the fact and get mad at me for it. correct.","abortion-euthanization","02:16 PM","abortion-debates","153"

For example, if the improbable happened and the pro-life group could somehow present solid evidence that a soul exists in an early fetus, would you accept a changed standard?","abortion-euthanization","02:50 PM","abortion-debates","155"
"07-23-2007","10129",11,"Another opinion","275130","You seem to be avoiding a debate about the purpose of rights and the rationality about which beings get rights - at least in this thread. Well, I made my own claim around when I first started my involvement in this thread that it was unsupported views, not views in general that I opposed having imposed on me. So you agree that your stance is just the same as the slaveholders stance in choosing who gets to have rights. As for the slaveholders stance of not letting any debate affect their views, neither you nor I hold a similar stance.","Steeeeve","275146","Yes, and I already stated why. And I'm supposed to know this how? I am not a huge fan of people jumping in a debate but at least when you do so state if you wish to modify the others argument. No I do not agree.","abortion-euthanization","04:04 PM","abortion-debates","156"

The fetus is a person...that is a belief. You claim the fetus is not a person...that too is a belief. Both of us will not be able to provide anything substantive that will prove to the other their view is true.","abortion-euthanization","04:09 PM","abortion-debates","157"

What is important is the significance we attach to it in that we attach rights to that term. So, the question that we are really addressing is ""what beings get rights and why?"". We, on the pro-choice side, can address that question with reasons (not just proclamations) that can then be supported in debate. If you can support your claims of zygotes getting rights by something more than proclamations, then we could get a real debate going. Though this debate would have no bearing on law, it could have bearing on our own stances. Though I suspect that I have already heard most of the limited arguements that you have presented, if there is something new and compelling then you might even succeed in changing my mind. Either way, our debate might influence potential readers to decide one way or the other.","abortion-euthanization","04:42 PM","abortion-debates","158"

And your reasoning in the first part doesn't make much sense. What a person is is not unimportant but it is important that persons are the ones who get rights. You then say it matters what beings get rights...well you already partly answered that question as persons do. It is therefore important to know what a person is.","abortion-euthanization","04:59 PM","abortion-debates","159"

It would be neceesary to consider the relationship between a woman having a soul and a fetus having a soul and what relative weight should be given to each. Would the fetus now have an automatic override over the womans soul? What consequnces does destroying the physical carrier of the fetal soul have on the fetal soul? Are souls all of eqal merit? Many questions would arise. Including of course is it just to give one soul a virtual full priority over another?","abortion-euthanization","05:21 PM","abortion-debates","161"

This would actually make for an interesting discussion in itself but would, of course, be a big digression from the main point of this thread. Either way, I am glad to hear that you are indeed open to being held accountable to positions that are determined by reasoned debate. It is what I had assumed you thought since (1) it made sense and (2) you didn't seem to claim otherwise in the posts that I read.","abortion-euthanization","05:58 PM","abortion-debates","164"
"07-23-2007","10129",11,"Another opinion","275167","We have been through this before, with the debate about morals in the ""Why is it wrong to kill other people?"" thread. There, I was adding more and more layers of reasons to your challenges. In the end, you dropped the ball and quit the debate. You have yet to prove that our arguements are ultimately based on proclamations. The only way to know for sure is to actually HOLD the debate to its conclusion. The term ""person"" is just a word - six letters. It is a word that different people attach to different levels of human development because the criteria that people place for ""person"" is different for different viewpoints (just like you place the criteria that the human egg needs to be fertilized). The IMPORTANCE to that word is that we attach consequecnes to that term - such as rights. If no consequences were attached to that word, then why would that word be significant? You could call a mouse a person and nobody would care. We care because that word carries consequences - rights being the most important of these. It then makes sense to me to address the issue that IS important (i.e. rights and the detailed criteria of who gets them) as opposed to the six letter word ""person"". If you say, it is ""people"" who get them, then you go around in circles. You need to address the main point - rights.","Steeeeve","275184","Actually I went on vacation and never wanted to get back into it because it was a lot of reading. what good are rights if they are not attached to people?","abortion-euthanization","06:30 PM","abortion-debates","165"
