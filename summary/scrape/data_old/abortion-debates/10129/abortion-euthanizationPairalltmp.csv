Not by any definition and not by any reasonable method of science and not by pretty much anything other than a bias on your own self.","Sigma","275985","It is not a human being in the sense of having existence in actuality . There is no one in there .","abortion-euthanization","abortion-debates","206","03:55 PM"

"","08-01-2007","10129","Steeeeve","275990","Only if you define human being the way you feel you want to.","Sigma","275994","Dictionary definitions are not adequate when discussing fine philosophical points, Steve. They are not human beings in the sense of having someone in there . One can reasonably believe there is a significant difference in the moral status between an two week pregnancy and a newborn. If there is a signicant moral difference it is perfectly consistent to defend the right to acquire an abortion yet oppose infanticide. It is reasonable to hinge that difference upon the existence in actuality of an individual.","abortion-euthanization","abortion-debates","211","04:21 PM"

You seem to mistake my attempt to clarify the discussion with an argument in and of itself. It is not. Your objection seems to be based solely on your inability to make unjustified proclamations using this criteria. It should provide no barrier if you have a reasoned argument.","abortion-euthanization","abortion-debates","215","04:33 PM"

Actually it almost seems less reasonable to use your definition as at least mine was developed prior to the abortion controversy making it a little less biased. I have no one of knowing if your random definition was developed to exclude who you want to exclude. That is a good question. What group to you refer to? Was is the standard that these reasons have to live up to is another question I think is important.","abortion-euthanization","abortion-debates","221","11:47 AM"

My criteria is hardly random. Consciousness, individuality, is a basic component in what it means to be a human being. Whatever group I am a part of that you would exclude from having rights. ""Reasonableness"" is an adequate criteria for this point, I suppose. What reasonable reason would you have to exclude any group, that I may happen to be a part of, from having equal rights?","abortion-euthanization","abortion-debates","222","12:30 PM"
