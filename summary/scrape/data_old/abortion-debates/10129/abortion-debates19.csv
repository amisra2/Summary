Just tell us if the Ice Man - a dead body containing human DNA is to be considered a human BEING will all the rights and privileges of a Human Being. A simple answer will clarify your position. Personally I am not willing to call a dead body a human being - perhaps you are. But if so AND if a zygote is a human being then so is a dead zygote and abortion makes no difference. Think this over carefully its vital to your argument.","Steeeeve","276895","a dead human being's body has no rights.","abortion-euthanization","12:58 PM","abortion-debates","271"
"08-07-2007","10129",19,"Sigma","276885","Well, certainly my criteria is more reasonable in the sense that it does not include entities such as the dead and human vegetables, which most reasonable people would agree are qualitatively different from you or I in some way. It also follows the ""common sense"" feeling that what makes us unique has more to do with our mind, brain, consciousness, etc instead of just our DNA. Your criteria has more problems it must try to explain away than mine in the philosophical arena.","Steeeeve","276896","If mind and brain make up who you are then why does a monkey not get more rights then a mouse (this is assuming you give rights based on what is a human being).","abortion-euthanization","01:00 PM","abortion-debates","272"
"08-07-2007","10129",19,"Another opinion","276893","I do think there is an absolute reality out there. For example, I am nearly 100% certain that the sun, earth and moon are real, that the computer in front of me is real, etc. There was a whole discussion on this in the ""Metaphysical Discussions"" thread many months back. However, where morality is concerned, that I do not view as an absolute because it is something invented by people and, since people vary, the ideal morality would vary. You may claim that the morality you hold, which comes from your religion, is the one that is absolutely true, but that is just an unsupported claim on your part. Slaveholders also made unsupported claims and were just as certain that they were right as you are. Since human psychology varies, the things they value ultimately have some variety. When people make decisions, they make them mainly out of a combination of reasoning and value judgements - a combination of logic and emotion. When logic is flawed, rational debate can correct that. For example, the claims of slaveholders that blacks were inherently inferior was flawed - rational debate and demonstration could have corrected that (if it were given a chance). I'm not sure what you are calling circular reasoning. If it is merely the fact that there is no one fixed answer and that it ultimately comes down to a value judgement, then you are forgetting that the main goal of the rational debate is to eliminate the bogus reasoning that surrounds that value judgmenet - where it is the bogus reasoning that has historically been a main cause of attrocities. I keep saying over and over and over that I would demonstrate to them that blacks are not inherently inferior to whites. Do you claim that is an impossible task? When children argue with each other back and forth just yelling out their views ""It's A"", ""No, it's B"", ""No, it's A"", ""No, it's B""... that is irrational. Rational arguements address the concerns of the other side and support ones own views with evidence or at least with more reasoning. Are you claiming that southerners would have been able to support their view of the inferiority of blacks in full rational debate without resorting to irrational arguements such as ""because I say so"" or ""because such and such a quotation from the Bible says so""? If so, then lets hold a mock debate to see. I would ask them why red haired people have less rights. You give people too little credit for having some level of rationality. You had mentioned the Lincoln/Douglas debates, so I Googled those and started reading the first one. All I read over many pages were debates about politics, not about essence. I did not read a debate which came down to ""Why do you think blacks should be slaves"" and then questioned in detail each point brought up, including challenges to Biblical quotations. If you know of such a detailed arguement, please post a link to it. By full rational debate, I do not mean a debate that just skims along the surface of the issue. I mean one that delves fully into it, questioning everything without fear of political reprecusssions. Rational debate, from the example of the Lincoln/Douglas debate which you mentioned, did not delve nearly deep enough. If you know of a particular debate which did delve deeply into the theoretical basis of why blacks were slaves, then please point me to it. Thn we are going in circles because pro-choice people would say that a right to ones own body is a natural right. You disagree, but neither side is absolutely right in their claim since THERE ARE NO ABSOLUTELY DEFINED NATURAL RIGHTS. If you claim there are, prove it. That is why I am holding up rational debate as the ideal. I know fully well that people are stubborn and will not submit to rational debate if it is inconvenient for them. I just claim that a culture where rational debate is held up as the ideal and is stressed will be more likely for people to participate in rational debate as compared to a culture where rational debate is not considered important. My arguements are supported by evidence and I could counter their points. Their evidence was only superficial and would have been knocked down if full debate was allowed. Again, please point me to a specific location, either in the Lincoln/Douglas debates or otherwise, where you thought that the southerners presented arguements which could not have been knocked down with rational debate. All of the arguements I have ever read about from them could easily have been knocked down, but it is possible that there is an arguement I missed. If so, then point that out. Otherwise, your claim that rational debate could not have countered their argument is groundless.","Steeeeve","276908","And yours are unsupported too. No, and you can't show that it would. I disagree, bogus beliefs cause this. Circular reasoning is when you can't prove anything and so you refer to a previously made claim to prove that same claim. It also can be called begging the question. It is only possible if you change a belief like I said. For this to be true you have to state that one belief is wrong and another is right. Considering all thoughts come down to beliefs then a debate on the reasonings from those beliefs would be fairly easy for me to win. Again, the only way to challenge a belief is to indicate there is a right one that they do not adhere to (other than showing they are inconsistent in their own belief). Because they believe red haired people have less rights. It all comes down to beliefs or circular reasoning like I said. You can't argue with the conclusion based upon that fundamental belief. There were 7 debates for one thing. Slavery was the main issue in all of these (and a large part the expansion of it). I'm not gonna give you a history lesson on the debates over slavery. If you don't believe they happened then you are a fool. We had a civil war over it. I know where this is going. You will say they didn't do it ""rationally"" enough because the techniques now are so infallible. Of course they thought the same thing at the time and thus hindsight being 20/20. Nevertheless, full out debates were had all over the place during the time period and yet things were never solved. This was actually the first link on google when searching for said debates: http://zorak.monmouth.edu/~afam/abolition2.html We could even look at the congress debates on slavery...or even in England when they were debating the issue. I can't remember the movie off the top of my head but it came out this year and referred to slavery being ended in England and the consistent debate they had over it. Not being able to prove, once again, does not mean they don't exist. I maintain they exist and that is purely a matter of faith. And yet my point is rational debate is fine but you aren't going to convince someone they are wrong on a point unless you can provide a right answer. Your rational for abortion is not going to fail in any logic because it is reasonable based on your unsupported beliefs. This is true for me as well. The only way to address this would then to show why your beliefs are wrong and mine are not...or visa versa. You don't get that this doesn't matter. Evidence to support your own reasoning that comes from a belief does you no good when the other has another belief. You are flawed in your thinking here because you belief a slaveholder is starting from the same premise as you when they clearly are not. This premise is supported only by belief (or circular reasoning which is not really a support) and thus you would have to convince someone the belief is wrong and there is no evidence that could do that....just claims and perhaps showing of those claims. I believe whites are inherently inferior to blacks and therefore they can be slaves. I'd like to see you knock down that claim with your so called evidence. Don't try to ask for reasons because I stated it was a belief. I already told you all things come down to a belief (if consistent).","abortion-euthanization","01:38 PM","abortion-debates","275"
"08-07-2007","10129",19,"chemist99a","276898","I note your careful use of language to distinguish the body from the human being.

"08-07-2007","10129",19,"Another opinion","276924","I have presented no bogus reasoning, as the slaveholders had. You are seriously claiming that there are no rational arguement that can show that blacks are not inherently inferior to whites? You mean like claiming that zygotes are people who deserve rights? All thoughts do not come down to beliefs. Unless you want to get into metaphysical discussions, the thought that the ground is hard, or the sun is hot today, is not a belief - it is an observation. Observations are not the same thing as beliefs. Noticing that the sun is hot is an observation. Thinking that the hot sun is moved around by the God Apollo is a belief. All I am asking for from you is one reason which the slaveholders gave which could not have been countered by rational debate (again, rational debate forcing the slaveholders to give layers of reasons or evidence behind their answers). Is this too much to ask of you? You are the one claiming that rational debate could not have resolved this issue. If this is what you claim, then show why. The ultimate decision on abortion may come down to a value judgement, but many arguements could be made along the way. For example, one could hold a rational debate about when mental existence starts. Since souls are a sort of supernatural mental existence, it would be required of you to present arguements and evidence about why you think souls exist and why you think they would start at conception. I could show scientific evidence on my side of the arguement. In arguing whether mental existence is important, we could address the issue of the consequences of a non-mentally existing being being killed vs a mentally existing being being killed. There would be many points to address. There are no absolute answers either way, but there are many levels of reasoning that people go through to get to an answer. Rational debate can help eliminate some of the bogus paths that people take and which have often led to attrocities or injust actions. If slaveholders were able to stick with a rational debate, then they would have had to concede that blacks were not inherently inferior. I just do not know why you do not see this. Well, first I would ask you why you think whites are inherently inferior to blacks. You made the claim and used it to reduce rights. The responsibility is yours to show that whites are inferior. Go ahead... I will then counter your arguements.","Steeeeve","276926","I still maintain some of the reasoning the slaveholders had was no bogus either. Seems irrelevant though. Not without addressing the belief. If one is inherently considered inferior then what good are you to say someone is smarter? That isn't really a consideration. How is the circular? It is a belief..ends there. No, that is still a belief. You assume many thing when claiming the sun is hot one of which is your observation is actually the reality. whites have white skin blacks don't. That is one reason. I also didn't claim ""rational debate"" couldn't solve the issue. I said it couldn't solve the issue unless you are willing to address the belief as false. No, it is the incorrect belief that causes atrocities. Your arguments on abortion already have an inherent bias in what we should be looking for and debating. I disagree with all of those as I don't feel mental existence is important at all and I don't think consequences are important in decided that matter either. Because inherent means ""built-in"". How would you ever rationally convince someone that another is not inherently different unless you change that fundamental belief. The only way to do this is to say there is another belief that is true. To do that (in the slaveholder case) you'd have to use the argument Lincoln did. Because it is my belief that it is so. It is inherent. I like how you asked for reasons when I told you what I'd say.","abortion-euthanization","02:51 PM","abortion-debates","280"

"08-07-2007","10129",19,"Another opinion","276943","There are objective tests to see whether one person is smarter than another. If a black person did better on such a test than a white person, that would show that, in that particular case, the black person was smarter. If someone has a belief that cannot be nudged by arguements and evidence from reality, then that is not rational. I am talking about rational arguements all this time. The question of how to deal with irrational people is another one all together. Where irrational people are concerned, who stubornly stick to their views no matter what arguement is presented, then one can only deal with them by a fight of numbers in a Democracy. I am not so naive as to think that everyone will comply with rational arguement. However, as I stated before, a society which holds rational argument in high esteem will have a lot more people willing to be subject to rational arguement. If that is what you call a belief, then you are so ungrounded in reality that I don't know how to proceed with a discussion with you. There are some things that all or nearly all people accept as true - one being that the sun is hot. Bottom line is that there are SOME things that are accepted by nearly everyone as true because there is such extraordinary evidence of it being true. If you think that evidence doesn't matter, then we might as well end this discussion right now and call it a day since we really have no common base to argue from. That doesn't say WHY you would deprive blacks of rights - where a reason is needed if they would want to hold a rational debate. Also, if you claim that it is by skin color alone, then if blacks would paint their faces white or chemically lighten their skin, then they would have gotten equal rights. Conversely, when whites tan their faces, their rights get reduced because the skin gets darker. Of course you have to address their belief in the inferiority of blacks as false, but you address it with rational debate. If you just tell them that their belief is false because your view is right, then you will be unconvincing unless you can fully support why your view is right while showing how theirs is wrong. All of this also assumes, of course, that they are willing to listen to you and be subject to the outcome of the debate which slave holders were unwilling to do. Here, we are talking idealized case of slaveholders that actually were willing to hold themselves accountable to rational debate. What reasons DO you think are important in deciding the matter? All I hear from you are proclamations that it is wrong, not specifically why apart from more proclamations (it is a person). When I try to nail you down on what specifically a person is - precise definition (ex. human DNA, start of growth process, etc.) - and why those characteristics are important then you often sidestep the question. By ""built-in"", I mean characteristics that are inherited and are not dependent upon environment. For example, you could compare blacks vs whites who grew up under the same socio-economic circumstances - ex. compare their test scores on a variety of capabilities. You can't hold a full rational debate without reasons. I am not saying just any debate would convince them, I am saying that full rational debate would convince them, which, as I have stated before, would require reasons and evidence to back up statements. If you don't want to give reasons, then you are not holding a full rational debate.","Steeeeve","276948","My point was intelligence has nothing to do with an inherent level of thinking. I'd say it is true as well but I can't prove that it is true. Its called faith. Like I said, we all have it. What do you mean that doesn't say why? Don't tell me the reasons have to convince you...you just asked for a reason. You can attempt to address a belief with rational debate but you aren't gonna get very far with the things you gave me because none of those address the belief. You seem to think there has to be a reason behind a belief when this is impossible without creating circular reasoning. So if the belief is simply that blacks are inferior to whites then you can't address reasons why they are because it is a belief in and of itself. A human being is what is important and it is important because human beings have inherent natural rights. Is this a proclamation? yes. But I see nothing wrong with this. Doesn't exactly matter what you want it to mean. I used inherent meaning that is the starting point. Why would I care about test scores if I never made a claim regarding intelligence? When we were talking about it earlier you could never give me reasons for why mental existence is important or should be valued. Whenever you tried it ended up going to empathy and then circled back around to mental existence and once again made circular arguments. If you want to talk about the slavery issue then you have to look beyond just the few reasons you can easily refute as these were merely cover-ups reasons for how they felt (an inherent bias against blacks). The claims of intelligence lacking in blacks was actually backed up with evidence at the time (scientific evidence) so it seems even that claim would be hard for you to refute since they would in fact have evidence. As a note, I blocked chemist so don't take non-responses to his posts as meaning anything.","abortion-euthanization","05:04 PM","abortion-debates","284"
