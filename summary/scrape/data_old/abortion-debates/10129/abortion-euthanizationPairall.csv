"08-29-2007",1,"10129","410","Another opinion","281431","Well, I would say it was a mixture. The southern states would never have separated in the first place if they did not feel that the institution of slavery was threatened with the election of Lincoln. However, Lincoln did not engage the Northern states in the Civil War to begin with for slavery but in order to keep the Union intact. The Emancipation Proclamation came later. Before the war, Lincoln had no plans to free all slaves, much as he probably personally would have liked that. However, the Southerners knew that it would have just been a matter of time before slavery was outlawed by force of upcoming anti-slave majority states. The issues are all interwoven. Either way, you cannot extract the issue of slavery as the main underlying cause of the conflict between the states which erupted into the Civil War. Without a conflict about slavery, the Civil War never would have happened.","Steeeeve","281436","http://www.civilwar.vt.edu/jr/jr.html The guy in that link would smack you if you said it was about anything other than slavery.

Before the Civil War, Lincoln had no intention of freeing all slaves. His view was that he would use his power to prevent any new slave-permitting states to arise from the US territories so that, eventually, the government would be composed of mainly anti-slave states and, thus, slavery would eventually expire. However, this was enough for the Southern states to separate. Then, Lincoln went to war to keep them from seceding and to keep the Union together. It is interesting to note that, even with the Emancipation Proclamation, he did not have any slaves freed that were in Union states. Also, at the beginning of the war, Lincoln prohibited his generals from freeing slaves even in captured territories. Much of this was gleaned from : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln_on_slavery as well as various Discovery Channel and History Channel programs, which were also developed by experts. So, the bottom line is that slavery was the main underlying cause of the civil war since the states would never have seceeded if not for the political threat to the institution of slavery posed by Lincoln's election, but that the war itself was started because of that secession not directly because of slavery. One can say that the main in-direct cause of the civil war was slavery but the main direct cause was keeping the union together. Alternatively, there are various statements that can be made: 1. The southern states would never have seceded if not for the threat to slavery. 2. The civil war would never have happened if not for the secession. So, if the Southern states would have kept their slaves and just complained in the official political process, without secession, then slavery as an institution would have continued for at least some decades to come before an anti-slave political state majority would have voted it off.","abortion-euthanization","02:59 PM","abortion-debates","354"

It is not a question of either slavery causing the war or secession causing the war - both were causes. The conflict about slavery and the urgency to that conflict that arose with the election of Lincoln made the South feel like they had to secede if they wanted to keep the institution of slavery, where that secession in turn sparked the civil war. I do not agree with you that the north would have started a civil war if the south had never seceded. Certainly, if the south had not seceded at that point in time, then some years or decades later, there would have eventually been an anti-slave majority of states that could have tried to vote out slavery. It is feasable that the southern states would have precipitated a conflict then. I doubt that they would have taken the voting-out of slavery lying down. However, other alternatives might have happened. Namely, it is possible that, knowing that slavery would eventually be outlawed, the South might have rearranged their system more toward the sharecropper system that happened later (which wasn't all that much worse for the planters financially). It is hard to predict at this point what would have happened. Was a conflict over slavery always destined to lead to war? Unknown.","abortion-euthanization","11:19 AM","abortion-debates","248"

The ideas of Lincoln and the Republican party were ideas that would have kept the elimination of slavery legal, from a constitutional sense, but their ideas still would have led to the elimination of slavery. It is certainly possible that the South would have precipitated a war or at least a secession (that would lead the north to war) to avoid giving up the lucrative enterprise of slavery. If they hadn't seceded after Lincoln's election then they might well have seceded years or decades later once his anti-new-slave-state policies produced anti-slave political majorities. On the other hand, perhaps those decades would have led to a re-assessment of their organization of slaves and a reorganization into something more akin to the sharecropper system. I admit that it would be unlikely that the South would have taken the elimination of slavery lying down and most likely would have seceded once the North made any strong attempt at getting rid of slavery. Also, I doubt that the North would have allowed slavery to continue indefinitely. There was just too much momentum against it and we were one of the only countries left that still supported it. So, I would say that you are probably right that the issue of slavery was destined to lead to war, but, still, that is far from absolutely certain since there could have been alternative paths.","abortion-euthanization","11:19 AM","abortion-debates","264"
