"08-23-2007","10129",24,"None","None","None","richbrmly","280125","Your saying the current data is wrong, that the details given by medical personnel are wrong regarding the reasoning for aborting because you disagree with they're assessment of the patients medical issues. They are going to need your risk assessment criteria, so they know when they can issue opinions to their patient. Its that important.","abortion-euthanization","03:43 PM","abortion-debates","349"
"08-23-2007","10129",24,"richbrmly","280074","Oh, thank your being pro-choice Oh yes, I understand the life of the host has no meaning. But the actual chance taken is 200%.....She actually counts with the birth.","Steeeeve","280129","If not allowing people to have abortions is pro-choice then I'm all for it! I disagree but you seem to think the unborn is a person.","abortion-euthanization","03:50 PM","abortion-debates","350"
"08-23-2007","10129",24,"Phyllis","280108","Doing so would simply be a waste of time. I, for one, do not have a problem specifying where our rights come from. That is the historical view of rights in the United States, and it is the only rational explanation for the existence of rights. What say you?","Steeeeve","280130","Well it would be nice to get an answer...but if not what do I care. Yeah, I'd agree that rights come from a creator. If they don't then they are abstract creations made from ones self and thus you believe rights are at their core a selfish invention.","abortion-euthanization","03:52 PM","abortion-debates","351"

Because if you where not counting the fetus, we are not at odds.","abortion-euthanization","04:15 PM","abortion-debates","353"
"08-23-2007","10129",24,"Phyllis","280139","You have solidified your membership into the club of sophists. It is unbecoming to try and use sophisticated reasoning in order to call somebody something they are not. In this case you simply change the ordinary meaning of a very common phrase. If you want to define pro-choice as opposition to abortion, then I will happily oblige and call myself pro-choice. Percentages are neither necessary nor realistic when examining whether maternal life is at risk. Each case where this would be a factor is unique and is best evaluated on its own merits. No, I base my conclusions on a fair evaluation of reliable evidence. In this instance, my data comes from Guttmacher Institute, an organization that advocates pro-choice policies. Of course, you do not seem to be able to make the very obvious distinction between abortions provided for health reasons, on the one hand, and abortions provided for preserving maternal life on the other. These are separate and distinct, and it is a fact that more abortions are performed for the purpose of maternal health (broadly defined, of course) than are performed for the purpose of saving the mother's life. The facts compel my conclusion. You don't like that conclusion, so you ignore the facts and resort to sophistry. This is ridiculous.","richbrmly","280143","Then we agree??","abortion-euthanization","04:45 PM","abortion-debates","355"

Do I want abortion to used for birth control? no... As you say, I agree things need to be looked at on a case by case bases; thats what choice is unless there are criteria. But again I agree, I can't set the criteria as well. You and I surely don't want the deaths back. Be it 10,000 or 80,000. Clearly we agree.

And of course 1/2 give or take of the voters would be disqualified if relevant issues come up to a vote.
