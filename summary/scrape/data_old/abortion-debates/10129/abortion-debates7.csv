"07-19-2007","10129",7,"Another opinion","274470","You are oversimplifying the issue and, therefore, missing the main point. The abolitionists drew support to their cause because of people's sympathy for the suffering of the slaves, not because of some abstract rule. The book ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" was a major draw for the abolitionist movement. Why? Was it because of an abstract concept? No, it was because people saw this good man being treated so badly. They had SYMPATHY for his SUFFERING. THAT and the similar treatment of thousands upon thousands of slaves was seen as a bad consequence of slavery and the loss of most rights. Also, you have not answered my question: What do you think are the consequences of an early fetus - prior to having mental existence - having no rights?","Steeeeve","274480","The idea of suffering is irrelevant. The point was they were people suffering. They saw them as humans not sub-humans as was claimed by science and by a majority of the people. Even the slaves not suffering were treated well were still wronged because they are people. This doesn't address the idea I getting at though. Chemist seems to think the current ""convention"" is how we determine who a person is and if the convention says you are not a person then you can't have someone else's will imposed on you. So if the ""convention"" at the time was blacks were not people (sub human rather) then the argument chemist99 uses should be just as valid. This argument being ""don't impose your beliefs on others"". Oddly enough this argument was used during this time period. I'm not going to address something that will change the subject I wish to debate right now. You can PM me the question or start a new topic.","abortion-euthanization","03:11 PM","abortion-debates","91"
"07-19-2007","10129",7,"chemist99a","274483","No I told you that with regard to fetal development the point at which personhood emerges cannot be scientifically and objectively defined. Namely that science can only provide information to guide a moral conclusion and cannot substitute for that moral conclusion. The science that does exist indicates to me that an early fetus is NOT a person but I do not claim proof of my conclusion. Likewise others may conclude otherwise without it upsetting me. What will and does upset me is that many of those that conclude a feteus is a person (without proof mind you) would choose to force their own subjective conclusion on me and make me act against my own best moral judgement. There is little to distinguish a system of forced abortion vs forced pregnancy - either situation is a moral black hole. Note well that the issues are VERY different. Jews and other minorities are clearly and indisputibly persons in an objective sense. They are well past the fuzzy border that the abotrion issue must deal with. And they are capable of declaring themselves to be persons. Not so the fetus.","Steeeeve","274484","But you can't even say whites are persons so to force me to believe that whites are persons is not letting me act in my own best moral judgment. Your position is still inconsistent! Not at the time they weren't. Are you saying they were right to claim blacks were not persons at the time?","abortion-euthanization","03:44 PM","abortion-debates","93"
"07-19-2007","10129",7,"Another opinion","274488","How can you say that the idea of suffering is irrelevant when that was the main thing that drove the abolitionist movement? If all of the slaves had truly been happy with their lot, then I doubt that movement would have gained any ground. If only a small percentage would have been happy with their lot, that would not have changed the fact that the great majority weren't. Even if all the slaves had been happy except one, then abolitionists might have dwelled on the suffering of that one. Bottom line was that it was the empathy with their suffering which drove the actions of the abolitionists, not an abstract concept of whether or not they are ""officially"" people. The definition of who gets rights and who doesn't isn't based on arbitrary decisions. One needs to have REASONS behind it. The reasons that were given for enslaving black people in the 19th century were based on faulty assumptions - i.e. that they were like children who needed to be governed, etc. Those reasons were easily proven wrong. Without valid reasons, the premise behind slavery had no rational basis to stand on and could easily have been knocked down were a rational debate allowed. Of course, though rational debate certainly played a role in the growing abolitionist movement, it had little effect on the power structure of the South which financially needed the slave labor and ostracized anyone who tried to use reason to argue against it. Rationality based on fully demonstratable evidence had no role in slavery - it was exploitation of the weak by the powerful, pure and simple. My main point is that setting a convention of who gets rights and who doesn't is not bad if it is based on demonstratable reasons and fully explored rational arguement - not power politics or arbitrary definitions.","Steeeeve","274535","Because suffering alone means nothing. A suffering ant does not lead to a civil war. They are people...that is the main point. Blacks are people too and as such are given the same rights as whites. This was the main idea that drove the movement. The actions done against slaves were wrong because people have rights. Surely an enslaved robot is not going to spark a freedom movement. irrelevant to the point being discussed. These were not wrong ""facts"" at the time. The assumptions were also not easily proven wrong but are obviously generally accepted today. And abortion has no ""demonstratable"" reasons and no rational argument better than that of slavery considering the times. It seems easy to say they are wrong now but at the time they were just considered sub-human. They created a false definition of what a human is and it excluded blacks (by definition). Likewise we see that a definition has been arbitrary created which conventionally excludes the unborn. So at the time the convention stated blacks were not worthy of being a person. So using the logic chemist presented he would have to say that one should not impose their beliefs on others and thus slavery was ok at that point in time. As an aside, if person is so ""arbitrary"" (as you put it) then calling blacks non-persons is not out of the realm of what that word could mean...afterall, it is arbitrary. The rest of the post is irrelevant to the discussion in my opinion.","abortion-euthanization","07:19 PM","abortion-debates","95"

"07-20-2007","10129",7,"chemist99a","274550","The fact that the personhood status of a fetus cannot be established objectively and clearly by science in no way negates the concept that persons exist. Nor is the classification arbitrary which would imply that random assignment to the category is appropriate. Please review the concepts of fuzzy logic before you continue this losing argument. And consider the other aspect of slavery here. The woman carrying the fetus is a person (lets assume) what right do YOU have to place her in slavery to her fetus for 9 months. Even if the fetus is a full blown person he/she does not have the rights to enslave another person.","Steeeeve","274579","I think ""person"" is very easy to define...you are the one that seems to think it has no real meaning. You still miss the point that your logic is inconsistent. I'll try to make it clear for you here: Your argument goes like this: ""Don't push your beliefs on others regarding abortion"" From here we have a few choices: 1) You assume the fetus is not a person 2) it is irrelevant whether or not the fetus is a person 3) the current general level of thinking is the fetus is not a person With option 1 you have assumed something you can't prove or show to be true. If I believe the fetus is a person then it is perfectly reasonable for me to fight for that persons rights. This would be the same as a slave owner believing the slave is not a person but an anti-slavery supporter feeling it is and thus fighting for the rights of the slave. With option 2 you find it irrelevant whether or not it is a person. If this is the case then you violate your own statement because if it is a person you have pushed beliefs onto that person and in this case endangers their life. The third option is that we go with the so called ""convention"". This is a bad argument because the convention in the 1800s was that blacks were sub-human and as such have no rights and are property. Your logic would have to conclude here that the slave owners and supporters of slavery were correct in arguing that others shouldn't impose their belief system on them. An argument (once again) used during this time period and an argument that has proved over and over again to be wrong. I challenge you to find me a case in past where a convention declaring something nonhuman to be beneficial. An odd definition of slavery as there is no one the woman is enslaved to. Nevertheless at the expense of another life it is justified. Even more so if the woman is a direct result of her situation.","abortion-euthanization","12:18 AM","abortion-debates","99"

"07-20-2007","10129",7,"chemist99a","274585","Yes isn't it! If the fetus is not a person and yet you insist the fetus must be carried to term you are enslaving the woman - she is required to surrender her rights to those you attribute to the fetus. If the fetus IS a person then that person is given absolute priority over the interests and needs of the woman carrying it - that amounts to enslavement by the fetus should the woman NOT consent to the arrangement. If the woman has sex and becomes pregnant then you propose to force her to carry the fetus (a piece of tissue) till it is born. In that case you (or society) are the enslaver. If the fetus is a person then the fetus (through society is the enslaver. Either way the woman is enslaved as she cannot by law exert her own rights regarding her own life.","Steeeeve","274617","If enslaving means ""do not have the right to kill"" then the woman is enslaved. I'd say this is the most messed up and insulting definition of slavery I've ever heard. I guess I am enslaved by you as I cannot kill you by law. And if the fetus is a person and the woman is allowed to exert her own will then that would mean (by your warped definition) that the unborn is enslaved to the woman. Now do you wish to get back to my main point? I am beginning to get the feeling you are ignoring the blatant points I address.","abortion-euthanization","10:04 AM","abortion-debates","102"
