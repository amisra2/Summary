They are not human beings in the sense of having someone in there . One can reasonably believe there is a significant difference in the moral status between an two week pregnancy and a newborn. If there is a signicant moral difference it is perfectly consistent to defend the right to acquire an abortion yet oppose infanticide. It is reasonable to hinge that difference upon the existence in actuality of an individual.","abortion-euthanization","04:21 PM","abortion-debates","211"
"08-01-2007","10129",15,"Another opinion","275993","If someone is trying to convince you that all the members of their group should be treated differently than all the members of another group, then they would have to show a few things: 1) How are the groups inherently different, supporting that with evidence 2) How is this difference relevant to rights, supporting that with debatable reasons 3) Show that ALL the member of the other group have that difference and NONE of your members have that difference. People who believed in slavery would not be able to present the needed arguements. One cannot have empathy for a being with no mental existence. As for animals, I admit that I am not being entirely fair to them in their treatment. Part of it is that they are the Other, where I have a clear bias for our species. If we were to give animals the same rights as humans, then we would die off as a species.","Steeeeve","275997","Oh really? 1) whites and blacks have different colored skin 2) Only people with white skin are people and only people get rights 3) All white people are indeed white. (note these are abridged to prove a point) These arguments aren't exactly ones you would support. But more importantly why does one have to state why a difference is relevant to rights? This seems like an immaterial point unless you have a previously set standard for who has rights (and in this case human rights). For example, lets take abortion... 1) the fetus/unborn is not born and does not have a fully functional brain. 2) Only people with ""mental existence"" get rights. We don't need to go further as you made this claim below and it is baseless. For a person that doesn't like baseless claims you sure did make one. So what if your species dies? Other than your unfounded bias is there any reason?","abortion-euthanization","04:26 PM","abortion-debates","212"

You seem to mistake my attempt to clarify the discussion with an argument in and of itself. It is not. Your objection seems to be based solely on your inability to make unjustified proclamations using this criteria. It should provide no barrier if you have a reasoned argument.","abortion-euthanization","04:33 PM","abortion-debates","215"

"08-02-2007","10129",15,"Another opinion","276008","Explain your reasons for only white skinned people getting rights. Remember, point 2 was supposed to present debatable reasons. I am waiting for those hypothetical debatable reasons. As for point 2, we would have to explore why rights are given to begin with. I would again argue that empathy drives much of our reasoning in terms of people getting rights to begin with, and empathy is what is most often appealed to when people are deprived of rights. I would also discuss the differences in consequences if a mentally existing being is deprived of rights vs a non-mentally existing life-form. I would further question your arguement in asking why a zygote should get rights and not an unfertilized egg - in questioning YOUR reasons for rights. There are many points to debate. Empathy is feeling for another by trying to imagine their suffering, experiences, emotions, etc. One cannot empathize with a rock, because a rock does not suffer, have experiences, emotions, etc. (Children, such as those with ""pet rocks"", might imagine a personality in that rock, but that is not real.) An early fetus also cannot suffer, have experiences, emotions, etc. I also mentioned the reason of lack of reciprocity. Animals cannot control their behavior. Therefore, they do not get the same rights. Children and severely mentally incapacitated people also do not get the same rights. However, we do not allow ourselves to kill them, as we do many animals. I already admitted to not being fully fair to animals because of that bias for my species. That's partly self defense.","Steeeeve","276075","before we even start we are going down a bad path here with Sigma joining in which lends itself to mixing up arguments. I'd note that my responses are directed towards here and I'd hope you wouldn't respond changing the frame of the debate but rather only respond to my responses to you. Otherwise it will get ugly and confusing. I'd ask that you first state why you should get rights. If you use anything involving empathy then I feel obligated to warn you that you will have come full circle and will be using circular reasoning to make a conclusion. Again, this is a circular reason. How do you have empathy for something you don't feel is a person? You seem to think there is a 3 part test. But to pass that three part test you claim empathy have to be the factor...and round and round we go. Isn't ""mental existence"" being a factor just an unsupported proclamation? Have we even decided how empathy is a main factor for rights (as I disagree it is)? Do you believe marriage is a right by the way? This too is an unsupported proclamation. An ant can feel pain but are you feeling empathy towards it? And again unsupported by anything. I will state that I don't find anything wrong with proclamations but you have stated you do and there have been at least 3 in this post alone.","abortion-euthanization","10:23 AM","abortion-debates","219"

Actually it almost seems less reasonable to use your definition as at least mine was developed prior to the abortion controversy making it a little less biased.
