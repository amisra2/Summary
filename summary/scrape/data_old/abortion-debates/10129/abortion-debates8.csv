"07-20-2007","10129",8,"Another opinion","274621","It was empathy with the slaves that drove the abolitionist movement which was a major cause of the civil war. You are trying to take empathy out of the picture, which is disingenuous on your part. Do you claim that empathy played no role? Yes, it was not ants that were suffering but people but it was not an abstract arbitrary assignment of a definition of person that drove the abolitionist movement - it was empathy with beings like oneself. As for enslaved robots, currently there is no developed artificial intelligence but many a science fiction movie has been based on the concept of rights of sentient robots. It may be an issue our society may someday need to face decades from now. Until they are sentient, their rights are irrelevant - just as with a pre-mentally existing fetuses. Perhaps I am misunderstanding you, but the assumptions I claim were made by 19th century supporters of Slavery were indeed largely disprovable (appart from the ones that came from a distorted Christian faith). These assumptions included the Southerners claim that blacks were like children who needed supervision, and they were automatically inferior because of their race. A simply proof could have been to let a sample group be brought up and live under the same condition as whites and see what comes of it. I have very little doubt that the result would have run counter to the Southerner's claims. Do you think otherwise? Also, what assumptions do you say are ""obviously generally accepted today""? Perhaps I missed something since I don't know what you are referring to. What one defines as the minimum definition of ""person"" is arbitrary: - I (and presumably chemist99a) define person as human with some level of mind - You define a person as a living entity with a complete set of human DNA that has started the growth process (which are the main characteristics of a zygote) - Someone else might define a person as an unfertilized egg or a sperm cell which, after all, are human, alive, and have the potential to become one of us - they simply lack the second set of DNA to get the process started. Your definition is as arbitrary as anyone elses. Lastly, I do not think that chemist99a chose to define the convention of who gets rights by randomly choosing it. I am sure that he had reasons behind choosing that convention. If you think that the convention he presents is arbitrary and that yours is not, then why don't the two of you compare the rational arguements behind the chosen convention and then debate those rational arguements instead of continuing an essentially silly arguement about a definition of ""person"". If, by the word ""person"", you both mean a human with rights, then doesn't it make sense to address the question of the reasons behind having rights?","Steeeeve","274675","Again, the key is that they were people. empathy and suffering are all irrelevant if people is not part of the equation. The major cause of the civil war was slavery and the movement was not ""suffering is bad""...it was ""these are people and as such have rights"". Those rights happen to include not getting whipped but the abolitionists were not just concerned with those that suffered in this manner. Ones that were treated well were still included. Reading an abolitionist book or text would reveal they cherished people as people and were not just against whipping or what have you. Again this is irrelevant when looking at the common belief at the time. But as a fact, your ""science"" even felt that blacks were subhuman and in general they were considered subhuman just by definition alone. This is similar to how you define ""person"" today and define it so that the fetus is left out. And one could define it as only people who's skin is white. This was what was done during this time period. Now, when you do this and someone says ""don't push your beliefs on me"", doesn't this present a bad argument? Of course one can push their beliefs on you because they feel you are violating another just like if I arbitrary claimed you weren't a person then society can push its beliefs on me and force me not to hurt you. I really don't understand how one could defend the argument ""don't push your beliefs on me"" with abortion yet deny the argument was false for slavery. It is the same argument with the same backing and reasoning behind it. The whole point of this argument is to show that the argument ""don't push your beliefs on me"" is an idiotic one and lends itself to comparison with slavery. The rest of what you want to talk about is going to have to responded to in another topic of PM because I've told you once I'm sticking with this one argument for now.","abortion-euthanization","03:24 PM","abortion-debates","106"
"07-20-2007","10129",8,"chemist99a","274639","Nope You would be enslaved by me only if I were say granted the right by law to move into your body and take whatever resources I wanted or needed without your consent and without your being able to do anything about it. Sounds a lot like enslavement to me. Its not slavery in the plantation sense perhaps but it is ENSLAVEMENT of the woman in the sense that here concerns and needs and wants etc are totally subordinated to a piece of tissue undergoing a developmental program which MIGHT eventaully result in another human being. What you are really asking for is HYPER-rights for that peiece of tissue - far beyond those granted persons in our society.","Steeeeve","274677","Of course this isn't the case with pregnancy. I don't recall ever seeing an unborn child meticulously plan a way to suck up resources and move into a womb without consent. Seems the only consent possible is if the woman chose to have sex. of course I believe the fetus to be a human and as such a person. Therefore this statement is rather worthless to me.","abortion-euthanization","03:29 PM","abortion-debates","107"
"07-20-2007","10129",8,"chemist99a","274728","If you establish the principle that choice should be eliminated then your freedom to treat your fetus as a person my vanish tomorrow. Its the give gov an inch and it will take a mile principle. If foreced pregnancy is an option, then so is forced abortion.","Phyllis","274732","Let's examine how this logic runs. Once you establish the principle that the people should govern themselves, the people might use that principle to do something bad. If you give the people an inch, then they will take a mile. Is this, then, an argument against democracy? The people should not govern themselves because they might do something bad? That argument doesn't fly. As I have already shown, there is not one stinking example where the people of the United States have ever established forced abortions. Rather, they have traditionally frowned upon abortion to the degree that they outlawed it in most circumstances. They continue to frown upon it to this degree by the way.","abortion-euthanization","11:36 PM","abortion-debates","111"

"07-21-2007","10129",8,"Another opinion","274681","The ""science"" of the time was as shoddy as some of the ID ""science"" is now. In other words, the conclusions were made first and the evidence was selectively chosen to fit those conclusions. I don't claim that science has always been objective. Science is conducted by humans who are fallible. Science is much more objective on social issues today, though not yet ideally so, than it was in the 19th century. The people who supported slavery made no great efforts at demonstrating evidence to support their reasons for slavery - they just made unsupported assumptions. If you claimed I wasn't a person (in the sense that I was not deserving of rights), then you would have to present excellent, well supported reasons for why I would not be deserving of certain rights. If your reasons were valid (for ex., if I were a child or mentally incapacitated), then your reasons would win out and my freedoms would be limited. If your reasons were bogus, then you would have no justification in imposing your views on me in trying to take my rights away. Society often pushes its beliefs on people in the form of laws, but those laws have to be based on rational reasons. Otherwise, as with slavery, the society can become very unfair in its treatment of others. You just claim that it should because of the proclamation that ""zygote = person"" and that ""person = someone with rights"" - proclamations unsupported by reasoned arguement. The bottom line is that society has every right to push its views on people if those views are based on rational reasons. In allowing the institution of slavery, it pushed its views on African Americans but those views were not based on rational reasons but on bogus reasons that were easily disproven if given the chance. Lastly, how would you like it if someone came around claiming that unfertilized eggs are people and should therefore have rights and that you are acting like a slaveholder in refusing them rights.","Steeeeve","274736","Monday morning quarterbacking haha, and they probably thought the same thing at the time. The supporters of slavery made a vast general assumption and made conclusions on that. Their assumption was blacks aren't people. From there it is only logical to say they have no rights as people do. Your assumption is that the fetus is not a person. It is irrelevant how you got there....the point is that it is a huge assumption and every ""logical"" and ""reasonable"" step you took to get to that assumption was based on even more assumptions. They had plenty of rational reasons for slavery. It was free labor that benefited their society and way of life. The problem comes in when you are talking about free labor as a person. Likewise with abortion you have rational reasons for it but at the expense of killing another person it is not worth it. So I'd modify you statement and claim that when society rejects calling a human a person then it results in unfair treatment of others. This has been the case throughout history and I question why one thinks it will change now. And irrelevant to my point. My reason for pushing my belief is that no innocent person should be put to death. How do you disprove ""blacks are not people"" when you can offer me not definite definition of person? I'd disagree with them. But again, you missed the entire point of my argument and continue to try and substitute something else in its place. With the unfertilized egg person I would not say ""don't push your beliefs on me"". That is the argument that I say you can never use as it make no sense and we always do push beliefs on others.","abortion-euthanization","12:45 AM","abortion-debates","114"

"07-21-2007","10129",8,"chemist99a","274639","Nope You would be enslaved by me only if I were say granted the right by law to move into your body and take whatever resources I wanted or needed without your consent and without your being able to do anything about it. You would have to structure your life and times about my needs and wants rather than your own, and if you did otherwise the government would coercively act to either punish you or force your compliance. This would be the case even if my ""demands"" exceeded your physiological capacities and resulted in serious prehaps chronically fatal damage to your body. It would be the case even if I was the result of your being raped by a mentally defective terrorist who you would never have voluntarily mated with. It would be the case even if I was ancephalic with no chance of being a functional human even after birth. In other words I the fetus would reign supreme and unchallenged and be supported in my claims by the power of the state including the use of force. Sounds a lot like enslavement to me.

"07-21-2007","10129",8,"chemist99a","274783","Thats not relevant if the pregnancy itself is required to be completed by the state - namely the woman is denied the choice to abort the fetus. Its about 9 months of enslavement if the choice to terminate is not available. Enslavement is enslavement regardless of the period.","Steeeeve","274787","Of course by enslavement you really mean not allowed to kill another person. Still the most messed and insulting definition of slavery I've ever heard. And if you believe the fetus is just a ""piece of tissue"" then I would be enslaved as well as I am not allowed to have my heart (a tissue) removed (thus killing me) as it is against the law.

"07-21-2007","10129",8,"chemist99a","274786","Actually NO our laws and constitution carry weight beyond the mob blowing in the wind. Minorities have protected rights. The majority for example could not legally decide to kill off say those with blue eyes. Neither is the state allowed to establish any law respecting the establishment of a religion. The debate over personhood is profoundly a religious issue.","Steeeeve","274788","Guess you weren't a big fan of James Madison or the federalists papers. Just to quote one part of the federalist papers: ""Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legislative power. It only supposes that the power of the people is superior to both "". This among numerous other quotes to assure the people have the ultimate power. You really hate to see a rookie mistake like that. Unfortunately they can. Murder and genocide are not two things forbidden by the constitution. There are laws against it but a majority could change those laws. Welcome to democracy. I'd also like to find where the constitution says a state is not allowed to establish any law respecting religion. Seems the word ""Congress"" is pretty specific. Nevertheless, you will pull out the BS that is the 14th amendment and somehow conclude that it means the 1st amendment applies to the states. You then have to show beyond that how ""personhood"" is even a religious issue that can't be decided on. If it is the laws against murder are out the window!","abortion-euthanization","12:11 PM","abortion-debates","120"
