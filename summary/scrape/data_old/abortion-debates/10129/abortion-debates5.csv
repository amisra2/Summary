Meaning for instance... if after amniocentesis it is discovered that the child has down syndrome or if it is discovered the child will be born with no legs the previously hoping and willing parents decide to abort for this reason. Do pro abortion people support this?","Shooterandproud","274157","Somewhat. First of all, I am not pro-abortion, I'm pro choice. Second, I think you at least owe it to your child to not have any defects that can cause a huge negative impact on their lives. It is the same child to me whether you decide to abort the body and have another child or not. Even if you abort the defective body, most will try to make another, and to me it is the same child if it is done before it mentally exists.","abortion-euthanization","12:46 AM","abortion-debates","66"
"07-18-2007","10129",5,"chloe","273705","I wonder if those who would use abortion to euthanize certain babies would also support euthanization of others who live outside of the womb.","Shooterandproud","274158","As a matter of fact, I do. As would most people with any sense at all.","abortion-euthanization","12:48 AM","abortion-debates","67"
"07-18-2007","10129",5,"None","None","None","chemist99a","274217","Indeed I also believe that people should have the right to voluntarily end their lives if they choose. There are perfectly good reasons in some cases to do so in order to avoid needless suffering.","abortion-euthanization","10:46 AM","abortion-debates","68"
"07-18-2007","10129",5,"chemist99a","274135","I do not need to prove my position. My belief is sufficient here to guide my own actions. You cannot offer scientific proof that a fetus IS a person. Absent such proof you can only claim a personal belief that a fetus is a person. I am willing to let you apply your unprovable belief to your fetus but only so long as you allow me to apply mine to my fetus. Should you fail to accord me my freedoms I shall do everything in my power to regain them. I am perfectly capable of claiming that I am a person. When have you seen a fetus do the same? And there is such a convention in the form of the laws of the United States of America where the issue of personhood arises rather often. The law is a codification of the conventions which bind societies together and its only partially objective.","Steeeeve","274253","likewise I'll do everything in my power to regain the freedoms for the ones you claim are not persons. Surely you aren't stating the laws are the correct way of thinking. No only needs to bring up slave laws to prove this.","abortion-euthanization","02:14 PM","abortion-debates","69"
"07-18-2007","10129",5,"chemist99a","274155","!! And the forced pregnancy policy in Romaina worked just fine too did it not - at least according to the policy makers/enforcers? And the rounding up and killing policy of the NAZIs also worked just fine did it not - nearly got rid of the jews after all and that was the goal! The policy of slavery in the old south worked well too for the plantation owners. The US policy in Iraq also serves its purposes just fine - the purposes of a certain group of individuals.","Steeeeve","274254","Interesting how you think the convention or law is right now but this was not the case with slavery. This would indicate that the law is not exactly the determining factor and as such you can't claim a convention as the means to deciding things (assuming there is one). You have not responded to anything I have said regarding slavery and how your reasoning is surprisingly like those who owned slaves. The idea of one ""not forcing your beliefs on me"" was a primary argument for the south. Amazing how history repeats itself.","abortion-euthanization","02:21 PM","abortion-debates","70"

I guess in your world the mentally handicapped are on a sinking ship.","abortion-euthanization","02:23 PM","abortion-debates","71"
"07-18-2007","10129",5,"chemist99a","274156","Would it? I am sure that Mr. Gonzales and the current USPOTUS would find a way to make it work. Majority rule after all!","Steeeeve","274256","If you aren't for majority rule then what are you for? Dictatorship? Minority rule? Monarchy? no rule? I mean, give me something here.","abortion-euthanization","02:26 PM","abortion-debates","72"

Either you object to abortion or you don't. Don't play semantics with regard to disability in order to try to catch prochoicers out. It won't wash. I support elective abortion up to viability, and after viability health/life of mother and severe abnormality of fetus (severe abnormality meaning those conditions that are recognised today as being so severe as to require a late term abortion). Don't like it? ... TOUGH! And Phyllis ... its a good idea to let prochoicers answer posts for themselves rather than you imposing what you think are our opinions. If you continue to post prochoicers opinions for them, then you might as well just stand in the mirror and argue with yourself.","abortion-euthanization","04:36 PM","abortion-debates","73"
"07-18-2007","10129",5,"chemist99a","274307","OK try the US Constitution. We are a representative democratic republic not a majority rule nation.","Steeeeve","274312","which is pretty much the same thing. The majority of representatives get their way. The representatives are elected by a majority. Being overally picky about it gets you no where...we pretty much have a majority rules nation. And we still haven't settled the question about how you think you can impose your belief on others but I can't. The ""convention"" idea didn't work, the idea that you aren't imposing a belief on others didn't work, so what is next?","abortion-euthanization","05:25 PM","abortion-debates","75"
