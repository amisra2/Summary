"07-21-2007","10129",9,"Another opinion","274790","Well, lets compare. At the time, among other things, some scientists made various claims about the inferiority of blacks. Certain abolitionists and many blacks certainly would have disputed that claim but their arguements were not heard - the conclusion was reached first and evidence was fabricated to fit those conclusions. What social biases are you claiming exist in Science now that are unsupportable and lead to negative social impacts? I'll be waiting for your answer..... I'll take your arguement to the extreme in order to prove a point: Your assumption is that the unfertilized egg is not a person. It is irrelevant how you got there....the point is that it is a huge assumption and every ""logical"" and ""reasonable"" step you took to get to that assumption was based on even more assumptions. Does that mean that we should grant rights to unfertilized human eggs because some can also choose to call those people? If we don't want our definitions and their consequences to be arbitrary, we need to provide REASONS. If you claim that reasons are not important, then what makes you an authority in deciding that unfertilized eggs should not be considered people?.... You are not calling an unfertilized egg a person so your view would result in unfair treatment of those people. What justification do you have for that? Many billions of unfertilized eggs are put to death each year. They are also considered innocent people by those who would choose to call them people. You are restricting the rights of those unfertilized eggs. Shame on you... Coming back to my real views, I have offered my own definition of a person many times and I'll offer it to you again. A person is a human being with at least some level of mind / mental existence. African Americans certainly fit that definition. My main point is that the convention has to be based on reasoned arguement. If there was a law outlawing contraception and forcing all women to become pregnant as often as possible to support that ""right to life"" of the unfertilized egg, then I am sure that you would be saying ""don't push your beliefs on me"". If you deny that, then would you sit back and accept those laws being pushed on you? I doubt it.","Steeeeve","274791","Again, this is monday morning quarterbacking...you just can't do that when looking at an argument. It appears you missed what my argument was. The argument was that logic an reason alone do no good in the situation of determining what a person is. The slave holders made assumptions and now you make assumptions. Either way they are worthless. So when one says ""ohhhh, well my assumptions are right so therefore you can't push your belief of what a person is on me"" then I laugh because the slave holders felt their assumptions were right to. It appears you are strawmanning this one. Strawman again... How dare you try to push your belief on what a person is to me! Only blacks are people in my view. I'm going to go enslave some whites now. What is wrong with that sarcastic remark I just typed? Well, you can push beliefs on me and not just because my position is irrational. It is only irrational to you much like your view is irrational to me. Again, you can't claim rational logic is needed to ""push a view"" when the entire idea is based on belief anyway (ie no rational logic). And there can be no reasoned argument. You can't reason your way to saying I am a person and the fetus is not without having massive assumptions that have no basis in any logic. We all know what assume does... There is a difference between saying ""don't push your beliefs on me"" and ""you are wrong"". You can push your beliefs but that doesn't make your beliefs right.","abortion-euthanization","12:47 PM","abortion-debates","122"
"07-21-2007","10129",9,"None","None","None","chemist99a","274801","You forget the main issue. Its not whether or not a fetus is a person, it how to reconcile the rights of individuals in a very diverse population where the beliefs surrounding this issue are extremely variable. How does one balance the different beliefs and concepts in a way which allows individuals to remain free in their beliefs while at the same time sustaining minimal conflict in society. Fortunately we have so far elected to allow considerable personal freedom in making choices as to whether abortion is allowed or not. We do not treat feti as if they were persons, but anyone can treat their own fetus as if it is should they so choose. Its a personal decision - one which one set of believers should not and cannot be allowed to make a collective decison for everyone.","abortion-euthanization","01:28 PM","abortion-debates","123"
"07-21-2007","10129",9,"Phyllis","274805","I suppose by ""we"" you really mean ""five elitist judges,"" because that is who really has elected to allow such considerable personal freedom in this area. Traditionally, no one was afforded this freedom. This of course is your personal opinion informed by your arbitrary political and moral philosophy. I think the only fair way to resolve the debate is to allow a democratic vote on what the policy should be. If you were so confident that your view is the one that most people hold to, then you would not be afraid to have a democratic vote on it. Disallowing such a vote often times is the only way an elitist can ensure that their elite opinion is the one that prevails. This is in fact what happened when the Supreme Court took the issue. Seven (and then five) elitists decided a policy that is not supported by a large fraction of the population.","chemist99a","274807","Well for starters the decision is the result of a long chain of due process at the top of which sits the supreme court. We have that system for a reason and its the process we have all signed on to accept. The courts are there from the local levels all the way to the supremes to make LEGAL judgements in instances where conflicts arise. Its the way we do it. Would you prefer critical issues to be decided by say 5 randomly selected citizens on a catch as catch can basis? Not going to happen. We decide constitutional issues through the courts not by popular vote except is very very strange circumstances. A democratic vote means that if 51% of the people agree to enslave the other 49% then it will be done. The US is not a democracy in that sense and hopefully it will never be. If I were confident that the majority would not trample the rights of the minority I would accept a popular vote. But we are not a democracy. Its entirely possible the 51% of the voters would decide to sacrifice the other 49% to its interest. Fortunately we have a constitution and employ a multiple layer system of checks and balances to keep such things from being very likely. Your proposal violates the entire set of principles upon which our government and our freedoms rest. I think I will keep what we have rather than give in to mobocracy.","abortion-euthanization","01:57 PM","abortion-debates","128"
"07-21-2007","10129",9,"Another opinion","274802","Of course we have every right to judge the past, why shouldn't we have that right? (Assuming that is what you mean by Monday morning quarterbacking). The only reason I commented on the scientific views of that century where race was concerned was because you had compared 19th century science to current science as if they were the same. I was demonstrating how they were different. Do you have any particular arguements against my claims or do you deny me the right to even make any judgements, even though you had made judgements? Somehow we need to say when rights start. Do you think this should be chosen arbitrarily? If not, then when should it be chosen to start? You say conception but what do you base those views on? For example, why not at an unfertilized egg or at the start of mental existence? I could just as easily claim that your restriction of rights to fertilized eggs (as opposed to unfertilized ones) is the same type of arguement as slaveholders used since you take it upon yourself to define personhood and rights. I am only throwing your arguements back at you. It is not a strawman since I am not distorting your views. I am presenting a parrallel view to prove a point. Namely, your arguements sound to us just like the sample hypothetical arguements I presented would sound to you. The structure of the arguements is identical. If you can present a view of rights that is fully supportable, where the great majority of people would agree with that reasoning, then you could indeed impose your views on others since those views would be supportable. For example, it is a supportable arguement that children should have fewer rights than adults. Certainly, children, particularly teenagers, think that such a view is being forced on them, but nearly all people would agree that such a rule is just since there are good reasons behind the rule. You have yet to explain your detailed reasons as to why zygotes should have rights. Until you explain your reasons, it is just as arbitrary as saying that an unfertilized egg should have rights. Wait a minute. I thought that your arguement was against people saying ""Don't push your beliefs on me"". If people supported the rights of unfertilized eggs enough to force a ban on contraception and to force pregnancy, would you not think and argue that they were trying to force their views on you? How is that different than pro-choice supporters claiming that pro-life people are trying to force their views on us in banning early abortion for those women who want abortions?","Steeeeve","274810","I deny that you could say ""their science was wrong and mine is right"" considering you could easily look back 50yrs and determine the science now to be wrong. As it relates to the discussion I am having you could only compare level of thinking at the time for it to be relevant. I'm really not sure how you aren't getting my argument. I'm using slaveholders as an example to show the idea that ""you can't push your beliefs on me"" isn't a valid argument. You are distorting my views actually. Fully supportable by what? Hopefully you aren't trying to convince me that the ""great majority"" of people is what determines if an argument is valid. The ""great majority"" of people in the US thought blacks were inferior. That is because it isn't my point. For the second time....no. strawman. I most admit I'm getting a little annoyed because the argument I was addressing is not the argument you seem to want to address. My only claim right now is that using the argument ""you can't push your beliefs on me"" is an invalid one and happens to be one the slaveholders used. The two are remarkably similar because they both start with the premise that the slave/unborn is not a person. In both cases it is a position that has to be used because otherwise you would be pushing your beliefs on another and violating your own argument. The idea of saying ""well the slave holders were wrong"" doesn't really get you anywhere because they didn't believe they were wrong (much like you don't now) and there is not logical/reasonable position that is a standard of measurement for determining they were wrong and you are right....at least that you believe.","abortion-euthanization","02:39 PM","abortion-debates","129"

If the fetus is a person then you have basically determined it to be less worthy than yourself and as such you discriminate. This brings up the same question I asked earlier...if it doesn't matter if you are a person or not then obviously I should decide for myself what to do with you. If I choose to hurt you then no big deal...it was my own personal choice.","abortion-euthanization","02:45 PM","abortion-debates","130"

Of course we have built it some instances where more than 51% of the vote is needed. It could be said that 90% of the people could vote to enslave 10% of the people though.","abortion-euthanization","03:18 PM","abortion-debates","133"
"07-21-2007","10129",9,"Another opinion","274814","I criticize the scientific assumptions about blacks from the 19th century because science, by its very definition, is supposed to be objective and base its conclusions on evidence, not on pre-determined conclusions. Science is limited by human imperfection - limited imagination, limits on computational power, and biases, among other things. One cannot blame scientists for their limited imagination and computational power and, indeed, these are things that do progress with time. However, one can blame scientists for bias. It is not as if the idea of blacks being just as equally human as whites never occurred to anyone. It was not lack of imagination. It was bias, pure and simple. I have no doubt that there are limitations to our scientific understanding today that are based on lack of imagination. However, for the most part, bias has been screened out of our scientific process much more so than it was in the 19th century. If you believe that is not the case, then present examples of clear bias in current scientific thinking. We are not saying that ""you can't push your beliefs on me"" applies to all situations. We would say more specifically, ""you can't push your unsupported beliefs on me"". If something is imposed on us by law, there need to be fully debated reasons presented to us for imposing that law. Do you deny that? Do you think laws need no justified reasoned debate? Do you deny that our laws are based on reasons or do you think they are arbitrary and based purely on one group pushing its rights on another? In contrast, we, on the pro-choice, are full of rational arguements for our cause and would welcome a full, detailed debate. However, this country having as a major tennet the separation of Church and State, the reasons presented by the pro-life side could not be something along the lines of ""because my religious leader tells me so"". Also, proclamations are not reasons. Saying ""a zygote deserves rights"" is a proclamation. One needs to define the reasons underneath that - which is why I keep repeating this point. This is not a strawman arguement since I am not distorting your views. If you claim that I am distorting your views, then please explain in detail HOW I am distorting them with this comparison.","Steeeeve","274816","I will not present examples as I have repeatedly said I don't wish to move away from my primary discussion. The point is only that the science at the time was accepted and helped enforce the ""convention"" at the time. As such, I don't believe ""conventions"" are a good form of evaluation as they have obviously been proven wrong and the ones today could just as easily be proven wrong. Legally speaking you can make a law for whatever reason you want. As a matter of principal I think you can never say you have no right to push beliefs on others (into law) as you certainly should be able to push what is right into law. Either way, if I believe the fetus is a person then you would be pushing beliefs onto that person and violating your own standard oddly. I believe all are derived from ethical and moral principals and by definition have to be. But if someone is to disagree with the law then obviously the belief is pushed onto him. You can't even provide me with a non-arbitrary definition of person. How on each can you get a rational argument from that? Look at this argument of defining person: ""Only those with black skin are people"". Why is this argument wrong? The only way it could be wrong is if there is some objective definition of person that refutes this. You would certainly say ""well you need a rational reason for that definition""...but how is a definition irrational to begin with? It just is what it is. Short of begging the question you can't claim that to be wrong unless another standard (a true one) exists. Your assumption on what the first amendment means is wrong and any look at history would show this. I'd have a hard time believing that the framers said you have to exclude any religious thought from your mind when deciding laws. In other words, people of faith are disallowed from being members of government. Because in the argument I am presenting now I never claimed the fetus should get rights. I merely said you can't say ""don't force your beliefs on me"". You inadvertently did something which I feel many folks do in the course of a debate. You added an argument never presented and choose to refute that argument instead of the one addressed. As such you presented a strawman argument.","abortion-euthanization","03:39 PM","abortion-debates","134"
