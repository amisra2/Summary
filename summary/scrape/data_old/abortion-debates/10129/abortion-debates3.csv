If the answer is no then the power of a mother to terminate the childs life doesn't hold any value. I mean even at 1 minute old the child does not really have the power to make any choice. Does the mother still get to decide the fault of the childs life? In all of these cases life wins out over power of attorney (which is basically what that is). This brings me back to the original point that if the fetus were to be a person then the choice cannot be made to terminate its life unless you believe you can impose beliefs on others and in this case impose the belief that some aren't worthy of life.","chemist99a","273865","You should. It happens from time to time and you might get ground up in the gears if the delineations are not relatively clear. And yes states DO have the right to terminate ""life"" under certain circumstances. Although say OCD is not one of them. Did you consider a person like TS ""menatlly ill"" or brain dead. As to a 1 minute old child the mother does not retain right to arbitrarily terminate life, however the mother does retain decision making rights including many in the medical area. I believe it goes so far as to terminate in the case of severe fatal anencephaly. If the fetus is a person then it has the rights of a person, however there is nothing to establish that say a first trimester fetus IS IN FACT a person. Indeed it can never be established in any objective way when personhood arrives on the scene - its a social construct not a scientific one. Only personhood and personhood conferred on a competent person at that permits a full range of independent decision making. All societies have persons who are not competent to make the necessary decisions for themselves and yet those decisions must be made! You cannot simply refuse to deal with the problem in the social arena.","abortion-euthanization","07:07 PM","abortion-debates","31"

I'd like to know how you think rights are afforded to born persons if not by a belief system or at the very least a belief in natural rights. Either way, that doesn't address the point I had. If I can't impose my beliefs on you then who you are to impose your belief of me not hurting chemist99a?","chemist99a","273871","Loosely defined a nuclear weapon is a firecracker and a rock is the GOD of the universe. Man is a social animal and such animals operate by social constructs which are ""loosely defined"" conventions known to and accepted by the community in which they apply. Complex societies like our own have both codified legal systems as well as less formal constructs. Natural rights per se are a convenient non-scientific way to describe these rather arbitrary and capricious conventional frameworks. Your example is coercive since it enforces your will upon me and the conventions say you have not this right. The case of choice in abortion is NOT coercive since no force is employed against a person by those who choose abortion and likewise by those who choose to have a child. The convention says that I am person have the right to defend myself and make my own decisions. You wish to violtate that convention by your attack. I am a person note, not a non-person. Conventionally for the first two trimesters a fetus is NOT a person and does not have the rights of a person.

If it is the law then this argument is terrible as slavery was once a law and I'd have a hard time believing you'd defend that one as it is convention. The situations are not parallel within our existing social construct.","Steeeeve","273882","Ok, but the point that I am addressing was the idea one can't impose beliefs on others. Given the assumption that the fetus is a person then abortion would be making a choice for another just like me saying you can't have an abortion or someone else saying I can't hurt you. Therefore, it is often that we impose our choice and belief on others and as such this argument is useless. The claim I was addressing is here: And I just say that it would be unjust and unfair of you to force metaphysical belief systems of your own which constitute religious belief upon your follows who may believe otherwise than you. Get pregnant and treat your fetus as a full person if you wish, nobody will force you to abort it. Let others follow their own beliefs differing or the same. Otherwise you attempt to obtain justice by doing injustice. And if society swings and decides the fetus is a person then you would agree that abortion is wrong? There certainly is not a consensus in society now about whether or not the unborn is a person. But if the assumption is that the fetus is a person then wouldn't this be you forcing your will onto another person? What convention? I know of no such convention. Furthermore, for someone who says they shouldn't impose beliefs you certainly are imposing one that says the fetus is not a person. If one believes the fetus is a person then wouldn't they want the same rights for that person? And wouldn't it be ok to impose a belief in that case? You are imposing a belief in your statement anyway. You say I should go with these ""conventions"" which are nothing more than your beliefs. The parallel is there. I can't go around claiming you are not a person and therefore I can hurt you. Why? Because a belief system is imposed on me and I have live with that.","abortion-euthanization","08:08 PM","abortion-debates","35"

Was it not just a few posts ago that you said that ""it can never be established in any objective way"" when one becomes a person? It is interesting, then, that in this post you are now sure, to the degree of being absolutely sure, that you are, in fact, a person. Now, if it is true that personhood can never be objectively established, then your contention that you are a person is subjective. And since you base your right to defend yourself in the fact that you are a person, then I will simply disagree that you are a person. Since it is apparently a matter of subjectivity, then you are in no position to argue that my assessment is incorrect. You may not like or even agree with my assessment, but you certainly cannot call me wrong.","abortion-euthanization","08:14 PM","abortion-debates","36"

You certainly could go around saying that a person is a non-person, but that would not make you correct. You would be objectively incorrect. On the other hand, if words and meanings were subjective, then you most certainly could go around calling persons non-persons and you would be correct. That is the problem of subjectivity, and it is interesting to me that people who apparently advocate subjectivity turn around and make absolute claims.","abortion-euthanization","08:20 PM","abortion-debates","40"
"07-16-2007","10129",3,"chemist99a","273885","Sorry but I will not admit that assumption into the argument since its not testable in any known way. Support your assumption if you wish. I will also not admit that a decapitated body hooked up to a machine (no head) is a person - will you. Nor will I admit the assumption that a rock is a human being. Since IF a fetus is NOT a person holds (and you will be hard pressed to shake that assumption) then you cannot logically compare interactions between persons with interactions between persons and feti. Personhood is a social convention. By convention I am clearly a person. Such conventions are not at there core objective statements of fact and usually cannot be made to be so. On the other hand my claim is only to conventional personhood. You may attempt to prove I am not a person if you choose. Sure you do. Stand in the street and render harm to a rock and little is likely to come of it. You will not trangress the convention. Shoot the mayor dead center in the head at a televised news conference and you are likely to be punished for it - unless of course your lawyer is a great deal more sophisticated than the argument you are attempting here.","Steeeeve","273899","So are you imposing your belief on me that I can't make a law saying a fetus is a human? What if I say you are not a person. Is there anyway you can say I am wrong without imposing a belief on me? Can you prove the fetus is not a person? What is this so called convention anyway? I have never heard of such a convention. Either way, isn't that imposing a belief on me? Oh, well the convention says the fetus is a person and deserves rights. I'm sure you have no problem with me saying this because of course it my belief on what the convention is and you wouldn't want to impose your belief on me.","abortion-euthanization","09:33 PM","abortion-debates","42"

Having it accepted as a convention is quite another thing since you cannot by yourself establish and enforce it. The current law (or codified convention) is that a fetus is not accorded codified personhood in and of itself and such rights as it has descend from its owner more or less entirely up till the beginning of the third trimester where it begins to acquire increasing personhood and becomes of interest to society. If you wish to BELIEVE that I am not a person thats fine by me. Its when you act on that be(lief and come up against the codified conventions of society that you will find difficulties staring you in the face. Scientifically no more than you can prove the opposite. Its not a question subject to scientific proof. Its determined by somewhat arbitrary social constructs including formally codified conventions (law) ,by informal social conventions, and of course by personal belief of the person responsible for the fetus. No conventions (ie laws) do you require that you BELIEVE the law and the current convention DOES NOT impose any belief on you prior to the third trimester since you can choose what status to assign to your fetus should you have one. The current convention (law) in the US non-coercive up to that point. However thats NOT what the current convention says. Read Rowe vs Wade for the codification itself. And Roe vs Wade does NOT impose a belief on you, and it does not impose your beliefs on others either. Basically it leaves the choices up to the mother until the end of the second trimester. Your problem is that you wish others to follow your beliefs and are willing to coerce them if necessary rather than accord them the rights to their own beliefs in a non-coercive context.","abortion-euthanization","09:52 AM","abortion-debates","43"
"07-17-2007","10129",3,"None","None","None","Another opinion","273999","As I see it, there are a few issues that have to be addressed in detail here: 1. Why should we limit when people make important life-critical decisions for others? My own answer is that I would not like others to make decisions for me since the decisions they make may not coincide with my desires and would cause me to suffer. It is a matter of personal freedom and desire to control the most critical aspects of my own life. Without freedom, I would personally suffer. My moral approach is reciprocal, so I would expect others to have the same freedoms. 2. When is it permissible for others to make life-critical decisions for someone and why? If I were unable to make the decision for myself, someone capable and well-intentioned would have to make the decision for me. This situation applies to childhood, when a trusted adult (usually the parent) makes the life-critical decision since the child lacks the knowledge or reasoning ability to make the decision for him/herself. Freedom is automatically given up, but it is assumed that the decision maker is both capable and trustworthy (making the decision based on what they would think is best for the child). This is also true for someone who is incapacitated - in a coma, or unable to communicate, etc. However, once again, the freedom of making one's own decision is given up but there is an assumption that the decisionmaker is trustworthy and capable. 3. What are the consequences of a bad decision imposed on another? I would say that the chief consequence is suffering. The consequences of a bad decision could cause physical suffering or death when that physical suffering or death is not desired. It could also cause psychological suffering, where a decision made for someone to, say, amputate a leg or have brain surgery could leave the person disabled and limited for the rest of their life. 4. How is this relevant to late stage fetuses? The assumption is that, sometime around the third trimester, fetuses start gaining mental abilities to suffer, feel emotion, pain, fear, etc. It may not know the concepts of life, suffering, etc. but it can still suffer, may have an instinctual will to live, etc. One can feel empathy toward that late stage fetus. 5. Is this relevant to early stage fetuses? With early stage fetuses, there is no suffering, no sense of pain, no desire to live, no desire for freedom of decision, no mental existence whatsoever. The relevant consequences that would apply to adults or children that would have a bad decision made for them do not apply for those early stage fetuses/embryos. The only real consequence is one of potential - in that the early fetus could grow up into someone who does feel a will to live, can suffer, etc. However, that is not yet real - it lies in the future. The only negative is the taking away of that potential.","abortion-euthanization","10:41 AM","abortion-debates","44"
"07-17-2007","10129",3,"None","None","None","chemist99a","274008","I largely agree but its not possible to objectify such ideas as suffering or even pain for a fetus. We have to proceed only semi-objectively meaning that science can provide us with information but not necessarily with a clear conclusion. You cannot take social convention and judgment out of the loop on this type of issue by sciencing it. You MAY be allbe to narrow the belt of uncertainty but you cannot eliminate it to produce a bright line conclusion which is science based. Other than that caution we are in substantial agreement.","abortion-euthanization","12:23 PM","abortion-debates","45"
