"07-23-2007","10129",12,"chemist99a","275172","If you have two persons interacting is it at all reasonable to give only one of them rights? Is it reasonable to set one persons rights and privileges to be superior to the other? Is any such assignment of superior rights to the most dependent of the two persons reasonable? If person A is living withing person B then does that exclude person B from evicting person A? If not then how can you claim to respect person Bs right to their own life? In effect that enslaves person B to the interests of person A. Does person A have this right?","Steeeeve","275185","Again, you use enslave here in a disturbing way. Nevertheless, if their rights are ""equal' then person B has no right to kill person A and visa versa. It seems you are the one that favors putting some people above others.","abortion-euthanization","06:34 PM","abortion-debates","166"
"07-23-2007","10129",12,"Another opinion","275177","As for the place where I first stated my own views, in my early post #94, I stated: ""My main point is that setting a convention of who gets rights and who doesn't is not bad if it is based on demonstratable reasons and fully explored rational arguement - not power politics or arbitrary definitions."". Before that, I had indeed mainly discussed a side issue to what you considered the main point (the issue of whether one can impose a view on another), so the topic did not come up between us.","Steeeeve","275186","and I didn't want to discuss that in this thread but you murdered the point I was addressing which was rather annoying.","abortion-euthanization","06:37 PM","abortion-debates","167"

It makes me wonder if that term is often misused by pro-life proponents... I did go off on a side issue in my first post in this thread but it was a side issue that WAS quite relevant to the main point. Besides, it did not kill your main point since we did continue to debate it. In retrospect, it probably would have made sense to clear things up with chemist99a earlier (in finding out whether it is ALL views that he would not be subjected to or only unsupported views). That would have cleared up some misunderstandings and let the debate get farther along.","abortion-euthanization","07:24 PM","abortion-debates","170"
"07-23-2007","10129",12,"Another opinion","275193","It seems that we might be talking about different approaches as to how we define ""person"": 1) Choose to define ""person"" by some independent criteria that has nothing to do with rights. Then just automatically attach rights to that independent definition of ""person"". 2) Aknowledge that the term ""person"" is a term whose importance lies in assigning rights to it. Therefore, it cannot be chosen arbitrarily but must be chosen to be consistent with reasons we have in assigning rights to begin with. 3) We also have the choice that we can define person one way, and then don't automatically asign rights to that defined ""person"" but for different reasons. I, personally, would go with either choice 2 or 3, since ultimately, for me, the REASONS behind when we assign rights and when we don't are important, not the term ""person"" itself. I suspect that you are going with choice 1.","Steeeeve","275210","1 and 2 are the same.","abortion-euthanization","09:11 PM","abortion-debates","172"
"07-23-2007","10129",12,"chemist99a","275196","Really? Let us suppose that both persons have equal rights, one person picks up a gun and says to the other - give me your life savings or I will kill you. What rights does the person being mugged have to defend himself? Any? Not according to you.","Steeeeve","275211","See Strawman argument. In any event it makes no sense.","abortion-euthanization","09:13 PM","abortion-debates","173"
"07-23-2007","10129",12,"Steeeeve","275210","1 and 2 are the same.","Another opinion","275221","Case 1 would allow one to define ""person"" as being a white male with green eyes and red hair only (after all, without a clear definition, one can make up whatever definition one wants). Then rights would only be attached to red-haired, green-eyed, white men - which would be completely arbitrary and undefendable. The only defense would be an irrational one: ""Why do only red-haired, green-eyed, white men get rights?"" ""Because we define them as people"". ""Why is it only red-haired, green-eyed, white men you define as people?"" ""No reason, we just felt like it"" (or alternatively, ""No reason is needed, that is our belief system""). In Case II, one recognizes that there are no supportable reasons to include only red-haired, green-eyed, white men as having rights, so we need to change the definition of person to include something more significant. We would then get into the discussion of why rights exist in the first place, which would lead to a far more rational result than what Case I would allow (ex. only red-haired, green-eyed, white men getting rights). These may be extreme comparisons but I think they prove a point that one needs to have some rational and debatable reasons behind the term ""person"" (if one is to attach rights to that term). Otherwise, you might end up with absurd scenarios.","abortion-euthanization","10:46 PM","abortion-debates","174"

It is impossible to somehow establish rights for people (or what they are/mean) if you haven't first defined what a person is. You simply beg the question throughout your debate. As for their being no supportable reasons for ""red haired green-eyed...etc"" I'd have to say there is no supportable reason for ""mental existence"".","abortion-euthanization","11:04 PM","abortion-debates","175"

They are applied to certain selected living beings. We apply a wide set of rights to humans, as opposed to animals, partly out of simple bias, partly because of historical assignment of rights, partly because animals have much less control over their behavior (as young children and mentally incapacitated adults have much less control over their behavior), and perhaps other reasons I have missed where some of these reasons are defendable and some aren't. Then, the question comes into play about which living beings of the human species get rights. There, our moral approach plays a role where I would give rights because I have empathy with the suffering or limitations in experiences of those whose rights are taken away, and I would give rights in all situations where I would expect to receive rights if I were in their shoes (where that is largely in situations where I would see myself suffering without rights). What would be a justification for giving rights only to green-eyed, red-haired, white men? I can't think of any justification that is not simply an unsupportable proclamation (such as that these groups are superior, or that this group is the only one with a soul, etc.). As for the term ""person"", it can either stand alone and not have any significance attached to it, in which case it doesn't matter what definition one assigns to that six-letter word; or it can have significance (such as rights). If you attach rights to the word ""person"" then there needs to be a REASON why you are attaching rights. Then, you can either explain your reasons why you attach rights to that particular definition of person only, or you can tailor your definition of person to suit the reasons you have for attaching rights to begin with. Either way, there need to be supportable REASONS for why we attach rights to some living beings and not to others - it cannot just be an arbitrary decision. Otherwise, you easily end up with a situation such as slavery.","abortion-euthanization","09:57 AM","abortion-debates","176"

The reason the unfertilized egg or a tree doesn't relate is that they are not humans..and no one claimed otherwise. You mean like the unsupported proclamation that one does and should have empathy for suffering and thus rights are given?","abortion-euthanization","10:52 AM","abortion-debates","177"
"07-24-2007","10129",12,"chemist99a","275294","Nope an unfertlized human egg is potentially a human being given certain processes and events occurr. Its as much a ""person"" as a fertilized egg or at least very very nearly so. That an unfertilized egg does not INEVITABLY become a human being is no argument agrainst the potentiality. The same of course applies to a fertilized egg - it to is potentially a human being or person provided that a long chain of processes and conditions occurr in the right sequence. The potential is not however always or even frequently realized. There is in fact no point between fertilization and actual birth where the developing embryo/fetus is indeed an actual human being, its only potential. Granted the potential increases as the process of development proceeds and at some point one might well declare that the potential is sufficiently great to declare (socially) that the organism is now a human being or so close as to not matter any more.","Another opinion","275297","The term ""a human"" has numerous definitions, one of which is ""member of the species Homo Sapien"". I think Steeeve was selecting that second definition, which one could argue also applies to the fertilized egg, and saying that the term ""a human"" needs to automatically be a criteria for our definition of person with rights. It is that automatic connection which I personally contest since it is just as arbitrary as any other condition.","abortion-euthanization","01:23 PM","abortion-debates","180"
