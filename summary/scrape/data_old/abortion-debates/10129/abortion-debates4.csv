Having it accepted as a convention is quite another thing since you cannot by yourself establish and enforce it. The current law (or codified convention) is that a fetus is not accorded codified personhood in and of itself and such rights as it has descend from its owner more or less entirely up till the beginning of the third trimester where it begins to acquire increasing personhood and becomes of interest to society. If you wish to BELIEVE that I am not a person thats fine by me. Its when you act on that be(lief and come up against the codified conventions of society that you will find difficulties staring you in the face. Scientifically no more than you can prove the opposite. Its not a question subject to scientific proof. Its determined by somewhat arbitrary social constructs including formally codified conventions (law) ,by informal social conventions, and of course by personal belief of the person responsible for the fetus. No conventions (ie laws) do you require that you BELIEVE the law and the current convention DOES NOT impose any belief on you prior to the third trimester since you can choose what status to assign to your fetus should you have one. The current convention (law) in the US non-coercive up to that point. However thats NOT what the current convention says. Read Rowe vs Wade for the codification itself. And Roe vs Wade does NOT impose a belief on you, and it does not impose your beliefs on others either. Basically it leaves the choices up to the mother until the end of the second trimester. Your problem is that you wish others to follow your beliefs and are willing to coerce them if necessary rather than accord them the rights to their own beliefs in a non-coercive context.","Steeeeve","274023","So you do wish to impose your belief or ""convention"" on me (assuming there really is said convention). Also, if said convention changes does that mean you will be against abortion? Then don't ask me to prove you are not a person. ohh, so if we have a ""convention"" (whatever that means) saying blacks aren't persons then if they were to become slaves then if I opposed that then I'd be imposing a belief on you when you are not imposing a belief on anyone directly. Good to know. Again with the random ""convention"" terms. So all you have to do in order to circumvent imposing beliefs is to first develop a convention stating certain people are, in fact, not people. The anti-slavery crowd would have had a tough time arguing with you. And you do the exact same. If my belief is that I should be allowed to hurt you then for you to say I can't means you impose a belief on me...or at least society does. Even if society deems you not a person, I'd still say society was wrong just like the anti-slavery crowd said society was wrong when they declared blacks to be ""sub-human"". The abolitionists were wishing others to follow their beliefs because it was what was right...not because it was the ""convention"" of society.","abortion-euthanization","01:22 PM","abortion-debates","46"

Wade has been superseded by Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which abolishes the trimester framework for a new, largely undefined, and historically removed ""undue burden"" standard. Your requirement that one ought not be able to impose their beliefs onto others in a non-coercive context is itself the imposition of a belief. That standard is your own, and to hold others to that standard is to impose your own subjective belief onto someone else. As this conversation has shown, this is something that is apparently wrong for everyone except yourself.","abortion-euthanization","03:47 PM","abortion-debates","47"
"07-17-2007","10129",4,"chemist99a","274050","Nope without coercion there is NO imposition! You may treat your fetus as a person if it suits you and I may treat mine as a tissue if if suits me. I do not impose my belief on you and you accord me the same right. No imposition involved.","Phyllis","274057","I support the state's right to impose a belief regarding the fetus onto you.","abortion-euthanization","04:40 PM","abortion-debates","49"
"07-17-2007","10129",4,"chemist99a","274103","even if that imposition requires forced abortions?","Phyllis","274105","No, I don't support that. I support the right of the state to impose one particular belief regarding the fetus onto you. I support the right of the state to tell you that a fetus has value, and therefore cannot be killed for any reason or no reason at all. No state in our history has ever imposed forced abortions, but virtually every state has placed restrictions on abortions.","abortion-euthanization","07:23 PM","abortion-debates","51"

If we are going to do it that way then why would you stop me from stating you are not a person and thus me hurting you is not against the law? I may treat you as random tissue as it suits me and there is no ""imposition"" on anyone as you were declared not a person. Most likely you'd respond saying something like ""well the convention says I am person"". I will respond saying that there is no said convention and even if there was you'd have to admit that abortion should be restricted if the ""convention"" includes the fetus as a person. You also can't say slavery was wrong because the ""convention"" then was that blacks were not full persons (sub-human).","abortion-euthanization","07:49 PM","abortion-debates","52"

My belief is sufficient here to guide my own actions. You cannot offer scientific proof that a fetus IS a person. Absent such proof you can only claim a personal belief that a fetus is a person. I am willing to let you apply your unprovable belief to your fetus but only so long as you allow me to apply mine to my fetus. Should you fail to accord me my freedoms I shall do everything in my power to regain them. I am perfectly capable of claiming that I am a person. When have you seen a fetus do the same? And there is such a convention in the form of the laws of the United States of America where the issue of personhood arises rather often. The law is a codification of the conventions which bind societies together and its only partially objective.","abortion-euthanization","10:18 PM","abortion-debates","54"

Your system is not of the people for the people. Your political system is of the rich for the rich. Your candidates run their candidatures on the back of the green-back. And the one who has the most dollar gets elected. The lobbyists are the ones who get their way in congress, buying those legislators they need to approve laws that favor their interests. Everybody has rights and human rights are universal, so to deny them to those in Guantnamo is a crime against humanity.","abortion-euthanization","11:41 PM","abortion-debates","60"
