"07-16-2007","10129",2,"None","None","None","sinjin","273782","My wife and I discussed what we would do in the case of substantial malformation during the amnio process and we agreed we would terminate without prejudice. I have no qualms on this score. Flame on.","abortion-euthanization","10:58 AM","abortion-debates","18"
"07-16-2007","10129",2,"chloe","273731","Euthanization is actually a word that we use in the scientific community.","thelmoose","273804","Is that the part of the scientific community that quotes Dr. Seuss? Maybe if you ever said something closely resembling science, that would approach being a believable statement. Chloe, being a receptionist in a vet's office doesn't really qualify.","abortion-euthanization","12:37 PM","abortion-debates","19"
"07-16-2007","10129",2,"chemist99a","273739","And I just say that it would be unjust and unfair of you to force metaphysical belief systems of your own which constitute religious belief upon your follows who may believe otherwise than you. Get pregnant and treat your fetus as a full person if you wish, nobody will force you to abort it. Let others follow their own beliefs differing or the same. Otherwise you attempt to obtain justice by doing injustice.","Steeeeve","273816","Really! Will you grant me the same benefit? Lets just say I have no moral problem with physically hurting you. Would you suggest that people who think that is wrong should not impose their belief system on me? You would certainly think they should impose their belief system on me. Chances are you would say something like ""well, I am a human so therefore I have certain rights"" to which I would respond that chloe and I believe the fetus is a human and we believe you are a human too so therefore the same standard applies. The argument about not pushing your beliefs on others just never works because every law is pushing beliefs on people.","abortion-euthanization","03:20 PM","abortion-debates","20"
"07-16-2007","10129",2,"chemist99a","273741","Do you prefer actually having to make personal moral choices or do you need a rigid and inviolable instruction manual to run your life?","Steeeeve","273818","Things are better built following the instructions then going off of your own personal choices. I suppose you build your IKEA furniture based on intuition","abortion-euthanization","03:23 PM","abortion-debates","21"

Rights afforded born people need not descend from religiously inspired ""belief systems"". Your belief that a fetus deserves the same rights as fully developed people does. In fact all your arguments always flow from this presumption.","abortion-euthanization","03:49 PM","abortion-debates","22"

In fact all your arguments always flow from this presumption.","Steeeeve","273827","Any belief system is a religion loosely defined. I'd like to know how you think rights are afforded to born persons if not by a belief system or at the very least a belief in natural rights. Either way, that doesn't address the point I had. If I can't impose my beliefs on you then who you are to impose your belief of me not hurting chemist99a?","abortion-euthanization","03:55 PM","abortion-debates","24"
"07-16-2007","10129",2,"chemist99a","273824","Different case. If you attack me you interfere with my legitimate choice as a person in the socieity. Your choosing whether or not to have an abortion gives both you and I the relevant choice. Whether or not a fetus is human is beyond objective determination. In such cases judgement of the most directly responsible party is often the standard of assigning the power of choice. A fetus is not a person unless accorded that status by the mother. Just how does my formulation of choice for both of us without conflict between the choices PUSH anything upon you or anyone else. If you choose to have an abortion you will not be imprisoned or coerced, if you choos NOT to have one you will not be coerced either.","Steeeeve","273830","If a fetus is a person then how is aborting it not taking away its own choice? I believe in the second paragraph you mean since the fetus cannot give a choice it has to have someone else give a choice for it...in this case the mother. In general I'd agree but, for example, many mentally ill patients cannot make a choice and for someone to then make the choice to terminate this mentally ill patients life, to me, is unethical. Would you say this would be ethical? I'm not exactly sure what you mean here. The fact that abortion is not illegal (due to supreme court cases) does not chance anything regarding whether it is right or wrong. Do I misunderstand your point?","abortion-euthanization","04:02 PM","abortion-debates","25"
"07-16-2007","10129",2,"chemist99a","273834","Again quite a different case. Most patients in such a state have someone with durable power of attorney and they hold the authority to make the decision. Absent that the decision devolves in some cases onto the state Again a pure hard line bright line rule will not serve one well here. Somebody has to be able to apply case by case judgement - not a simple rule written down somewhere in the past.","Steeeeve","273837","Who cares who has the decision power...the point is can that person or the state make the decision to terminate the mentally ill patients life? If the answer is no then the power of a mother to terminate the childs life doesn't hold any value. I mean even at 1 minute old the child does not really have the power to make any choice. Does the mother still get to decide the fault of the childs life? In all of these cases life wins out over power of attorney (which is basically what that is). This brings me back to the original point that if the fetus were to be a person then the choice cannot be made to terminate its life unless you believe you can impose beliefs on others and in this case impose the belief that some aren't worthy of life.","abortion-euthanization","04:22 PM","abortion-debates","27"

I probably should have used the term ""affirmed"" not ""afforded"". My bad. As you cannot show a fetus is entitled to these rights, you are arguing apples to oranges. The natural rights of ""the born"" are not in dispute. You wish them extended without evidence simply owing to your religious beliefs.","abortion-euthanization","05:11 PM","abortion-debates","28"

So I could easily ask why they should have been shortened. Either way, in my example natural rights were in dispute. If my belief is that I can hurt chemist99a then it seems you would be imposing your belief on me that I can't. Thus, the idea of imposing beliefs on others is a rather useless argument.","abortion-euthanization","06:11 PM","abortion-debates","29"
