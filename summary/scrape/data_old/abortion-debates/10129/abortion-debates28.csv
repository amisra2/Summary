"08-29-2007","10129",28,"Another opinion","281185","So then, how much do you think evidence plays a role in showing what our reality is about? This includes anything from satelite images of weather patterns helping to predict future local weather, to knowledge that has been gained from evidence about the origins of humanity and our solar system, to knowledge about the forces of nature, etc. My main point is that one either sees evidence as useful or one ignores it, or one questions the ways the evidence was taken or presented and proposes an alternative explanation. You can't have it both ways. At least with the knowledge that has been gained through evidence, that knowledge is so very consistent with our experienced reality that untold numbers of accurate predictions have been made based on that knowledge - not so with religion. You seem to approach this issue as if there is one right answer to abortion rights - there isn't. I don't think in such absolute terms as you do. I acknowledge that it is people who ultimately determine their rights in a democracy, but I am continually stressing that any laws (including those about rights) that are determined by people's representatives need to be based on rational discussion. You seem to claim that a desire for rights from conception is equally valid to a desire for rights only for blue-eyed, red haired people, is equally valid to a desire for rights for those with mental existence,... I disagree. I think the validity of the views is based on the arguements they present. But much of your belief structure is based on religious faith. The separation of church and state does not allow for laws based on religion. You have some non-religious arguements as well, but when I asked you the basic question of the critical difference between an unfertilized egg and a fertilized one that determines rights, you said ""a soul"" - that is a religious belief (both in a soul and when it enters the body). In your apparent view of democracy, you would see nothing wrong if a hypothetical future extremist muslim majority in the US (it could hypothetically happen someday) would vote in Sharia law. I do see something wrong with that. A law shouldn't be introduced because a group says ""we say so"" but because a group presents compelling arguements that people can agree on. The reality of democracy is that a large enough group (say 75%)could vote in whatever they want (ex. a law to kill all red-haired people) - that doesn't make it right. Empathy is trying to imagine what the other is feeling. We can only do that because we humans are relatively similar to one another. Rights didn't come from some abstract absolutist land, they come from people, where people can be swayed by arguements of emotion (largely including empathy) and arguements of reason. Slaveholders were not exactly open-minded about the prospect of slavery so you wouldn't have been able to convince most of them with reason, no matter how much evidence was presented. I am simply stating rational discussion as an ideal that we should strive for, so I present idealized scenarios of what rational arguement could have achieved if true open-minded rational discussion had been participated in. But there were many slaves who had more white ancestry than African ancestry and whose skin color was even lighter than many of those from, say, Italy or Greece. How would that have been defended using your argument? If nobody is suffering, where is the injustice? Relative reasoning does not mean arbitrary reasoning. That is something that is so often implied by you and others who hold on to belief in absolute truths, but something that is wrong. Saying that we need to restrict the rights of mass murderers is very different than saying that we need to restrict the rights of, say, red-haired people since one is based on rational arguement and the other is not.","Steeeeve","281434","It is hard to say with 100% certainly how much of a role evidence place in reality since you can't be 100% sure what reality is. I have stated that given this you do the best you can and obviously evidence is important to that. You get beyond that and can look at whether or not someone is using the evidence to make a valid conclusion. can you give an example of a prediction the Christian faith has made that proved to be not true to reality? This, of course, assumes you know true reality (an absolute principal I might add). Furthermore, I disagree that a consistent experience indicates truth. In fact, common theories have been disproven many times as this gets back to the ability for one to understand. One might say that if the sun rises a bird will fly. Now this will happen repeatedly but does not indicate a truth of relationship. This is obviously easily shown to be wrong now but throughout our past we have found that what has been a ""set in stone"" finding really was wrong afterall. I see no reason why today is any different. Yes there is. You say you don't and base conclusions on that but in reality you do but deny it. You believe in some absolutes. Understanding of a on reality is an absolute for example. You may not think absolute rights exist but if that is the case then rights are certainly more vulnerable. And rational discussion has no meaning as far as I can tell. You would probably indicate that you have to provide evidence for everything but not everything has evidence. Many laws are based purely on beliefs of a society and those can only be but into law but common beliefs. I don't think they are equally valid. I think mine is right and the others are wrong. I do, however, believe that beliefs are a valid reason for a law. You just happen to be wrong about what our first amendment means. I also hope this isn't your only reason for saying abortion laws shouldn't be enacted. Again you try to establish an absolute here. What if 99% of people made a law to kill all red-haired people...does that make it right? Considering your 2+2=3 answer some posts ago I would say you would have to say it does make it right. As for my views of democracy, if extremist Muslims got a majority then I wouldn't have any other choice than to follow the laws they enacted. I would probably leave the country though. An appeal to the human being again. Interesting. Now, if a human being was not and could not suffer would you have empathy for them if something bad happened? I'd like to know how you think people had empathy to begin with. Furthermore, can you show this to be true? Obviously many people disagree that rights came from people...including the people that created our government. You are flawed in that you seem to believe people have to have the same thoughts as you do. There would be no difference in me claiming you do have the ability to ""rational argument"" as you claim the slaveholders didn't. It seems your argument here is really ""if people saw things the way I do then they are open-minded and will see the light"". You may not seem like you are doing this but, in fact, you are. It is the exact reason why I say a belief system like that is based upon oneself which has an inherent selfish basis (don't take this paragraph to be a low-XXXX...I don't mean to insult but state a point). You are still black at that point. But lets assume for arguments sake that the belief was a color X you are considered black and thus no rights (perhaps they had a little paint chart or something). How would you go about denying this belief and showing them they should have empathy when they clearly do not? Suffering does not equal injustice. Yes it does This is only true if you believe in an absolute right and wrong.","abortion-euthanization","02:32 PM","abortion-debates","409"
"08-29-2007","10129",28,"Another opinion","281431","Well, I would say it was a mixture. The southern states would never have separated in the first place if they did not feel that the institution of slavery was threatened with the election of Lincoln. However, Lincoln did not engage the Northern states in the Civil War to begin with for slavery but in order to keep the Union intact. The Emancipation Proclamation came later. Before the war, Lincoln had no plans to free all slaves, much as he probably personally would have liked that. However, the Southerners knew that it would have just been a matter of time before slavery was outlawed by force of upcoming anti-slave majority states. The issues are all interwoven. Either way, you cannot extract the issue of slavery as the main underlying cause of the conflict between the states which erupted into the Civil War. Without a conflict about slavery, the Civil War never would have happened.","Steeeeve","281436","http://www.civilwar.vt.edu/jr/jr.html The guy in that link would smack you if you said it was about anything other than slavery.

Before the Civil War, Lincoln had no intention of freeing all slaves. His view was that he would use his power to prevent any new slave-permitting states to arise from the US territories so that, eventually, the government would be composed of mainly anti-slave states and, thus, slavery would eventually expire. However, this was enough for the Southern states to separate. Then, Lincoln went to war to keep them from seceding and to keep the Union together. It is interesting to note that, even with the Emancipation Proclamation, he did not have any slaves freed that were in Union states. Also, at the beginning of the war, Lincoln prohibited his generals from freeing slaves even in captured territories. Much of this was gleaned from : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln_on_slavery as well as various Discovery Channel and History Channel programs, which were also developed by experts. So, the bottom line is that slavery was the main underlying cause of the civil war since the states would never have seceeded if not for the political threat to the institution of slavery posed by Lincoln's election, but that the war itself was started because of that secession not directly because of slavery. One can say that the main in-direct cause of the civil war was slavery but the main direct cause was keeping the union together. Alternatively, there are various statements that can be made: 1. The southern states would never have seceded if not for the threat to slavery. 2. The civil war would never have happened if not for the secession. So, if the Southern states would have kept their slaves and just complained in the official political process, without secession, then slavery as an institution would have continued for at least some decades to come before an anti-slave political state majority would have voted it off.","abortion-euthanization","02:59 PM","abortion-debates","411"

It is not a question of either slavery causing the war or secession causing the war - both were causes. The conflict about slavery and the urgency to that conflict that arose with the election of Lincoln made the South feel like they had to secede if they wanted to keep the institution of slavery, where that secession in turn sparked the civil war. I do not agree with you that the north would have started a civil war if the south had never seceded. Certainly, if the south had not seceded at that point in time, then some years or decades later, there would have eventually been an anti-slave majority of states that could have tried to vote out slavery. It is feasable that the southern states would have precipitated a conflict then. I doubt that they would have taken the voting-out of slavery lying down. However, other alternatives might have happened. Namely, it is possible that, knowing that slavery would eventually be outlawed, the South might have rearranged their system more toward the sharecropper system that happened later (which wasn't all that much worse for the planters financially). It is hard to predict at this point what would have happened. Was a conflict over slavery always destined to lead to war? Unknown.","abortion-euthanization","11:19 AM","abortion-debates","418"

"08-30-2007","10129",28,"None","None","None","Winston Smith","281619","The doctrine of states' rights has been the cause of bitter controversy at several periods in U.S. history. Before the American Civil War (1861-1865), supporters of the doctrine generally held that the federal government was only a voluntary compact of the states, and that the latter could legally refuse to carry out federal enactments that they regarded as unconstitutional encroachments on their sovereignty. In the early days of the United States, loyalty to ones state often took precedence over loyalty to ones country. A New Yorker or a Virginian would refer to his state as my country. The Union was considered a voluntary compact entered into by independent, sovereign states for as long as it served their purpose to be so joined. In the nations early years, neither North nor South had any strong sense of the permanence of the Union. New England, for example, once thought of seceding, or leaving the Union, because the War of 1812 cut off trade with England. When Lincoln took the oath of office on March 4, 1861, seven states had seceded and organized a working government. Southern leaders believed that their action was lawful, but Lincoln and a majority of Northerners refused to accept the right of Southern states to secede. The new president announced in his inaugural address that he would hold, occupy, and possess the property and places belonging to the government. He promised that the government would not assail the states of the South, and he pleaded with the Southern people not to act hastily but to give the new administration a chance to prove that it was not hostile. Lincoln seems to have believed that with time, and without an act of provocation, the states in secession might return to the Union, but time ran out.","abortion-euthanization","07:56 PM","abortion-debates","420"
