"07-16-2007","10129",2,"chemist99a","273824","Different case. If you attack me you interfere with my legitimate choice as a person in the socieity. Your choosing whether or not to have an abortion gives both you and I the relevant choice. Whether or not a fetus is human is beyond objective determination. In such cases judgement of the most directly responsible party is often the standard of assigning the power of choice. A fetus is not a person unless accorded that status by the mother. Just how does my formulation of choice for both of us without conflict between the choices PUSH anything upon you or anyone else. If you choose to have an abortion you will not be imprisoned or coerced, if you choos NOT to have one you will not be coerced either.","Steeeeve","273830","If a fetus is a person then how is aborting it not taking away its own choice? I believe in the second paragraph you mean since the fetus cannot give a choice it has to have someone else give a choice for it...in this case the mother. In general I'd agree but, for example, many mentally ill patients cannot make a choice and for someone to then make the choice to terminate this mentally ill patients life, to me, is unethical. Would you say this would be ethical? I'm not exactly sure what you mean here. The fact that abortion is not illegal (due to supreme court cases) does not chance anything regarding whether it is right or wrong.

If the answer is no then the power of a mother to terminate the childs life doesn't hold any value. I mean even at 1 minute old the child does not really have the power to make any choice. Does the mother still get to decide the fault of the childs life? In all of these cases life wins out over power of attorney (which is basically what that is). This brings me back to the original point that if the fetus were to be a person then the choice cannot be made to terminate its life unless you believe you can impose beliefs on others and in this case impose the belief that some aren't worthy of life.","abortion-euthanization","04:22 PM","abortion-debates","27"

Indeed it can never be established in any objective way when personhood arrives on the scene - its a social construct not a scientific one.

Otherwise you attempt to obtain justice by doing injustice. And if society swings and decides the fetus is a person then you would agree that abortion is wrong? There certainly is not a consensus in society now about whether or not the unborn is a person. But if the assumption is that the fetus is a person then wouldn't this be you forcing your will onto another person? What convention? I know of no such convention. Furthermore, for someone who says they shouldn't impose beliefs you certainly are imposing one that says the fetus is not a person. If one believes the fetus is a person then wouldn't they want the same rights for that person? And wouldn't it be ok to impose a belief in that case? You are imposing a belief in your statement anyway. You say I should go with these ""conventions"" which are nothing more than your beliefs. The parallel is there. I can't go around claiming you are not a person and therefore I can hurt you. Why? Because a belief system is imposed on me and I have live with that.","abortion-euthanization","08:08 PM","abortion-debates","35"

Now, if it is true that personhood can never be objectively established, then your contention that you are a person is subjective. And since you base your right to defend yourself in the fact that you are a person, then I will simply disagree that you are a person. Since it is apparently a matter of subjectivity, then you are in no position to argue that my assessment is incorrect.

"07-16-2007","10129",3,"chemist99a","273885","Sorry but I will not admit that assumption into the argument since its not testable in any known way. Support your assumption if you wish. I will also not admit that a decapitated body hooked up to a machine (no head) is a person - will you. Nor will I admit the assumption that a rock is a human being. Since IF a fetus is NOT a person holds (and you will be hard pressed to shake that assumption) then you cannot logically compare interactions between persons with interactions between persons and feti. Personhood is a social convention. By convention I am clearly a person. Such conventions are not at there core objective statements of fact and usually cannot be made to be so.

Having it accepted as a convention is quite another thing since you cannot by yourself establish and enforce it. The current law (or codified convention) is that a fetus is not accorded codified personhood in and of itself and such rights as it has descend from its owner more or less entirely up till the beginning of the third trimester where it begins to acquire increasing personhood and becomes of interest to society. If you wish to BELIEVE that I am not a person thats fine by me. Its when you act on that be(lief and come up against the codified conventions of society that you will find difficulties staring you in the face. Scientifically no more than you can prove the opposite. Its not a question subject to scientific proof. Its determined by somewhat arbitrary social constructs including formally codified conventions (law) ,by informal social conventions, and of course by personal belief of the person responsible for the fetus. No conventions (ie laws) do you require that you BELIEVE the law and the current convention DOES NOT impose any belief on you prior to the third trimester since you can choose what status to assign to your fetus should you have one. The current convention (law) in the US non-coercive up to that point. However thats NOT what the current convention says. Read Rowe vs Wade for the codification itself. And Roe vs Wade does NOT impose a belief on you, and it does not impose your beliefs on others either. Basically it leaves the choices up to the mother until the end of the second trimester. Your problem is that you wish others to follow your beliefs and are willing to coerce them if necessary rather than accord them the rights to their own beliefs in a non-coercive context.","abortion-euthanization","09:52 AM","abortion-debates","43"
"07-17-2007","10129",3,"None","None","None","Another opinion","273999","As I see it, there are a few issues that have to be addressed in detail here: 1. Why should we limit when people make important life-critical decisions for others? My own answer is that I would not like others to make decisions for me since the decisions they make may not coincide with my desires and would cause me to suffer. It is a matter of personal freedom and desire to control the most critical aspects of my own life. Without freedom, I would personally suffer. My moral approach is reciprocal, so I would expect others to have the same freedoms. 2. When is it permissible for others to make life-critical decisions for someone and why? If I were unable to make the decision for myself, someone capable and well-intentioned would have to make the decision for me. This situation applies to childhood, when a trusted adult (usually the parent) makes the life-critical decision since the child lacks the knowledge or reasoning ability to make the decision for him/herself. Freedom is automatically given up, but it is assumed that the decision maker is both capable and trustworthy (making the decision based on what they would think is best for the child). This is also true for someone who is incapacitated - in a coma, or unable to communicate, etc. However, once again, the freedom of making one's own decision is given up but there is an assumption that the decisionmaker is trustworthy and capable. 3. What are the consequences of a bad decision imposed on another? I would say that the chief consequence is suffering. The consequences of a bad decision could cause physical suffering or death when that physical suffering or death is not desired. It could also cause psychological suffering, where a decision made for someone to, say, amputate a leg or have brain surgery could leave the person disabled and limited for the rest of their life. 4. How is this relevant to late stage fetuses? The assumption is that, sometime around the third trimester, fetuses start gaining mental abilities to suffer, feel emotion, pain, fear, etc. It may not know the concepts of life, suffering, etc. but it can still suffer, may have an instinctual will to live, etc. One can feel empathy toward that late stage fetus. 5. Is this relevant to early stage fetuses? With early stage fetuses, there is no suffering, no sense of pain, no desire to live, no desire for freedom of decision, no mental existence whatsoever. The relevant consequences that would apply to adults or children that would have a bad decision made for them do not apply for those early stage fetuses/embryos. The only real consequence is one of potential - in that the early fetus could grow up into someone who does feel a will to live, can suffer, etc. However, that is not yet real - it lies in the future. The only negative is the taking away of that potential.","abortion-euthanization","10:41 AM","abortion-debates","44"

Having it accepted as a convention is quite another thing since you cannot by yourself establish and enforce it. The current law (or codified convention) is that a fetus is not accorded codified personhood in and of itself and such rights as it has descend from its owner more or less entirely up till the beginning of the third trimester where it begins to acquire increasing personhood and becomes of interest to society. If you wish to BELIEVE that I am not a person thats fine by me. Its when you act on that be(lief and come up against the codified conventions of society that you will find difficulties staring you in the face. Scientifically no more than you can prove the opposite. Its not a question subject to scientific proof. Its determined by somewhat arbitrary social constructs including formally codified conventions (law) ,by informal social conventions, and of course by personal belief of the person responsible for the fetus. No conventions (ie laws) do you require that you BELIEVE the law and the current convention DOES NOT impose any belief on you prior to the third trimester since you can choose what status to assign to your fetus should you have one. The current convention (law) in the US non-coercive up to that point. However thats NOT what the current convention says. Read Rowe vs Wade for the codification itself. And Roe vs Wade does NOT impose a belief on you, and it does not impose your beliefs on others either. Basically it leaves the choices up to the mother until the end of the second trimester. Your problem is that you wish others to follow your beliefs and are willing to coerce them if necessary rather than accord them the rights to their own beliefs in a non-coercive context.","Steeeeve","274023","So you do wish to impose your belief or ""convention"" on me (assuming there really is said convention).

Good to know. Again with the random ""convention"" terms. So all you have to do in order to circumvent imposing beliefs is to first develop a convention stating certain people are, in fact, not people. The anti-slavery crowd would have had a tough time arguing with you. And you do the exact same. If my belief is that I should be allowed to hurt you then for you to say I can't means you impose a belief on me...or at least society does. Even if society deems you not a person, I'd still say society was wrong just like the anti-slavery crowd said society was wrong when they declared blacks to be ""sub-human"".

The definition of who gets rights and who doesn't isn't based on arbitrary decisions. One needs to have REASONS behind it. The reasons that were given for enslaving black people in the 19th century were based on faulty assumptions - i.e. that they were like children who needed to be governed, etc. Those reasons were easily proven wrong. Without valid reasons, the premise behind slavery had no rational basis to stand on and could easily have been knocked down were a rational debate allowed. Of course, though rational debate certainly played a role in the growing abolitionist movement, it had little effect on the power structure of the South which financially needed the slave labor and ostracized anyone who tried to use reason to argue against it. Rationality based on fully demonstratable evidence had no role in slavery - it was exploitation of the weak by the powerful, pure and simple. My main point is that setting a convention of who gets rights and who doesn't is not bad if it is based on demonstratable reasons and fully explored rational arguement - not power politics or arbitrary definitions.","Steeeeve","274535","Because suffering alone means nothing. A suffering ant does not lead to a civil war. They are people...that is the main point. Blacks are people too and as such are given the same rights as whites. This was the main idea that drove the movement. The actions done against slaves were wrong because people have rights. Surely an enslaved robot is not going to spark a freedom movement. irrelevant to the point being discussed. These were not wrong ""facts"" at the time. The assumptions were also not easily proven wrong but are obviously generally accepted today. And abortion has no ""demonstratable"" reasons and no rational argument better than that of slavery considering the times. It seems easy to say they are wrong now but at the time they were just considered sub-human. They created a false definition of what a human is and it excluded blacks (by definition). Likewise we see that a definition has been arbitrary created which conventionally excludes the unborn. So at the time the convention stated blacks were not worthy of being a person. So using the logic chemist presented he would have to say that one should not impose their beliefs on others and thus slavery was ok at that point in time. As an aside, if person is so ""arbitrary"" (as you put it) then calling blacks non-persons is not out of the realm of what that word could mean...afterall, it is arbitrary.

You still miss the point that your logic is inconsistent. I'll try to make it clear for you here: Your argument goes like this: ""Don't push your beliefs on others regarding abortion"" From here we have a few choices: 1) You assume the fetus is not a person 2) it is irrelevant whether or not the fetus is a person 3) the current general level of thinking is the fetus is not a person With option 1 you have assumed something you can't prove or show to be true. If I believe the fetus is a person then it is perfectly reasonable for me to fight for that persons rights. This would be the same as a slave owner believing the slave is not a person but an anti-slavery supporter feeling it is and thus fighting for the rights of the slave. With option 2 you find it irrelevant whether or not it is a person. If this is the case then you violate your own statement because if it is a person you have pushed beliefs onto that person and in this case endangers their life. The third option is that we go with the so called ""convention"". This is a bad argument because the convention in the 1800s was that blacks were sub-human and as such have no rights and are property. Your logic would have to conclude here that the slave owners and supporters of slavery were correct in arguing that others shouldn't impose their belief system on them. An argument (once again) used during this time period and an argument that has proved over and over again to be wrong. I challenge you to find me a case in past where a convention declaring something nonhuman to be beneficial. An odd definition of slavery as there is no one the woman is enslaved to.

"07-20-2007","10129",8,"Another opinion","274621","It was empathy with the slaves that drove the abolitionist movement which was a major cause of the civil war. You are trying to take empathy out of the picture, which is disingenuous on your part. Do you claim that empathy played no role? Yes, it was not ants that were suffering but people but it was not an abstract arbitrary assignment of a definition of person that drove the abolitionist movement - it was empathy with beings like oneself. As for enslaved robots, currently there is no developed artificial intelligence but many a science fiction movie has been based on the concept of rights of sentient robots. It may be an issue our society may someday need to face decades from now. Until they are sentient, their rights are irrelevant - just as with a pre-mentally existing fetuses. Perhaps I am misunderstanding you, but the assumptions I claim were made by 19th century supporters of Slavery were indeed largely disprovable (appart from the ones that came from a distorted Christian faith). These assumptions included the Southerners claim that blacks were like children who needed supervision, and they were automatically inferior because of their race. A simply proof could have been to let a sample group be brought up and live under the same condition as whites and see what comes of it. I have very little doubt that the result would have run counter to the Southerner's claims. Do you think otherwise? Also, what assumptions do you say are ""obviously generally accepted today""? Perhaps I missed something since I don't know what you are referring to. What one defines as the minimum definition of ""person"" is arbitrary: - I (and presumably chemist99a) define person as human with some level of mind - You define a person as a living entity with a complete set of human DNA that has started the growth process (which are the main characteristics of a zygote) - Someone else might define a person as an unfertilized egg or a sperm cell which, after all, are human, alive, and have the potential to become one of us - they simply lack the second set of DNA to get the process started. Your definition is as arbitrary as anyone elses. Lastly, I do not think that chemist99a chose to define the convention of who gets rights by randomly choosing it. I am sure that he had reasons behind choosing that convention. If you think that the convention he presents is arbitrary and that yours is not, then why don't the two of you compare the rational arguements behind the chosen convention and then debate those rational arguements instead of continuing an essentially silly arguement about a definition of ""person"". If, by the word ""person"", you both mean a human with rights, then doesn't it make sense to address the question of the reasons behind having rights?","Steeeeve","274675","Again, the key is that they were people. empathy and suffering are all irrelevant if people is not part of the equation. The major cause of the civil war was slavery and the movement was not ""suffering is bad""...it was ""these are people and as such have rights"". Those rights happen to include not getting whipped but the abolitionists were not just concerned with those that suffered in this manner. Ones that were treated well were still included. Reading an abolitionist book or text would reveal they cherished people as people and were not just against whipping or what have you. Again this is irrelevant when looking at the common belief at the time. But as a fact, your ""science"" even felt that blacks were subhuman and in general they were considered subhuman just by definition alone. This is similar to how you define ""person"" today and define it so that the fetus is left out. And one could define it as only people who's skin is white. This was what was done during this time period. Now, when you do this and someone says ""don't push your beliefs on me"", doesn't this present a bad argument? Of course one can push their beliefs on you because they feel you are violating another just like if I arbitrary claimed you weren't a person then society can push its beliefs on me and force me not to hurt you. I really don't understand how one could defend the argument ""don't push your beliefs on me"" with abortion yet deny the argument was false for slavery. It is the same argument with the same backing and reasoning behind it. The whole point of this argument is to show that the argument ""don't push your beliefs on me"" is an idiotic one and lends itself to comparison with slavery.

In other words, the conclusions were made first and the evidence was selectively chosen to fit those conclusions. I don't claim that science has always been objective. Science is conducted by humans who are fallible. Science is much more objective on social issues today, though not yet ideally so, than it was in the 19th century. The people who supported slavery made no great efforts at demonstrating evidence to support their reasons for slavery - they just made unsupported assumptions. If you claimed I wasn't a person (in the sense that I was not deserving of rights), then you would have to present excellent, well supported reasons for why I would not be deserving of certain rights. If your reasons were valid (for ex., if I were a child or mentally incapacitated), then your reasons would win out and my freedoms would be limited. If your reasons were bogus, then you would have no justification in imposing your views on me in trying to take my rights away. Society often pushes its beliefs on people in the form of laws, but those laws have to be based on rational reasons. Otherwise, as with slavery, the society can become very unfair in its treatment of others. You just claim that it should because of the proclamation that ""zygote = person"" and that ""person = someone with rights"" - proclamations unsupported by reasoned arguement. The bottom line is that society has every right to push its views on people if those views are based on rational reasons. In allowing the institution of slavery, it pushed its views on African Americans but those views were not based on rational reasons but on bogus reasons that were easily disproven if given the chance. Lastly, how would you like it if someone came around claiming that unfertilized eggs are people and should therefore have rights and that you are acting like a slaveholder in refusing them rights.","Steeeeve","274736","Monday morning quarterbacking haha, and they probably thought the same thing at the time.

It is irrelevant how you got there....the point is that it is a huge assumption and every ""logical"" and ""reasonable"" step you took to get to that assumption was based on even more assumptions. They had plenty of rational reasons for slavery. It was free labor that benefited their society and way of life. The problem comes in when you are talking about free labor as a person. Likewise with abortion you have rational reasons for it but at the expense of killing another person it is not worth it. So I'd modify you statement and claim that when society rejects calling a human a person then it results in unfair treatment of others. This has been the case throughout history and I question why one thinks it will change now. And irrelevant to my point. My reason for pushing my belief is that no innocent person should be put to death. How do you disprove ""blacks are not people"" when you can offer me not definite definition of person? I'd disagree with them. But again, you missed the entire point of my argument and continue to try and substitute something else in its place.

Does that mean that we should grant rights to unfertilized human eggs because some can also choose to call those people?

If you claim that reasons are not important, then what makes you an authority in deciding that unfertilized eggs should not be considered people?.... You are not calling an unfertilized egg a person so your view would result in unfair treatment of those people. What justification do you have for that? Many billions of unfertilized eggs are put to death each year. They are also considered innocent people by those who would choose to call them people. You are restricting the rights of those unfertilized eggs. Shame on you... Coming back to my real views, I have offered my own definition of a person many times and I'll offer it to you again. A person is a human being with at least some level of mind / mental existence. African Americans certainly fit that definition. My main point is that the convention has to be based on reasoned arguement. If there was a law outlawing contraception and forcing all women to become pregnant as often as possible to support that ""right to life"" of the unfertilized egg, then I am sure that you would be saying ""don't push your beliefs on me"".

For example, it is a supportable arguement that children should have fewer rights than adults. Certainly, children, particularly teenagers, think that such a view is being forced on them, but nearly all people would agree that such a rule is just since there are good reasons behind the rule. You have yet to explain your detailed reasons as to why zygotes should have rights. Until you explain your reasons, it is just as arbitrary as saying that an unfertilized egg should have rights. Wait a minute. I thought that your arguement was against people saying ""Don't push your beliefs on me"". If people supported the rights of unfertilized eggs enough to force a ban on contraception and to force pregnancy, would you not think and argue that they were trying to force their views on you? How is that different than pro-choice supporters claiming that pro-life people are trying to force their views on us in banning early abortion for those women who want abortions?","Steeeeve","274810","I deny that you could say ""their science was wrong and mine is right"" considering you could easily look back 50yrs and determine the science now to be wrong. As it relates to the discussion I am having you could only compare level of thinking at the time for it to be relevant. I'm really not sure how you aren't getting my argument. I'm using slaveholders as an example to show the idea that ""you can't push your beliefs on me"" isn't a valid argument. You are distorting my views actually. Fully supportable by what? Hopefully you aren't trying to convince me that the ""great majority"" of people is what determines if an argument is valid. The ""great majority"" of people in the US thought blacks were inferior. That is because it isn't my point. For the second time....no. strawman. I most admit I'm getting a little annoyed because the argument I was addressing is not the argument you seem to want to address. My only claim right now is that using the argument ""you can't push your beliefs on me"" is an invalid one and happens to be one the slaveholders used. The two are remarkably similar because they both start with the premise that the slave/unborn is not a person. In both cases it is a position that has to be used because otherwise you would be pushing your beliefs on another and violating your own argument. The idea of saying ""well the slave holders were wrong"" doesn't really get you anywhere because they didn't believe they were wrong (much like you don't now) and there is not logical/reasonable position that is a standard of measurement for determining they were wrong and you are right....at least that you believe.","abortion-euthanization","02:39 PM","abortion-debates","129"

Its not whether or not a fetus is a person, it how to reconcile the rights of individuals in a very diverse population where the beliefs surrounding this issue are extremely variable. How does one balance the different beliefs and concepts in a way which allows individuals to remain free in their beliefs while at the same time sustaining minimal conflict in society. Fortunately we have so far elected to allow considerable personal freedom in making choices as to whether abortion is allowed or not.

"07-21-2007","10129",9,"Another opinion","274814","I criticize the scientific assumptions about blacks from the 19th century because science, by its very definition, is supposed to be objective and base its conclusions on evidence, not on pre-determined conclusions. Science is limited by human imperfection - limited imagination, limits on computational power, and biases, among other things. One cannot blame scientists for their limited imagination and computational power and, indeed, these are things that do progress with time. However, one can blame scientists for bias. It is not as if the idea of blacks being just as equally human as whites never occurred to anyone. It was not lack of imagination. It was bias, pure and simple. I have no doubt that there are limitations to our scientific understanding today that are based on lack of imagination. However, for the most part, bias has been screened out of our scientific process much more so than it was in the 19th century. If you believe that is not the case, then present examples of clear bias in current scientific thinking. We are not saying that ""you can't push your beliefs on me"" applies to all situations. We would say more specifically, ""you can't push your unsupported beliefs on me"". If something is imposed on us by law, there need to be fully debated reasons presented to us for imposing that law. Do you deny that? Do you think laws need no justified reasoned debate? Do you deny that our laws are based on reasons or do you think they are arbitrary and based purely on one group pushing its rights on another? In contrast, we, on the pro-choice, are full of rational arguements for our cause and would welcome a full, detailed debate. However, this country having as a major tennet the separation of Church and State, the reasons presented by the pro-life side could not be something along the lines of ""because my religious leader tells me so"". Also, proclamations are not reasons. Saying ""a zygote deserves rights"" is a proclamation. One needs to define the reasons underneath that - which is why I keep repeating this point. This is not a strawman arguement since I am not distorting your views. If you claim that I am distorting your views, then please explain in detail HOW I am distorting them with this comparison.","Steeeeve","274816","I will not present examples as I have repeatedly said I don't wish to move away from my primary discussion. The point is only that the science at the time was accepted and helped enforce the ""convention"" at the time. As such, I don't believe ""conventions"" are a good form of evaluation as they have obviously been proven wrong and the ones today could just as easily be proven wrong. Legally speaking you can make a law for whatever reason you want. As a matter of principal I think you can never say you have no right to push beliefs on others (into law) as you certainly should be able to push what is right into law. Either way, if I believe the fetus is a person then you would be pushing beliefs onto that person and violating your own standard oddly. I believe all are derived from ethical and moral principals and by definition have to be. But if someone is to disagree with the law then obviously the belief is pushed onto him. You can't even provide me with a non-arbitrary definition of person. How on each can you get a rational argument from that? Look at this argument of defining person: ""Only those with black skin are people"". Why is this argument wrong? The only way it could be wrong is if there is some objective definition of person that refutes this. You would certainly say ""well you need a rational reason for that definition""...but how is a definition irrational to begin with? It just is what it is. Short of begging the question you can't claim that to be wrong unless another standard (a true one) exists. Your assumption on what the first amendment means is wrong and any look at history would show this. I'd have a hard time believing that the framers said you have to exclude any religious thought from your mind when deciding laws. In other words, people of faith are disallowed from being members of government. Because in the argument I am presenting now I never claimed the fetus should get rights. I merely said you can't say ""don't force your beliefs on me"". You inadvertently did something which I feel many folks do in the course of a debate. You added an argument never presented and choose to refute that argument instead of the one addressed. As such you presented a strawman argument.","abortion-euthanization","03:39 PM","abortion-debates","134"
"07-21-2007","10129",10,"Another opinion","274820","But the structure of our legislative process was meant for these laws to be based on reasoned debate by competent legeslators. If we accept the idea of laws being based not on rational discourse but on gut reaction, then what prevents us once again from enslaving minority groups? After all, if the white power movement ever would gain a large majority, then that is not impossible. The situation with an early term fetus is similar. Almost two thirds of Americans do not think that first trimester fetuses should have rights, and would allow abortion in that case. The pro-life supporters have not successfully made a reasoned case as to why first trimester fetuses should have rights. Do you believe that ethical and moral principals have to be based on reasoned arguement or can they be based on unsupported proclamations? There is a difference between being inspired by religion and making a law based on religious beliefs. For example, one cannot take away the rights of homosexuals only on the basis of quotes from the Bible. Would you think it permissible if, in several decades, the majority of the US ended up being from the Islamic religion and tried to impose Islamic law on all of us through majority rule in congress? You presented the arguement that our view was like the view of slaveholders. It is perfectly legitimate for me to then compare your view, in a similar way, to a hypothetical view. The bottom line is that groups can indeed impose their views on us if those views have been fully debated based on rational supportable reasons. My main claim, and I think chemist99a might agree, is that it is views imposed on us without that fully supported rational debate which are views that we resent being imposed on us. Supported reasoned debate is the best method for getting laws which are as fair as possible.","Steeeeve","274831","No it wasn't. There is nothing anywhere that states you have to be competent to be a legislature. Nothing, in our system of government you have to accept the fact that we can vote to enslave the minority. First off, who cares what 2/3rds of Americans think? 2/3rds of Americans can and have been wrong...on a very similar issue no less. Secondly, I see no more reasoned argument than ""the unborn is a person and people have rights and therefore abortion should be illegal"". That argument is as reasoned as any for abortion....beliefs taken with logic to reach a conclusion. My argument is against the idea of ""pushing beliefs on others"" as this argument does not logically derive correctly and is inconsistent. They are all based on unsupported proclamations or you end up with circular logic. You can believe homosexuals are immoral and therefore vote for laws restrict gay rights. Would it be legally permissible? Yes. Sort of them telling us when to pray they can pass laws related to their religion. But that is not what you did. You assumed a different point and compared that one. I'm just going to post something I already posted regarding the idea that you can't impose your beliefs on others...mainly this issue of abortion: From here we have a few choices: 1) You assume the fetus is not a person 2) it is irrelevant whether or not the fetus is a person 3) the current general level of thinking is the fetus is not a person With option 1 you have assumed something you can't prove or show to be true. If I believe the fetus is a person then it is perfectly reasonable for me to fight for that persons rights. This would be the same as a slave owner believing the slave is not a person but an anti-slavery supporter feeling it is and thus fighting for the rights of the slave. There is no rational argument for defining person...it just is what it is. With option 2 you find it irrelevant whether or not it is a person. If this is the case then you can violate your own statement because if it is a person you have pushed beliefs onto that person and in this case endangers their life. The third option is that we go with the so called ""convention"". This is a bad argument because the convention in the 1800s was that blacks were sub-human and as such have no rights and are property. Your logic would have to conclude here that the slave owners and supporters of slavery were correct in arguing that others shouldn't impose their belief system on them. An argument (once again) used during this time period and an argument that has proved over and over again to be wrong.

"07-22-2007","10129",10,"Another opinion","274901","Age limits were placed on congressmen to help ensure competence but there was certainly no guarantee of competence. People had the right and ability to choose incompetent leaders. Overall, though, the hope and expectation of the founders was that the legislature would act based on reasoned debate. The reality of politics often got in the way. The first ammendment was meant to stop religious laws from being introduced. The founders had experienced the Church of England being forced upon the populace - this was a major inspiration for preventing any religion from imposing itself on the populace. Also, later ammendments prohibiting discrimination in law based on race would prevent enslavement of the minority. So, there are many safeguards in the current state of the Constitution which protect us from religious or racial persecution. However, I would admit that, if a majority were large enough - say 90% or even 75% - then most or even all aspects of our Constitution could be changed. We could even become an extremist Islamic state if the majority became large enough. Do you see nothing wrong with the degradation of our political and civic culture? Do you believe that ""might"" of numbers alone makes ""right""? If you think that reason plays no part, then you would have to admit that a statement ""the unborn is a person and people have rights and therefore abortion should be illegal"" would be equally valid as a statement ""only whites are people and only defined people have rights and therefore slavery should be legal"". Am I interpreting you correctly that proclamations don't have to be challenged? People can try to force whatever proclamation they want into law and, if they have the sufficient majority, they are certainly justified in doing so? If so, then I hope to God that your view does not become prevalent since it could easily lead to a despotic country where most of our freedoms are lost. As a pro-choice supporter, I would grudgingly accept abortion rights being restricted IF and ONLY IF they were restricted based on full rational debate. In contrast, the slaveholders were unwilling to have ANY debate on the subject. No amount of reasoning would have swayed them from their opinions set in stone. Don't you see the difference?","Steeeeve","274918","I'm sure they hoped they would be competent but there was no rule saying you had to be. Your claim is unfounded. The Church of England was an established religion for the country. The 1st amendment prohibited this but certainly didn't prohibit laws being introduced where the morality behind it is purely religious. Right, and that is the risk of a democracy. I got the impression you did. It seems I'm the only fighting the majority anyway. Right and Wrong, to me, is never determined by the majority. Again with the strawmans. I never said reason plays no part...I just said you can't reason the position. I am perfectly capable of claiming what a person is and if someone says ""only whites are people"" then I'd say they are wrong. What I wouldn't use is an argument saying ""don't push your beliefs on me"". Hate to break this to you but all laws are proclamations and yes they can be challenged. It just so happens that one that tries to define person will always have unfounded reasons. There is no law that is not based on a belief at its root. Once again, my arguement is that, if a group wants to impose their views on us, they need to present arguements that then go through a reasoned debate before they are enacted. Actually the slaverholders had plenty of debates on it. And they used the same reasoning the pro-choice folks use now...things like ""don't push your beliefs on me"" or ""you don't have to have a slave"" or ""they aren't people but subhuman and are meant to be enslaved"". All of those arguments were reasoned from an unfounded belief....much like the unfounded beliefs you and other pro-choicers hold.

Still you seem to find nothing wrong with a super-majority imposing its will on all in pushing laws with no reasons to support those laws. If I am wrong about this, then explain what I am misinterpreting. Nobody is claiming that nobody has a right to push any views on another. Again (and I don't know why you are not picking up on the difference), we claim that one cannot push views on us without reasoned debate. Also, if you are saying that reason does play some role, then what role do you say it plays? I hate to break this to you but, before the laws are written down in the form of a proclamation, reasons for them are presented and debated. This is true for the great majority of laws we have on the books. This has been lamented by older congressmen of both parties who remember a better time when issues such as whether we go into a particular war were hotly debated. That is an unsupported contention. Provide detailed arguements for that contention. If the slaveholders were held to a full debate where all claims had to be justified, they would have lost. Therefore, they did not choose to hold themselves accountable to any debate. It would have been hard to fully justify that any inherent difference between blacks and whites (which, contrary to their views, really only comes down to skin color) justified taking away rights. In comparison, those of us on the pro-choice side have fully supported reasons for saying that zygotes do not have rights. We are quite open to holding a debate on this issue and have confidence that we would be able to support our views. If some astounding new evidence or arguements were presented by your side that win the debate, then we would grudgingly accept the consequences (at least I would and many others on the pro-choice side). You seem to want to avoid that debate altogether. You seem to assume that you are not imposing your own limits on who gets rights and who doesnt. You take rights away from unfertilized eggs. Should I then claim that your arguments are just as bad as that of the slaveholders because you take it upon yourself to say that unfertilized eggs are not people and should not have rights?","Steeeeve","274961","and there is only one correct way to interpret a legal document. It happens to be the same way you interpret anything. I have a problem with people doing something that is wrong but I don't argue that you can't impose your will. You take the good with the bad in a democracy. Chemist never claimed this for one. And I deny you need a reasoned debate anyway.....I don't even know what a reasoned debate is to you. It seems when legislatures make laws they always have a debate then they vote. I'm lost on this...are you asking if reason plays a part in determining if something should be allowed to be pushed on another? If so, then reason is not a requirement to do so. I'd prefer that someone pushed the right thing rather than a faulty reasoned wrong thing. That doesn't make them any less of a proclamation. Reasons are debated but they don't have to be anything more than 'this is right'. hotly debated? Which ones??? Vietnam was debated like the war in iraq was. no, its not my main point. If you don't believe it then ignore it. Only if there is a standard by which they had to live up to. If they had debated and had to justify it in a Christian world view then they would have lost. If they had to justify it to society norms then they would have won. They did the latter. This is only true if there is an objective standard of who gets rights outside of what people create. They are no more supported than what the slaveholders had. You claim person means X and the slaveholders said person means Y. Both are just random claims that can't be justified but are the basis for your position. This is not true if you can show (or just claim) an outside standard that is true though. There is no evidence that would satisfy you as your have predefined person to exclude the fetus. At that point who wouldn't be for abortion. With slaveholders their definition excluded blacks and they had reasons which are just as wrong as yours. I certainly am imposing my own limits. I already told you I see no problem with this.

You have yet to prove that our arguements are ultimately based on proclamations. The only way to know for sure is to actually HOLD the debate to its conclusion.

It is a word that different people attach to different levels of human development because the criteria that people place for ""person"" is different for different viewpoints (just like you place the criteria that the human egg needs to be fertilized). The IMPORTANCE to that word is that we attach consequecnes to that term - such as rights. If no consequences were attached to that word, then why would that word be significant? You could call a mouse a person and nobody would care. We care because that word carries consequences - rights being the most important of these. It then makes sense to me to address the issue that IS important (i.e. rights and the detailed criteria of who gets them) as opposed to the six letter word ""person"".

Then, the question comes into play about which living beings of the human species get rights. There, our moral approach plays a role where I would give rights because I have empathy with the suffering or limitations in experiences of those whose rights are taken away, and I would give rights in all situations where I would expect to receive rights if I were in their shoes (where that is largely in situations where I would see myself suffering without rights).

For most of its history, ensoulment was thought to happen at ""quickening"", not at conception. It was only in the 19th century that abortion started being considered murder from conception on. A good web site which summarizes the history (with supporting references) is: http://www.religioustolerance.org/abo_hist.htm So, religious reasoning and Scriptural interpretation varied during Church history - even though they were talking about the same text, the Bible. As for the general subject of views being imposed on a populace: I think, in general, the great majority of people have SOME level of logic in discussing reasons behind their views. Even the worst dictators and murderers had some justification in mind when they committed their heinous acts - though in nearly all cases, it would have been hard for them to support their reasons with evidence. I think that is what would limit the extent of brutal behavior in people and nations, were full rational supportable debate allowed - the desire of most people to justify their behavior with logical reasons. Logical reasons depend on one's assumptions. Religious reasoning is ultimately based on faith (which is essentially traditional guesses) and is not supportable with empirical evidence, as Scientific reasoning is. Therefore, despite many good influences that have come from religion, religious reasoning has also been a major cause of various brutal conclusions and actions. Scientific and secular reasoning, on the other hand, could potentially have stopped many of the brutal treatments of the past by proving to the Southerners that blacks are indeed not automatically inferior because of their race, by proving to Hitler that it was only a small subset of Jews that were responsible for Germany's loss during World War I (and other accusations he held against the Jews) not all of them, by provint to the Aztecs and Mayans that human sacrifice plays no role whatsoever in the movement of the sun, etc. Scientific and secular reasoning may not guarantee a world that we would all be happy with, but it would have eliminated many of the injustices that this world has historically experienced. As for the question of when rights start: Yes, one cannot prove what a person is by science, but one can include a list of important criteria for why creatures get rights, argue why those criteria are important, and then use science to support claims as to when some of those criteria arise.","abortion-euthanization","10:33 AM","abortion-debates","186"

Also, where, in the DOI, does it say that all humans have rights? All I see is ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights..."". As a matter of fact, if one takes the DOI literally, then only men are created equal, so women don't count apparently. Anyway, the DOI is praised not because it is the basis to our view on morality but because it is the founding document in our country in telling the Brits to bugger off. Psychology is supported by evidence - mainly observation, some limited experimentation, and statistical surveys. Psychologists claim that a distinguishing mark of psycopaths is that they do not have empathy. Also, psychology does not address the issue of rights. I am trying to understand your question. It was a response to my quoted post, in which I wrote, ""If, as a society, we prefer having people help each other out and try to limit situations where people suffer, then empathy is an emotion that it would make sense to encourage since it could be effective in achieving that goal. "" What, in that analysis, are you challenging?","Steeeeve","275939","I said it was a fundamental truth that humans have rights. this doesn't make it not a truth.

"08-01-2007","10129",14,"Another opinion","275967","People speak of human rights but human, there, is only used as a differentiation from animal. It is not meant to define when those rights begin in a human life form. It also uses the adjective ""human"" as opposed to the noun ""a human"", where human eggs are also human. Basically, you are playing a game of choosing those definitions which suite you to try to argue that a point is a fundamental truth. Even if one does claim that it refers to ""a human"", then there are multiple definitions of ""a human"" - only one of which is ""member of the species homo sapien"" which could be argued that a zygote is such a member (others might argue that ""member"" requires more than just a full set of DNA and the start of the growth process). Another definition of ""a human"" is ""a person"", which people interpret differently since the definition is not fixed. So your arguement is far from a fundamental truth. Stating it doesn't make it true. Your stating it doesn't make it true either. Women had far fewer rights than men for most of the history of the US. I am not at all convinced that they included women in this term, given the attitudes about women at the time. Considering that they didn't include blacks in equal rights either, this term seemed to be quite limited. What do you mean when you say what SUPPORTS observation? Unless one is experiencing a halucination or optical illusion, what one observes (the sky is blue today) is true. Psychologists have investigated enough people that they have a good representative sample by now. There conclusions are not just based on guesses. I presented empathy as a main motivation for rights because it is what I most often hear appealed to (many pro-life arguements included) when people argue that certain people should have certain rights. It also coincides with my own moral approach. There are no absolute rules about rights. Rights are assigned by groups and governments. It is just that empathy is what is used most often (either directly or indirectly) in arguing for particular rights.","Steeeeve","275974","If you don't think humans have fundamental rights then I feel sorry for you and it is no wonder we have had things like slavery and the holocaust.

I have empathy for my cat but I don't think she deserves rights. Perhaps it is not a main motivation for rights but rather a means to ensure rights remain among others?

I am waiting for those hypothetical debatable reasons. As for point 2, we would have to explore why rights are given to begin with. I would again argue that empathy drives much of our reasoning in terms of people getting rights to begin with, and empathy is what is most often appealed to when people are deprived of rights. I would also discuss the differences in consequences if a mentally existing being is deprived of rights vs a non-mentally existing life-form. I would further question your arguement in asking why a zygote should get rights and not an unfertilized egg - in questioning YOUR reasons for rights. There are many points to debate. Empathy is feeling for another by trying to imagine their suffering, experiences, emotions, etc. One cannot empathize with a rock, because a rock does not suffer, have experiences, emotions, etc. (Children, such as those with ""pet rocks"", might imagine a personality in that rock, but that is not real.) An early fetus also cannot suffer, have experiences, emotions, etc. I also mentioned the reason of lack of reciprocity. Animals cannot control their behavior. Therefore, they do not get the same rights. Children and severely mentally incapacitated people also do not get the same rights. However, we do not allow ourselves to kill them, as we do many animals. I already admitted to not being fully fair to animals because of that bias for my species.

But to pass that three part test you claim empathy have to be the factor...and round and round we go. Isn't ""mental existence"" being a factor just an unsupported proclamation?

"08-02-2007","10129",16,"Another opinion","276132","Rights are a social construct delegated by the societies that allocate them. They exist to begin with because the negative consequences associated with not having rights led underprivileged groups to demand their rights. They came about historically because some groups (Monarchy, Aristocracy, etc.) were treated by law in a far better manner than other groups (Merchant class, peasants, etc.) where the reasons given for the preferred treatment (ex. a claim of divine right) was not accepted by many people and was unsupportable. The people suffered under the reduced rights and were not given reasonable reasons for that. The rights typically came about because of comparison with the rights of privileged classes in arguments that basically came down to ""Why should THEY get to have these rights, and we don't"". These questions were being asked more often to begin with because of the influence of Enlightment thought, where it was thought that reason could explain everything in the world. Sometimes, this push for rights led to the classes with fewer rights gaining rights. Sometimes, it led to privileged classes losing rights (ex. losing the privilege not to pay taxes). Either way, it was the negative consequences of not having rights (suffering either mental or physical) that drove those with fewer rights to demand and win rights. Privileged classes usually had a wide range of reasons why they thought they should maintain their privileges but they used their political power to avoid being held accountable for those reasons. Therefore, things did not change until the people were fed up enough to use their own power of numbers in revolutions (17th Century English Revolution, 18th Century US and French Revolutions, etc.) and either open or assumed threat of revolution to force their rights to be accepted. Ultimately, the ideal became that all people should be viewed equally under the law. Again, this historical change was driven by the people who suffered under unequal rights. In practice, even in what is considered the ideal, rights are not perfectly equal but can be taken away for reasons. For example, children and severely mentally incapacitated adults have little control over their behavior and have very limited powers of reasoning. Therefore, their freedoms (ex. of movement, of major decisions) are restricted and few contest those restrictions (except for teenagers). Others, such as criminals, get rights taken away as a consequence to their actions. Sometimes rights are restricted because they interfere with the rights of others (ex. you dont have the right to take other peoples property). So, I would say that rights exist to begin with because of the negative consequence of not having rights (mental and/or physical suffering) and rights are unequal when there are debatable accepted reasons for those rights not to be equal (children, mentally incapacitated adults, criminals, etc.). Since rights exist to begin with because of the mental and/or physical suffering caused by not having rights, when rights are denied a particular group, then it is an appeal to the suffering of that group and the sense of Why are they excluded from rights you take for granted that is the common response. Part of this is an appeal to empathy and part is an appeal for fairness (equal rights unless you present a reason why they should not be equal). At least these are the appeals that have been used in debates on rights up to now. Without mental existence, most rights are irrelevant (ex. right to property, rights to act in certain ways, etc.). If one talks about rights of a non-mentally existing being to life, then the question arises what are the negative consequences of destroying that life? For a mentally existing being, mental and physical suffering could result. For a non-mentally existing being but one that could become a mentally-existing being, the consequences are the curtailing of the potential to grow into more. That is true both for early fetuses and for unfertilized eggs, just to different degrees since one is much farther along the process than the other. Since the traditional appeal to empathy for suffering does not work in this case, then one would need to appeal to the importance of the negative consequence of losing potential in comparison to the negative consequences of a woman being forced against her will to carry that fetus (which IS a traditional appeal to empathy). One would also have to explain where one would place the limit of the potential argument (early fetus vs unfertilized egg) and why. This is a very different arguement than has been used for gaining rights in the past and has shown itself to be a hard sell in situations where reasoned argument prevails, as opposed to religious or other proclamations. Marriage is a social construct. I wouldnt say that there is a right to marriage but if you grant it to one group of people then you have to have good reasons for not granting it to another. Any being that can suffer, feel pain, emotion, have experiences, etc. is a being that can be empathized with. It is harder to empathize with lower animals because we might well be attaching emotions and feelings to it that it is not capable of having. That is probably true for the ant. I can try to guess what it is feeling based on its actions but, without close consultation with scientists who have analyzed its neural network, I would probably be wrong in my guess. It is much easier with people (at least the normal range of people) since we ourselves have had similar experiences to those we would empathize with we would be much more likely to be accurate in our estimations of what they are experiencing and feeling. I would be open to discussing potential animal rights but would prefer if it were moved to another thread, since it would be too much of a tangent to this thread. There are many potentially related points we could address, but we have to keep in mind how much those points make us digress from the main point. You yourself have used this argument before, so I will use it here. Lets stick to the human species. It is UNSUPPORTED proclamations I am against. It is the support (reasons) behind the proclamations which are important. Which proclamations have I made which I have not tried to support with reasons?","Steeeeve","276140","So we are back to what is a person... I hope we aren't confusing legal and philosophical rights here. I disagree that those with handicaps have natural rights restricted. I also disagree that there ever was a ""right to take others property"". None of this answered my question about why you should get rights. Again, if you use empathy then we have done circular reasoning. I can show you how if you like. But this is simply a proclamation. You think rights are useless if you can't understand or feel anything if they are gone. I disagree. We are also using circular reasoning here. Why is empathy important...because that is what we use to create/give rights...well who gets those rights...those with mental existence...why is mental existence important...because we have empathy for certain beings. Round and round. You can look at that a few ways...anyone really is allowed to marry. This is more a side thing so we can drop it...I was just wondering if you thought it was a right. Is equality a right? It certainly is not a tangent. If you can't explain to me why empathy for one ""group"" is not as important than empathy for another group then you have violated your test that you gave me. It still is a proclamation anyway and if you want to stick with the human species then I suppose you admit then that the unborn is a member of the human species. This gets me back to the idea that one should never discriminate against any human and to do so would be just as bad as the slaveholders. Your reasons are basically that you believe in empathy and mental existence. Either way, it comes down to beliefs and any belief is by itself an unsupported proclamation which can only be supported by faith.","abortion-euthanization","02:31 PM","abortion-debates","227"

"08-03-2007","10129",16,"Another opinion","276164","No. How did you come to that conclusion from the section that you quoted? What are you calling ""philosophical rights""? Ideally, rights one derives from philosophical / rational arguements should be equal to legal rights. I though we were discussing what we thought actual (ultimately legal) rights SHOULD be and why. What do you think we are discussing? I didn't say those with handicaps have limited rights. People with paralized legs have just as many rights as anyone else. They just have limited mobiility that they try to get around with wheelchairs and ramps. I was talking about people with such limited mental capability (due to birth defects or brain damage) that, for example, they do not realize that it is dangerous to walk full speed into heavy traffic, or walk off a bridge to try to catch the pretty butterfly. They may want to go running after that butterfly but you restrict their rights for their own good by restricting their freedom of movement. I used the historical reasons why rights were introduced to begin with, and those had a lot to do with people wanting to avoid the suffering caused by limited rights and the sense of unfairness that someone just like them but who is born into a noble family should get rights that they don't because of bogus excuses (ex. divine rights). Rights do not exist as some perminent fixed abstract entity (I suspect you think they do). They are social constructs dictated by a society. From that point of view, it is important to note what drives societies to give rights to begin with. I just think that it is important that societies take all arguements into account when making decisions - which means debating the reasons until there is nothgin left to debate. Just because there were historical reasons for rights to exist does not mean that we have to restrict ourselves to the historical reason. However, if you want to deviate from historical motivations for rights, you need to present new compelling reasons. So, what are YOUR reasons for thinking that rights exist? Rights of a zygote to act in certain ways is irrelevant if it has no capability of ""acting"" anyway. Rights of freedom of speech for a zygote is useless if it has no capability of communicating. Other rights are useful such as a right to life of a zygote. However, such a right is just as useful for an unfertilized egg. The consequences of either a zygote or egg being destroyed are nearly the same. I do not have a fully explored theory on rights of animals so I cannot present one to you. Nobody has claimed other rights for animals in this thread so there is no compelling reason to address it. If this were a thread about animal rights, I would explore the reasoning. I might even be convinced by certain arguements. As it is, the subject is only tangentially relevant. I will try to think about it and address it if and only if you address the issue of why YOU think rights exist to begin with and answer my points, as I am answering yours. I don't know where you are getting this from. Please re-read my post. Is it irrelevant to you why rights were historically introduced in civilizations to begin with? I think that the reasons people introduced rights to begin with are very relevant to why rights exist now. I suspect you are unable to get around your idea of unsupported proclamations. The slaveholders similarly used unsupported proclamations to justify their stance (or at least did not allow any debate on the bogus reasons they gave for their proclamations).","Steeeeve","276260","You spoke of people getting rights and why...it only leaves the question of what a person is. I claim that blacks always had certain rights even if they were not legally recognized. I disagree they have restricted natural rights. This doesn't answer the question about why you should have rights. Still a proclamation as who cares what the consequences are. Part of this thread is exploring why one can have empathy for many living creatures yet give different rights to them. Seems this suggests another criteria is needed. Is it that you only have a certain amount of empathy for certain levels of ""mental existence""? If this is the case then some animals would beat out a new born baby in terms of rights they should get. It is irrelevant if you can't tell me the origin. The origin is a belief system. I agree they were unsupported but they problem was not that but rather they were untrue. I'm suggesting yours are both unsupported and untrue as well.

"08-03-2007","10129",16,"Another opinion","276263","I think that a major difference between our two views is that you think that there are some natural rights that are automatically inherent in people that exist external to any political structure. Indeed, I agree that the Declaration of Independence does imply natural rights. However, the trouble with the natural rights concept is that you are back to square one in trying to define what those rights are to begin with and when in the life of a human entity those rights start (unfertilized egg, zygote, early fetus, late fetus, birth, adulthood, etc.). Different philosophers who studied natural rights came up with different conclusions about which rights are natural rights. So, that brings us back to defining rights based on debated reasons for those rights, just as you would in the ideal case for legal rights. As the philosopher, Jonathan Wallace put it: I just think that, in debating reasons for having rights to begin with, it is important to view why rights were introduced historically. If one wants to include new reasons for rights, one can then introduce the reasons and debate them. As I said, I would be able to further debate this if and only if you would be willing to outline YOUR reasons for having rights to begin with. If you agree, then I will agree. I never agreed to a one-sided debate. It has to be two-sided. The origin is the motivations which drove people to demand rights to begin with, and the reasoning they used to push them. Here, I think we are again running into a difference in outlook. You think that there are natural rights that exist in some ideal abstract realm which automatically attach to people. I think that people of a group are the ones that determine rights for that group but, in order to make them as just as possible, one needs to fully debate the reasons behind those rights. And for that, historical reasons are what one looks at first.","Steeeeve","276310","I disagree with Wallace as he infers no natural rights in his statement.

The trouble is, how do you define those natural rights to begin with? By gut reaction? By religious creed? Is there a way to do it by pure reasoning (as some philosophers try to do)? I think that, though some things can be determined logically, others are based on value judgements (ex. value of the potential of an embryo vs a woman's right to her own body). If you claim that there is only one way of defining natural rights, then prove it by explaining that method. Otherwise, you will have to acknowledge that even the idea of natural rights are relative and depend on the reasoning or gut feelings of the particular philosopher. If natural rights are determined just by gut feeling, or particular religious creeds, then they are open to such a wide interpretation that injustice can easily creep in. For example, various traditional cultures automatically assume that women or people of different religions or ethnic groups do not get the same rights because it is ordained so by God. 2) Rights determined by full debated reasons and evidence, where applicable. : This is what I support since I think that it is the method which can lead to the most just system of rights. Debate does not mean that, in the end, someone can answer ""because I say so"" or ""because it is so"" or ""because such and such a book tells me so"". Debate means supporting everything one says with evidence or rational explanation. It may well be that the discussion will ultimately come down to a value judgement but at least the debate that one had along the way would have eliminated all or most of the bogus reasoning that most often leads to unjust systems of rights (such as the Southerners assumptions of the inherent inferiority of the African races). 3) The actual way rights are determined: The actual way rights are determined, at least in our Democracy, unfortunately includes the greatly flawed system where people often do not make decisions based on rational reasons but based on gut reaction, political allegiances, self interest indifferent to others, ego, etc. I agree to your concern in thinking that politically derived rights may be very unjust compared to the rights that many think one SHOULD have, since politically derived rights are rights that are set down by a very flawed system.

Perhaps we can continue to do so at least by our own assessment of such things.","Another opinion","276404","I agree that we have improved and that the trend in politics has generally been toward a more just system. However, I think it is important that the real political system keep in mind what the ideal, in my view, SHOULD be - namely, a system where decisions truly take all arguements and evidence into account, weighing the pros and cons. I am afraid that we are losing touch with that ideal, and that can be dangerous for our democracy. What I am particularly afraid of is the non-insignificant numbers of the religious right who would impose their will on others based on religious creed, not rational arguement. I am afraid when I look at this administration which so often has ignored the reality of the situation (such as the fact that Iraq wouldn't just neatly fall into peaceful Democracy grateful to America as soon as Saddam was toppled). Decisions have been made too often by gut reaction, political creed, and not debated understanding of the pros and cons of particular actions.

"08-06-2007","10129",17,"Another opinion","276498","Then how do YOU determine what natural rights are. If they are based on religious assumptions, then someone of another religioius belief could just as easily say that your idea of natural rights is incorrect. Indeed, the slaveholders thought that their view of blacks as inferior and justified as being slaves was supported by Christian doctrine. There are apparently many passages in the Bible (mainly the Old Testament) that talk about slavery as a normal occurrence. If there is no basis behind what one determines to be natural rights, then your view is just as arbitrarily chosen as that of the slaveholders. My view is different than the first one (natural rights) because most people's system of judgement is not either purely value judgement or purely reason. We are creatures of BOTH reason and emotion. Most of the attrocities I can think of in human history (apart from the occasional attrocities of people who felt no need to justify themselves) were due to reasons that could have been debated away. The slaveholders held their views about the inferiority of blacks not because of the skin color itself (it would have been hard to justify that rationaly) but because they felt that races with darker skin were inherently inferior. This would have been much harder to prove were they ever to be held accountable to that. It was a wrong understanding of reality that could have been cleared up with rational debate. The same is true about discrimination against women. The treatment was largely based on wrong assumptions that could have been eliminated in rational debate. Hitler blamed all Jews for actions that only a small minority was guilty of. Most wars that are fought are filled with propaganda which villifies the enemy and makes him seem sub-human. Most or all of this wrong thinking could have been eliminated with rational debate (assuming that the debate actually would have stayed rational and people would have held themselves accountable to it). Yes, often the debate might ultimately come down to value judgements, but meanwhile, one has eliminated all the bogus reasoning that has so often led to injustice. Your method (i.e. jumping to assumptions about what natural rights are) allows the bogus reasoning to remain and allows more injustice to happen. Lastly, a debate that uses reason that ultimately leads to a value judgment does not automatically lead to selfish conclusions. People treat others well not only for selfish reasons (treating others well so they would also be treated well) but because of empathy as well. It is the culture that inspires empathy. It doesn't matter if it is religious or secular. There are both religious and secular cultures that have inspired noble acts, just as there are both religious and secular cultures that have inspired attrocities. I get so tired of people suggesting that those who don't base their morality on religion are automatically selfish. History does not bear that out. Politics had a lot to do with it since the founders fully realized that the Southerners had no intention of holding themselves accountable to real discussions about slavery. Also, the values were incorrect because they were based on bogus reasoning - in that the Southerners thought blacks were automatically inferior and that slavery was their natural state. Again, all of that could have been eliminated with rational debate. Most people on the pro-choice side would see a right to one's own body as a natural right. Unless there is some rational way of defining natural rights, everyone can just go with their own view, which leaves us back at the starting point of might of numbers making right. I just think that rational debate is ultimately better than might of numbers as a determination of who gets rights, what kind and when.","Steeeeve","276696","And just as arbitrary as yours. The only difference is theirs was wrong and mine is not. Again you can't rationalize with something unless their is a standard of comparison. By this I mean you couldn't tell a slaveholder he is wrong in saying blacks aren't people unless you have a correct definition of what a person is. If you compared their own definition of person and how they acted then it would be very reasonable but very wrong. You want to talk about how most atrocities happen? They happen when people try to justify a difference between human and person and try to rank accordingly. Of course you think you have rational reasons now but those in the past felt they had rational reasons then too. Hindsight is 20/20 as they say. The first and second are still the same anyway as they all come down to value judgment or they come down to a circular argument. circular arguments are bogus reasoning. Stating natural rights is merely showing faith. I go beyond that. I say everyone is automatically selfish. And history has shown this to be true. I go further and state that only way to try to become less selfish is to have a morality outside your own control. They had many discussions on slavery. In fact you could just look to the Lincoln Douglas debates for an example. There were many many many debates and they would be wrong.

"08-07-2007","10129",19,"Another opinion","276893","I do think there is an absolute reality out there. For example, I am nearly 100% certain that the sun, earth and moon are real, that the computer in front of me is real, etc. There was a whole discussion on this in the ""Metaphysical Discussions"" thread many months back. However, where morality is concerned, that I do not view as an absolute because it is something invented by people and, since people vary, the ideal morality would vary. You may claim that the morality you hold, which comes from your religion, is the one that is absolutely true, but that is just an unsupported claim on your part. Slaveholders also made unsupported claims and were just as certain that they were right as you are. Since human psychology varies, the things they value ultimately have some variety. When people make decisions, they make them mainly out of a combination of reasoning and value judgements - a combination of logic and emotion. When logic is flawed, rational debate can correct that. For example, the claims of slaveholders that blacks were inherently inferior was flawed - rational debate and demonstration could have corrected that (if it were given a chance). I'm not sure what you are calling circular reasoning. If it is merely the fact that there is no one fixed answer and that it ultimately comes down to a value judgement, then you are forgetting that the main goal of the rational debate is to eliminate the bogus reasoning that surrounds that value judgmenet - where it is the bogus reasoning that has historically been a main cause of attrocities. I keep saying over and over and over that I would demonstrate to them that blacks are not inherently inferior to whites. Do you claim that is an impossible task? When children argue with each other back and forth just yelling out their views ""It's A"", ""No, it's B"", ""No, it's A"", ""No, it's B""... that is irrational. Rational arguements address the concerns of the other side and support ones own views with evidence or at least with more reasoning. Are you claiming that southerners would have been able to support their view of the inferiority of blacks in full rational debate without resorting to irrational arguements such as ""because I say so"" or ""because such and such a quotation from the Bible says so""? If so, then lets hold a mock debate to see. I would ask them why red haired people have less rights. You give people too little credit for having some level of rationality. You had mentioned the Lincoln/Douglas debates, so I Googled those and started reading the first one. All I read over many pages were debates about politics, not about essence. I did not read a debate which came down to ""Why do you think blacks should be slaves"" and then questioned in detail each point brought up, including challenges to Biblical quotations. If you know of such a detailed arguement, please post a link to it. By full rational debate, I do not mean a debate that just skims along the surface of the issue. I mean one that delves fully into it, questioning everything without fear of political reprecusssions. Rational debate, from the example of the Lincoln/Douglas debate which you mentioned, did not delve nearly deep enough. If you know of a particular debate which did delve deeply into the theoretical basis of why blacks were slaves, then please point me to it. Thn we are going in circles because pro-choice people would say that a right to ones own body is a natural right. You disagree, but neither side is absolutely right in their claim since THERE ARE NO ABSOLUTELY DEFINED NATURAL RIGHTS. If you claim there are, prove it. That is why I am holding up rational debate as the ideal. I know fully well that people are stubborn and will not submit to rational debate if it is inconvenient for them. I just claim that a culture where rational debate is held up as the ideal and is stressed will be more likely for people to participate in rational debate as compared to a culture where rational debate is not considered important. My arguements are supported by evidence and I could counter their points. Their evidence was only superficial and would have been knocked down if full debate was allowed. Again, please point me to a specific location, either in the Lincoln/Douglas debates or otherwise, where you thought that the southerners presented arguements which could not have been knocked down with rational debate. All of the arguements I have ever read about from them could easily have been knocked down, but it is possible that there is an arguement I missed. If so, then point that out. Otherwise, your claim that rational debate could not have countered their argument is groundless.","Steeeeve","276908","And yours are unsupported too. No, and you can't show that it would. I disagree, bogus beliefs cause this. Circular reasoning is when you can't prove anything and so you refer to a previously made claim to prove that same claim. It also can be called begging the question. It is only possible if you change a belief like I said. For this to be true you have to state that one belief is wrong and another is right. Considering all thoughts come down to beliefs then a debate on the reasonings from those beliefs would be fairly easy for me to win. Again, the only way to challenge a belief is to indicate there is a right one that they do not adhere to (other than showing they are inconsistent in their own belief). Because they believe red haired people have less rights. It all comes down to beliefs or circular reasoning like I said. You can't argue with the conclusion based upon that fundamental belief. There were 7 debates for one thing. Slavery was the main issue in all of these (and a large part the expansion of it). I'm not gonna give you a history lesson on the debates over slavery. If you don't believe they happened then you are a fool. We had a civil war over it. I know where this is going. You will say they didn't do it ""rationally"" enough because the techniques now are so infallible. Of course they thought the same thing at the time and thus hindsight being 20/20. Nevertheless, full out debates were had all over the place during the time period and yet things were never solved. This was actually the first link on google when searching for said debates: http://zorak.monmouth.edu/~afam/abolition2.html We could even look at the congress debates on slavery...or even in England when they were debating the issue. I can't remember the movie off the top of my head but it came out this year and referred to slavery being ended in England and the consistent debate they had over it. Not being able to prove, once again, does not mean they don't exist. I maintain they exist and that is purely a matter of faith. And yet my point is rational debate is fine but you aren't going to convince someone they are wrong on a point unless you can provide a right answer. Your rational for abortion is not going to fail in any logic because it is reasonable based on your unsupported beliefs. This is true for me as well. The only way to address this would then to show why your beliefs are wrong and mine are not...or visa versa. You don't get that this doesn't matter. Evidence to support your own reasoning that comes from a belief does you no good when the other has another belief. You are flawed in your thinking here because you belief a slaveholder is starting from the same premise as you when they clearly are not. This premise is supported only by belief (or circular reasoning which is not really a support) and thus you would have to convince someone the belief is wrong and there is no evidence that could do that....just claims and perhaps showing of those claims. I believe whites are inherently inferior to blacks and therefore they can be slaves. I'd like to see you knock down that claim with your so called evidence. Don't try to ask for reasons because I stated it was a belief. I already told you all things come down to a belief (if consistent).","abortion-euthanization","01:38 PM","abortion-debates","275"

"08-07-2007","10129",19,"Another opinion","276924","I have presented no bogus reasoning, as the slaveholders had. You are seriously claiming that there are no rational arguement that can show that blacks are not inherently inferior to whites? You mean like claiming that zygotes are people who deserve rights? All thoughts do not come down to beliefs. Unless you want to get into metaphysical discussions, the thought that the ground is hard, or the sun is hot today, is not a belief - it is an observation. Observations are not the same thing as beliefs. Noticing that the sun is hot is an observation. Thinking that the hot sun is moved around by the God Apollo is a belief. All I am asking for from you is one reason which the slaveholders gave which could not have been countered by rational debate (again, rational debate forcing the slaveholders to give layers of reasons or evidence behind their answers). Is this too much to ask of you? You are the one claiming that rational debate could not have resolved this issue. If this is what you claim, then show why. The ultimate decision on abortion may come down to a value judgement, but many arguements could be made along the way. For example, one could hold a rational debate about when mental existence starts. Since souls are a sort of supernatural mental existence, it would be required of you to present arguements and evidence about why you think souls exist and why you think they would start at conception. I could show scientific evidence on my side of the arguement. In arguing whether mental existence is important, we could address the issue of the consequences of a non-mentally existing being being killed vs a mentally existing being being killed. There would be many points to address. There are no absolute answers either way, but there are many levels of reasoning that people go through to get to an answer. Rational debate can help eliminate some of the bogus paths that people take and which have often led to attrocities or injust actions. If slaveholders were able to stick with a rational debate, then they would have had to concede that blacks were not inherently inferior. I just do not know why you do not see this. Well, first I would ask you why you think whites are inherently inferior to blacks. You made the claim and used it to reduce rights. The responsibility is yours to show that whites are inferior. Go ahead... I will then counter your arguements.","Steeeeve","276926","I still maintain some of the reasoning the slaveholders had was no bogus either. Seems irrelevant though. Not without addressing the belief. If one is inherently considered inferior then what good are you to say someone is smarter? That isn't really a consideration. How is the circular? It is a belief..ends there. No, that is still a belief. You assume many thing when claiming the sun is hot one of which is your observation is actually the reality. whites have white skin blacks don't. That is one reason. I also didn't claim ""rational debate"" couldn't solve the issue. I said it couldn't solve the issue unless you are willing to address the belief as false. No, it is the incorrect belief that causes atrocities. Your arguments on abortion already have an inherent bias in what we should be looking for and debating. I disagree with all of those as I don't feel mental existence is important at all and I don't think consequences are important in decided that matter either. Because inherent means ""built-in"". How would you ever rationally convince someone that another is not inherently different unless you change that fundamental belief. The only way to do this is to say there is another belief that is true. To do that (in the slaveholder case) you'd have to use the argument Lincoln did. Because it is my belief that it is so. It is inherent. I like how you asked for reasons when I told you what I'd say.","abortion-euthanization","02:51 PM","abortion-debates","280"

"08-07-2007","10129",19,"Another opinion","276943","There are objective tests to see whether one person is smarter than another. If a black person did better on such a test than a white person, that would show that, in that particular case, the black person was smarter. If someone has a belief that cannot be nudged by arguements and evidence from reality, then that is not rational. I am talking about rational arguements all this time. The question of how to deal with irrational people is another one all together. Where irrational people are concerned, who stubornly stick to their views no matter what arguement is presented, then one can only deal with them by a fight of numbers in a Democracy. I am not so naive as to think that everyone will comply with rational arguement. However, as I stated before, a society which holds rational argument in high esteem will have a lot more people willing to be subject to rational arguement. If that is what you call a belief, then you are so ungrounded in reality that I don't know how to proceed with a discussion with you. There are some things that all or nearly all people accept as true - one being that the sun is hot. Bottom line is that there are SOME things that are accepted by nearly everyone as true because there is such extraordinary evidence of it being true. If you think that evidence doesn't matter, then we might as well end this discussion right now and call it a day since we really have no common base to argue from. That doesn't say WHY you would deprive blacks of rights - where a reason is needed if they would want to hold a rational debate. Also, if you claim that it is by skin color alone, then if blacks would paint their faces white or chemically lighten their skin, then they would have gotten equal rights. Conversely, when whites tan their faces, their rights get reduced because the skin gets darker. Of course you have to address their belief in the inferiority of blacks as false, but you address it with rational debate. If you just tell them that their belief is false because your view is right, then you will be unconvincing unless you can fully support why your view is right while showing how theirs is wrong. All of this also assumes, of course, that they are willing to listen to you and be subject to the outcome of the debate which slave holders were unwilling to do. Here, we are talking idealized case of slaveholders that actually were willing to hold themselves accountable to rational debate. What reasons DO you think are important in deciding the matter? All I hear from you are proclamations that it is wrong, not specifically why apart from more proclamations (it is a person). When I try to nail you down on what specifically a person is - precise definition (ex. human DNA, start of growth process, etc.) - and why those characteristics are important then you often sidestep the question. By ""built-in"", I mean characteristics that are inherited and are not dependent upon environment. For example, you could compare blacks vs whites who grew up under the same socio-economic circumstances - ex. compare their test scores on a variety of capabilities. You can't hold a full rational debate without reasons. I am not saying just any debate would convince them, I am saying that full rational debate would convince them, which, as I have stated before, would require reasons and evidence to back up statements. If you don't want to give reasons, then you are not holding a full rational debate.","Steeeeve","276948","My point was intelligence has nothing to do with an inherent level of thinking. I'd say it is true as well but I can't prove that it is true. Its called faith. Like I said, we all have it. What do you mean that doesn't say why? Don't tell me the reasons have to convince you...you just asked for a reason. You can attempt to address a belief with rational debate but you aren't gonna get very far with the things you gave me because none of those address the belief. You seem to think there has to be a reason behind a belief when this is impossible without creating circular reasoning. So if the belief is simply that blacks are inferior to whites then you can't address reasons why they are because it is a belief in and of itself. A human being is what is important and it is important because human beings have inherent natural rights. Is this a proclamation? yes. But I see nothing wrong with this. Doesn't exactly matter what you want it to mean. I used inherent meaning that is the starting point. Why would I care about test scores if I never made a claim regarding intelligence? When we were talking about it earlier you could never give me reasons for why mental existence is important or should be valued. Whenever you tried it ended up going to empathy and then circled back around to mental existence and once again made circular arguments. If you want to talk about the slavery issue then you have to look beyond just the few reasons you can easily refute as these were merely cover-ups reasons for how they felt (an inherent bias against blacks). The claims of intelligence lacking in blacks was actually backed up with evidence at the time (scientific evidence) so it seems even that claim would be hard for you to refute since they would in fact have evidence.

"08-20-2007","10129",20,"Another opinion","276965","What do you mean by ""inherent level of thinking""? There is lots of evidence for a hot sun. For example, one could easily show that areas that have had access to sunlight are hotter than areas that have not and the more open the access to sunlight for longer periods, the warmer the region becomes. Also, one can send a space probe into the sun to measure the temperature as it approaches it. One can also measure the spectrum from the sun, where experiment and theoretical analysis has shown that heat causes particular spectral signatures. All of this, of course, puts value on organized observation via scientific method - i.e. evidence. There are other types of evidence (ex. anecdotal) as well, but scientific evidence generally has the advantage of being repeatable and observable by anyone who wants to observe it. Faith is belief without evidence. There is a big difference between faith and scientific understanding, which is based on a lot of evidence. Do you seriously think that evidence plays no role? When I gave my reasons for claiming that, to me and most others, mental existence is important, I did not end it there. I responded to the why, how and what questions. Ultimately, the debate came down to the fact that we humans are inherently (from our evolution / biology) capable of empathy and empathy has historically been a main driving force for rights. It is what is most often appealed to, directly or indirectly, when rights are taken away. How is that circular? First you have to define what inferior is. How is one group inferior to the other and how is that relevant to rights? These types of questions are how rational debates are held. I suspect that the reason for that is that you claim to know it is right since you claim that your religion defines the absolute truth. Your religion tells you that zygotes have souls and that, therefore, they are people whereas unfertilized eggs are not. (or at least that is the difference you outlined in an earlier thread). You know that your views are based on faith, not on evidence or fully debatable reasons, so you try to claim that no other views involve debatable reasons or evidence either - a false claim. Here we were addressing the fact that southerners claimed that blacks were inherently inferior - and they didn't mean that they were equal in all ways except for skin color. So, the question arises - how were they thought inferior? Most aspects of human nature are testable - from intelligence, to physical fitness, to questions of courage, etc. I never claimed that there is an absolute criteria for rights. I claimed that for most people, empathy plays a role, since most appeals I have heard of for rights appeal either directly or indirectly to empathy and since the historic roots of people striving for rights was because they were suffering without them. Rights are desired and given by people, after all. I argued that it is an inherent capability in most of us (as claimed by psychologists). As for whether one can empathize accurately with a being with no mental existence, apart from the type of empathy that is a false attachment of personality (such as with pet rocks), the very definition of empathy requires a mental existence in the one you are empathizing with. How is all that circular? But that is why I bring up ""inherent"" inferiority. Of course, someone who was brought up as a slave would have much less knowledge and intellectual adaptness (on average) than someone who was brought up as the son of a rich man. However, if you take the socio-economic considerations into account, then the differences would have been much, much smaller.","Steeeeve","279437","I'm not sure I know a way to explain that further. It is the foundational thinking I suppose. This isn't truth though. This is simply making conclusions based upon accepted assumptions that most agree with (such as definition of hot, what observation is, that we are in fact existing...etc etc). Plays no role in what? And I kind of agree with your definition but everything would still come down to faith...at least faith in a few ideas. I'll address how it is circular. You claim you only have empathy for those with mental existence. That is fine but why do you think mental existence is important? The answer to that question (which we have done) simply gets back to empathy which creates the circular argument. It further doesn't address the question about how you give rights to something if you don't have empathy for it. If you had no empathy for a certain class of people then how do you convince them they should? Likely you would claim mental existence is important but that is simply an opinion and a matter of faith and inconsistent among species. They are inherently inferior. This is relevant to rights because of the belief that rights are granted to those who are of equal value. Not only that, I claim reasons do not have evidence that is relevant and that your claims are based on faith. They are thought to be inherently inferior. It just so happens that the only way to tell who is inferior is by the skin color and that is rather testable. While I disagree with some stuff here it is irrelevant since you seem to think there is no absolute criteria for rights. If there is no absolute criteria then I have a heard time understanding why my criteria is wrong. Perhaps there is an absolute criteria for determining if your method of evaluating rights is reasonable? I disagree and I'm not alone in this thinking. Of course with legal rights I do agree but I am under the impression we aren't talking about those. Empathy is actually something learned and is only partially inherent. Well for one we assume empathy is important for establishing rights. This is something I disagree with. It might be ok for arguing for someone to get rights but that doesn't mean it is the reason they have them to begin with. Certain animals have more mental existence than a 1 day old baby but I wouldn't have much empathy if the animal died and I wouldn't say this animal deserves rights. As for circular reasoning, this statement is not circular by itself but simply an unprovable statement. irrelevant. The reason blacks were treated so poorly for so long is that the people during the time period grew up learning things a certain way. If you start out believing blacks are inferior then it is darn near impossible to convert that thinking and to have any empathy for a black person. The only reason this changed was that some folks simply had beliefs and upbringing that would allow for empathy or realization that blacks are in fact people as well and thus deserving of rights. It only took an act of showing where ones views were inconsistent to change minds. A good example might be a kid that kills someone. Often times a kid like this will really have no concept that what he did ended a life and that this is a bad thing. Someone like this will never really be able to function in society as they cannot comprehend why they shouldn't kill someone. An odd concept I realize but since you look to psychology I took the liberty of asking my psychologist friend who gets to deal with people like this all the time (not like that provides anything convincing to you). The point to this is what if everyone became like that. Would we no longer have rights against killing? I suggest no because I find right to be inherent and natural. Because of this I can claim blacks always had rights and that the unborn has rights as well.","abortion-euthanization","10:51 AM","abortion-debates","288"

The outcome of harvesting organs and abortion are the same. The real question is; can we defend something before it comes to being? Danger here. Because there are many living organisms that would be covered under such conditions. Like sperm and eggs in general. Should we have laws that prevent women from having periods without sexual relations to try and get the egg to become what it was designed for? Prevent men from masturbation for the same reasons. Both items have probabilities of becoming children like a fetus or fertilized egg. Should we have laws that force women to be checked for fertilized eggs before the beginning of a period so that the embryo can be protected? There are fertilized eggs or embryos that are even flushed down church toilets without the host ever knowing. The embryos could become a productive human being if laws where in place to protect them.

This is generally a test for people who have a high risk of genetic abnormalities. Test results are available within 7 to 14 days. Miscarriage rate from CVS is about 4%, recent studies indicate that if the CVS is done before 10 weeks gestation there is an added risk (.5% to 1.7%) of limb deformity, and about 3% CVS is associated with serious decline in amniotic fluid protection. There is a greater incidence of false positives because of the differences between the cellular genetic material of the choirionic villi and the fetus. There is a small chance that the sex they determine is wrong as well. Amniocentisis This diagnostic test is performed as early as 9 weeks and for diagnostic purposes, 18 weeks gestation. There is a risk of 1-1.5% miscarriage and 1% chance of other pregnancy complications (infection, premature labor, injury to the fetus, cord, or placenta, rupture of membranes, etc.). The tests take about 2-4 weeks to run. There is a small chance that the sex they tell you is incorrect. Ultrasound While ultrasound can be performed at any stage of pregnancy for the purpose of finding out the sex it is best done between 18 and 26 weeks. Most care providers will not give an ultrasound for the specific purpose of finding out the sex, and the American College of OB/GYNs has issued a statement against routine ultrasound exposure during pregnancy. However, most physicians do not heed this warning. Adequate studies on ultrasound safety have not been done, but we do know that ultrasound exposure can change the way the cell reproduces and moves. There have also been studies indicating that ultrasound heats up the cells. This method is the most frequent for finding out the sex of a baby, however, it is the least accurate. Accuracy depends on several factors: baby's cooperation, gestational age, technician's ability, etc. Doctors don't determine the sex of a baby.

We can start with your suggestion that abortions are illegal after the first trimester. That suggestion, while common, is not correct. 12% of abortions in the United States occur after the first trimester of pregnancy . That's an estimated total of about 154,800 abortions in 2002. And besides that, you miss the point. The point I tried to advance is that people who are avidly pro-choice typically do not see any circumstances under which they would restrict abortions save for (in some instances) the third trimester. Thus, they would defend a woman's decision to obtain an abortion for the sole reason that she fears that the child will be one gender rather than the other. It also would be interesting to know (since you felt the need to weight in) whether you support abortions performed solely for the purpose of gender selection?","abortion-euthanization","12:20 AM","abortion-debates","296"

"08-22-2007","10129",21,"Another opinion","279715","You seem to be thinking in extreme terms - i.e. either something can be proven 100% or it is faith. I strongly disagree. As an analogy, take a murder trial. If there is no evidence (via observations of various sort - witnesses, fingerprints, motive, etc.), then the probability of that particular person being guilty is quite small. However, the more evidence on has, the higher the probability of guilt. That does not mean that someone who has a lot of evidence stacked against him may not be innocent (and just being framed, for example, or unlucky). However, that probability is quite small and the relatively low statistics of innocent people being convincted shows this. Evidence is the APPEARANCE of something being true. It is usually not absolute proof. That doesn't make it useless. Far from it. So, am I understanding you correctly that you think that either something is proven 100% or its is faith? If so, then we might as well end this part of the discussion here and now since we are not speaking from a common perception of reality. As I said before, there are no absolute rules about who gets rights and of what type. This is determined by humans for both rational and irrational reasons. My stress of empathy comes from the fact that most of us are capable of it. Most appeals for rights that I have heard are appeals for people to empathize with the suffering of those without rights. Besides, I also have the reciprocity part of my moral stance - treating others as you expect to be treated. Even if you strongly dislike the others, that reciprocity part of the moral stance still holds. Thinking that someone is inherently inferior is not the same as that person BEING inherently inferior. That needs to be proven and the slaveholders would have been hard pressed to fully prove that blacks were INHERENTLY inferior. That is not INHERENT inferiority. Otherwise, if it is ONLY skin color that the slaveholders thought caused inferiority, then they would have to admit that, when they themselves would get their skin tanned by the sun, they would become inferior - there are obvious logical inconsistencies that they would have to face. Yes, I do not think there are absolute criteria for rights (just as there is no ABSOLUTE proof of any of our knowledge). However, methodoligy at getting at any decision is important. A well thought out decision (as in the decision about rights) will mainly yield more just results than an arbitrary decision. Most decisions that people make are not purely emotional value judgements or purely rational reasoning but a combination of the two, where those two types of thought are also often interdependent. Hitler was able to rally anti-semitic feelings, allowing him to lead the Holocaust, but the only reason he was able to get away with it is because German people believed the lies and propaganda he spread about Jews. Rational discussion would have been able to lay bare the falsehood of that propaganda. Similarly, most decisions should be based on as REAL an understanding of the relevant reality as we can get, and that is most achievable with fully rational discussion. THat is why I stress rational discussion - where rational discussion means that people base their decisions and understanding on the reasons and evidence presented in the rational discussion. Being stuck in a belief system (such as the slaveholders had about blacks) simply because one was raised that way is not rational if one does not truly weigh in all the opposing evidence. I fully realize that full rational discussion is not possible for many people. I simply feel that it should be held up as an ideal in our society since a culture that stresses rational discussion will be more likely to practice it. You cannot convince someone if they are not open to rational discussion - such as the murderous kid in this case.","Steeeeve","279915","I'd say in your murder example there are still elements of faith. That is why we go with ""beyond a reasonable doubt"". There is always some level of faith. I'm saying everything has a faith aspect to it. I disagree that empathy plays a role in who gets rights. It may be good for arguing why one should not be denied their rights but I would say they had rights before but were being denied them and thus the question becomes how did they get them. I disagree that empathy is the thing that grants rights. As for the circular argument I did not mean to say the definition is circular but the way you use it to deny the unborn rights is. I guess to avoid this you would need a valid reason why empathy is the means by which you have rights. Oh, I also disagree that it is always the case that people think of rights in terms of empathy. For example many people think marriage is right but you really can't play empathy into that very much. Furthermore, I am sure many do not have empathy for what happens to a person who abuses children but I'd still say they have rights. Finally, it still doesn't really address why we place a different level of rights on humans as opposed to beings that may have higher mental existence. Proven based on what? Surely you aren't suggesting there is a standard by which they have to prove. This would get us back into that circular arguing again. The only thing they would need to show would be that skin color is different and since the belief exists that black skin equals inferior then that is what plays out. Please understand though that I would still say that reasoning is wrong with my point being that your reasoning can't say it is. By your definition its not but that seems rather irrelevant. tanning your skin doesn't change your genetics but that is really beside the point. You seem to be suggesting a certain standard but are unwilling to say this is the standard. I think in the case of abortion you will always come out to an arbitrary decision because you make so many assumptions and statements of faith along the way. I'd argue that most decisions are based upon what makes a person comfortable (selfishness) with possible input from emotion and rational reasoning. Kind of an off the subject remark but how can you be so sure you aren't falling victim to believing things that may not be true in reality? A rational discussion on abortion would only lead us back to statements of belief. The thing is they thought they were having rational discussion and in a sense they were. It was the underlying beliefs that were wrong but the conclusions from those beliefs were very rational. I don't disagree that reasoning is a good thing but it does have many limitations and once you get to that point you are going by faith alone. It turns out that at this point if you have two different beliefs you either find a way to live with it or you decide which side will prevail. Sadly it took 750,000 lives to decide who's belief would prevail in the Civil War. But he would be open to rational debate I'm sure. You just need to understand that he is coming from a totally different belief structure. To the kid there is nothing rationally wrong with killing. If he/she grew up without empathy then what would be your argument? It seems hard to comprehend these things sometimes I realize but at some point you have to see that we all come from different backgrounds and that truly shapes the way you rationalize. In the end it still comes down to that basic belief structure and that seems to be the only disagreement between you and I.","abortion-euthanization","12:13 PM","abortion-debates","305"

We have differences on many issues. Yes there where, and the issues are still here. The Terri Schiavo case where the brain had all it motor functions in place, yet no conscience mind. The Brain couldnt reason enough to pick up a glass of water yet the motor skills where complete. The use of Organs from living humans for the repair of other people is directly associated to this issue. A doctor removes vital Organs from a living human for use in another human. I am interested in knowing your stand on the practice. We criminalized abortion in the late 1800s. The death rate of women climbed as high as 15,000 in a year. This was in a period where we didnt have that many to start with. Pre Roe V Wade, the death rate from women with pregnancy issues was 8000 a year. The same rate as Mexico had under its anti abortion law. Doctors where forced to turn in women for their deeds and many simply could not follow the law. In Mexico, women would get sentenced to 1 to 5 years in prison and their ages where pretty wide. Currently under the hard right wings attack on abortion, the rate of womens deaths in the United States has more than doubled, so your message is getting out. As far as complicity in these deaths Ill leave that for God to decide. A fetus does not qualify as an individual. It is parasitic human tissue with no individual human qualities for an extended period in its incubation process. Cancer is an abnormal growth that is individual under your conditions. What something will become can not be quantified reasonably. If we could, we would do what Joshua did and kill babies under many conditions. The bible explains that pregnancy is a curse on the woman. Personally I have never seen it as a curse, but the process is traumatic and leaves lasting effects. The complete birth cycle takes lives to this day. A mother is a hero. Even in nature a mother will defend her offspring against massive opponents. Can law force someone to mother at any point? You and I where born and we know our mothers carried us as fetuses and cared for themselves so that we could come to be. If your mother was forced by law to have you, what effect would that have on you? Knowing your mother was forced to take the trauma of your coming into being? Should we hold a gun to your mothers head? You and I can be against abortion, but can we force a woman to carry a fetus morally? Simply tie people down and force them to host something? If a man is in liver failure, and you change his outcome by connecting another human to him, he would become parasitic and live by means of his host. What would the hosts choices be? Bare in mind the parasitic side of the question. This person qualifies as a human being in all detail. The only difference between pro-choice and pro-life is the use of a doctor. Abortion happens and will happen. Abortion is very simple. Abortion is so simple an 8 year old with a stick can do one. The path to the fetus is extremely easy to follow, and the fetus is in a thin membrane. As far as pro-abortion, I have yet to see people running around telling people to abort. There is no way to stop an unwilling host to a fetus. We would have to tie her down and force her to allow the gestation. If we dont, we are asking for the loss of not only a fetus but the loss of the host. Morally, we would be complaisant in the hosts death. Mexico had 1.5 Million abortions during its last year of law preventing abortion. 8000 women died and 40,000 (think it was) where hospitalized. The United States had 1.2 Million abortions, less than Mexico even though it is legal.","abortion-euthanization","08:29 AM","abortion-debates","327"

"08-23-2007","10129",23,"Another opinion","279937","Ok, so if everything has some elements of ""faith"", then wouldn't you agree that some beliefs rely more on ""faith"" than others and that there is a gray scale of faith vs proven certainty, where the amount of evidence determines that gray scale? This relates to the analogy of the murder trial since the more evidence one has for guilt, the more probable that guilt is. Or do you deny this? One thing we disagree on is that you really believe in a concept of ""natural rights"" presumably ""endowed by our creator"" which may be a nice concept to think about and makes for nice rhethoric in the Declaration of Independence but it is not the legal basis on which our country is founded (the legal basis is the Constitution) and is very problematic since different people come to different conclusions on natural rights. For example, those on the pro-choice side would view a right to ones body as a natural right - an inherent part of liberty. Instead of believing in some abstract natural rights, I acknowledge that it is the people of a country that ultimately determine rights, where the founders were wise enough to make it difficult for people to vote their rights away (by requiring a large majority to do so). Since it is people who make these decisions, my stress of empathy is that, directly or indirectly, empathy was the main emotion that people appealed to in claiming rights. Couples want to have their love and lifelong committment ackowledged in marriage - which also gives respectibility to their union. Without it, their relationship would not be the same. Since most people see the positive aspects of marriage, they would also not deny it to others. When it comes to the question of support for gay marriage, both of those moral stances play a role - reciprocity in treating gay couples just like any other couples who are in love, and empathy in acknowledging that gay couples have most of the same feelings and needs as straight couples. The opposite arguments are essentially based on a negative view of gays - either through religion (""God says homosexuality is immoral"") or through the general homophobia of this culture. I, personally, have no problem with gay marriage but, acknowledging that it is difficult to change a culture overnight, I would be more of a supporter of civil unions at this point. Oh, so it is not skin, after all, but the genetics that determine skin color. Then, how about Italian Americans or Greek Americans - who are relatively dark skinned compared to WASPs, would they have been considered inferior to WASPs because of their skin color, which is genetic? A main point is that differentiating people based purely on skin color and nothing else, leads to many complicated inconsistencies. Another main point is that people do not just randomly spit out rules but they nearly always feel the need to justify those rules - even the slaveholders. They did not claim that it was only dark skin itself that made the difference - they were prejudiced against the race that inherently had black skin for a number of reason (some reasons were interpreted quotes from the bible). In the idealized case, rational discussion could have laid bare the falsehood of many of these assertions. Well, people certainly do fight for their own rights, but when it comes to the rights of others or decisions about others, then they are swayed by both emotional value judgements and reason. In that example, I was speaking of the idealised case where people would engage in rational discussion and allow themselves to be held accountable to it. I fully realize that reality is not that way and some people will continue to believe that ""2 + 2 = 3"" if it suits them, no matter what rational arguements are presented. I bring up the idealized case simply to show what that ideal could have achieved - in order to try to convince you and others in this culture to try to hold up rational arguement as an ideal. Rational discussions can get rid of a lot of the bogus reasoning that has caused injustice, as long as it is fully participated in. That is why I mainly refer to rational ""discussion"" not rational ""debate"". Debate, in my view, is when people try to convince others - either in the opposition or in an audience - of their point of view. It says nothing about their open-mindedness in having their own minds changed. In order to fully participate in rational discussion, I would claim that you also have to be willing to have your mind changed - something that is difficult for many people to do due to ego, self-interest, or other issues. That open-mindedness is critical to having effective rational discussions. Without it, not much gets accomplished - as can be seen on so many debates on 4forums.com as well.","Steeeeve","280071","That's actually kind of a hard question to answer. I'm sure it's true but if you have elements of faith then without knowing the truth you don't know how wrong you could be. You know, this is really an aside anyway. The only point to this was we all have faith and I'd say we have a lot more than you probably think we do. At least you can see my views are not limited to just me. But aside from that I'd say the DoI reflected the views of the people who mainly wrote the constitution. Furthermore, the constitution's man goal was to set up a system of government and only in the amendments did they get into making some rights harder to reach. Interestingly, the constitution doesn't need to define terms like ""liberty"" as it clearly states how this word can be defined (due process). So the idea was the let the people decide what they want liberty to mean in hopes of achieving natural rights. Obviously there are disagreements on what they are. as stated above I agree our rights are basically codified by laws and voted on by the people. This doesn't disprove or prove a natural rights idea though. But I stress again it is hard to promote empathy if you are not empathic to the being to start with. Furthermore, it implies the right already exists outside of empathy and therefore you have to show how it is given to both parties. meh, we might want to get off this topic since this isn't the gay rights forum but I tend to disagree with a lot said here. Is it not? I'm pretty sure they limited it to just Africans. No it doesn't. If you are going to claim that my argument has to be ""you gain rights the lighter your skin gets"" then why couldn't I claim your argument is ""you gain rights the more developed your brain gets""? That would lead to the same complicated inconsistencies. Well I'm a firm believer that they knew it was wrong but it seems they did just make rules based upon a belief. Yes some spit out certain claims from science to the Bible and yet ""rational discussion"" didn't solve this. The idea that they were weak-minded then and we are so perfect now is foolish. Thinking hasn't changed much since then. doubtful If everyone thought 2 + 2 = 3 would you say it does (abstractly)? You weren't one to defend me when I was getting rid of the bogus reasoning that goes like this: ""Don't push your beliefs on me"". In fact, I challenge you to call people on your side when they give a bogus reasoning and I'll do the same (which I tend to do anyway). That aside, I have never disagreed that rational discussion is bad, in fact, I think it is good but I'd disagree that it would lead anywhere but having two separate belief structures. I also disagree that it is full proof as it is extremely limited to ability to comprehend and numerous other factors. Of course open mindedness is hard to prove.

It was a bit hard to follow. You appear to be raising a scenario whereby the mother's life would be at risk. These types of cases are rare indeed. Only 4% of abortions in 2004 were performed for the sole reason if maternal health issues. Of that 4%, it is not clear how many were actually necessary to preserve the life of the mother (although it is known to be much lower than the full 4%). But for the sake of argument, we can simply assume that the entire 4% were performed to save the life of the mother. It is estimated that 1.3 million abortions occur every year in the United States. Therefore, about 52,000 abortions are performed for the purpose of maternal health (even less for the purpose of preserving maternal life). It seems odd to me that someone who thinks that those 52,000 abortions should be permitted would then advocate for policies that lead to 1.3 million abortions. If you think abortions should be permitted for health reasons, then you should advocate policies that allow abortions only for that reason. Supporting abortion in the so-called hard cases should not lead one to conclude that 1.3 million abortions should be permitted. My own view is that in issues where maternal life is jeopardized by pregnancy (a very, very rare circumstance), the physician ought to save the life that can be saved. This approach would typically preserve the life of the mother at the costly expense of killing a human life. Although advances in medical knowledge has reduced the likelihood of an either-or scenario. In the vast majority of cases, both lives can be preserved medically.

Why wouldn't we? Because we outlawed abortion before, and it was not necessary to come up with some abstract concept of risk ratio. Your claim that we would need one makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. All that I have said really boils down to this: if you support abortion for the purpose of preserving maternal life, fine. Advocate for policies that would encompass that scenario. There is no need to condone, endorse, and support 1.3 million abortions annually in order to ensure that a very small number of women are able to obtain life saving medical treatment. It would be tantamount to saying that killing another person is justifiable in certain circumstances. Therefore, we must not prohibit anyone from killing another person in any cicumstance. That is bogus logic. And in keeping with the spirit of your spurious conclusion about a risk ratio requirement, consider this: we are able to make a distinction in the law between murder and self-defense without specifying an arbitrary risk ratio. It is not necessary to know what percentage chance a person had of surviving an attack in order to distinguish between a killing (or injury) in self-defense, and a killing (or injury) for no justifiable reason at all. But if you truly believed in this risk ratio nonsense, then you would be advocating the need for a specification of risk ratio in our self-defense statutes.

The risk ratio in that case is of course implicity determined by the court proceeding. However I am reasonably certain that in border line cases prosecuters and defenders have argued over the real risks involved in specific situations and most likely introduced expert testimony on both sides of the issue! For example you kill sombody who physically pushes you out of your drivers seat and takes you and your car on a chase. Should you kill him I would FERVENTLY hope that your defense attorney could produce statistical evidence as to the probability that the hijacker would likely subjected you to serious harm should you not have killed him. Or perhaps you would complain if he did so - bad idea IMHO. In any case the risk ratio may not be established in the courts (they really hate unambiguous numbers you know - I speak from experience) but it certainly can and does play a role in making case by case decisions. I don't do capital cases, but from my work in other criminal areas I know that risk assessment is often an issue before courts.","richbrmly","280359","I agree, but Doctors can't play that. And thats the issue. Doctors have to live off numbers, or their job will differ from Doctor to Doctor. We as a people in the United States have set up a justice system that will only punish even a killer if we can obtain a preponderance of evidence against them. It is better to let 1000 people go free than let one person be punished who is innocent. So to say what ever ratios of abortions occur that someone has determined by their standards to be unnecessary has no meaning. Its the persons life that is saved that has meaning. Choice, which has been right where Jesus was born, and has been the law of land far longer than the Christian Jehodists concept. Now, if you say sure, there where abortions in Roman controlled areas but the people choose not to do so. Then there ya go. Choice!

I have not said that a mother should be allowed to kill her baby in order to save her life. What I said, periodically, is that abortion should only be an option to preserve maternal life. I say that as shorthand. In the very rare circumstance where a mothers life is jeopardized by a pregnancy, the physician should save the life that he can save. In the rare circumstance where a pregnancy threatens a mothers life, the physician will have the option of acting to save the mothers life, which will have the unfortunate and costly result of killing her child; or the physician will have the option of trying to save the life of the child, which will have the unfortunate and costly result of killing the mother. In these scenarios, my understanding is that the latter scenario is never likely. If the physician were to opt to try and save the childs life, both the child and the mother would die. That being the case, the physician should act to save the mothers life. This is not at all shocking. It is similar to the scenario where a student walks into a classroom building and opens fire on unsuspecting students. When the ordeal is over, paramedics enter the scene to find several people seriously injured. In this situation the paramedics try to save the lives that they can save. Does that mean the other lives were less valuable? No. Is there some ethical absurdity to saving the lives that can be saved? No. What are you talking about?

"08-27-2007","10129",27,"Another opinion","280981","That may be the basis behind our difference in perspectives. At least my stance is consistent. I can understand your hesitation in answering this question since, in the murder case analogy, you would probably feel obliged to say that evidence does count, whereas agreeing that evidence does count in our knowledge about origins of humanity, supernatural beliefs, ... then that same stance about evidence would go against your beliefs. I follow the results of evidence, which has been a pretty good indicator of reality up to now The less evidence one has, the more uncertainty one has. With no evidence, one is left with belief without evidence - defined as faith. I occasionally allow my self leaps of faith, but I do not pretend to be certain about them. I would not be able to be intellectually honest if I claimed certainty in beliefs of faith. Where views based on evidence are concerned, then large amounts of evidence convince me. I do not believe every scientific theory is true - the string theory in Physics comes to mind (Occam's razor arguement) - just the ones that are well supported by evidence. I knew from the beginning that your views were not limited to you. However, I know that many of your views are based on religious beliefs. If you were not trying to impose your largely religious-based views on the populace at large via laws, then I would not be arguing as strongly against them. My stance is that laws need to be based on rational, supportable (with evidence) arguements. Our founders were wise in separating church and state. Heck, even Jesus said ""Let Caesar have what belongs to him, and God have what belongs to him"". But that is the trouble - there is disagreement on what they are, where pro-choice proponents would view a right to ones own body as an essential part of liberty. After all, if the state can control what one does with ones own body, then what does one have left to control - only the mind? Empathy is different than sympathy, where you are talking about sympathy. Empathy is a realization that others have similar feelings and reactions. However, if you recognize the fact that they might suffer, then you have to think about the consequences of that. Apparently, many slaveowners didn't empathize with their slaves in realizing that they had the same feelings and reactions as any white person would have had in that situation. Some did realize that and didn't care because of their own greed and self-interest. Then, they had to think of contorted ways to justify that oppression. Again, I stress empathy as a main driving force since that is what was most appealed to (directly or indirectly) historically in the fight for rights. First, I am only arguing againt the purely skin color argument since you were the one who introduced it in this discussion (i.e. that the slaveholders could have used skin color alone as an arguement). My goal was to show the inconsistencies in that arguement. As for my arguement, I am not argueing that ""you gain rights the more developed your brain gets"". I am arguing that there is a point at which rights start, in my view, and that is the first possibility of mental existence since mental existence is critical, in my view, to the existence of rights. Similarly, you say that rights start when there is a complete set of DNA and when the growth process starts. Both of our views acknowledge a point where rights begin. If everyone thought that 2 + 2 = 3, then they would all agree that 2 + 2 = 3 since nobody would be arguing otherwise. However, in such a situation, nobody would feel a sense of injustice. Open mindedness is hard to prove, but it can be demonstrated by people letting their minds be changed by full rational discussion. If someone holds a belief that cannot stand up to scrutiny, then there is a large chance that that belief is wrong.","Steeeeve","280992","You distort what I said and my stance is perfectly consistent. I don't doubt we use evidence and things like that for a murder case because it is the best system we have but that doesn't speak to how much faith is involved in 2 unique situations. This assumes you known what reality is. Of course you have no way of knowing this and thus even that is based on faith. But even those have elements of faith in them which was the point of this argument. If we relate this to the abortion forum then I'd say there is nothing but faith. There is no evidence supporting the idea that mental existence is important in giving rights and for that matter there is no evidence that we are to have rights. This can get us back into the murder of an adult question and why is that illegal. There is no evidence to support why some humans are valuable and not allowed to be killed other than a belief this is wrong. As for ""rational""...my belief on abortion is the only rational conclusion from my belief structure just like your belief is the only rational conclusion from yours. I disagree that separation of church and state means that one set of beliefs is not permitted in government. There is no trouble there. The constitution sets up a system to solve the issue...vote on it. If a pro-choicer finds different then convince the people and change the law. I'm not sure why people are fixed on the idea that democracy doesn't work. That is not exactly true. It is a feeling brought on by another's situation. It has nothing to do with whether another has similar feelings to you or not. Again, I think you distort the meaning of empathy here. Nevertheless, this still doesn't address how you get a slaveholder to empathize with a slave. Furthermore it doesn't speak to where the rights come from. I agreed that empathy can be a tool for fighting for rights but that hardly establishes how the right came to be and who deserves it anyway. If you want to get picky with it then just say you get rights if you are not of that natural skin color (ie black). I thought it was clear this is what I meant. I would claim that everyone would be wrong and thus everyone committed an injustice (assuming that wrong was an injustice I suppose). This does bring up an interesting point regarding a relative belief system. I still maintain that such a system would never allow one to say another is wrong or cant' do something.

"08-29-2007","10129",28,"Another opinion","281185","So then, how much do you think evidence plays a role in showing what our reality is about? This includes anything from satelite images of weather patterns helping to predict future local weather, to knowledge that has been gained from evidence about the origins of humanity and our solar system, to knowledge about the forces of nature, etc. My main point is that one either sees evidence as useful or one ignores it, or one questions the ways the evidence was taken or presented and proposes an alternative explanation. You can't have it both ways. At least with the knowledge that has been gained through evidence, that knowledge is so very consistent with our experienced reality that untold numbers of accurate predictions have been made based on that knowledge - not so with religion. You seem to approach this issue as if there is one right answer to abortion rights - there isn't. I don't think in such absolute terms as you do. I acknowledge that it is people who ultimately determine their rights in a democracy, but I am continually stressing that any laws (including those about rights) that are determined by people's representatives need to be based on rational discussion. You seem to claim that a desire for rights from conception is equally valid to a desire for rights only for blue-eyed, red haired people, is equally valid to a desire for rights for those with mental existence,... I disagree. I think the validity of the views is based on the arguements they present. But much of your belief structure is based on religious faith. The separation of church and state does not allow for laws based on religion. You have some non-religious arguements as well, but when I asked you the basic question of the critical difference between an unfertilized egg and a fertilized one that determines rights, you said ""a soul"" - that is a religious belief (both in a soul and when it enters the body). In your apparent view of democracy, you would see nothing wrong if a hypothetical future extremist muslim majority in the US (it could hypothetically happen someday) would vote in Sharia law. I do see something wrong with that. A law shouldn't be introduced because a group says ""we say so"" but because a group presents compelling arguements that people can agree on. The reality of democracy is that a large enough group (say 75%)could vote in whatever they want (ex. a law to kill all red-haired people) - that doesn't make it right. Empathy is trying to imagine what the other is feeling. We can only do that because we humans are relatively similar to one another. Rights didn't come from some abstract absolutist land, they come from people, where people can be swayed by arguements of emotion (largely including empathy) and arguements of reason. Slaveholders were not exactly open-minded about the prospect of slavery so you wouldn't have been able to convince most of them with reason, no matter how much evidence was presented. I am simply stating rational discussion as an ideal that we should strive for, so I present idealized scenarios of what rational arguement could have achieved if true open-minded rational discussion had been participated in. But there were many slaves who had more white ancestry than African ancestry and whose skin color was even lighter than many of those from, say, Italy or Greece. How would that have been defended using your argument? If nobody is suffering, where is the injustice? Relative reasoning does not mean arbitrary reasoning. That is something that is so often implied by you and others who hold on to belief in absolute truths, but something that is wrong. Saying that we need to restrict the rights of mass murderers is very different than saying that we need to restrict the rights of, say, red-haired people since one is based on rational arguement and the other is not.","Steeeeve","281434","It is hard to say with 100% certainly how much of a role evidence place in reality since you can't be 100% sure what reality is. I have stated that given this you do the best you can and obviously evidence is important to that. You get beyond that and can look at whether or not someone is using the evidence to make a valid conclusion. can you give an example of a prediction the Christian faith has made that proved to be not true to reality? This, of course, assumes you know true reality (an absolute principal I might add). Furthermore, I disagree that a consistent experience indicates truth. In fact, common theories have been disproven many times as this gets back to the ability for one to understand. One might say that if the sun rises a bird will fly. Now this will happen repeatedly but does not indicate a truth of relationship. This is obviously easily shown to be wrong now but throughout our past we have found that what has been a ""set in stone"" finding really was wrong afterall. I see no reason why today is any different. Yes there is. You say you don't and base conclusions on that but in reality you do but deny it. You believe in some absolutes. Understanding of a on reality is an absolute for example. You may not think absolute rights exist but if that is the case then rights are certainly more vulnerable. And rational discussion has no meaning as far as I can tell. You would probably indicate that you have to provide evidence for everything but not everything has evidence. Many laws are based purely on beliefs of a society and those can only be but into law but common beliefs. I don't think they are equally valid. I think mine is right and the others are wrong. I do, however, believe that beliefs are a valid reason for a law. You just happen to be wrong about what our first amendment means. I also hope this isn't your only reason for saying abortion laws shouldn't be enacted. Again you try to establish an absolute here. What if 99% of people made a law to kill all red-haired people...does that make it right? Considering your 2+2=3 answer some posts ago I would say you would have to say it does make it right. As for my views of democracy, if extremist Muslims got a majority then I wouldn't have any other choice than to follow the laws they enacted. I would probably leave the country though. An appeal to the human being again. Interesting. Now, if a human being was not and could not suffer would you have empathy for them if something bad happened? I'd like to know how you think people had empathy to begin with. Furthermore, can you show this to be true? Obviously many people disagree that rights came from people...including the people that created our government. You are flawed in that you seem to believe people have to have the same thoughts as you do. There would be no difference in me claiming you do have the ability to ""rational argument"" as you claim the slaveholders didn't. It seems your argument here is really ""if people saw things the way I do then they are open-minded and will see the light"". You may not seem like you are doing this but, in fact, you are. It is the exact reason why I say a belief system like that is based upon oneself which has an inherent selfish basis (don't take this paragraph to be a low-XXXX...I don't mean to insult but state a point). You are still black at that point. But lets assume for arguments sake that the belief was a color X you are considered black and thus no rights (perhaps they had a little paint chart or something). How would you go about denying this belief and showing them they should have empathy when they clearly do not? Suffering does not equal injustice.

Before the war, Lincoln had no plans to free all slaves, much as he probably personally would have liked that. However, the Southerners knew that it would have just been a matter of time before slavery was outlawed by force of upcoming anti-slave majority states. The issues are all interwoven. Either way, you cannot extract the issue of slavery as the main underlying cause of the conflict between the states which erupted into the Civil War. Without a conflict about slavery, the Civil War never would have happened.","Steeeeve","281436","http://www.civilwar.vt.edu/jr/jr.html The guy in that link would smack you if you said it was about anything other than slavery.

Before the Civil War, Lincoln had no intention of freeing all slaves. His view was that he would use his power to prevent any new slave-permitting states to arise from the US territories so that, eventually, the government would be composed of mainly anti-slave states and, thus, slavery would eventually expire. However, this was enough for the Southern states to separate. Then, Lincoln went to war to keep them from seceding and to keep the Union together. It is interesting to note that, even with the Emancipation Proclamation, he did not have any slaves freed that were in Union states. Also, at the beginning of the war, Lincoln prohibited his generals from freeing slaves even in captured territories. Much of this was gleaned from : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln_on_slavery as well as various Discovery Channel and History Channel programs, which were also developed by experts. So, the bottom line is that slavery was the main underlying cause of the civil war since the states would never have seceeded if not for the political threat to the institution of slavery posed by Lincoln's election, but that the war itself was started because of that secession not directly because of slavery. One can say that the main in-direct cause of the civil war was slavery but the main direct cause was keeping the union together. Alternatively, there are various statements that can be made: 1. The southern states would never have seceded if not for the threat to slavery. 2. The civil war would never have happened if not for the secession. So, if the Southern states would have kept their slaves and just complained in the official political process, without secession, then slavery as an institution would have continued for at least some decades to come before an anti-slave political state majority would have voted it off.","abortion-euthanization","02:59 PM","abortion-debates","411"

It is not a question of either slavery causing the war or secession causing the war - both were causes. The conflict about slavery and the urgency to that conflict that arose with the election of Lincoln made the South feel like they had to secede if they wanted to keep the institution of slavery, where that secession in turn sparked the civil war. I do not agree with you that the north would have started a civil war if the south had never seceded. Certainly, if the south had not seceded at that point in time, then some years or decades later, there would have eventually been an anti-slave majority of states that could have tried to vote out slavery. It is feasable that the southern states would have precipitated a conflict then. I doubt that they would have taken the voting-out of slavery lying down. However, other alternatives might have happened. Namely, it is possible that, knowing that slavery would eventually be outlawed, the South might have rearranged their system more toward the sharecropper system that happened later (which wasn't all that much worse for the planters financially). It is hard to predict at this point what would have happened. Was a conflict over slavery always destined to lead to war? Unknown.","abortion-euthanization","11:19 AM","abortion-debates","418"

New England, for example, once thought of seceding, or leaving the Union, because the War of 1812 cut off trade with England. When Lincoln took the oath of office on March 4, 1861, seven states had seceded and organized a working government. Southern leaders believed that their action was lawful, but Lincoln and a majority of Northerners refused to accept the right of Southern states to secede. The new president announced in his inaugural address that he would hold, occupy, and possess the property and places belonging to the government. He promised that the government would not assail the states of the South, and he pleaded with the Southern people not to act hastily but to give the new administration a chance to prove that it was not hostile. Lincoln seems to have believed that with time, and without an act of provocation, the states in secession might return to the Union, but time ran out.","abortion-euthanization","07:56 PM","abortion-debates","420"

The ideas of Lincoln and the Republican party were ideas that would have kept the elimination of slavery legal, from a constitutional sense, but their ideas still would have led to the elimination of slavery. It is certainly possible that the South would have precipitated a war or at least a secession (that would lead the north to war) to avoid giving up the lucrative enterprise of slavery. If they hadn't seceded after Lincoln's election then they might well have seceded years or decades later once his anti-new-slave-state policies produced anti-slave political majorities. On the other hand, perhaps those decades would have led to a re-assessment of their organization of slaves and a reorganization into something more akin to the sharecropper system. I admit that it would be unlikely that the South would have taken the elimination of slavery lying down and most likely would have seceded once the North made any strong attempt at getting rid of slavery. Also, I doubt that the North would have allowed slavery to continue indefinitely. There was just too much momentum against it and we were one of the only countries left that still supported it. So, I would say that you are probably right that the issue of slavery was destined to lead to war, but, still, that is far from absolutely certain since there could have been alternative paths.","abortion-euthanization","11:19 AM","abortion-debates","423"

Secession was not the only option that the slave states had to the election of Lincoln and the eventual threat that posed to slavery. It was just the only option they found palatable at the time. As Winston Smith said, and as I have heard on various History Channel programs, before the Civil War, the federal government wasn't nearly as strong as it is today and most people felt more of an allegance to their state than to the country. States had more rights and more sovereignty than they do today, so the idea of secession was not just made-up but a real political reality.","abortion-euthanization","11:25 AM","abortion-debates","424"
