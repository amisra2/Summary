"04-19-2009","12507",8,"Lakrite","350148","You prove nothing if you do not explain what you believe an actual living human being is. The only definition of human being I am using is any living human. I am not equivocating at all. Repeating that I am lying does not make me a liar. So far you have not actually said anything. A zygote is the union of egg and sperm, correct. The other stage is an embryo. A fetus is simply a much more developed zygote. It is still a direct result of the union of egg and sperm. The vast majority of all chicken eggs people buy are not fertilized. I am not wrong, I am right. You are right that a small amount are fertilized, but that amount is minute. That first sentence made no sense. ... my point was that an unfertilized chicken egg was not similar to a fetus. Which is correct. No...I said what I wanted to say. Maybe you think I wanted to say something else. What I said was what I meant to say. Lets go over what you said in your post that wasn't just calling me stupid. [snip] I pretty much agree with everything said there. You didn't even argue against me.","electrolyte","350208","Yes, Holmes, this is precisely my point. Look: Then you've purposely sidestepped the question of whether a fetus is a ""living human"" as you're using that term, despite the fact that this is the issue you pretend that you're trying to argue. Actually, I have. Your reasoning allows me to define the daytime sky as red and then say that the sky's color is just like that of a cherry. I see you got your hands on a 7th grade biology textbook. Good for you. No, a fetus is not "" simply "" a much more developed zygote. Try a textbook written for people capable of significant comprehension. No, it's not. Lots of things have to happen between the time an egg is fertilized and the time a fetus exists. Of course I'm right. You said that those eggs are not fertilized. Some are. Thus, you are wrong. Again. 'Tis not my fault you can't read. But it was clear that you were actually arguing that the egg was not similar to a human embryo , which is not correct if the egg is fertilized. In other words, upon fixing your inability to speak like a remotely intelligent sixth-grader, your statement becomes incorrect. Thus, your wording was correct, your intended argument was not. You were trying to argue that the acorn is not analogous to an embryo. That is incorrect. Plain and simple. You did not mean ""fetus."" You repeatedly used the word ""fetus"" when referring to either a zygote or an embryo. If there is any confusion here, it is because of your own biological illiteracy. I called you WRONG. Multiple times, even. Glad to see you agree. See, you're suffering from selective amnesia. I made it quite clear that you don't know what the hell you're talking about. I pointed out your hypocrisy for accusing others of not understanding biology and thus being incapable of arguing logically while yourself not understanding biology and thus being incapable of arguing logically. I exposed your fallacy of defining your opinion into the lexicon. I explained how your analogies are inaccurate. Now you're pretending that I've been largely agreeing with you when what I've been doing is using information (information that you acknowledge is true!) to show that your position isn't supported. (This is why I wasn't all that broken up about being too busy to spend time here like I used to.)","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","03:15 AM","abortion-debates","111"

"04-19-2009","12507",8,"Lakrite","350292","I believe a fetus is a living human. A fetus is a more developed zygote, and that is a simple way to describe it. Many things do happen between the time the egg is fertilized and the time the fetus comes into existence. But the fetus would not come into existence and none of those things would happen if it were not for the union of egg and sperm. Zygotes, embryos, fetuses, children, and adults are all the result of the union of the female egg and male sperm. I stated that an UNfertilized chicken egg is not analagous to a fetus. Which is true. ... What you did was change my analogies so that they were incorrect and then point out I wrote them incorrectly. You are setting up a strawman. Its quite obvious.","electrolyte","350302","And I believe that this is a gross oversimplification, so gross that it sidesteps issues that are more important than word selection (and as such, should not be further complicated by poor word selection such as that demonstrated so effectively in your posts). This is hardly a position that's not understandable or unfamiliar to people who discuss this issue (or, you know, biologists). Damn right that's a simple way. An overly simple way. To the point of erroneous conclusions, in fact. Now, I understand the need to dumb down things when talking to people who aren't very bright, but considering I 'm calling you out for oversimplification, you can rest assured that I can comprehend the actual facts, as technical as they may be. I, however, am left with the impression that you may not be capable of such comprehension. True, but why choose those points? Why not start with insemination or germ cell genesis? Why not start with uterine implantation or the latest point at which miscarriages occur? Why not end with the development of lungs, or of higher brain function, or viability, or (god forbid) birth ? I can't fathom why you think I need a biology lesson. I 've been correcting you . But zygotes are also a ""result"" of oogenesis and other things. (See above.) But you stated it in the context of using ""fetus"" as interchangeable with ""zygote"" and ""embryo."" (Perhaps if you were more familiar with using context clues as a comprehension tool, you'd have seen that my conclusion about your meaning was reasonable.) That said, please do clarify what you meant by using accurate terminology based on factual information, that way our disagreements can regard your actual views instead of what you communicate. For the record -- in case either Lakrite or any reader were unclear about this after reading my comment immediately above this section -- my ""changing"" was not intentional but was based on my interpretation of Lakrite's unclear original statements. Lakrite -- or anyone else -- will be hard-pressed to find me purposely creating strawmen. Thus, I will forgo further responding to Lakrite's points about unfertilized eggs, fertilized eggs, acorns, zygotes, embryos, fetuses, newborns, chicks, chickens, adult humans, and trees until he can state them using words that actually mean what he intends.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","05:23 PM","abortion-debates","116"
