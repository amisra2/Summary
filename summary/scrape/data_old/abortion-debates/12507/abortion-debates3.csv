"04-10-2009","12507",3,"Another opinion","349153","(snipped for brevity,...) You have to actually address the concerns of the undecided - which generally seem to sway between concerns for women and concerns for the fetus . If you completely ignore their concerns for the fetus , then you will never influence their views. After all, if you only ""preach to the choire"" then nothing is gained in the overall cause of abortion rights. The silent undecided readers are the ones that I personally think are most critical to address .","Chuz Life","349155","I agree totally on that last point,... but if you are sincere in addressing your opposition's concerns for prebirth children? One of the ways to demonstrate that concern is by acknowledging the fact that they (in addition to being clinically called ""fetuses"") are also acknowledged by the medical community as "" prebirth children ."" Your dispassionate un-relenting sterilzation of the subject as exemplified by your use of the word ""fetus"" when addressing our concerns for when a child's life begins falls a little short (IMHO) when you're actually claiming to make an effort to address those concerns.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","10:51 AM","abortion-debates","31"
"04-10-2009","12507",3,"chester","349135","Exactly so, and the Supreme Court, in its role as defender of the Constitution, declared in Roe that it would not come down on any one particular answer to the metaphysical question it faced. Seen in that context, Roe is a marvel of judicial restraint.","Steeeeve","349156","Other than the fact that they did try to answer the question. It starts out by saying ""We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins"" and then they go on and refer to an unborn as ""potential life"" throughout the entire opinion. In any event, they didn't need to answer the question relating to life or abortion because neither is covered in the constitution and the Supreme Court is wrong. The Supreme Court can be wrong because they aren't the ones that can give meaning to the words adopted by the people. It just doesn't work that way for this contract nor any other contract.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","11:13 AM","abortion-debates","32"

One of the ways to demonstrate that concern is by acknowledging the fact that they (in addition to being clinically called ""fetuses"") are also acknowledged by the medical community as "" prebirth children .""","Another opinion","349157","This term ""pre-birth children"" is far from being a universal term used by all medical practitioners. Just as with the general population, medical practitioners also range from pro-choice to pro-life where, I would guess, that it is largely pro-life medical practitioners that would be the ones addressing zygotes and embryos as pre-birth children. As I have expressed before, I do have concerns about late term fetuses since they might have a mind, might be able to suffer, etc. Indeed, I don't see a fetus one day from birth as being much different than a newborn baby except in how it affects the woman (ex. its presence in the mother can cause a risk to her life or a major risk to her health, etc.) which has its own legal implications. Otherwise, I would have similar sympathy to very late term fetuses that are aborted without good cause as I might toward born babies. The beginning of that late term is less certain but, since the development of the cerebral cortex suggests that there MIGHT be a mental existence, I personally would give the fetus the benefit of the doubt and assume that there is (just as, at end of life, I would assume that a person still has mental existence until proven otherwise). The case for zygotes, embryos and early term fetuses is much different since, lacking a mental existence, then all the reasons for my supporting rights of late term fetuses disappear. The only thing that zygotes, embryos and early term fetuses have going for them is their potential to become more - i.e. to become one of us. I do think that too many people on the pro-choice side ignore the value of this potential in disregarding it completely, thus alienating some of the undecided. I do value that potential and understand how others can value it but I always note that I value the rights of a woman over her own body more. After all, we are a country that espouses freedom. What freedom is more fundamental than the rights over ones own body? As with all freedoms, though, it has its limits and, as happens most of the time, the limits appear when there is a conflict between the rights of two individuals. I know that you personally call mind-less bodies ""individuals"" / ""people"" / ""human beings"" but, as you know, I don't since it never made sense. Just because a living entity WILL BE a person like one of us does not mean that it is one yet. What IS is not the same as what WILL BE. A zygote WILL BE a person but it makes absolutely no sense to me to call it a person while it is still a zygote and to attach the rights of a person to it when it, as a mere living thing with no mind or soul, cannot experience the lack of rights. On a last note, you claimed to agree that it is the silent readers that are the ones that are most critical to address yet, in all of your posts, I have never seen you address any concern for the women involved. In doing so, you yourself are alienating many of the same undecided readers that you are agreeing are critical. Do you have ANY sympathy for women who find themselves with unwanted pregnancies? Besides myself, I am sure that there are many silent undecided readers that would want to know.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","11:22 AM","abortion-debates","33"

It depends on your point of view. It might help to know that the purpose of laws is supposed to be (as the founders intended) to secure and protect our rights and to make any violations of those rights ""punishable."" The founders (I'm sure) never intended for the government to control individual's choices and behaviors with the use of power and intimidation enacted into law. is your post #14 on a thread called ""Prohibition"". Want to tell us how you reconcile this with your belief that the government can use its ""power and intimidation"" to keep women from terminating their pregnancies?

If so, then it is all the better for our pro-choice side since most people seem to hold views in between the two extremes of pro-life (no abortions) and pro-choice (no restrictions on abortions) and might be sway-able in their views. The solid pro-life view is largely restricted to the religious right so their ranks diminish or grow based largely on the percentage of the population that is involved in such more fundamentalist religions. The ranks of the less fundamentalist religions tend to have a mix of pro-choice and pro-life members. Either way, if we on the pro-choice side present only one-sided views as well and don't address the spectrum of concerns of the undecideds, then we will also miss out on that opportunity to try to sway their views toward the pro-choice side. Let's not make the same mistakes that the pro-life side does.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","10:28 AM","abortion-debates","43"
