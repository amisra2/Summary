Why think about this example at all as it relates to choice? How is this a comparable parallel which applies to abortion at all? Here's a more apt question which would align with the question of choice. If someone went and sought out a man specifically to hit him in the groin with all the force he could muster with a sledgehammer, would the person about to get hit then have the right to kill the hitter when all he was doing was honoring his request? The answer to that question is absolutely not since the guy with the gun set the whole scenario up himself by his own free will and actions. Secondarily, if you are equating the unborn baby to the guy with the sledgehammer, you reveal how shallow your understanding of basic biology is. Child bearing is as natural a function as breathing in this world and is why life exists at all. To compare it to being hit in the groin with a sledgehammer which in 99% of the cases would be fatal, where as in 99% of childbirth cases the mother suffers no adverse affects, is a ludicrous and irresponsible analogy. So find a new strawman shooter because yours fails miserably.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","04:23 AM","abortion-debates","2"

Be that as it may, if you and those close to you choose to accept it as true, more power to you. By all means act on your metaphysical presuppositions. On the other hand, do not molest, harm, or endanger in any way those who start with different assumptions and act on their equally valid answers to this metaphysical question.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","07:42 AM","abortion-debates","3"

I simply find it inconceivable to call a mindless body a person. As such, then zygotes, embryos and early fetuses cannot be called people, in my view, since they cannot have a mind, according to the neurological understanding of the source of our cognitive capabilities resting in our cerebral cortex. Late term fetuses might have a mind, according to neurologists, so, by my view of person, I would say that late term fetuses are people. However, what if we were not in this reality but in some hypothetical scenario where even zygotes had minds. Then, I would probably apply the same rules from the beginning of pregnancy as I personally currently would in the late term. Namely, I would restrict abortion to risk to mother's life, significant risk to her health (both of which are relevant to your self-defense example), mercy killing for severely deformed fetuses, rape, incest and would be open to other conditions that are brought up in debate. In such a hypothetical but unreal case, then I would make very sure that women have very easy access to long term contraceptives, sexual education early on in how to use them, and free distribution of contraceptives to poor women - all to make the risk of unwanted pregnancy as absolutely minimal as possible. Of course, this would be a good strategy to use in reality as well, but the religious right often introduces obstacles - such as opposition to teaching about the use of contraceptives in sexual education class, opposition to giving out free contraceptives, etc. There are only so many battles I am willing to fight. Since abortion is an option, that battle isn't nearly as important now as it would be in that hypothetical scenario or a potentially real scenario of abortions being outlawed. Luckily, for women's reproductive rights, the choice in reality isn't that stark. Early abortions do not kill a human being with a mind that can suffer or experience the abortion in any way, or indeed that can experience anything. Early abortions just kill a living human body with ''nobody home"" whose worth lies only in its potential to become more - a far less weighty consequence than killing a human being that can already experience the abortion or which already mentally exists.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","10:20 AM","abortion-debates","4"

For example, a fetus is not considered to be hostile like a man with a sledgehammer. Furthermore, a sledgehammer to the groin would probably kill a person a large percentage of the time and higher than a rate of pregnancy.

It will put the host's body through stress and discomfort for months, possibly even cause it to die, at the very least it will change that body forever. No person can be compelled to give organs, tissue, or blood against their will, even to save the life of another. This is SO fundamental that not even condemned prisoners can be so compelled.

But go ahead,.. I'll digress. True. Quite true. True again. And you have just ran head on into why abortions in cases of rape are justified. (Man I need to get my website up, I could link you to a great debate I had with some ACLU members and lawyers) FOUND IT! CLICK HERE Rather than rehash the same debate, please read that one and tell me what ya think. As to your point about all pregnancies causing stress and life changing changes in a woman's body? All true. But the law (I think rightly) considers the differences between when a person puts themself into harms way consentually and when that danger is forced upon them against their will. Women (and the men they sleep with) know the downside and risks of pregnancy when they decide to RISK having sex. And just as it is with all other areas of law,... *when one risks a behavior, they assume the legal and other consequences that come with it.... (*within reason of course--a pregnancy which Dr.s detrmine will kill or unreasonably disfigure the woman would be the same as any ""life of the mother"" exception.) HUH? It's not the same at all,.. see above and read the debate I linked to. This has all been hashed out before.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","10:09 PM","abortion-debates","11"
