To deny that an abortion kills a child (i.e. the link provided), it is you and your ilk that has to pervert the facts. I provided a dictionary reference which states that a human fetus is a child .

The disconnect is where the Laws are not following the facts and indeed the language.

"04-13-2009","12507",4,"Chuz Life","349365","And let us (on all sides) not forget the fact that EVERY successful abortion results in the death of at least one child .","Another opinion","349398","If you look at your own dictionary reference, there are multiple definitions of ""child"": 1. a person between birth and full growth; a boy or girl: books for children. 2. a son or daughter: All my children are married. 3. a baby or infant. 4. a human fetus. The first definition is the one that people use most often which, you will notice, starts from birth. Presumably, they added the fourth definition ( a human fetus) because Pro-Life advocates call fetuses children. Once again, you have demonstrated your lack of knowledge in how to use dictionaries. Either that, or you are purposely being dishonest. Go ahead and call fetuses children, if you like, but the very dictionary that you quoted supports the pro-choice view that most people don't use the term ""child"" in that manner. You have once again shown why you lack credibility in any issue involving the use of dictionary terms since you obviously either (1) don't know how to use them or (2) purposely distort them. Any experienced reader is going to see right through your games, and those of us on the pro-choice side will make sure to reveal these games of yours to those readers who are not experienced enough to recognize such games for themselves. You will not win the debate by destorting definitions, try as you will.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","03:55 PM","abortion-debates","48"

It doesn't support that at all. It only supports the idea that child is used more often in one sense than the other. It DOES NOT indicate that many people don't feel that is a proper use of the word or don't use it in ""that manner"". So have you For someone who claims to be about logic you did a number of distortions yourself. I've debated you many times and this is not your style..what gives?","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","04:42 PM","abortion-debates","49"
"04-13-2009","12507",4,"Another opinion","349398","If you look at your own dictionary reference, there are multiple definitions of ""child"":","Chuz Life","349407","Yeah,.. and it only takes one for the word to apply. (I bet you hate that) Nevermind the self evidence that a prebirth child presents of him or herself... It's true, One can (too easily) disgregard a prebirth child's ""personhood"" when they concentrate on the attributes that the child lacks. Rather than do that , I (and many others) choose to define a child (prebirth or otherwise) by the attributes they have . The definitions I provided support that. It's true that a pre-birth child lacks many of the things attributable to a much older child. But to use their temporary lack of those attributes as an excuse to ignore, deny and downplay the significance of the attributes they have is (to me) borderline criminally insane.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","04:46 PM","abortion-debates","50"
"04-13-2009","12507",4,"Another opinion","349415","Also, you should note that I never said that calling a fetus a child was an improper use according to the dictionary . I simply said that it was the less common use. Since Chuz Life seemed to imply that calling a fetus a child was THE official use, not the lesser of two, that is why I called him on it.","Chuz Life","349416","Your perception problems asside,... I'm glad to see that you finally understand how it is not a perversion of the language nor the definitions to refer to a child which is in the fetal stage of their life, growth and development as a "" child ."" Thank you!","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","05:09 PM","abortion-debates","52"
"04-13-2009","12507",4,"Another opinion","349418","Your post implied that calling a fetus a ""child"" was THE only way to use the term ""child"". You were wrong. Most people use the word ""child"" only once the baby is born - as is indicated by the first definition which, by the standards of dictionaries, denotes the most common useage. I don't mind you claiming that you have the right to call a fetus a child. I DO mind you claiming that the dictionary says that child always refers to fetuses as well - it doesn't. I am very curious - what attributes does a zygote have that makes it a person, in your view? In other words, what attributes define a person?","Chuz Life","349421","One need only scroll back and read what I actually posted to know better than that. I was not wrong (per your attempt to construct a strawman) again, anyone can read my posts and see for themselves. I am the one who linked to the definitions. How you can then say that I was trying to mis-use or twist that deifintion is ludicrous. It's clear to me, that you do so mind. As for your claims and/or other's claims is that it is a ""perversion"" of the language to refer to a human fetus as a ""child."" You are clearly wrong in that claim. As is your claim that I ever suggested that definition 4 was the ONLY definition, also wrong. (ridiculous even) I provided the link to the complete definition myself. Inviting everyone to see for themselves that it is NOT a twisting of the language to refer to a human fetus as a ""child."" The most basic definition (of which a zygote would have to meet or surpass to be called a person) is ""human being."" Of course, by that definition, anyone could claim almost any cell in their body to be a ""human being"" and therefor a ""person."" So the other factors and attributes surrounding a ""zygote, embryo, fetus"" becomes more significant to the claim. One can not rightfully claim a hair folicule or sperm cell for example is the ""product"" of human reproduction. Nor can they claim a sperm cell or skin cell to be an organism. By scientific definition,... they are not. A human zygote, however ""IS"" already (not just potentially) living the life of a human organism. A ""human"" genetically individual ""being."" A ""person"" in the very earliest moments of their biological life. And all you can do now is deny it. Which is fine,... but slowly, your denials will be seen for what they are in light of scientific evidence that proves things like a ""human beings aging begins"" at the moment of their conception. Which to most people would beg the question; ""how can a human being's aging possibly begin at any point other than the beginning of their life?"" Course Description: Aging begins at conception and terminates at death. As we progress through life and its four major states: 1. conception and birth, 2. puberty and adolescence, 3. adulthood and 4. senescence,","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","05:31 PM","abortion-debates","54"
"04-13-2009","12507",4,"Another opinion","349427","So you admit that, according to the proper use of the English language, a fetus doesn't have to also be called a child? If so, then I was indeed misinterpeting your views. Good! So, you and the pro-life side can keep on calling a fetus a child since that is how you see it, and I and the pro-choice side will keep on calling a fetus a fetus and not calling a fetus a child since we don't see it that way. We will each use the terms we wish and not claim that there is any ONE way that the term HAS to be used. I am fine with that. Are you really fine with that?","Chuz Life","349429","Well, asside from the fact that I resent being called ""pro-life"" just because I oppose elective abortion,... You should have known better before now that a human fetus can be legitimately referred to as a ""child"" and also as a ""fetus"" interchangibly. It is what it is,... a very very young child in the fetal stage of his or her life.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","06:36 PM","abortion-debates","56"
"04-13-2009","12507",4,"Another opinion","349427","They just don't have the right to claim any legal status on that term or to claim that it is the ONLY way to use that term.","Chuz Life","349431","Actually, per the 1st. Amendment we all have the right to make claims such as the one that a human fetus is a child and deserves recognition and Constitutional protections as such. Some even claim that Chimpanzees and other great apes are worthy of Constitutional protections just because they are genetically close to Humans. How can it be said that those people have a right to their claims, but those who (like myself) make even more direct comparissons have none? The answer should be clear. You can't.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","06:41 PM","abortion-debates","57"
"04-13-2009","12507",4,"Another opinion","349427","That last point is not solidly based on universally accepted definitions. A being - especially a ""human being"" - is not universally defined as an organism. You may go ahead and assume this, but it is a philosophical assumption of how to define ""being"", not a scientific one.","Chuz Life","349433","Why? Because you said so? No offense but ""who are you to me?"" The Constitution and our existing laws and legal definitions say what they say. And using the current laws and legal definitions (in light of discoveries such as the ones about aging) the argument can be easily made that a human being's life biologically begins at the point of conception,... and that the Constitution protects BIOLOGICALLY existing human individuals even in the absense of a ""metaphysical"" being (souls and all that ####.) I don't stray away from ""what is"" even for a second in my arguments.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","06:46 PM","abortion-debates","58"
"04-13-2009","12507",4,"Another opinion","349427","The growth and, yes, aging of the human BODY starts at conception. Your claim that it is a human BEING / person / individual at that point is just a claim based on your particular philosophy and those of other pro-life proponents (including those pro-life proponents that are in the medical profession). Not on scientific consensus. You certainly have the right to that view. Your claims that it is based purely on science are false since you make philosophical assumptions of definitions along that scientific route which show that it is ultimately your OPINION that determines that particular definition, not purely science.","Chuz Life","349434","Quote for me ONE Philisophical claim that I have made regarding the ""personhood"" of a pre-birth child. Just one. I know you can't do it because I have never made such a claim. My claim is now (and has always been) that since a human zygote, embryo, fetus meets the current most basic definitions of ""human,"" ""being, person,"" etc. It is that which qualifies them to be treated as ""persons."" And nothing more is needed or required by the law. That if you support the notion of a separation between ""church and state"" you have no choice but to refuse to even consider the ""philosophical"" wants or preferences of the masses.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","06:52 PM","abortion-debates","59"
"04-13-2009","12507",4,"Another opinion","349427","My view of personhood starting at mental existence is also based on science since science can tell us when that mental existence might start. However, as with you, I make a philosophical assumption about how the term ""human being"" is defined - you as biological human organism, me as biological human organism with a mind. We both simply use science to detail our philosophical positions. Your claim otherwise is a fallacy.","Chuz Life","349436","Yes, it's clear that you and others require a child to live long enough as to overcome your ability to deny them their ""personhood"" for whatever arbitrarily chosen threshold you've set,... you refuse to hold true to the meaning of the word ""begin."" As you said,... it doesn't ""begin"" until you say so regardless the evidence that it was alive, growing and further developing even before that arbitrarily drawn line in the sand.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","06:56 PM","abortion-debates","60"
