Why think about this example at all as it relates to choice? How is this a comparable parallel which applies to abortion at all? Here's a more apt question which would align with the question of choice. If someone went and sought out a man specifically to hit him in the groin with all the force he could muster with a sledgehammer, would the person about to get hit then have the right to kill the hitter when all he was doing was honoring his request? The answer to that question is absolutely not since the guy with the gun set the whole scenario up himself by his own free will and actions. Secondarily, if you are equating the unborn baby to the guy with the sledgehammer, you reveal how shallow your understanding of basic biology is. Child bearing is as natural a function as breathing in this world and is why life exists at all. To compare it to being hit in the groin with a sledgehammer which in 99% of the cases would be fatal, where as in 99% of childbirth cases the mother suffers no adverse affects, is a ludicrous and irresponsible analogy. So find a new strawman shooter because yours fails miserably.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","04:23 AM","abortion-debates","2"

I simply find it inconceivable to call a mindless body a person. As such, then zygotes, embryos and early fetuses cannot be called people, in my view, since they cannot have a mind, according to the neurological understanding of the source of our cognitive capabilities resting in our cerebral cortex. Late term fetuses might have a mind, according to neurologists, so, by my view of person, I would say that late term fetuses are people. However, what if we were not in this reality but in some hypothetical scenario where even zygotes had minds. Then, I would probably apply the same rules from the beginning of pregnancy as I personally currently would in the late term. Namely, I would restrict abortion to risk to mother's life, significant risk to her health (both of which are relevant to your self-defense example), mercy killing for severely deformed fetuses, rape, incest and would be open to other conditions that are brought up in debate. In such a hypothetical but unreal case, then I would make very sure that women have very easy access to long term contraceptives, sexual education early on in how to use them, and free distribution of contraceptives to poor women - all to make the risk of unwanted pregnancy as absolutely minimal as possible. Of course, this would be a good strategy to use in reality as well, but the religious right often introduces obstacles - such as opposition to teaching about the use of contraceptives in sexual education class, opposition to giving out free contraceptives, etc. There are only so many battles I am willing to fight. Since abortion is an option, that battle isn't nearly as important now as it would be in that hypothetical scenario or a potentially real scenario of abortions being outlawed. Luckily, for women's reproductive rights, the choice in reality isn't that stark. Early abortions do not kill a human being with a mind that can suffer or experience the abortion in any way, or indeed that can experience anything. Early abortions just kill a living human body with ''nobody home"" whose worth lies only in its potential to become more - a far less weighty consequence than killing a human being that can already experience the abortion or which already mentally exists.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","10:20 AM","abortion-debates","4"

CLICK HERE Rather than rehash the same debate, please read that one and tell me what ya think. As to your point about all pregnancies causing stress and life changing changes in a woman's body? All true. But the law (I think rightly) considers the differences between when a person puts themself into harms way consentually and when that danger is forced upon them against their will. Women (and the men they sleep with) know the downside and risks of pregnancy when they decide to RISK having sex. And just as it is with all other areas of law,... *when one risks a behavior, they assume the legal and other consequences that come with it.... (*within reason of course--a pregnancy which Dr.s detrmine will kill or unreasonably disfigure the woman would be the same as any ""life of the mother"" exception.) HUH?

"04-10-2009","12507",3,"Chuz Life","349155","I agree totally on that last point,... but if you are sincere in addressing your opposition's concerns for prebirth children? One of the ways to demonstrate that concern is by acknowledging the fact that they (in addition to being clinically called ""fetuses"") are also acknowledged by the medical community as "" prebirth children .""","Another opinion","349157","This term ""pre-birth children"" is far from being a universal term used by all medical practitioners. Just as with the general population, medical practitioners also range from pro-choice to pro-life where, I would guess, that it is largely pro-life medical practitioners that would be the ones addressing zygotes and embryos as pre-birth children. As I have expressed before, I do have concerns about late term fetuses since they might have a mind, might be able to suffer, etc. Indeed, I don't see a fetus one day from birth as being much different than a newborn baby except in how it affects the woman (ex. its presence in the mother can cause a risk to her life or a major risk to her health, etc.) which has its own legal implications. Otherwise, I would have similar sympathy to very late term fetuses that are aborted without good cause as I might toward born babies. The beginning of that late term is less certain but, since the development of the cerebral cortex suggests that there MIGHT be a mental existence, I personally would give the fetus the benefit of the doubt and assume that there is (just as, at end of life, I would assume that a person still has mental existence until proven otherwise). The case for zygotes, embryos and early term fetuses is much different since, lacking a mental existence, then all the reasons for my supporting rights of late term fetuses disappear. The only thing that zygotes, embryos and early term fetuses have going for them is their potential to become more - i.e. to become one of us. I do think that too many people on the pro-choice side ignore the value of this potential in disregarding it completely, thus alienating some of the undecided. I do value that potential and understand how others can value it but I always note that I value the rights of a woman over her own body more. After all, we are a country that espouses freedom. What freedom is more fundamental than the rights over ones own body? As with all freedoms, though, it has its limits and, as happens most of the time, the limits appear when there is a conflict between the rights of two individuals. I know that you personally call mind-less bodies ""individuals"" / ""people"" / ""human beings"" but, as you know, I don't since it never made sense. Just because a living entity WILL BE a person like one of us does not mean that it is one yet. What IS is not the same as what WILL BE. A zygote WILL BE a person but it makes absolutely no sense to me to call it a person while it is still a zygote and to attach the rights of a person to it when it, as a mere living thing with no mind or soul, cannot experience the lack of rights. On a last note, you claimed to agree that it is the silent readers that are the ones that are most critical to address yet, in all of your posts, I have never seen you address any concern for the women involved. In doing so, you yourself are alienating many of the same undecided readers that you are agreeing are critical. Do you have ANY sympathy for women who find themselves with unwanted pregnancies?

Up to now, there has not been widespread agreement on the personhood status of a fetus/embryo at various stages of development, which is why Roe vs Wade could take the stance that it did. However, that may not always be the case. In arguing here for my view of personhood (which is very similar to that of many other views here), I am simply playing my small role in trying to make that view a widespread view. This is not an impossible task. There was a time when newborn babies were killed if deemed of little value, where they were not viewed as persons worthy of rights. That changed when culture slowly changed. There are apparently still some cultures in the world that do not acknowledge young children as people. All this says is that the state of personhood beginning at birth is not something that always was and always will be ""written in stone"". It can change when cultures change. In the US, there is and has been widespread agreement from the very beginnings of our country, that born humans are people deserving rights. That stance may yet change in having its limits pushed partly into pregnancy. The failure of the North Dakota and Colorado personhood initiatives shows that most Americans, and this is a relief, would not push the idea of personhood to the beginning of pregnancy. However, I would venture to guess that most WOULD consider a very late term fetus a person. This is something that has simply not been universally addressed in politics since the Pro-Life side would never be willing to settle for that. You should also keep in mind that Roe vs Wade did not give women complete rights to abortion for ALL stages of pregnancy. It does allow the state to interfere in late term for reasons of viability, which are independent of reasons of personhood. Indeed, my understanding is that most states do limit late term abortions to certain exceptions. Though the reasons given (viability) do not coincide with my personal reasons (personhood) for limiting late term abortions, I am currently quite content with the standing of Roe vs Wade since it coincides well with my view of the state interfering in abortion rights only in the last trimester. The only concern I would have about Roe vs Wade is if new technologies would push the state of viability to earlier points in the pregnancy, allowing the state to restrict abortions at earlier terms. Luckily, that won't be a concern for quite some time. On a last note, you should not represent your extreme (abortions always allowed for whatever reason) as the general pro-choice view since most pro-choice supporters WOULD restrict third trimester abortions. Though I appreciate that you are a pro-choice supporter, I think it is important that your arguements take into account the current state of US law and opinion.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","10:44 AM","abortion-debates","89"

You can't win an argument with the fallacy of equivocation. No, it's not. Your repeating a lie doesn't make it true. Wait for it... wait for it... and: And there it is, folks. Absolute idiocy demonstrated by Lakrite. He denigrates others for not knowing what a fetus is, then he demonstrates for all to see that he doesn't know what a fetus is. But wait! It gets better! Later, Lakrite says: Yes, folks, biologically ignorante Lakrite is demanding that people be biologically literate to make logical arguments. In this respect, I completely agree; but by this requirement, Lakrite can't be relied upon to make logical arguments. And oh the evidence for this! Let's take a look: WRONG. The union of an egg cell and a sperm cell is a zygote. A zygote is not a fetus. In fact, after developing, a zygote is classified as yet another stage before it gets reclassified as a fetus. Wrong, at least sometimes. I've seen eggs [for eating] that had embryonic growth within. The fact that some chicken eggs are fertilized and sold for food is not in dispute. Now we see something interesting: a true statement that is true for the reason opposite the point Lakrite is trying to make. How wrong do you have to be to come full circle? A human fetus is indeed not to a chicken egg (even a fertilized one) as an adult human is to an adult chicken. Instead, it would be more accurate to say that a human embryo is to a fertilized chicken egg as an adult human is to an adult chicken. Next, we see the same phenomenon again: Once again, we have a statement that is technically correct but says the opposite of what Lakrite wants it to say. An acorn is a seed. A seed is not a fetus. A seed is not an unfertilized egg. A seed is a fertilized cell (or cells). It is not analogous to a fetus. It is not analogous to an unfertilized chicken egg. It is analogous to the fertilized chicken egg that Lakrite would eat without qualm. It is analogous to a pre-fetal human. Seriously: How are we supposed to treat you not like a ##### when your statements are so moronic?","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","06:51 PM","abortion-debates","101"

I am not equivocating at all. Repeating that I am lying does not make me a liar. So far you have not actually said anything. A zygote is the union of egg and sperm, correct. The other stage is an embryo. A fetus is simply a much more developed zygote. It is still a direct result of the union of egg and sperm. The vast majority of all chicken eggs people buy are not fertilized. I am not wrong, I am right. You are right that a small amount are fertilized, but that amount is minute. That first sentence made no sense. ... my point was that an unfertilized chicken egg was not similar to a fetus. Which is correct. No...I said what I wanted to say. Maybe you think I wanted to say something else. What I said was what I meant to say. Lets go over what you said in your post that wasn't just calling me stupid.

Look: Then you've purposely sidestepped the question of whether a fetus is a ""living human"" as you're using that term, despite the fact that this is the issue you pretend that you're trying to argue. Actually, I have. Your reasoning allows me to define the daytime sky as red and then say that the sky's color is just like that of a cherry. I see you got your hands on a 7th grade biology textbook. Good for you. No, a fetus is not "" simply "" a much more developed zygote. Try a textbook written for people capable of significant comprehension. No, it's not. Lots of things have to happen between the time an egg is fertilized and the time a fetus exists. Of course I'm right. You said that those eggs are not fertilized. Some are. Thus, you are wrong. Again. 'Tis not my fault you can't read. But it was clear that you were actually arguing that the egg was not similar to a human embryo , which is not correct if the egg is fertilized. In other words, upon fixing your inability to speak like a remotely intelligent sixth-grader, your statement becomes incorrect. Thus, your wording was correct, your intended argument was not. You were trying to argue that the acorn is not analogous to an embryo. That is incorrect. Plain and simple. You did not mean ""fetus."" You repeatedly used the word ""fetus"" when referring to either a zygote or an embryo. If there is any confusion here, it is because of your own biological illiteracy. I called you WRONG. Multiple times, even. Glad to see you agree. See, you're suffering from selective amnesia. I made it quite clear that you don't know what the hell you're talking about. I pointed out your hypocrisy for accusing others of not understanding biology and thus being incapable of arguing logically while yourself not understanding biology and thus being incapable of arguing logically. I exposed your fallacy of defining your opinion into the lexicon. I explained how your analogies are inaccurate.

Many things do happen between the time the egg is fertilized and the time the fetus comes into existence. But the fetus would not come into existence and none of those things would happen if it were not for the union of egg and sperm. Zygotes, embryos, fetuses, children, and adults are all the result of the union of the female egg and male sperm. I stated that an UNfertilized chicken egg is not analagous to a fetus. Which is true. ... What you did was change my analogies so that they were incorrect and then point out I wrote them incorrectly. You are setting up a strawman. Its quite obvious.","electrolyte","350302","And I believe that this is a gross oversimplification, so gross that it sidesteps issues that are more important than word selection (and as such, should not be further complicated by poor word selection such as that demonstrated so effectively in your posts). This is hardly a position that's not understandable or unfamiliar to people who discuss this issue (or, you know, biologists). Damn right that's a simple way. An overly simple way. To the point of erroneous conclusions, in fact. Now, I understand the need to dumb down things when talking to people who aren't very bright, but considering I 'm calling you out for oversimplification, you can rest assured that I can comprehend the actual facts, as technical as they may be. I, however, am left with the impression that you may not be capable of such comprehension. True, but why choose those points? Why not start with insemination or germ cell genesis? Why not start with uterine implantation or the latest point at which miscarriages occur? Why not end with the development of lungs, or of higher brain function, or viability, or (god forbid) birth ? I can't fathom why you think I need a biology lesson. I 've been correcting you . But zygotes are also a ""result"" of oogenesis and other things. (See above.) But you stated it in the context of using ""fetus"" as interchangeable with ""zygote"" and ""embryo."" (Perhaps if you were more familiar with using context clues as a comprehension tool, you'd have seen that my conclusion about your meaning was reasonable.) That said, please do clarify what you meant by using accurate terminology based on factual information, that way our disagreements can regard your actual views instead of what you communicate. For the record -- in case either Lakrite or any reader were unclear about this after reading my comment immediately above this section -- my ""changing"" was not intentional but was based on my interpretation of Lakrite's unclear original statements. Lakrite -- or anyone else -- will be hard-pressed to find me purposely creating strawmen. Thus, I will forgo further responding to Lakrite's points about unfertilized eggs, fertilized eggs, acorns, zygotes, embryos, fetuses, newborns, chicks, chickens, adult humans, and trees until he can state them using words that actually mean what he intends.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","05:23 PM","abortion-debates","116"
