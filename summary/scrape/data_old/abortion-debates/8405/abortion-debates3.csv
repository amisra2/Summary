The tags seem a bit misleading anyway. It seems that ""pro-choice"" and ""no-choice"" would better describe the feelings of the two sides. ""Pro-life"" conjures up a mental picture of an ""anti-life"" opponent, something that I am not. Life is precious. There is however a great obstacle presented to an expectant mother who really doesn't want to be one. The circumstances of the pregnancy should be considered in determining whether her choice is still available. I imagine that people will argue 'til the cows come home about where the line should be drawn..the line between a non-feeling mass of cells and a sensitive human body. The ability to feel pain definitely does not occur in the first few weeks and definitely does occur prior to birth. I say 3 months is a reasonable demarcation. Religious beliefs should have nothing to do with it.","clinic-give-out-free-morning-after-pills","02:04 PM","abortion-debates","31"

The debate is simply about whether elective abortion should be legal or not, and at what stage of gestation.","clinic-give-out-free-morning-after-pills","02:53 PM","abortion-debates","32"
"07-17-2006","8405",3,"sinjin","None","So sex without intent to procreate is wrong? I'll ask you the same question: What constitutes a ""being""?","Prototype","222972","This sounds like trying to sever the connection between sex and pregnancy. I say that having sex without dealing with a possible pregnancy is wrong. Besides, there are other forms of sex besides... well, the kind that is the direct route to forming a pregnancy. I believe a zygote is the very very first stage of life for any human being. The only form before that is cells and eggs and other material that is lost all the time. A zygote, on the other hand, is a living growing human being and can die. Now you can say all you want on what you believe is a being, but as for me, that constitutes a being.","clinic-give-out-free-morning-after-pills","05:18 PM","abortion-debates","33"

I believe human personhood or a human that is capable of activiley participating in the act of BEING begins at best with consistent brain wave patterns that indicate activity in the Cerebral cortex in which is considered *higher brain death* when this area ceases permanent function.This happens about 22-24 weeks of gestation around the same time of viabily.","clinic-give-out-free-morning-after-pills","12:25 PM","abortion-debates","34"

This point in gestation is the subject of ongoing debate...when does it cease to be a cell mass and become a baby. It is certainly long before birth. Women who wait until the eighth month to decide should have no choice but to have the baby. My vote for the cut off point goes to the end of the third month.","clinic-give-out-free-morning-after-pills","10:11 AM","abortion-debates","39"
