Bush and it's slanderous of you to claim that I did, ER!","Xenamnes","450049","You have yet to prove the Virgina abortions bill is an example of state-sanctioned rape Simone. This is becoming a noticeable pattern every time you start a new thread. You make wild claim and baseless accusations, but when pressed to clarify your reasoning you choose not to answer and either leave the discussion or try and change the topic. Hyperbole will not save you. Changing the topic will not help you. Accusing others will be no use. Ultimately the only option you have will be to address your own claims.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","06:40 PM","abortion-debates","91"

Rather what is at issue is your attempt to redefine an elective procedure into something it is not. A transvaginal ultrasound -or any other similar procedure- is no more an act of rape to a woman than a colonoscopy is an act of rape to a man.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","09:32 PM","abortion-debates","93"

They are required to have the scan for a termination they can always refuse and not have the termination. This prerequiste to a termination is nothing like being violated by force.
