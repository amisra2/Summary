Forced genital mutilation...legal or not","sinjin","449814","You may continue to believe this but since the removal of the foreskin degrades neither appearance nor function, I will continue to believe otherwise.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","05:57 PM","abortion-debates","76"

If the fetus was considered a person with rights the woman would not be allowed an abortion...period","sinjin","449815","Who do you suppose is sponsoring the legislation? Since it isn't a person, why should a woman be ""required"" to see images of it before aborting? Why are her rights subordinated to this non-person?","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","06:05 PM","abortion-debates","77"

If we are to enter a brave new world of disposable fetuses then at least the woman should look at the thing before she destroys it. If only to remind her to take the pill or demand her boyfriend uses a rubber next time especially if the state is paying for it. Jeez that poor darling who would have to bear the agony of looking at an image of the ' parasite' inside her would probably not baulk at looking inside her hanky before binning it( and if it is a ' non person with no rights and a parasite to boot then whats the problem?). If people are to indulge in the grown up world of sexual intercourse then they should face up to the consequences of feckless behaviour during it. People like you who demonise or present fetuses as parasites not worthy of a second look before crushing and binning are doing nothing for humanist morality.

Who are you to decide that? Because you know she's been careless. The State forcing her for no medical reason. Feckless? Is it the sex or your lack of getting your share that's bothering you? I've done no such thing. I simply wish to let the woman decide while it's early without coercion either way.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","04:57 PM","abortion-debates","85"

Most incidence of sexual congress are mutually agreed and contraception is very reliable so the odds are that she was. Careless or not she should be a witness to what she wishes to destroy. There may be no ' medical' reason to terminate the fetus I take it you have no argument so you chose to insult me instead While its early? So how would looking at an image of an 'early' fetus coercion. You want the fetus to be seen as a liability , something of no importance because it suits your agenda of abortion on demand.It has nothing to do with womens rights, instead it has everything to do with the notion that the fetus should be given no rights. Thats why you insist that a deluded religious person can believe a fetus has any right to a second thought from either the mother or the State.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","05:18 PM","abortion-debates","87"
