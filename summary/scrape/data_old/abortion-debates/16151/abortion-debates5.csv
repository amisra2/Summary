You may have religion on your mind regarding abortion and contraception but there are ethical and moral perspectives outside of religion that would require a woman to look at the potential child that she is about to destroy. Abortion is not just about relieving oneself of a parasite.","sinjin","449741","""Potential child"" is a meaningless term. What something may become is not what it is.

Many doctors see an embryo of 4,5,6 weeks as an individual. When most abortions occur there is a heart beat and many normal functions of born humans. Hell, at 6-7 weeks the fetus has eyes, arms, and legs and a few weeks later has visible fingers. The possible downside for anti-abortion folks is that an ultrasound, even transvaginal, normally can't see enough detail to tell any of this (maybe heart beat at 8 wks). This can have an adverse effect of making people think they are just hacking out a few unwanted cells when in reality there is a lot more going on. Seems to me showing them a picture of what they are about to abort would be more effective.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","06:45 PM","abortion-debates","64"

Tracy Weitz, an assistant professor in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at the University of California at San Francisco, performed a recent study on whether or not forced ultrasounds prior to abortion procedures changed womens minds and caused them to cancel the procedure; it did not. The study concluded that viewing an ultrasound is not an indication that a woman will cancel her scheduled procedure, regardless of what emotional response the sonogram elicits.

Showing an ultrasound picture has no effect, as you point out...show them a picture of what the baby actually looks like at that age (they are available all over the internet) since that is probably more effective than the ultrasound photo showing a black dot.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","01:01 PM","abortion-debates","67"
"02-24-2012","16151",5,"None","None","None","Another opinion","449791","I am also opposed to the law as it stood where it required a trans-vaginal probe ultrasound. I personally do not know of other medical procedures that are required by LAW to be performed on a person - especially none that do so for non-medical reasons. This would be negative on two fronts: 1) It would set a dangerous precedent for politicians to force un-necessary medical procedures purely for political reasons. 2) It is a highly invasive medically-unnecessary procedure that, in being forced upon a woman, is highly intrucive into her personal freedom. Because of issues such as this, I find Republican rhetoric about the Democrats' invasion of freedom as being utterly ridiculous and hipocritical. Republicans don't only want a smaller government - they want a government small enough to fit into our bedrooms... Either way, my understanding is that the bill has already been changed since there was such an outcry against requiring such a procedure. The governor, a fairly moderate Republican, said he would veto the law in that form so, apparently, the state legislature did change it to a version which required only the normal external ultrasound (which is typically done in abortions anyway). Even in this form, I object to the law since medical procedures should not be mandated by law. It should be between the doctor and patient to determine the procedures based on medical necessity and with the patient's general permission.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","01:37 PM","abortion-debates","68"

It mutilates a different part of the body for a different end. The only connection that male and female circumcision have is that they are both genital mutilations. Dont try to swerve the obvious. You forced you son to have a procedure that mutilated part of his external genitalia.
