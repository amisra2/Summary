I just want to understand what the criteria is for forcing something upon others in your mind.","sinjin","449655","A background check is meant to exclude one from the list of those prohibited from legally purchasing firearms. The transvaginal ultrasound in question serves no public interest other than to attempt to discourage women from obtaining a legal medical procedure because it is morally repugnant to some. As far as the contraception question goes, I think it is like other lifestyle choices that are personal and should not be open to picking and choosing by the employer. Comprehensive medical coverage is just that. Otherwise employers could decide not to cover any sort of lifestyle choices made by employess they didn't like. Overeating, smoking, too much procreating, alcohol related treatment. I asked before and I'll ask again. If the church is against out of wedlock births should they be able to deny maternity benefits to an unmarried employee? How is that different?","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","11:35 AM","abortion-debates","31"

Using the terms ' forced' or ' rape' is just using emotional and dishonest rhetoric","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","12:15 PM","abortion-debates","32"
"02-22-2012","16151",3,"gansao","449649","As I said the woman is not being forced at all so ' force' has nothing to do with the OP. The examination is a prerequisite before she is allowed to have a termination. It is not forced upon her.","Steeeeve","449658","Again, I'm not asking about whether or not she is being forced. I'm asking about the below: Are you against FORCING people to have a background check prior to owning a handgun or FORCING people who own a business to pay for insurance offering contraception or FORCING people to purchase health insurance in general? I just want to understand what the criteria is for forcing something upon others in your mind.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","12:27 PM","abortion-debates","33"

Forced and rape are emotional words and it are being misused by you and Simone You are creating victims where none exist.

Nevertheless, my point was that ""forcing"" was never really the issue...just whether or not you agree with THAT to be forced since you don't believe their is an interest. I'm fine if you think it is a bad law because it doesn't serve a valid purpose but don't say ""forcing"" is the reasoning behind it.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","06:02 PM","abortion-debates","45"
