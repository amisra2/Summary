"02-22-2012","16151",4,"Steeeeve","449681","I'm fine if you think it is a bad law because it doesn't serve a valid purpose but don't say ""forcing"" is the reasoning behind it.","sinjin","449683","I support forcing people to do many things. Serve in the military, pay taxes, go to school, etc.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","06:23 PM","abortion-debates","47"

Public will is subordinate to the Constitutional rights of the individual.","Steeeeve","449691","Right but you said ""public interest"" and that would clearly be defined by the public. Nothing discussed on this thread has any constitutional questions.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","07:29 PM","abortion-debates","48"
"02-22-2012","16151",4,"sinjin","449683","I support forcing people to do many things. Serve in the military, pay taxes, go to school, etc.","Steeeeve","449692","Right, so really there is no problem with the ""forcing"" part of this bill...it is the reasoning behind the bill. I have a problem with the way the opponents of the bill are going about their protest. They claim it is so immoral to ""force"" something yet, like you suggest, that is never the issue. The issue is that there is no legitimate reason to force this particular procedure. The debate should be what is a ""legitimate reason"" as opposed to whether or not we should force people to do something....yes?","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","07:32 PM","abortion-debates","49"
"02-23-2012","16151",4,"None","None","None","sinjin","449705","Yes, agreed.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","09:55 AM","abortion-debates","50"
"02-23-2012","16151",4,"sinjin","449606","Why shouldn't a women be forced to see the image before getting a legal elective procedure? How would like to be required to submit to a prostate exam and provide a semen sample before you could buy condoms?","gansao","449729","Contraception and terminations are two completely different procedures with two completely different outcomes. Are the use of prophylactics the same procedure or even directly related to medical procedures to treat sexually transmitted diseases? You need to try harder than than Even if it was a requirement to provide a sperm sample and submit to a prostate examination before I could but condoms I would still have a choice( unlike your child) I would not be forced to do anything and it cetainly would not be tantamount to rape If after buying condoms a finger was forcibly thrust into my rectum and after that I was locked in a room with a dirty mag and told not to come out without a sperm sample then I could say that I was forced to do these things. That is why I object to the word force as well as the word rape..both are incorrect and dishonest. They suggest coercion and helplessness when none exist( except in your case). I am not forced to provide money in order to purchase goods it is a requirement.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","05:13 PM","abortion-debates","52"
"02-23-2012","16151",4,"Steeeeve","449680","Than change the word forced to ""required"" and answer the question. Clearly you are missing the point.","gansao","449730","How about you changing the word forced to required and asking me again?","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","05:15 PM","abortion-debates","53"

The destruction or removal of a portion or the entire external genitalia What is quite undeniable is that you forced... force - to compel, constrain, oblige, impose. force - to compel by physical, moral, or intellectual means. ..an infant to have a procedure of genital mutilation. You had his foreskin cut off because you felt like it...he had no choice","sinjin","449731","Please describe the male internal genitalia. This is a direct reference to female genital mutilation. That's so what. I deny it is mutilation. Parents are required to force their children all the time. They often have no choice. I made the choice for him. I stand by it.

I would be proud to be Jewish but no. Btw, excluding Hispanics, 90% of American males are circumcised. 99% of American females prefer them that way.

You may have religion on your mind regarding abortion and contraception but there are ethical and moral perspectives outside of religion that would require a woman to look at the potential child that she is about to destroy. Abortion is not just about relieving oneself of a parasite.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","05:40 PM","abortion-debates","60"
