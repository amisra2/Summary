Anti-abortion legislation does not meet the definition as provided by the member Sinjin. Your statement is nothing more than pure hyperbole Simone. The most you can allege is an effort by states to limit post-rape treatment and options to victims. However even that is flimsy at best.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","04:20 PM","abortion-debates","5"

None, that's what.","gansao","449594","Then why are they obliged too? And its not really rape is it? Transvaginal ultrasound is a imaging technique used to create a picture of the genital tract in women. The hand-held device that produces the ultrasound waves is inserted directly into the vagina, close to the pelvic structures, thus often producing a clearer and less distorted image than obtained through transabdominal ultrasound technology, where the probe is located externally on the skin of the abdomen. Purpose Transvaginal ultrasound can used to evaluate problems or abnormalities of the female genital tract. It may provide more accurate information than transabdominal ultrasound for women who are obese, for women who are being evaluated or treated for infertility, or for women who have difficulty keeping a full bladder. However, it does provide a view of a smaller area than the transabdominal ultrasound.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","05:16 PM","abortion-debates","11"

However none of these constitute an example of rape. Even under standards of sodomy medical procedures are not considered criminal actions. Simply being uncomfortable with the procedure does not mean it is akin to rape. Medical procedures are not intended to be pleasant and desirable in nature. The use of transvaginal ultrasound devices are no more an example of rape for a woman than a colonoscopy is an example of rape for a man.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","06:11 PM","abortion-debates","15"
