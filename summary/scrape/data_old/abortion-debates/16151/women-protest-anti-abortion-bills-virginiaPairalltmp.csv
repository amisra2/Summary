I just want to understand what the criteria is for forcing something upon others in your mind.","sinjin","449655","A background check is meant to exclude one from the list of those prohibited from legally purchasing firearms. The transvaginal ultrasound in question serves no public interest other than to attempt to discourage women from obtaining a legal medical procedure because it is morally repugnant to some. As far as the contraception question goes, I think it is like other lifestyle choices that are personal and should not be open to picking and choosing by the employer. Comprehensive medical coverage is just that. Otherwise employers could decide not to cover any sort of lifestyle choices made by employess they didn't like. Overeating, smoking, too much procreating, alcohol related treatment. I asked before and I'll ask again. If the church is against out of wedlock births should they be able to deny maternity benefits to an unmarried employee? How is that different?","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","abortion-debates","31","11:35 AM"

When my son was born I was ""required"" to listen to a 15 minute lecture on why circumcision was now a bad thing before I could have my son cut. I found it offensive since the lecture had nothing to do with medicine.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","abortion-debates","37","01:12 PM"

Nevertheless, my point was that ""forcing"" was never really the issue...just whether or not you agree with THAT to be forced since you don't believe their is an interest. I'm fine if you think it is a bad law because it doesn't serve a valid purpose but don't say ""forcing"" is the reasoning behind it.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","abortion-debates","45","06:02 PM"

I have a problem with the way the opponents of the bill are going about their protest. They claim it is so immoral to ""force"" something yet, like you suggest, that is never the issue. The issue is that there is no legitimate reason to force this particular procedure. The debate should be what is a ""legitimate reason"" as opposed to whether or not we should force people to do something....yes?","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","abortion-debates","49","07:32 PM"

Many doctors see an embryo of 4,5,6 weeks as an individual. When most abortions occur there is a heart beat and many normal functions of born humans. Hell, at 6-7 weeks the fetus has eyes, arms, and legs and a few weeks later has visible fingers. The possible downside for anti-abortion folks is that an ultrasound, even transvaginal, normally can't see enough detail to tell any of this (maybe heart beat at 8 wks). This can have an adverse effect of making people think they are just hacking out a few unwanted cells when in reality there is a lot more going on. Seems to me showing them a picture of what they are about to abort would be more effective.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","abortion-debates","64","06:45 PM"

Tracy Weitz, an assistant professor in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at the University of California at San Francisco, performed a recent study on whether or not forced ultrasounds prior to abortion procedures changed womens minds and caused them to cancel the procedure; it did not. The study concluded that viewing an ultrasound is not an indication that a woman will cancel her scheduled procedure, regardless of what emotional response the sonogram elicits.

Showing an ultrasound picture has no effect, as you point out...show them a picture of what the baby actually looks like at that age (they are available all over the internet) since that is probably more effective than the ultrasound photo showing a black dot.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","abortion-debates","67","01:01 PM"
