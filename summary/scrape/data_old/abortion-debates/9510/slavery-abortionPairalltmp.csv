Second of all, even if it is the 1 percent you claim, that one percent is exactly the reason we need to keep abortion legal.","slavery-abortion","abortion-debates","47","09:01 PM"

If you think that this is a source that gives the statistics you claim, you are rathr delusional: you ould be pulling these numbers out of your arse for all we know. So kindly provide an actual source instead of evading, otherwise we can assume that your claims are unfounded, and dismiss them.","slavery-abortion","abortion-debates","50","02:09 PM"

Second of all, statistics has nothing to do with it, we needed to see a source that supports your numbers as you could easily be pulling them out of your arse. The burden of proof was on you to provide supporting evidence so don't give us your garbage, acting all self-righteous. I'll look into the article and post later, as I'm sure everyone else will. I already see a lot of bull in the part you posted with the ""social reasons"", which say it is because the foetus is inconvenient or unwanted, as there are innumereable reasons for abortion.","slavery-abortion","abortion-debates","52","02:28 PM"

In a debate, something like statistics isn't a fact unless it is substantiated by evidence (studies, etc.), which you were not supplying. Since this is a debate, a claim like that required some sort of support.","slavery-abortion","abortion-debates","54","04:01 PM"

Is a reason YOU support abortion because overall it decreases crime and welfare?","ShadowPikachu","251701","Uh, yeah, we totally beleive you. No, really we do!! ....... Allright, I guess we don't. You really expect us to beleive this line of garbage? Here's what I (and anyone else viewing the thread would think) think. You didn't read his link, made yourself look like a dumb arse, and now are trying to worm your way out of it when he pointed it out.","slavery-abortion","abortion-debates","155","10:52 AM"
