"02-12-2007","9510",5,"simone","250724","A pregnancy can be a threat to a woman's life. A pregnancy can be a threat to a woman's health. A pregnancy can be a threat to a woman's job, her career, her prosperity, her ability to care for her other children, a threat to carry out her responsibilities to others she may have in her family. A pregnancy is not the little simplicity you trick it out to be. How old are you, VT? You sound as if you don't know very much about life. Are you saying that when a woman stays home and takes care of children and a household that she's sitting around doing nothing? Do you know anything at all about the responsibilities and cares of parenting? How old are you, VT? You sound as if you don't know very much about life. I think Jitobear should be upset. In too many cases women are left totally alone to take on the heavy burden of a pregnancy, a delivery, the care of a child without anyone helping her along the way. And, if it is an illegitimate pregnancy, she is cursed and shunned by Christians and her life is made even more burdensome. Again, VT, how old are you? Do you know anything at all about life?","Shooterandproud","250772","I don't think age would have much to do with it. I'm holding up in this debate and I'm 14, I'm not as wise as you or Jito, but I still manage. IMO, VT is ignorant. I don't think he's young, but I don't think he (or she) has ever gone through a pregnancy.","slavery-abortion","01:25 PM","abortion-debates","61"

"02-13-2007","9510",5,"VTCruiser","250642","first of all, im very sorry that you have not been educated in high school about the statistics, but here you go... this is just one of thousands of sources on the internet that match these numbers... if you really want to see ... google it and find the credible websites.. i dont have time to post 50 for you. http://www.abortionno.org/Resources/fastfacts.html ""UNITED STATES Number of abortions per year: 1.37 Million (1996) Number of abortions per day: Approximately 3,700 Why women have abortions 1% of all abortions occur because of rape or incest; 6% of abortions occur because of potential health problems regarding either the mother or child, and 93% of all abortions occur for social reasons (i.e. the child is unwanted or inconvenient).""","SpicyGirl","250887","Don't you hate when people ask for sources and then don't even read it?! That is so annoying. But I definately agree with your source. Statistics have everything to do with what your agrument is about. I have read your link, and it is very accurate. I found not holes in it at all. Actually it is a national average. So it is a worthy source. Please allow me to add to your source, with ones of my own. Since people still, after a source has been listed. Have doubt, allow me to presnt some more links in conjunction with VTCruiser's links.To fortify the stand. Since this too is my view. Take a look at this source http://www.PregnantPause.org/numbers/index.html Here you need to scroll down, and click on,"" why women abort"". There you will see a chart of the reasons. This poll is taken from women who have aborted, and the numbers are from a worty source. Since they are taken from actual women, who have had an abortion. The numbers, match the ones that VTCruiser put up in his first link. 93% of abortions come from women who have social problems. Which in my mind, is not a valid reason for an abortion. BTW only 1.0% of the abortions were from incest, or rape. Now getting to the point that alot of pro-choice people like to debate upon. They speak of it being cruel to make a woman carry a fetus, when she was raped. They think that this is a special reason why alot of women who have been raped, get abortions. They feel as if, when raped the majority of women have abortions. Well, despite what alot of pro-chioce people want to believe. Alot of women who have been raped do not want abortions. As a matter of fact, they resent any who say they should have one, because they were raped. But I don't want anyone to take my word for it. Lets see what the victims have to say about this. http://www.lifenews.com/nat2566.html I do believe the victims are speaking against the abortion of their fetuses, because of rape. And are even taking it to court, to have their voices heard. They are tired of being misrepresented. Take a look at this. http://www.Amazon.com/victims-victor.../dp/0964895714 Now this is a book written from about 200 women. Who have been victims of rape. And who have either kept their babies, or regret killing them. Scroll down until you see book description. And read some of their comments on abortion because of rape. What better source to go by then those who have been in the situation?! And I don't doubt that there are some out there who have been raped, and quickly want an abortion. But the majority don't. And like that old phrase says,"" The majority rules!""","slavery-abortion","02:29 PM","abortion-debates","63"

"02-13-2007","9510",5,"Another opinion","250323","Are you claiming that black women are being forced into abortion? If not, then how is ""genocide"" being committed if they themselves are choosing abortion? By the way, the rates of abortion in whites vs blacks are similar to the rates of teenage pregnancy between whites and blacks. From http://www.teenpregnancy.org/america...sp?ID=3&sID=20 , there is a roughly three times higher rate of teenage pregnancies among black women than among white women (153/1000 vs 55/1000). From http://www.abortionfacts.com/statistics/race.asp , the abortion rate for whites is 12/1000 while it is 31/1000 for black women. Note, the 1000 refers to 1000 women of child-bearing age (or 1000 teenage women in the case of teenage pregancy rates). Since there is a much higher rate of teenage pregnacny among black women, it makes sense that there would be a much higher rate of abortion among black women. So, the main question is ""Why is there so much more teenage pregnancy among black women?"". I would think that poverty is a main reason. African Americans started off poor because of the legacy of slavery and stayed poor for ages because of unbridled discrimination. The last few decades have produced enormous changes in laws and practices governing discrimination. Unfortunately for African Americans, just as they were gaining more freedoms from discrimination in law and practice, socio-economic changes in the US made it more difficult for anybody who was poor (black or white) to get into the middle class. However, I hope that more African Americans will be able to take more advantage of those opportunities that they do still have to advance to higher levels (in education, sports, etc.).","SpicyGirl","250891","Ok, I'm going to have to question your statement as far as this post goes. I really don't like the fact that you brought out, how African Americans, abort because of poverty, and low education. But white people abort for different reasons. That is basicly what you said. I find that to be an insult. My cousin, was not poor, nor was she uneducated when she had her abortions. As well as my sister. I think that is some kind of rasist idea that alot of people like to keep as regards to black people. Because I never saw you pin a reason, on why white people abort. But in your mind its understandable. But WOE! To the uneducated black folks! Then you go on to state that black people should in fact take advantage of the higher education, and sports provided for them. By that statement, it seems to me as if you're implying that black people don't take the oppurtunity to benefit ourselves. Need I remind you, that black people are leading in the sports world. And that there are thousands of black people who are taking advantage of higher learning. And what is your advice for those who are white, who lead uneducated lives, and abort because of being poor. Believe it or not, there are alot in that situation. So don't you dare classify one race. And assume, they are uneducated, and poor. Thus they have abortions. Expecially since I see that with people of all races. It seems to me like you never took that into consideration.","slavery-abortion","03:01 PM","abortion-debates","65"

And I'm not talking about people judging what others should do. I'm talking about the fact that they said, rape victims have abortions because of rape. I'm attacking the statement. Not the fact of CHOICE. Many have held true to the fact that women who have been raped, want their fetus abroted. I said the majority rules, in that, the majority of women who have been raped do not want abortions. So in the case of the statement, the majority rules, in rendering the false statement wrong. And your wrong about the majority rules being the most assinine thing you heard today. When you wrote that example of people locking me up, and feeding me brussel sprouts was the most assinine thing written today. Its just sad you didn't notice it was.

The statistics on that completely confused me, as it listed the ""suction curretage"" method as the most common for abortions. I'm not American, and they don't even offer this method at the NHS hospital in my area, so I wasn't even aware of this method. The only methods offered by my hospital were the medical abortion, (both in the first and early second trimester, different procedures) which appears to count for only 62 abortions in the whole of the US, and the surgical abortion (first trimester). If anyone knows, is this site actually correct with these figures? (completely off topic from the whole rape/incest debate I know) I've never been in that situation, but I believe that if I was raped I would almost certainly have an abortion. I don't really think it's appropriate to say the majority rules because if I was in that situation I wouldn't give a damn if every other rape victim in the world who became pregnant kept their baby, if I wanted to abort that would be my choice after such a horrific ordeal.","slavery-abortion","03:47 PM","abortion-debates","67"

"02-14-2007","9510",5,"jitobear","250920","OK, I get it. I thought you were saying that because many, or a majority of rape victims (I am not convinced that this is true - nor do I really care) choose not to abort or regret their abortions, that those numbers mean they have the right to decide for the next victim. My mistake. You really need to lighten up. The statement was intended to be ridiculous. I know you are bright enough to know that. Actually I did respond a while back. ""Social reasons"", ""convenience reasons"" are all catchy little phrases that lifers use to demonize women faced with an unplanned pregnancy. What are these reasons, really, that make up that 93%? Jobs, money, education, safety, the ability to provide for oneself, drug addiction, being really young, being really scared - are ALL VALID REASONS. You can help to address them - or you can keep on trivializing them and saying that they (she) isn't good enough reason. Just because you do that doesn't mean she will. She has to and will address them, regardless of your preaching. Now what is your damned solution? If its criminalization or continued preaching - you aren't helping women or babies. I have been raped and I know good and well I would abort it in a heartbeat.","SpicyGirl","250961","Yup! Sure was. I know exactly what the example was supposed to be. But the example was uncalled for, and based on an assumption. And I don't take things like that lightly. I'm not talking about a while back. I was refering to the sources I put up yesterday. Which you failed to mention yesterday. Well since you quoted yourself on this one. I don't know if you are responding to me or yourself. But I'll go ahead and respond to it. I know it was meant for me. I have already posted up reasons, for why it is not an excuse to abort based on the reasons above. In another thread. I even put up links, because this has been asked before. And I really don't feel like repeating myself. Also, if you are going to call me preachy, and trival, then why even respond to me?! Your statements will just be the same. To me that is boring. Also, you still doubt information that is stated. Like in the case with the rape victims, you said, ""you doubt it, nor do you care."" I'm not getting mixed up in a debate with someone, who does not want to look at sources, and who calls people trival. Any information posted in a debate thread, is part of the debate, of course. So disregarding information, and saying you don't care. Is not a good debate. Sources are part of a debate, if you don't care. Then don't debate. If you think I'm preachy, stop talking to me. Thats your choice. Not eveyone has to agree though.","slavery-abortion","12:28 PM","abortion-debates","73"
"02-14-2007","9510",5,"SpicyGirl","250959","Firstly, I don't know what procedure you are talking about on that site. Because I was only intrested in the numbers. Not some video, that I don't know whether it is fake or not. I don't pay attention to videos on the internet about abortions. Because I don't know their source, and if they were altered. Also, I don't go to sites with the purpose for the sites to lie, and use deception so that my point can seem right. I like my links to be accurate. I will say this. My numbers added up, to VTCuisers numbers. And his numbers were national average numbers. That shows that whether they come from a pro-life site or not. The numbers are correct. But if the site is what is throwing people off. I will provide numbers from other sources other then a pro-life site, to support my claim. Again, I was not saying the majority rules, in the decision of what other women do with their bodies. I was proving a STATEMENT wrong. Does anyone get it now?! So I'm not saying you have no choice and others deterimne your choice. But the statement that the majority of raped women get abortions is wrong. Only a very few do. That is what I'm stating.","paw_x","250965","It wasn't a video, it was the methods of abortion ""information"" section of the site. I was just wondering if anyone knew it was correct. I wasn't aware anyone stated that the majority of women who are raped have abortions. I know people have stated that abortion is justified in cases of rape, and it has been mentioned that it isn't the woman's fault to have been raped [in response to those saying the woman should have never had sex].","slavery-abortion","12:59 PM","abortion-debates","75"
