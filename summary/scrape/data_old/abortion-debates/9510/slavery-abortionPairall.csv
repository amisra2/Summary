So you admit I never said what you said I said? I'll take that as apology and a admission you were quite wrong. I believe once enough neutral connections have been established that sentience follows. How many is the minimum necessary however is another matter all together. But sentience is not a issue for me in the decision making. Whether something has sentience is not really that important.
