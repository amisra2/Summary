"02-14-2007","9510",6,"paw_x","250965","It wasn't a video, it was the methods of abortion ""information"" section of the site. I was just wondering if anyone knew it was correct. I wasn't aware anyone stated that the majority of women who are raped have abortions. I know people have stated that abortion is justified in cases of rape, and it has been mentioned that it isn't the woman's fault to have been raped [in response to those saying the woman should have never had sex].","ShadowPikachu","250968","Not sure about that, I haven't done a whole lot of research into those kinds of statistics. You weren't aware of it because no one did. SpicyGirl seems intent on and obsessed with building up strawmen to tear down, so I say let her waste her time on it and don't pay her any attention.","slavery-abortion","01:46 PM","abortion-debates","76"
"02-14-2007","9510",6,"SpicyGirl","250961","I know exactly what the example was supposed to be. But the example was uncalled for, and based on an assumption. And I don't take things like that lightly. I'm not talking about a while back. I was refering to the sources I put up yesterday. Which you failed to mention yesterday. Well since you quoted yourself on this one. I don't know if you are responding to me or yourself. I have already posted up reasons, for why it is not an excuse to abort based on the reasons above. In another thread. I even put up links, because this has been asked before. And I really don't feel like repeating myself. Also, if you are going to call me preachy, and trival, then why even respond to me?! Your statements will just be the same. To me that is boring. Also, you still doubt information that is stated. Like in the case with the rape victims, you said, ""you doubt it, nor do you care."" I'm not getting mixed up in a debate with someone, who does not want to look at sources, and who calls people trival. If you think I'm preachy, stop talking to me. Thats your choice. Not eveyone has to agree though.","jitobear","250973","My experiences with you thus far is that you take little lightly. I use sarcasm to its full benefit. I'm here for fun more than anything. Your sources say the same thing that VTs did and I am not arguing about those stats. I am well aware that few abortions are performed due to rape or critical health conditions. My arguments are with whether rape/critical health conditions are the only valid reasons to abort and with the clumping of millions of women's life experiences into ""social"" or ""convenience"" categories. Just pointing out a previous response I made in regards to the stats. Whoopdedoodaday - I am officially posting here that they are valid excuses. I am not here to entertain you. You come in here and post stats that claim 93% of abortions are for social or convenience reasons. I take issue with the generalization that everything in a woman's life short of her impending death is a mere ""social"" or ""convenience"" matter. The things I posted are a damned big deal - and need to be addressed (and are only a small offering of the complications that could be going on in a woman's life). What I am saying is that stamping your foot and claiming ""those reasons aren't a good enough reason to get an abortion"" is preachy and does NOTHING. I am curious as to your goal here. Is it to attempt to reduce abortion or are you just here to state your opinion and attempt to change minds? If it is the latter - preaching is fine, if it is the former - you aren't really going to help. YOU may not think me having to stop working and potentially lose my home or not being able to care for my son aren't good enough reasons to abort - but I may. And if I am the one who is pregnant I will do what I must. You can join me in attempting to find a solution or you can preach. Which do you think will work in stopping the abortion? You finding one sight of raped women who regret having aborted does not indocate a majority of anything. And I really wouldn't care if you did. I am not arguing that. I never claimed anything about what raped woman want or will prefer. I just want them to have choice. I want me to. I took a glance and have seen many like them before. Careful how you condemn - you are being hypocritical again. May I remind you that when I attempted to show you what the world's leading health organizations had to say about gay parenting / gay marriage and what several children of gay parents had to say about their parents you flatly refused to visit the information. I did not do this. I said that you were trivializing the life circumstances of 93% of women who are facing unplanned pregnancy. No. Of course not.","slavery-abortion","02:56 PM","abortion-debates","77"
"02-14-2007","9510",6,"SpicyGirl","250963","I want to see your sources for these precentages. Show me where it says that more black women have abortions then white women because of poverty. As far as you feeling as if poverty was the reason why both white and black women abort, you never specified that. You only mentioned black women as having abortions because of poverty. I don't think you're prejudice, I just think that the way you worded your last post was questionable. I agree that ALL races should take more advantages of the opportunity to advance. But you did not generalize your statements. You classified them to one specific group of people. By making the statement that African Americans should take the opportunity to advance. But only now are you generalizing your statement. Which tends to lead a reader, like me. To think you were only pin-pointing a certain group of people. Beings that you only said African Americans. You never pin-pointed another race. Which is misleading, if that was not what you meant to do.","Another opinion","250975","The post that I wrote that you had originally responded to (post #23) was a post in which I responded to a claim that abortion was being used as a type of genocide (yes, that word was used) against African Americans (post #2). I thought that that claim was unjustified so I wrote my post to refute it. My post concentrated on the reasons why so many African American women abort because it was meant to refute the apparent claim that they abort because of society's intention to minimize the African American population. It is all a matter of context. Perhaps you did not see the context in which I wrote that post. Speaking about race in general can be a tricky issue since it is such a sensitive topic that people can easily jump to conclusions. That is why it is important to hear the person out. Yes, my arguements were not a general discussion about the reasons why all races abort but specifically concentrated on why black women abort. I still think those arguements make sense in the context of the post that I was responding to but I realize that, if you read it on its own out of context, the fact that it did not address other races could be taken the wrong way. I just don't know if that could have been avoided without going into a very long winded post.","slavery-abortion","03:32 PM","abortion-debates","78"

But I see that your intentions were not to demean the black race. So I apologise for jumping to conclusions. Those situations are of real concern not only to black, but to alot of people today. The way the economy is people tend to get more abortions. Not that I think its right.","slavery-abortion","02:21 PM","abortion-debates","81"

And the fact that I'm still replying to you, shows that I don't really take your sarcasim seriously. People who I really can't stand, I just don't reply to at all. I know it sounds mean. Hey! What can I say?! No ones perfect. You may not have said anything about being concerned about stats. But others were asking about it. So I gave proof. Plus proof in certain debates, is really what is needed. I never said you were. I come on here to enjoy myself. So I'm finding entertainment for myself. It is up to me to respond to people who I think will give me a good debate. The fact that I said some of what you do is boring, is so that you will know why you're being ignored when you write some of the stuff that I don't feel like responding to. Because for me its probably either boring, or something that you tend to drag out for days, and I really don't feel like hearing it. Not that you care, nor do I. I'm just setting the facts straight. I don't need anyone to entertain me. I will find entertainment for myself, thank you. First of all, I'm on here to state my views on the matter. Not tell anyone else how they should live their lives. I'm making a stand, sticking to it. And giving proof why I stick to it. What others do is their business. But I'm speaking against it. So my goal is to voice my opinion. Second of all, how in the world can you say that you are pro-choice, but then say you want to find a solution to abortion?! You feel as if abortion should be avilable. So why is it your trying to solve the problem?! I thought pro-choice people did not view abortion as a problem that needed a solution. So where do you stand on this?! It was not a site with women who regret having abortions. It was rape victims/incest victims who WILL not have an abortion due to the violent actions takern against them. Also they do make up the majority, because those women are in large numbers trying to get a constitution made, so that they can have their voices heard. It has nothing to do with what you want to do with your body. Instead it has everything to do with dispelling the misinformed fact that alot of pro-choice people like to lean on. And that is the statement that rape victims/incest victims want abortions. Because that is simply not true. Out of the 1% that get raped, only a fraction, want a abortion. So that is my purose of that link. And that is a claim I see alot. Also, I did not need to post up various links. When that one link surfficed with what I was trying to say. First of all, I don't condemn people. I state my own views, backed up with sources. So using condemn in this sense is a misuse of the word. And who said that I did not take a look at the sources taht you provided?! Do you know that for sure?! I just did not agree. But that does not mean I didn't look at them. Thats obvious. You wont leave me alone. You followed me out of the gay marriage thread, and are now bugging me in this thread. Your puropose is?! Maybe to annoy me to death?!","slavery-abortion","02:58 PM","abortion-debates","82"

Abortion is a sad symptom of bigger issues. I do believe that it would be wonderful to reduce abortion - but I don't believe criminalization is the answer. And I do believe there are times when abortion may be necesary but only the woman pregnant can know that. You do not support abortion, but do not seek to stop it either. To me that makes you pro-choice. You think its horrible and even wrong - but you aren't seeking to make choices for other people either. I have always felt there is more middle ground between the pro-life and pro-choice movement than there is dissent - we all just spend too much time bickering to find it. For the record - most choicers don't think abortion is grand - it is a sad, hard thing a woman goes through. We just don't want it criminalized - made illegal. I still don't see how you can claim its a majority of anything. Roughly half the folks in the US are pro-choice and roughly a third of all women will be raped. To claim that a majority of those women don't want abortion (as a choice) doesn't seem to make a mathematical sense to me. In the end - choicers aren't saying that all rape victims want abortion anyway. They are just saying that they want all rape victims to have the choice . You did. You said point blank in the post that you wouldn't look at them. Please - out from behind the ego. I have been posting here for a couple of years now - it has nothing to do with you.","slavery-abortion","10:49 PM","abortion-debates","83"
"02-15-2007","9510",6,"jitobear","250920","""Social reasons"", ""convenience reasons"" are all catchy little phrases that lifers use to demonize women faced with an unplanned pregnancy. What are these reasons, really, that make up that 93%? Jobs, money, education, safety, the ability to provide for oneself, drug addiction, being really young, being really scared - are ALL VALID REASONS.","VTCruiser","251129","Just my first thought when i read this is... this is exactly the same type of argument plantation owners used when they were challenged by abolitionists.","slavery-abortion","11:11 PM","abortion-debates","84"

Second, even if she hypothetically had said that (which you cannot show that she did), why would it matter? Eugenics was not followed as a practice in the US, despite its early adherents, and is certainly not part of any national strategy of any major movement today such as Planned Parenthood. You have no evidence to say otherwise so your statements are nothing but unsupported opinion - worth much less than supported opinion. The African American women are CHOOSING to have those abortions so any idea of genocide against African Americans is completely invalid.","ShadowPikachu","251159","Well, this IS VT we're talking about here, you can't just expect him to provide evidence .
