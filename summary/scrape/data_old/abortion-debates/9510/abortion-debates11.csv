Btw you haven't proven me wrong anywhere so your again is quite wrong as well. I pointed to a book that explains my point. How am I avoiding the question? You make no sense. You do remind of someone who's been beaten so badly and wanting a win that he's willing to throw out completely nonsense in the hopes something sticks.","slavery-abortion","03:26 AM","abortion-debates","153"

You really expect us to beleive this line of garbage? Here's what I (and anyone else viewing the thread would think) think. You didn't read his link, made yourself look like a dumb arse, and now are trying to worm your way out of it when he pointed it out.","slavery-abortion","10:52 AM","abortion-debates","155"

It was great, and it raised some very good points about economic issues.","slavery-abortion","01:27 PM","abortion-debates","156"

I address points made to me, you have a bad habit of ignoring a ever increasing amount of points made to you . Explain to me how I am avoiding a question by pointing to a book that explains exactly why I believe what you say I do. Would you say someone who was asked for evidence by citing a book to be avoiding the question. You make no sense. Considering I already answered that question [ShadowPikachu's post] you're just repeating yourself in light of being given the answer.","slavery-abortion","02:03 PM","abortion-debates","157"
"02-20-2007","9510",11,"obvious_child","251672","How is that related? But on that note, I like the idea of scanning everything in a library and putting online. That would significently lower costs and we could replace libraries with public computer labs that only connect to a central library. Much lower costs doing the same kind of gov't duty!","jitobear","251844","I think that is great idea for researching - but too much reading on-screen gives me a headache. I need books in front of me.","slavery-abortion","10:05 AM","abortion-debates","158"
