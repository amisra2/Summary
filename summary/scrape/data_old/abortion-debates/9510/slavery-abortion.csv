There are logical similarities between some of the arguments justifying slavery and arguments justifying abortion. These similarities are perhaps most evident in the two corresponding SCOTUS decisions in Dred Scott v. Sandford and Roe v. Wade. Both of these cases used the illegitimate doctrine of substantive due process, and in the process, substituted what the Constitution really says with what the Justices wanted it to say.","slavery-abortion","11:33 PM","abortion-debates","3"

If not, then how is ""genocide"" being committed if they themselves are choosing abortion? By the way, the rates of abortion in whites vs blacks are similar to the rates of teenage pregnancy between whites and blacks. From http://www.teenpregnancy.org/america...sp?ID=3&sID=20 , there is a roughly three times higher rate of teenage pregnancies among black women than among white women (153/1000 vs 55/1000). From http://www.abortionfacts.com/statistics/race.asp , the abortion rate for whites is 12/1000 while it is 31/1000 for black women. Note, the 1000 refers to 1000 women of child-bearing age (or 1000 teenage women in the case of teenage pregancy rates). Since there is a much higher rate of teenage pregnacny among black women, it makes sense that there would be a much higher rate of abortion among black women. So, the main question is ""Why is there so much more teenage pregnancy among black women?"". I would think that poverty is a main reason. African Americans started off poor because of the legacy of slavery and stayed poor for ages because of unbridled discrimination. The last few decades have produced enormous changes in laws and practices governing discrimination. Unfortunately for African Americans, just as they were gaining more freedoms from discrimination in law and practice, socio-economic changes in the US made it more difficult for anybody who was poor (black or white) to get into the middle class. However, I hope that more African Americans will be able to take more advantage of those opportunities that they do still have to advance to higher levels (in education, sports, etc.).","slavery-abortion","10:01 AM","abortion-debates","23"

I found not holes in it at all. Actually it is a national average. So it is a worthy source. Please allow me to add to your source, with ones of my own. Since people still, after a source has been listed. Have doubt, allow me to presnt some more links in conjunction with VTCruiser's links.To fortify the stand. Since this too is my view. Take a look at this source http://www.PregnantPause.org/numbers/index.html Here you need to scroll down, and click on,"" why women abort"". There you will see a chart of the reasons. This poll is taken from women who have aborted, and the numbers are from a worty source. Since they are taken from actual women, who have had an abortion. The numbers, match the ones that VTCruiser put up in his first link. 93% of abortions come from women who have social problems. Which in my mind, is not a valid reason for an abortion. BTW only 1.0% of the abortions were from incest, or rape. Now getting to the point that alot of pro-choice people like to debate upon. They speak of it being cruel to make a woman carry a fetus, when she was raped. They think that this is a special reason why alot of women who have been raped, get abortions. They feel as if, when raped the majority of women have abortions. Well, despite what alot of pro-chioce people want to believe. Alot of women who have been raped do not want abortions. As a matter of fact, they resent any who say they should have one, because they were raped. But I don't want anyone to take my word for it. Lets see what the victims have to say about this. http://www.lifenews.com/nat2566.html I do believe the victims are speaking against the abortion of their fetuses, because of rape. And are even taking it to court, to have their voices heard. They are tired of being misrepresented. Take a look at this. http://www.Amazon.com/victims-victor.../dp/0964895714 Now this is a book written from about 200 women. Who have been victims of rape. And who have either kept their babies, or regret killing them. Scroll down until you see book description. And read some of their comments on abortion because of rape.

"02-13-2007","9510",5,"Another opinion","250323","Are you claiming that black women are being forced into abortion? If not, then how is ""genocide"" being committed if they themselves are choosing abortion? By the way, the rates of abortion in whites vs blacks are similar to the rates of teenage pregnancy between whites and blacks. From http://www.teenpregnancy.org/america...sp?ID=3&sID=20 , there is a roughly three times higher rate of teenage pregnancies among black women than among white women (153/1000 vs 55/1000). From http://www.abortionfacts.com/statistics/race.asp , the abortion rate for whites is 12/1000 while it is 31/1000 for black women. Note, the 1000 refers to 1000 women of child-bearing age (or 1000 teenage women in the case of teenage pregancy rates). Since there is a much higher rate of teenage pregnacny among black women, it makes sense that there would be a much higher rate of abortion among black women. So, the main question is ""Why is there so much more teenage pregnancy among black women?"". I would think that poverty is a main reason. African Americans started off poor because of the legacy of slavery and stayed poor for ages because of unbridled discrimination. The last few decades have produced enormous changes in laws and practices governing discrimination. Unfortunately for African Americans, just as they were gaining more freedoms from discrimination in law and practice, socio-economic changes in the US made it more difficult for anybody who was poor (black or white) to get into the middle class. However, I hope that more African Americans will be able to take more advantage of those opportunities that they do still have to advance to higher levels (in education, sports, etc.).","SpicyGirl","250891","Ok, I'm going to have to question your statement as far as this post goes. I really don't like the fact that you brought out, how African Americans, abort because of poverty, and low education. But white people abort for different reasons. That is basicly what you said. I find that to be an insult. My cousin, was not poor, nor was she uneducated when she had her abortions. As well as my sister. I think that is some kind of rasist idea that alot of people like to keep as regards to black people. Because I never saw you pin a reason, on why white people abort. But in your mind its understandable. But WOE! To the uneducated black folks! Then you go on to state that black people should in fact take advantage of the higher education, and sports provided for them. By that statement, it seems to me as if you're implying that black people don't take the oppurtunity to benefit ourselves. Need I remind you, that black people are leading in the sports world. And that there are thousands of black people who are taking advantage of higher learning. And what is your advice for those who are white, who lead uneducated lives, and abort because of being poor. Believe it or not, there are alot in that situation. So don't you dare classify one race. And assume, they are uneducated, and poor. Thus they have abortions.

There you will see a chart of the reasons. This poll is taken from women who have aborted, and the numbers are from a worty source. Since they are taken from actual women, who have had an abortion. The numbers, match the ones that VTCruiser put up in his first link. 93% of abortions come from women who have social problems. Which in my mind, is not a valid reason for an abortion. BTW only 1.0% of the abortions were from incest, or rape. What better source to go by then those who have been in the situation?!

The statistics on that completely confused me, as it listed the ""suction curretage"" method as the most common for abortions. I'm not American, and they don't even offer this method at the NHS hospital in my area, so I wasn't even aware of this method. The only methods offered by my hospital were the medical abortion, (both in the first and early second trimester, different procedures) which appears to count for only 62 abortions in the whole of the US, and the surgical abortion (first trimester). If anyone knows, is this site actually correct with these figures? (completely off topic from the whole rape/incest debate I know) I've never been in that situation, but I believe that if I was raped I would almost certainly have an abortion. I don't really think it's appropriate to say the majority rules because if I was in that situation I wouldn't give a damn if every other rape victim in the world who became pregnant kept their baby, if I wanted to abort that would be my choice after such a horrific ordeal.","slavery-abortion","03:47 PM","abortion-debates","67"

My mistake. You really need to lighten up. The statement was intended to be ridiculous. I know you are bright enough to know that. Actually I did respond a while back. ""Social reasons"", ""convenience reasons"" are all catchy little phrases that lifers use to demonize women faced with an unplanned pregnancy. What are these reasons, really, that make up that 93%? Jobs, money, education, safety, the ability to provide for oneself, drug addiction, being really young, being really scared - are ALL VALID REASONS. You can help to address them - or you can keep on trivializing them and saying that they (she) isn't good enough reason. Just because you do that doesn't mean she will.

My arguments are with whether rape/critical health conditions are the only valid reasons to abort and with the clumping of millions of women's life experiences into ""social"" or ""convenience"" categories. Just pointing out a previous response I made in regards to the stats. Whoopdedoodaday - I am officially posting here that they are valid excuses. I am not here to entertain you. You come in here and post stats that claim 93% of abortions are for social or convenience reasons. I take issue with the generalization that everything in a woman's life short of her impending death is a mere ""social"" or ""convenience"" matter. The things I posted are a damned big deal - and need to be addressed (and are only a small offering of the complications that could be going on in a woman's life). What I am saying is that stamping your foot and claiming ""those reasons aren't a good enough reason to get an abortion"" is preachy and does NOTHING. I am curious as to your goal here. Is it to attempt to reduce abortion or are you just here to state your opinion and attempt to change minds? If it is the latter - preaching is fine, if it is the former - you aren't really going to help. YOU may not think me having to stop working and potentially lose my home or not being able to care for my son aren't good enough reasons to abort - but I may.

You finding one sight of raped women who regret having aborted does not indocate a majority of anything. And I really wouldn't care if you did. I am not arguing that. I never claimed anything about what raped woman want or will prefer. I just want them to have choice. I want me to. I took a glance and have seen many like them before.

May I remind you that when I attempted to show you what the world's leading health organizations had to say about gay parenting / gay marriage and what several children of gay parents had to say about their parents you flatly refused to visit the information.

I don't think you're prejudice, I just think that the way you worded your last post was questionable. I agree that ALL races should take more advantages of the opportunity to advance.

And I do believe there are times when abortion may be necesary but only the woman pregnant can know that. You do not support abortion, but do not seek to stop it either. To me that makes you pro-choice. You think its horrible and even wrong - but you aren't seeking to make choices for other people either. I have always felt there is more middle ground between the pro-life and pro-choice movement than there is dissent - we all just spend too much time bickering to find it. For the record - most choicers don't think abortion is grand - it is a sad, hard thing a woman goes through. We just don't want it criminalized - made illegal. I still don't see how you can claim its a majority of anything. Roughly half the folks in the US are pro-choice and roughly a third of all women will be raped. To claim that a majority of those women don't want abortion (as a choice) doesn't seem to make a mathematical sense to me.

CHAPTER IV: The Fertility of the Feeble-Minded What vesture have you woven for my year? O Man and Woman who have fashioned it Together, is it fine and clean and strong, Made in such reverence of holy joy, Of such unsullied substance, that your hearts Leap with glad awe to see it clothing me, The glory of whose nakedness you know? ""The Song of the Unborn"" Amelia Josephine Burr There is but one practical and feasible program in handling the great problem of the feeble-minded . That is, as the best authorities are agreed, to prevent the birth of those who would transmit imbecility to their descendants . Feeble-mindedness as investigations and statistics from every country indicate, is invariably associated with an abnormally high rate of fertility. Modern conditions of civilization, as we are continually being reminded, furnish the most favorable breeding-ground for the mental defective, the XXXXX, the imbecile. ""We protect the members of a weak strain,"" says Davenport, ""up to the period of reproduction, and then let them free upon the community, and encourage them to leave a large progeny of `feeble-minded': which in turn, protected from mortality and carefully nurtured up to the reproductive period, are again set free to reproduce, and so the stupid work goes on of preserving and increasing our socially unfit strains ."" The philosophy of Birth Control points out that as long as civilized communities encourage unrestrained fecundity in the ""normal"" members of the population--always of course under the cloak of decency and morality--and penalize every attempt to introduce the principle of discrimination and responsibility in parenthood, they will be faced with the ever-increasing problem of feeble-mindedness, that fertile parent of degeneracy, crime, and pauperism. Small as the percentage of the imbecile and half-witted may seem in comparison with the normal members of the community, it should always be remembered that feeble-mindedness is not an unrelated expression of modern civilization. Its roots strike deep into the social fabric. Modern studies indicate that insanity, epilepsy, criminality, prostitution, pauperism, and mental defect, are all organically bound up together and that the least intelligent and the thoroughly degenerate classes in every community are the most prolific . Feeble-mindedness in one generation becomes pauperism or insanity in the next. There is every indication that feeble-mindedness in its protean forms is on the increase, that it has leaped the barriers, and that there is truly, as some of the scientific eugenists have pointed out, a feeble-minded peril to future generations--unless the feeble-minded are prevented from reproducing their kind . To meet this emergency is the immediate and peremptory duty of every State and of all communities. The curious situation has come about that while our statesmen are busy upon their propaganda of ""repopulation,"" and are encouraging the production of large families, they are ignoring the exigent problem of the elimination of the feeble-minded . In this, however, the politicians are at one with the traditions of a civilization which, with its charities and philanthropies, has propped up the defective and degenerate and relieved them of the burdens borne by the healthy sections of the community, thus enabling them more easily and more numerously to propagate their kind. ""With the very highest motives,"" declares Dr. Walter E. Fernald, ""modern philanthropic efforts often tend to foster and increase the growth of defect in the community.... The only feeble-minded persons who now receive any official consideration are those who have already become dependent or delinquent, many of whom have already become parents. We lock the barn-door after the horse is stolen. We now have state commissions for controlling the gipsy-moth and the boll weevil, the foot-and-mouth disease, and for protecting the shell-fish and wild game, but we have no commission which even attempts to modify or to control the vast moral and economic forces represented by the feeble-minded persons at large in the community ."" How the feeble-minded and their always numerous progeny run the gamut of police, alms-houses, courts, penal institutions, ""charities and corrections,"" tramp shelters, lying-in hospitals, and relief afforded by privately endowed religious and social agencies, is shown in any number of reports and studies of family histories. We find cases of feeble-mindedness and mental defect in the reports on infant mortality referred to in a previous chapter, as well as in other reports published by the United States government. Here is a typical case showing the astonishing ability to ""increase and multiply,"" organically bound up with delinquency and defect of various types: ""The parents of a feeble-minded girl, twenty years of age, who was committed to the Kansas State Industrial Farm on a vagrancy charge, lived in a thickly populated Negro district which was reported by the police to be the headquarters for the criminal element of the surrounding State.... The mother married at fourteen, and her first child was born at fifteen . In rapid succession she gave birth to sixteen live-born children and had one miscarriage. The first child, a girl, married but separated from her husband.... The fourth, fifth and sixth, all girls, died in infancy or early childhood. The seventh, a girl, remarried after the death of her husband, from whom she had been separated. The eighth, a boy who early in life began to exhibit criminal tendencies, was in prison for highway robbery and burglary. The ninth, a girl, normal mentally, was in quarantine at the Kansas State Industrial Farm at the time this study was made; she had lived with a man as his common-law wife, and had also been arrested several times for soliciting. The tenth, a boy, was involved in several delinquencies when young and was sent to the detention-house but did not remain there long. The eleventh, a boy... at the age of seventeen was sentenced to the penitentiary for twenty years on a charge of first-degree robbery; after serving a portion of his time, he was paroled, and later was shot and killed in a fight. The twelfth, a boy, was at fifteen years of age implicated in a murder and sent to the industrial school, but escaped from there on a bicycle which he had stolen; at eighteen, he was shot and killed by a woman. The thirteenth child, feeble-minded, is the girl of the study. The fourteenth, a boy was considered by police to be the best member of the family; his mother reported him to be much slower mentally than his sister just mentioned; he had been arrested several times. Once, he was held in the detention-home and once sent to the State Industrial school; at other times, he was placed on probation. The fifteenth, a girl sixteen years old, has for a long time had a bad reputation. Subsequent to the commitment of her sister to the Kansas State Industrial Farm, she was arrested on a charge of vagrancy, found to by syphilitic, and quarantined in a state other than Kansas. At the time of her arrest, she stated that prostitution was her occupation. The last child was a boy of thirteen years whose history was not secured....""(1) The notorious fecundity of feeble-minded women is emphasized in studies and investigations of the problem, coming from all countries. ""The feeble-minded woman is twice as prolific as the normal one."" Sir James Crichton-Browne speaks of the great numbers of feeble-minded girls, wholly unfit to become mothers, who return to the work-house year after year to bear children, ""many of whom happily die, but some of whom survive to recruit our idiot establishments and to repeat their mothers' performances."" Tredgold points out that the number of children born to the feeble-minded is abnormally high. Feeble-minded women ""constitute a permanent menace to the race and one which becomes serious at a time when the decline of the birth-rate is... unmistakable."" Dr. Tredgold points out that ""the average number of children born in a family is four,"" whereas in these degenerate families, we find an average of 7.3 to each. Out of this total only a little more than ONE-THIRD--456 out of a total of 1,269 children--can be considered profitable members of the community, and that, be it remembered, at the parents' valuation. Another significant point is the number of mentally defective children who survive. ""Out of the total number of 526 mentally affected persons in the 150 families, there are 245 in the present generation--an unusually large survival.""(2) Speaking for Bradford, England, Dr. Helen U. Campbell touches another significant and interesting point usually neglected by the advocates of mothers' pensions, milk-stations, and maternity-education programs. ""We are also confronted with the problem of the actually mentally deficient, of the more or less feeble-minded, and the deranged, epileptic... or otherwise mentally abnormal mother,"" writes this authority. ""The `bad mothering' of these cases is quite unimprovable at an infant welfare center, and a very definite if not relatively very large percentage of our infants are suffering severely as a result of dependence upon such `mothering.""'(3) Thus we are brought face to face with another problem of infant mortality. Are we to check the infant mortality rate among the feeble-minded and aid the unfortunate offspring to grow up, a menace to the civilized community even when not actually certifiable as mentally defective or not obviously imbecile? Other figures and studies indicate the close relationship between feeble-mindedness and the spread of venereal scourges. We are informed that in Michigan, 75 per cent. of the prostitute class is infected with some form of venereal disease, and that 75 per cent. of the infected are mentally defective,--XXXXXX, imbeciles, or ""border-line"" cases most dangerous to the community at large. At least 25 per cent. of the inmates of our prisons, according to Dr. Fernald, are mentally defective and belong either to the feeble-minded or to the defective-delinquent class. Nearly 50 per cent. of the girls sent to reformatories are mental defectives. To-day, society treats feeble-minded or ""defective delinquent"" men or women as ""criminals,"" sentences them to prison or reformatory for a ""term,"" and then releases them at the expiration of their sentences. They are usually at liberty just long enough to reproduce their kind, and then they return again and again to prison. The truth of this statement is evident from the extremely large proportion in institutions of neglected and dependent children, who are the feeble-minded offspring of such feeble-minded parents. Confronted with these shocking truths about the menace of feeble-mindedness to the race, a menace acute because of the unceasing and unrestrained fertility of such defectives, we are apt to become the victims of a ""wild panic for instant action."" There is no occasion for hysterical, ill-considered action, specialists tell us. They direct our attention to another phase of the problem, that of the so-called ""good feeble-minded."" We are informed that imbecility, in itself, is not synonymous with badness. If it is fostered in a ""suitable environment,"" it may express itself in terms of good citizenship and useful occupation. It may thus be transmuted into a docile, tractable, and peaceable element of the community. The XXXXX and the feeble-minded, thus protected, so we are assured, may even marry some brighter member of the community, and thus lessen the chances of procreating another generation of imbeciles. We read further that some of our doctors believe that ""in our social scale, there is a place for the good feeble-minded."" In such a reckless and thoughtless differentiation between the ""bad"" and the ""good"" feeble-minded, we find new evidence of the conventional middle-class bias that also finds expression among some of the eugenists. We do not object to feeble-mindedness simply because it leads to immorality and criminality; nor can we approve of it when it expresses itself in docility, submissiveness and obedience. We object because both are burdens and dangers to the intelligence of the community. As a matter of fact, there is sufficient evidence to lead us to believe that the so-called ""borderline cases"" are a greater menace than the out-and-out ""defective delinquents"" who can be supervised, controlled and prevented from procreating their kind. The advent of the Binet-Simon and similar psychological tests indicates that the mental defective who is glib and plausible, bright looking and attractive, but with a mental vision of seven, eight or nine years, may not merely lower the whole level of intelligence in a school or in a society, but may be encouraged by church and state to increase and multiply until he dominates and gives the prevailing ""color""--culturally speaking--to an entire community. The presence in the public schools of the mentally defective children of men and women who should never have been parents is a problem that is becoming more and more difficult, and is one of the chief reasons for lower educational standards. As one of the greatest living authorities on the subject, Dr. A. Tredgold, has pointed out,(4) this has created a destructive conflict of purpose. ""In the case of children with a low intellectual capacity, much of the education at present provided is for all practical purposes a complete waste of time, money and patience.... On the other hand, for children of high intellectual capacity, our present system does not go far enough. I believe that much innate potentiality remains undeveloped, even amongst the working classes, owing to the absence of opportunity for higher education, to the disadvantage of the nation. In consequence of these fundamental differences, the catchword `equality of opportunity' is meaningless and mere claptrap in the absence of any equality to respond to such opportunity. What is wanted is not equality of opportunity, but education adapted to individual potentiality; and if the time and money now spent in the fruitless attempt to make silk-purses out of sows' ears, were devoted to the higher education of children of good natural capacity, it would contribute enormously to national efficiency."" In a much more complex manner than has been recognized even by students of this problem, the destiny and the progress of civilization and of human expression has been hindered and held back by this burden of the imbecile and the XXXXX. While we may admire the patience and the deep human sympathy with which the great specialists in feeble-mindedness have expressed the hope of drying up the sources of this evil or of rendering it harmless, we should not permit sympathy or sentimentality to blind us to the fact that health and vitality and human growth likewise need cultivation. ""A LAISSER FAIRE policy,"" writes one investigator, ""simply allows the social sore to spread. And a quasi LAISSER FAIRE policy wherein we allow the defective to commit crime and then interfere and imprison him, wherein we grant the defective the personal liberty to do as he pleases, until he pleases to descend to a plane of living below the animal level, and try to care for a few of his descendants who are so helpless that they can no longer exercise that personal liberty to do as they please,""--such a policy increases and multiplies the dangers of the over-fertile feeble-minded.(5) The Mental Survey of the State of Oregon recently published by the United States Health Service, sets an excellent example and should be followed by every state in the Union and every civilized country as well. It is greatly to the credit of the Western State that it is one of the first officially to recognize the primary importance of this problem and to realize that facts, no matter how fatal to self-satisfaction, must be faced. This survey, authorized by the state legislature, and carried out by the University of Oregon, in collaboration with Dr. C. L. Carlisle of the Public Health service, aided by a large number of volunteers, shows that only a small percentage of mental defectives and XXXXXX are in the care of institutions. The rest are widely scattered and their condition unknown or neglected. They are docile and submissive, they do not attract attention to themselves as do the criminal delinquents and the insane. Nevertheless, it is estimated that they number no less than 75,000 men, women, and children, out of a total population of 783,000, or about ten per cent. Oregon, it is thought, is no exception to other states. Yet under our present conditions, these people are actually encouraged to increase and multiply and replenish the earth. Concerning the importance of the Oregon survey, we may quote Surgeon General H. C. Cumming: ""the prevention and correction of mental defectives is one of the great public health problems of to-day. It enters into many phases of our work and its influence continually crops up unexpectedly. For instance, work of the Public Health Service in connection with juvenile courts shows that a marked proportion of juvenile delinquency is traceable to some degree of mental deficiency in the offender. For years Public Health officials have concerned themselves only with the disorders of physical health; but now they are realizing the significance of mental health also. The work in Oregon constitutes the first state-wide survey which even begins to disclose the enormous drain on a state, caused by mental defects. One of the objects of the work was to obtain for the people of Oregon an idea of the problem that confronted them and the heavy annual loss, both economic and industrial, that it entailed. Another was to enable the legislators to devise a program that would stop much of the loss, restore to health and bring to lives of industrial usefulness, many of those now down and out, and above all, to save hundreds of children from growing up to lives of misery."" It will be interesting to see how many of our State Legislatures have the intelligence and the courage to follow in the footsteps of Oregon in this respect. Nothing could more effectually stimulate discussion, and awaken intelligence as to the extravagance and cost to the community of our present codes of traditional morality. But we should make sure in all such surveys, that mental defect is not concealed even in such dignified bodies as state legislatures and among those leaders who are urging men and women to reckless and irresponsible procreation. I have touched upon these various aspects of the complex problem of the feeble-minded, and the menace of the XXXXX to human society, not merely for the purpose of reiterating that it is one of the greatest and most difficult social problems of modern times, demanding an immediate, stern and definite policy, but because it illustrates the actual harvest of reliance upon traditional morality, upon the biblical injunction to increase and multiply, a policy still taught by politician, priest and militarist. Motherhood has been held universally sacred; yet, as Bouchacourt pointed out, ""to-day, the dregs of the human species, the blind, the deaf-mute, the degenerate, the nervous, the vicious, the idiotic, the imbecile, the cretins and the epileptics--are better protected than pregnant women."" The syphilitic, the irresponsible, the feeble-minded are encouraged to breed unhindered, while all the powerful forces of tradition, of custom, or prejudice, have bolstered up the desperate effort to block the inevitable influence of true civilization in spreading the principles of independence, self-reliance, discrimination and foresight upon which the great practice of intelligent parenthood is based. To-day we are confronted by the results of this official policy. There is no escaping it; there is no explaining it away. Surely it is an amazing and discouraging phenomenon that the very governments that have seen fit to interfere in practically every phase of the normal citizen's life, dare not attempt to restrain, either by force or persuasion, the XXXXX and the imbecile from producing his large family of feeble-minded offspring. In my own experience, I recall vividly the case of a feeble-minded girl who every year, for a long period, received the expert attention of a great specialist in one of the best-known maternity hospitals of New York City. The great obstetrician, for the benefit of interns and medical students, performed each year a Caesarian operation upon this unfortunate creature to bring into the world her defective, and, in one case at least, her syphilitic, infant. ""Nelly"" was then sent to a special room and placed under the care of a day nurse and a night nurse, with extra and special nourishment provided. Each year she returned to the hospital. Such cases are not exceptions; any experienced doctor or nurse can recount similar stories. In the interest of medical science this practice may be justified. I am not criticising it from that point of view. I realize as well as the most conservative moralist that humanity requires that healthy members of the race should make certain sacrifices to preserve from death those unfortunates who are born with hereditary taints. But there is a point at which philanthropy may become positively dysgenic, when charity is converted into injustice to the self-supporting citizen, into positive injury to the future of the race. Such a point, it seems obvious, is reached when the incurably defective are permitted to procreate and thus increase their numbers. The problem of the dependent, delinquent and defective elements in modern society, we must repeat, cannot be minimized because of their alleged small numerical proportion to the rest of the population. The proportion seems small only because we accustom ourselves to the habit of looking upon feeble-mindedness as a separate and distinct calamity to the race, as a chance phenomenon unrelated to the sexual and biological customs not only condoned but even encouraged by our so-called civilization. The actual dangers can only be fully realized when we have acquired definite information concerning the financial and cultural cost of these classes to the community, when we become fully cognizant of the burden of the imbecile upon the whole human race; when we see the funds that should be available for human development, for scientific, artistic and philosophic research, being diverted annually, by hundreds of millions of dollars, to the care and segregation of men, women, and children who never should have been born. The advocate of Birth Control realizes as well as all intelligent thinkers the dangers of interfering with personal liberty. Our whole philosophy is, in fact, based upon the fundamental assumption that man is a self-conscious, self-governing creature, that he should not be treated as a domestic animal; that he must be left free, at least within certain wide limits, to follow his own wishes in the matter of mating and in the procreation of children. Nor do we believe that the community could or should send to the lethal chamber the defective progeny resulting from irresponsible and unintelligent breeding. But modern society, which has respected the personal liberty of the individual only in regard to the unrestricted and irresponsible bringing into the world of filth and poverty an overcrowding procession of infants foredoomed to death or hereditable disease, is now confronted with the problem of protecting itself and its future generations against the inevitable consequences of this long-practised policy of LAISSER-FAIRE. The emergency problem of segregation and sterilization must be faced immediately. Every feeble-minded girl or woman of the hereditary type, especially of the XXXXX class, should be segregated during the reproductive period. Otherwise, she is almost certain to bear imbecile children, who in turn are just as certain to breed other defectives. The male defectives are no less dangerous. Segregation carried out for one or two generations would give us only partial control of the problem. Moreover, when we realize that each feeble-minded person is a potential source of an endless progeny of defect, we prefer the policy of immediate sterilization, of making sure that parenthood is absolutely prohibited to the feeble-minded. This, I say, is an emergency measure. But how are we to prevent the repetition in the future of a new harvest of imbecility, the recurrence of new generations of XXXXXX and defectives, as the logical and inevitable consequence of the universal application of the traditional and widely approved command to increase and multiply? At the present moment, we are offered three distinct and more or less mutually exclusive policies by which civilization may hope to protect itself and the generations of the future from the allied dangers of imbecility, defect and delinquency. No one can understand the necessity for Birth control education without a complete comprehension of the dangers, the inadequacies, or the limitations of the present attempts at control, or the proposed programs for social reconstruction and racial regeneration. It is, therefore, necessary to interpret and criticize the three programs offered to meet our emergency . These may be briefly summarized as follows: (1) Philanthropy and Charity: This is the present and traditional method of meeting the problems of human defect and dependence, of poverty and delinquency. It is emotional, altruistic, at best ameliorative, aiming to meet the individual situation as it arises and presents itself. Its effect in practise is seldom, if ever, truly preventive. Concerned with symptoms, with the allaying of acute and catastrophic miseries, it cannot, if it would, strike at the radical causes of social misery. At its worst, it is sentimental and paternalistic. (2) Marxian Socialism: This may be considered typical of many widely varying schemes of more or less revolutionary social reconstruction, emphasizing the primary importance of environment, education, equal opportunity, and health, in the elimination of the conditions (i. e. capitalistic control of industry) which have resulted in biological chaos and human waste. I shall attempt to show that the Marxian doctrine is both too limited, too superficial and too fragmentary in its basic analysis of human nature and in its program of revolutionary reconstruction. (3) Eugenics: Eugenics seems to me to be valuable in its critical and diagnostic aspects , in emphasizing the danger of irresponsible and uncontrolled fertility of the ""unfit"" and the feeble-minded establishing a progressive unbalance in human society and lowering the birth-rate among the ""fit."" But in its so-called ""constructive"" aspect, in seeking to reestablish the dominance of healthy strain over the unhealthy, by urging an increased birth-rate among the fit, the Eugenists really offer nothing more farsighted than a ""cradle competition"" between the fit and the unfit. They suggest in very truth, that all intelligent and respectable parents should take as their example in this grave matter of child-bearing the most irresponsible elements in the community.

Also, you mentioned that you wwouldn't want to see abortion banned. Well I would not be oppossed to it if it happened. I would not mind if it was banned. I'm just not going to sit up here and keep pushing the issue. I don't care to make choices for others, but I'm not oppossed to seeing abortion banned. I thought it was the other way around. I thought you guys did not mind aborion. I never knew that some of you didn't like abortion since you pro-choice people, are always arguing us pro-life people down as far as abortion goes. Some of the statements that I've heard. Lead me to believe that pro-choice people felt as if rap/incest victims automaticly want abortions. I never said that. Because I did go to the links and look at the information. Yeah right. So the next time you quote me, I should just look at it and say,""She must not be talking to me. This has nothing to do with me."" I don't think so. It has everthing to do with me since you are talking to me. And you refused to stop talking to me. When I said you should stop, you said,""No."" So your comments concerning me, do have something to do with me. How long you've been on this site however, does not.","jitobear","251324","But ity seems you are not interested in forcing that opinion into others actions - that no matter how you feel about the subject - you aren't going to make choices for other people. Banning abortion is a bad idea. For one - it won't stop abortion. It will just give those who have fought to make it ilegal a chance to compliement themselves while pregnant women will continue to face real life issues with fewer safe choices. I think most people don't find abortion a pleasant thing. We fight those who are pro-life because most would seek to criminalize abortion and that is something we do not want. Our stance acknowledges that we don't know what women in these situations want. You don't either. Each woman's life is unique. The point is we aren't going to decide for them and we don't you (lifers) should either. I thought when I told you to check out the Colage site you said ""no thanks."" Of course I am responding to you. I tend to post in the gay rights, abortion, and religion threads (and once in awhile other threads). I respond to the posts I wish to.

So, why waste your breath? What I do is not tell them what to do, I just object to their choices, if I see otherwise. No. Its too much fun arguing with you.","jitobear","251418","I would agree with this. No - I said fewer safe choices. If faced with an unplanned pregnancy, and that pregnany will result in serious negative impacts in the woman's life, she will likely resort to extreme and dangerous actions to end it.

I could take the trouble to try to do a more full search myself to look into this but I would find it, personally, of negligible interest and priority. Why? Because it REALLY DOES NOT MATTER for today's policies and directions. Look, Thomas Jefferson made an extraordinary contribution to our Democracy BUT he owned slaves and had an illegitimate child with one. Does that mean that we discredit all the good that he did because of the bad? No. We appreciate the good while disparaging the bad. The bad that he did - i.e. in having a relationship with his black slave - should be disparaged but it did not have any long term effect so it is of much lesser import. The legacy of Thomas Jefferson which exists today is the one which had the longer lasting effect - i.e. his contributions to Democracy. Similarly, on a different level, Margaret Sanger was a supporter of Eugenics - which nearly everyone is against today, including myself and the great majority of pro-choice supporters. However, the Eugenics movement never gained strong power and has no legacies which continue to this day. Also, whether or not she did make disparaging comments about blacks, those comments have nothing to do with the efforts of Planned Parenthood today, so why do you find them of such importance. She may have had her negative sides that should be disparaged (just like the negative sides of anyone who has made positive contributions). However, I do strongly appreciate her contributions toward contraception for women.

Abortion is a lesser evil to me then increased crime (especially violent) and increased welfare.","VTCruiser","251675","Is a reason you support abortion because overall it decreases crime and welfare?","slavery-abortion","02:46 AM","abortion-debates","150"

You really expect us to beleive this line of garbage? Here's what I (and anyone else viewing the thread would think) think.

I address points made to me, you have a bad habit of ignoring a ever increasing amount of points made to you . Explain to me how I am avoiding a question by pointing to a book that explains exactly why I believe what you say I do. Would you say someone who was asked for evidence by citing a book to be avoiding the question. You make no sense. Considering I already answered that question [ShadowPikachu's post] you're just repeating yourself in light of being given the answer.","slavery-abortion","02:03 PM","abortion-debates","157"
