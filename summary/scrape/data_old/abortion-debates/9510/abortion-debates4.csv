Second of all, even if it is the 1 percent you claim, that one percent is exactly the reason we need to keep abortion legal.","slavery-abortion","09:01 PM","abortion-debates","47"

If you think that this is a source that gives the statistics you claim, you are rathr delusional: you ould be pulling these numbers out of your arse for all we know.

Second of all, statistics has nothing to do with it, we needed to see a source that supports your numbers as you could easily be pulling them out of your arse. The burden of proof was on you to provide supporting evidence so don't give us your garbage, acting all self-righteous. I'll look into the article and post later, as I'm sure everyone else will. I already see a lot of bull in the part you posted with the ""social reasons"", which say it is because the foetus is inconvenient or unwanted, as there are innumereable reasons for abortion.","slavery-abortion","02:28 PM","abortion-debates","52"

In a debate, something like statistics isn't a fact unless it is substantiated by evidence (studies, etc.), which you were not supplying. Since this is a debate, a claim like that required some sort of support.","slavery-abortion","04:01 PM","abortion-debates","54"

Hey, some of us have never even had an abortion!","ShadowPikachu","250661","I think this sums it up perfectly.

"02-11-2007","9510",4,"jitobear","250659","And that 93% is exactly where every lifer loses all credibility with me. Until you stop trivializing real and important life circumstances of women and laying claim to what is or is not a mere convenience in the life of a stranger you will never do a damned thing to help this problem.","VTCruiser","250662","Going back to the topic of this thread.. this has finally gotten to my ultimate point..... Slave traders didnt want to end slavery because they would be making it a hard circumstance on people who built their lives around slavery...

"02-11-2007","9510",4,"Coyote","250529","I don't know anything about griswold or Casey. But calling the right to privacy the right to abortion is silly. Are you saying you'd rather not have a right to privacy? Please tell me what you look at on the internet at 2:00 am when no one's around. Please tell me the worst thing you ever did, and to whom. Please give me the intimate details (with first and last names) of your most recent sexual encounter. Privacy doesn't seem important to you, so I guess you won't mind telling me.","Steeeeve","250704","I misspoke here slightly...I meant the right to privacy is griswold case.....the right to abortion is pretty much an extension on ""privacy"" and was done in roe. Secondly, I like privacy as much as the next person...that doesn't mean it is in the constitution though...at least as a blanket right.","slavery-abortion","11:03 PM","abortion-debates","58"

A pregnancy can be a threat to a woman's health. A pregnancy can be a threat to a woman's job, her career, her prosperity, her ability to care for her other children, a threat to carry out her responsibilities to others she may have in her family. A pregnancy is not the little simplicity you trick it out to be. How old are you, VT? You sound as if you don't know very much about life. Are you saying that when a woman stays home and takes care of children and a household that she's sitting around doing nothing? Do you know anything at all about the responsibilities and cares of parenting? How old are you, VT? You sound as if you don't know very much about life. I think Jitobear should be upset. In too many cases women are left totally alone to take on the heavy burden of a pregnancy, a delivery, the care of a child without anyone helping her along the way. And, if it is an illegitimate pregnancy, she is cursed and shunned by Christians and her life is made even more burdensome. Again, VT, how old are you? Do you know anything at all about life?","slavery-abortion","08:06 AM","abortion-debates","59"
