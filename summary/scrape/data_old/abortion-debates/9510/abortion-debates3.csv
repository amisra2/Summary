"02-08-2007","9510",3,"thelmoose","250354","Yes, that makes a lot of sense. That is a topic (who/how decisions of abortion policy) that one can more reasonably argue than whether abortion is moral or not, though it takes more legal and constitutional law knowledge than (at least) I have. I do support a more pragmatic approach to this topic, along the lines of what do we actually need to do about this complex problem. Deciding what is a human or baby or what it feels or thinks is essentially an unanswerable issue. Interesting philosophical arguments to be sure, unless one wants to be dogmatic and insist their own is the only way to see things. The other issue of what constitutes a ""human right"" legal or constitutionally (or even if such a thing exists in those domains) is also an interesting topic, that I had not considered until now. Thanks for the clarification.","Steeeeve","250372","I think the constutionality of the issue is very important as well and perhaps we should make a topic on that. We have before but it always seems like the ""abortion in the constitution"" side dies...this is not to imply they gave up but normally the person arguing doesn't have a good grasp on constituitonal law and history. Sigma argues this sometimes but she doesn't have the time to post often...thus the argument dies right in the middle . TheMoose, would you like Phyllis to start topic on this and perhaps you could learn more about the constitution? I might even learn a thing of two","slavery-abortion","05:03 PM","abortion-debates","31"

I am not sure how to do that - have an intelligent take on Constitutional law - from google or the like anyway. I would need to take a course, or start a new career.","slavery-abortion","05:15 PM","abortion-debates","33"
"02-08-2007","9510",3,"Coyote","250373","Uh, I'm confused. I keep hearing ""the right to abortion"" being thrown around. There is no ""right to abortion"". There is, however, a ""right to privacy"" and that's what Roe v. Wade was about. Though the right to privacy does have its limits.","Steeeeve","250393","The right to privacy (aka the right to abortion) was established in the griswold case...not roe. Futhermore, the section of roe you cited later was pretty much taken away by Casey....not only that, what the hell are the limits? No one seems to know.","slavery-abortion","11:53 PM","abortion-debates","34"

"02-09-2007","9510",3,"Shooterandproud","249786","Because they don't know any better. Besides, how many unwanted pregnancies have you had? How many abortions? Notice that most anti-choicers are men, which exposes the true hypocrisy in this dogma of thinking.","VTCruiser","250470","None as a matter of fact.. Just so you know, i dont know where you get your facts from... but you have almost swayed me with your grand knowledge of this subject.. You should take this argument to cnn and tell them that they are in no need of polls anymore because you know all the answers and facts already.","slavery-abortion","04:01 PM","abortion-debates","36"
"02-09-2007","9510",3,"Another opinion","250205","Indeed, forcing a woman to carry a pregnancy against her will could be viewed as a temporary partial form of slavery (temporary = 9 months, partial = freedom of use of her body partly taken away, other freedoms mainly still existing). As you say, that is also a little weak. Comparing abortion to slavery is just a poor comparison to make overall.","VTCruiser","250471","Not really because ultimately, it was their choice to have sex.","slavery-abortion","04:05 PM","abortion-debates","37"

What is there consequence? Balls in a vice for nine months? Shall we legislate it? Remember - I am not talking about parenting here.","slavery-abortion","07:19 AM","abortion-debates","39"

Are you saying you'd rather not have a right to privacy? Please tell me what you look at on the internet at 2:00 am when no one's around. Please tell me the worst thing you ever did, and to whom. Please give me the intimate details (with first and last names) of your most recent sexual encounter. Privacy doesn't seem important to you, so I guess you won't mind telling me.","slavery-abortion","11:10 AM","abortion-debates","40"

The government can't regulate how big your pubes are, therefore they cannot strictly regulate abortion. Its really just common sense.","slavery-abortion","03:16 PM","abortion-debates","41"

Is that what getting married does for ya? Anyway, your answers to the questions posed to you seem to have a tense problem: ...then she/he/they should not have had sex in the first place ... should have used better birth control ... should first of all be married ... should have been in the ideal socio-economic position to have children as well as the ideal psychological position to desire and be able to care for children. These shoulds are all well and good and they have merit. In and of themselves they sometimes can be very good ideas; maybe not for everyone, but they certainly would decrease unwanted pregancies and/or the motivations for abortion. The problem is they are all after the fact. It makes no sense and is staggeringly unhelpful to spout these rather obvious platitudes when it is too later to enact them. What good is it to tell someone what they should have done after they have already done it?","slavery-abortion","04:58 PM","abortion-debates","45"
