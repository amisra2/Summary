To explore this, would your views on a particular abortion change if you knew for certain that a particular fetus has no soul? The reason I bring this up is that, for those of us with largely secular views, the idea of the soul is closely analogous to our idea of mental existence, sentience, etc. I suspect, therefore, that much of our thinking may end up being similar but that you view this mental essence as starting at conception and we take the scientific view of it happenning much later in a pregnancy. I know that, apart from that arguement, you value potential more than we do. However, I suspect that concepts of the soul do play a role in the views of most on the pro-life side. Would you be willing to discuss such ideas?","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","11:00 AM","abortion-debates","1"

This is transcendent of whether they are conscious or unconscious and it is why we treat 24 week premies who have no real conscious existence and a 30 year old automobile accident victim in a coma on a respirator and you and me the same. So strongly do humans recognize this inherent dignity that even in death a person is dignified with a funeral ceremony recognizing their life had inherent meaning and value. We build memorials to those who were victimized in life.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","11:24 AM","abortion-debates","2"

Can you see from a statement like that why it's so hard to respect the opinions of people with such shallow and vacuous opinions? They also believe somehow that until a child breathes its first breathe, it can't be called or considered a PERSON. They also believe that until a baby breathes its first breathe, it isn't alive. These beliefs are not only vacuous and illogical but are completely ignorant and without any merit from a rational or common sense perspective. It is totally reasonable to believe and understand that not only is a fertilized egg ALIVE, but that it contains the SOUL of the individual it will become, from its very conception when it starts to grow into the unique individual it will one day grow into. If this weren't true then children would be virtual clones of their parents rather than unique and independent individuals. They would reflect exactly half of each of their parents and they would show no new traits apart from what their parents have between them. But in reality, 2 very simple people can give birth to a genius and 2 Physicists can birth a simpleton. Just as 2 criminals can birth a future cop, and 2 laborers can birth a future Professor. So, yes; I believe that the soul enters the new life at fertilization when the egg starts to grow into a unique human being. And that is why I belief it is a life with value as a human being even though it hasn't fully developed enough yet to live outside the womb on its own. The argument that it doesn't qualify for personhood because of that fact is totally bogus and irrelevant to me because it doesn't speak to the person that the child is in reality. I mean, if a 4 month old fetus is dismissed as a non living being based on its state of current development and what it can do by itself; then what more can a newborn baby do that the 4 month old fetus can do apart from breathe on its own? Beside that one ability, the newborn is no more independent than the fetus. Yet none here, hopefully, will deny the newborn the right to life as they would so easily, the 4 month old fetus. That's why considering the potential of the unborn fetus is valid, because if we will reject that as a consideration, then why would we invest so much into the future potential of our born children? How shallow is it to limit our ability to love our children only after birth while considering them nothing more than lumps of tissue while they are developing and growing into the people they will be?","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","11:55 AM","abortion-debates","3"

"04-11-2008","11136",1,"smiley","308299","Why are these opinion shallow and vaccuous? True, ""babies"" are certainly alive before birth - I would find it hard to argue against that - but surely just because someone has an opinion that differs from your own does not open them to such personal criticism. Do you have any evidence as to when the soul enters the body, if indeed it exists at all? Smiley","Archangel","308301","Who did I openly criticize as personally shallow and vacuous smiley? Didn't I say: that's why it's so hard to respect the opinions of people with such shallow and vacuous opinions Their opinions are shallow and vacuous because they are unable to understand that if life begins at conception, then so does the soul enter the child at that time. It is ridiculous to think that the integral make up of a human being comes peace meal. If there was no life at conception then there would be no soul, nor would their be a growing person at all.

And just to push your opinion a little further, if the soul enters the new being at fertilization, then does this mean that those girls (though very rare) who are born just from an unfertilized egg have no souls. Is a special case made for these human beings? One might ask the same question of the even more rare boy born of a virgin mother. I'm not saying that you are wrong. I was just wondering if your theory extends this far. Smiley","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","04:14 PM","abortion-debates","7"

"04-11-2008","11136",1,"None","None","None","JakeCJB","308348","We all agree I think that humans have dignity. The question is, at what point does something that is alive become a human person? Those who say this starts at conception argue that potential and DNA are enough. I think it's an inadequate and impoverished idea. Being human is on a much grander scale, if we are attaching a meaning to human. It also involves making decisions about what happens with one's own body.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","11:03 PM","abortion-debates","10"

First of all we don't know if a soul even exist, and secondly, even if we had proof that it did, we have no way of knowing when it becomes reality for that person. Maybe it's like sin, you know, a man-made concept You want to consider a ZEF a 'person' - fine, let's apply this so-called 'logic' across the board.

Just as sin isn't a man made concept but a reality that is proven whenever you feel guilty for doing wrong. I mean only sociopaths feel no guilt when sinning, are you saying that you're a sociopath? What's a ZEF? Is that another secular humanist term that's intended to marginalize the unborn babies that pro-abortionists endorse killing to the tune of 1.4 million a year?","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","06:08 PM","abortion-debates","15"
