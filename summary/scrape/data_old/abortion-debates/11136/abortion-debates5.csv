"04-13-2008","11136",5,"Archangel","308478","FETUSES GET ABORTED, BUT THAT PROCESS TAKES PLACE LONG AFTER THE ZYGOTE AND EMBRIO STAGE I'm not educated? I'm being immature? prove it's there and it's me who's too ignorant to find it. USE SUCH AN ABBREVIATED WORD IN A SENTENCE THAT MAKES SENSE IF YOU CAN. I WANT TO SEE IT.","Colonel Ingus","308504","Ummmm.... someone want to explain to this person that a ZEF is all three stages of a fetuses development? This person is like the posterboy for uneducated anti-choice replies Quit frankly, IMO every anti-choicer here should be begging archangel to stop posting and embarrassing their cause any further than its already been... how can anyone have a serious debate with him when archangel doesn't even know what BASIC fetal development is? <trust me, you don't need to advertise this anymore. Maybe find another topic to debate, as this one doesn't seem to be your forte> Completed. Nope. I'm tired educating you. Ask your mommy to do that, or open a book, or start reading medical journals... The people here aren't your personal slaves. You want to learn something, do it yourself like everyone else has to","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","12:11 PM","abortion-debates","62"

But you will notice, Colonel, that Archie is doing a great job of avoiding the fact that he's insisting that there's a soul but making no argumentation to that effect.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","12:20 PM","abortion-debates","63"

Go here: http://dictionary.reference.com/medical/ Type in ZEF ( all caps ), and look at the very top of the dictionary list Yes he is, isn't he. That's not debating, that just him being argumentative and avoiding the facts.

It's the free dictionary, and here's the URL. http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ Where does it say MEDICAL in it? Can't you be honest at even the most basic level? Now I challenge you to click on it and type ZEF in any section other than acronym and come up with a definition of it. So once again, it isn't my foot in my mouth, but yours that's in yours as you again mislead in order to cover your claim that ZEF is a medical term when it's an abbreviation of 3 words that can't be found in the medical section of a dictionary at all. And you completely ignored my challenge to simply use it properly in a sentence. Of course you know that you can't so you'll say anything you want to but can't back it up with evidence at all. Oh, why do I even bother with someone like you. The truth is beyond you. You're not worth the time it takes to respond to you, so talk to yourself because I'm through playing with you. Now come on back and divert attention from your own ignorance and dishonesty by again distorting what I have said as if your tactics aren't evident for all to see.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","12:36 PM","abortion-debates","66"
"04-13-2008","11136",5,"ingus","None","You mean except for the OBVIOUS FACT that no one has never seen one? DOH!","Archangel","308510","Hey genius, if no one has never seen a soul, that means that everyone has seen one. Which is exactly what I have been trying to get through to you. If you've seen another living human being, then you've seen the soul within them. Sadly though, you're just not smart enough to know it.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","12:41 PM","abortion-debates","67"

Look, paste a damn link to the definition of ZEF that has the word ""medical"" in the URL or retract your claim.

When a person goes out of their way to refuse to learn something, that's when I lose all respect for them. Congratulations Well right about now I guess it should be plural - feet First you CLAIMED that it was something that we made up - we PROVED that you were wrong and are full of it, and so then you claimed that it's no where to be found on the net, and we PROVED to you were wrong and full of that too. Every single time that you CLAIM anything you are completely shot down, and not just by me but by everyone else here too, yet you still persist in further embarrassing yourself publicly . You're either the most uneducated anti-choicer here, or a genius Pro-choicer posing as a half-witted anti-choicer to make anti-choicers look bad. Which is it? Your only aim seems to be to make threads go off topic. Yes. See our proceeding post explaining why. Thank you.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","01:12 PM","abortion-debates","70"

Well, his physical age is much greater...","Colonel Ingus","308518","No I mean right UNDER that where it says "" Did you mean ZEF (in dictionary) Are you claiming that they didn't post a link for you there, or that their search engine works like ####, because regardless of what it initially says, I kind of see them posting an actual LINK Here's another way to look at it, if it wasn't a legitimate term then why would they be teaching it at Baylor University? Any other questions then I suggest you ask an Obstetrician, as you're verging on starting to act like Archie Hopefully we can get back on topic now.

"04-13-2008","11136",5,"electrolyte","308530","You missed my point, didn't you? It says that it can't find ""ZEF"" in the medical dictionary. It suggests trying the acronym finder, which is where you find it. Perhaps because Baylor is an extremely religious university and wants to familiarize their students with this acronym so they can pretend they know what they're talking about? You made the claim that ""medical"" was in the URL, and it's not.","Colonel Ingus","308536","No I didn't miss it, in fact I deliberately addressed it when I said "" ...or that their search engine works like #### "" The search engine obviously found the term, but because it's not working correctly it thought that no results were found, even though one was. You've been listening to good 'ol archie for too long. I never said that it was a word , he did. What I suggested that he do to find it was to ""try a medical dictionary or a dictionary with acronyms ."" I can overlook someone like archie for putting words in my mouth because... well because he's 'archie', but I respect you as an educated person so hopefully you won't try that same tactic. Perhaps. All I know is that it is a basic term used all of the time when talking about the complete stage of pregnancy. Guess it's just easier to type out It is . That's how I first found it. I even posted the first link for you. Just because their search engine is designed to send you somewhere else doesn't mean squat. When you go to http://dictionary.reference.com/medical/ it says MEDICAL DICTIONARY in bold letters. It ALSO says ""Search for medical terms..."" right under that. Even Stevie Wonder could see that! Now type in ANY MEDICAL term in the space provided and click 'enter'. It will send you to another page but regardless it's STILL a medical dictionary. When you type in the word 'pregnancy' it does NOT say 'medical' any longer in the URL either, so what are you suggesting, that a pregnancy isn't a medical condition either Listen I work with designing search engines all the time, and where they end up is not as significant as where they start. I'm sure it's to be found in other places too but I've wasted far too much time already on this pettiness showing that it does exist. If any of my colleagues know of any other medical sites that list it, I'll be more than happy to post them here, but any reasonable person that isn't trying to be anal should already be able to see that it's a real term that real people use everyday.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","02:56 PM","abortion-debates","74"

It's only in the acronym finder. It absolutely does. You posted a link to Baylor's website, yet I saw the link on the 4forums website. Does that mean that Baylor's website has 4forums in the URL? Hell no. And that page says that ZEF isn't in the medical dictionary. I've made this pretty damn clear. I'm ""suggesting"" that you don't claim that the word ""medical"" is in the URL when the word ""medical"" is not in the URL. I'm ""suggesting"" that you don't pretend that an acronym finder qualifies as a medical dictionary, especially when ""Zero Emission Fuel"" is right under it. Is WYSIWYG a medical term, too? If this is your point, then you should have emphasized that it's a real, used term, not that it's in a medical dictionary and can be found on a page with the word ""medical"" in the URL. I really don't understand what the problem here is besides your inability to admit that you've overstated your position to an incredible extent.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","04:36 PM","abortion-debates","75"
