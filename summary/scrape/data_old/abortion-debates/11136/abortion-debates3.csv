"04-12-2008","11136",3,"electrolyte","308444","You were saying that he wouldn't have called it a claim if it were a known fact. something that is a known truth can be stated as a ""claim.""","Colonel Ingus","308451","No, that's NOT what I said at all. Go back and read what I actually wrote, and not just what you want to read. If you still need help, just ask I've already said this so that's redundant.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","08:31 PM","abortion-debates","32"

"04-12-2008","11136",3,"None","None","None","Colonel Ingus","308457","Well aside from getting the thread off on a tangent... You need to read the statement from the person who was saying it's point of view. A person would not say ""my claim is that the sun is hot"" if they really knew it was hot, they would just say ""the sun is hot"". A person psychologically only adds the 'claim' reference when they are unsure of something. It has nothing to do with "" it "" being a fact or not, it has to do with how they represent it. The fact that this needs to be explained to you doesn't say much for our educational system Still waiting for that evidence of souls existing. If none is provided then I'll just assume you're admitting that they don't exist...","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","09:44 PM","abortion-debates","36"
"04-12-2008","11136",3,"Colonel Ingus","308446","That doesn't say much for google now does it Try a medical dictionary or a dictionary with acronyms. It's a well known medical term so I'm sure you'll find it.","Archangel","308458","You're a sanctimonious fraud ingus. There's no definition for the word ZEF in the online medical dictionary. No match for ZEF Sorry, the term ZEF is not in the dictionary. Check the spelling and try removing suffixes like ""-ing"" and ""-s"". Here, check for yourself. http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/omd/ Now stop playing games and just admit that you made the word up or tell us what you claim it means. Are you referring to the word zygote? And I ask only because it starts with a z also. Either way, stop calling me ignorant if you can't explain what a word you used means.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","09:49 PM","abortion-debates","37"
"04-12-2008","11136",3,"Phyllis","308448","Or perhaps they were just a really, really gigantic clump of cells.","Archangel","308459","Hey Phyllis, we're dealing with an immature and uninformed juvenile here who is one of those who will make unsupportable statements and then just dance around the issue when pressed for evidence to support his lies. I mean, have you ever heard of the word ZEF? This newbie is telling me I'm ignorant for not knowing what it means when even the medical dictionary hasn't heard of it. So I think ignore is the place where this troll belongs until he gets tired of talking to himself and skulks away.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","09:55 PM","abortion-debates","38"

It is common to refer to statements as claims regardless of their truth value. This is especially true in philosophical/logical arguments. I'm a new part of that education system, bub. The fact is that you said you didn't say what you actually did say, and now you're trying to cover that up by giving an alternate explanation that ignores the fact that this is a debate forum where ""claims"" are labeled for what they are: claims. It's a shame our education system has to compete with numbskulls who hold their misplaced opinions in higher regard than people trained in those areas. News flash, Holmes: I never said that souls existed. I never even implied such. I took a quick rip at Archie's pathetic arguments early in the thread and have since been arguing with you about why calling something a claim would mean that it isn't believed. If you want to argue that souls don't exist, or that nobody has shown that souls do exist, then your arguments had better be better than vacuous attempts to nail someone for faulty phraseology.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","10:17 PM","abortion-debates","39"

There is only one online medical dictionary? So just because you aren't educated in these matters that suddenly means that the other person is playing games or made something up? Stop acting so immature, and stop making accusations. No one made anything up. Ask a midwife or a Obstetrician if you don't believe me Archangel if you don't know these BASIC medical terms then how can you claim that you know anything about abortion? If I just give you the link then what would you have learned? I've read at least 3 posts from you where you have displayed an immature outburst. Debating the topic of abortion is one of the most heated issues that you will find. If you can't swim in the deep end of the pool then you should be in the shallow end. Quit embarrassing yourself while your ahead If I, or someone else has to post a link, that's going to take away all of your credibility. You wouldn't want that now would you?","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","10:36 PM","abortion-debates","40"

It's a matter of public record Quit trying to manipulate the facts. It just wastes everyones time and leads the topic even more off course than it already is Sorry electrolyte, that one was my fault I wasn't trying to suggest that you made that comment, just that I was still waiting for said proof. My appologies. I should have re-quoted the person that did say it but now I think they ran away. Oh well... guess they can't prove it","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","10:44 PM","abortion-debates","41"

Any reader with the inability to read your mind (which is everybody on the planet besides you) can read your words but apparently not know what you mean, since you say what you don't mean. I posted our statements right next to each other for everybody to read. This is the point. They can't prove it. They can't even present halfway decent arguments. So let's make that the issue instead of pulling claims of psychology-induced Freudian slips. And no, he's still here. He just loves ""allowing"" the thread to be derailed. Trust me, he does it himself, especially when he's getting his XXX kicked. Keep pointing out that he hasn't shown (and can't show) that souls exist, and he'll stop posting in the thread.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","11:04 PM","abortion-debates","43"
"04-12-2008","11136",3,"Phyllis","308469","It seems to me that the initial question was fine. But you added that second question which was rhetorical (rather than interrogatory) and unnecessary, and came across as inflammatory.","electrolyte","308471","Phyllis, this is exactly what he meant to do. There's no sense in chiding him. He wanted it to be inflammatory, because he's a troll. He has his answers before he even has a chance to think about the questions. The best he can do is convince himself by poisoning the well. What's really sad is that I'd never heard of ""ZEF"" before, but I figured it out merely from context, which anybody familiar with actual embryology terms should be able to do. For all the ranting that Archie does about abortion, he's not very educated about the subject.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","11:12 PM","abortion-debates","44"
"04-12-2008","11136",3,"Phyllis","308469","It is short-hand for zygote/embryo/fetus. the fact that he didn't might indicate that he is not really interested in discussing the issue with you.","Colonel Ingus","308473","THANK YOU Phyllis They claimed that they could not find it anywhere on the net, but it can easy be found here and other places Not exactly. The whole point was that if they want to learn basic terms then they need to do some legwork or it's not going to stick. If I would have answered his question right away I assure you that he would have found some way to discount or dismiss it. It's an important term and one that they need to learn, that's all I was trying to do. I'd be more than willing to discuss the process and how it applies to the topic, and I agree with you 110% about keeping the thread on topic","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","11:22 PM","abortion-debates","45"
