Does that mean that Baylor's website has 4forums in the URL? Hell no. I'm ""suggesting"" that you don't claim that the word ""medical"" is in the URL when the word ""medical"" is not in the URL. If this is your point, then you should have emphasized that it's a real, used term not that it's in a medical dictionary I really don't understand what the problem here is besides your inability to admit that you've overstated your position to an incredible extent.","Colonel Ingus","308555","Well gee, maybe that's because it's a medical acronym What a shame that an adult had to spell that out for you. Enjoy cleaning the pan you're frying your red herring in. The only thing I'm suggesting at this point is that you see an optometrist or a proctologist since you're being so anal about this I did. Just because I didn't put it in oversized bold capital letters is a moot point. I never said it was, I said that they should look there as a suggestion . Big difference, one apparently that's over your head. Stop being disingenuous and misrepresenting what I said. You can twist things around and create strawman arguments all you want, but it doesn't change the facts. Deal with it and quite wasting our time","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","05:27 PM","abortion-debates","76"
"04-13-2008","11136",6,"bhbcu64","308500","NO, clown, you MADE the assertion; you SUPPORT the assertion. The burden of proof is on you, and the STANDARD of proof is ""beyond a reasonable doubt"".","Colonel Ingus","308556","I agree 110% . This is the second time that he's done this and expected everyone else to prove he was wrong That's not how it works in the real world. When he proves that the photos weren't photoshoped then I'll believe him. When he proves that the soul actually exists, then I'll believe him. Until then I won't.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","05:33 PM","abortion-debates","77"

A colleague of mine has a gigantic medical dictionary. I'll try to remember to check it when I get to work tomorrow. So when you make the argument it's okay, but when I parody it, it's a red herring? I'm still waiting for you to post the link to the page that tells what a ZEF is that has ""medical"" in the URL. Why can't you do it? Why won't you just admit that you can't? You made a special point to tell us that it was on a page with ""medical"" in the URL. It's not in a page with ""medical"" in the URL any more than Baylor's study guide is on a page with ""4forums"" in the URL. How did I misrepresent what you said? You asked if he could explain why it says ""MEDICAL"" in the URL. It doesn't. You've repeatedly insisted that it does. If it does, then you should be able to post the dictionary URL that contains the word ""medical"" and links to a page that explains what ZEF is. I'm twisting nothing. Your link to the meaning of ZEF is not to a page within a medical dictionary, nor does it have ""medical"" in the URL. Your only argument for justifying the ""'medical' in the URL"" claim is the same one that can justify saying that ""'4forums' is in the Baylor website's URL,"" which is absurd. It's like saying that a Google news search that brings up an all-text news story can be found on Google image search (and is on a page with ""images"" in the URL) because -- if you click enough links -- you can get from point A to point B. If you can't see the absurdity of this, we're done.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","06:00 PM","abortion-debates","78"

I plan on checking out our medical library section as well. Until then see this . Hope you can recognize the word 'medical' listed at the top of the page Not at all. It was (is) a red herring and so that's what I called it. Can't be simpler than that. Strawman argument. By twisting it around, but then you already know that Redundant, and already addressed. Another red herring ( you must like fish ). The term ZEF has been explained many times now, and by several people. I don't care if a medical website sends you to the Walt Disney site, all that is important is that it ORIGINATES from a medical site and it explains what it stands for! You obviously don't care about the terms authenticity or meaning because if you did you wouldn't be acting so petty now. Sorry, but I'm not continuing on with your little one man game.

You call it a fallacy. You're wrong. The argument form is invalid.
