It is common to refer to statements as claims regardless of their truth value. This is especially true in philosophical/logical arguments. I'm a new part of that education system, bub. The fact is that you said you didn't say what you actually did say, and now you're trying to cover that up by giving an alternate explanation that ignores the fact that this is a debate forum where ""claims"" are labeled for what they are: claims. It's a shame our education system has to compete with numbskulls who hold their misplaced opinions in higher regard than people trained in those areas. News flash, Holmes: I never said that souls existed. I never even implied such. I took a quick rip at Archie's pathetic arguments early in the thread and have since been arguing with you about why calling something a claim would mean that it isn't believed. If you want to argue that souls don't exist, or that nobody has shown that souls do exist, then your arguments had better be better than vacuous attempts to nail someone for faulty phraseology.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","abortion-debates","39","10:17 PM"

You've been listening to good 'ol archie for too long. I never said that it was a word , he did. What I suggested that he do to find it was to ""try a medical dictionary or a dictionary with acronyms ."" I can overlook someone like archie for putting words in my mouth because... well because he's 'archie', but I respect you as an educated person so hopefully you won't try that same tactic. Perhaps. All I know is that it is a basic term used all of the time when talking about the complete stage of pregnancy. Guess it's just easier to type out It is . That's how I first found it. I even posted the first link for you. Just because their search engine is designed to send you somewhere else doesn't mean squat.

When you type in the word 'pregnancy' it does NOT say 'medical' any longer in the URL either, so what are you suggesting, that a pregnancy isn't a medical condition either Listen I work with designing search engines all the time, and where they end up is not as significant as where they start. I'm sure it's to be found in other places too but I've wasted far too much time already on this pettiness showing that it does exist. If any of my colleagues know of any other medical sites that list it, I'll be more than happy to post them here, but any reasonable person that isn't trying to be anal should already be able to see that it's a real term that real people use everyday.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","abortion-debates","74","02:56 PM"
