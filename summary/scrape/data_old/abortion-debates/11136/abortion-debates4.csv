"04-12-2008","11136",4,"electrolyte","308470","I posted our statements right next to each other for everybody to read. He just loves ""allowing"" the thread to be derailed. Trust me, he does it himself, especially when he's getting his XXX kicked. Keep pointing out that he hasn't shown (and can't show) that souls exist, and he'll stop posting in the thread.","Colonel Ingus","308475","Yes you did. Funny how your interpretation was different To be honest I'm not even sure what this thread is about anymore, this is the abortion section isn't it? My oh my how on Earth do you ever debate someone like that? Seems it would just waste a lot of precious time. In any event THANK YOU for the heads up. Looking forward to a great debate","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","11:29 PM","abortion-debates","46"
"04-12-2008","11136",4,"electrolyte","308471","What's really sad is that I'd never heard of ""ZEF"" before, but I figured it out merely from context, which anybody familiar with actual embryology terms should be able to do. For all the ranting that Archie does about abortion, he's not very educated about the subject.","Colonel Ingus","308476","I don't know you electrolyte but I already respect you for figuring that out on your own Probably just very young. Not sure why they'd want to debate this topic though, it gets pretty heated from time to time","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","11:36 PM","abortion-debates","47"
"04-13-2008","11136",4,"Colonel Ingus","308464","Well that's not very christian of you now is it? There is only one online medical dictionary? So just because you aren't educated in these matters that suddenly means that the other person is playing games or made something up? Stop acting so immature, and stop making accusations. No one made anything up. Ask a midwife or a Obstetrician if you don't believe me Archangel if you don't know these BASIC medical terms then how can you claim that you know anything about abortion? If I just give you the link then what would you have learned?","Archangel","308478","Sure it is! I'm not lying when I called you a sanctimonious fraud because that's precisely what you are. You're evasive, dismissive and abusive in your style of communicating with people before even getting to know them. Get a clue buddy, this is why you're a fraud. I could look ZEF up in every medical dictionary on Earth and it will never give the definition for a slang of 3 different words put together as an abbreviation. So what you did was lie and make up a medical term that doesn't exist in any dictionary; then you proceeded to call me stupid for not knowing. Only an ignorant dishonest XXXXX would use such tactics unless they're here for the sole purpose of trolling and starting trouble. Is that what your game is? I'm not educated? I'm being immature? I challenge you to produce a link to the word ZEF in any medical dictionary. That's where you told me to find it, so prove it's there and it's me who's too ignorant to find it. For once stop turning your ignorance around on others and just support your lies. PROVE TO ME THAT ZEF IS A BASIC MEDICAL TERM. I CHALLENGE YOU TO SUPPORT THAT ClAIM. SO GIVE ME A LINK WHERE IT IS USED AS A GENERAL TERM IN THE INDUSTRY. AND TELL ME THIS GENIUS, WHY WOULD THEY USE THE TERM ZYGOTE EMBRIO AND FETUS AS ONE WORD IN THE SAME SENTENCE? FETUSES GET ABORTED, BUT THAT PROCESS TAKES PLACE LONG AFTER THE ZYGOTE AND EMBRIO STAGE; SO USE SUCH AN ABBREVIATED WORD IN A SENTENCE THAT MAKES SENSE IF YOU CAN. I WANT TO SEE IT. AND HOW ABOUT YOU STOP EDITING OUT THE MEAT OF MY REPLIES AND RESPOND TO MY WHOLE POST FOR ONCE. YOU JUST SHOW HOW WEAK YOU ARE BY RIPPING POSTS APART AND JUST RESPONDING TO SECONDARY POINTS.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","12:30 AM","abortion-debates","49"
"04-13-2008","11136",4,"electrolyte","308477","This is what happens on internet debate forums when you aren't very clear. Sadly enough, some people here can take a statement that is only the tiniest bit unclear, spin it, and then continue to misrepresent it even after explicit clarification. (Free preemptive tip: don't try to be sarcastic online unless you somehow make it incredibly obvious that it's sarcasm.) With Archie, it's not ""debate"" at all. I beat him over the head with the Truth Stick of No Mercy and expect no rational response. Another free tip: don't look forward to many of those with Archie. Other people here do show promise, though. He's not; he's just purely irrational. His irrationality stems from the fundy mindset he's locked himself into. Beware the vile he'll spew at you when you kick his XXX.","Archangel","308479","SPEAKING OF A WASTE OF TIME. IF YOU WEREN'T SO PATHETIC I MIGHT BOTHER DEALING WITH YOU AND YOUR DELUSIONAL TRUTH STICK OF NO MERCY LYTEBOY.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","12:38 AM","abortion-debates","50"

"04-13-2008","11136",4,"Phyllis","308469","It would be interesting to have a discussion about the thread's topic, which is eloquently and succinctly stated in its title: ""How important is the soul to pro-life views?"" I maintain that it is not important to the pro-life argument.","JakeCJB","308482","Then the argument is what? The potential of the fertilized egg, the potential in and of itself, is what takes it from being merely alive, to being human? Is it DNA, or which future possibility makes something human? Pro-life puts the line at conception. But there is no guarantee a conception will be born as a baby, unless it survives other further processes, unites with other things that belong to the woman, like the uterine wall.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","01:34 AM","abortion-debates","53"

It's not in a medical dictionary at all, but is found under acronyms in the free dictionary. So besides lying about it being a medical term, it isn't even a word. And I've proved to everyone I'm the XXXXX? Nice try.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","07:47 AM","abortion-debates","55"

And as for namecalling? I didn't call you names, I properly defined you as pathetic and delusional. I mean, you actually believe that you walk around here with some imaginary truth stick of no mercy when in fact you mislead and misinterpret what others say because you can't even debate them by honestly responding to what they actually say. Now that's both delusional and pathetic, but that's you lyte. As for my assertion that we all have souls; I stand by that claim and insist that I'm right. Of course, leave it to you to boldly demand evidence of an invisible trait when you know it can't be proven at all scientifically. Isn't that a great example of your cowardly use of the imaginary truth stick of no mercy? Of course you're welcome to prove that the soul doesn't exist and really beat me over the head with your big old truth stick of no mercy. Cmon lyte, don't be a beat me with that stick and humble me with your truth.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","08:08 AM","abortion-debates","56"
