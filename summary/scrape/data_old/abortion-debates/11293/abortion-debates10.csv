What about just compensation when land is taken via eminent domain?","Steeeeve","320341","Dear Hypocrite, Not only would I put those up for a vote, but they already have been up for a vote and passed. How on earth do you think constitutional amendments are adopted? Furthermore, abortion is not a constitutional right. And before you start, I realize the state legislatures are not electorate but the state legislatures are all representatives of the people and therefore can vote on constitutional amendments whether to repeal or adopt new. Obviously no other person nor body (short of state conventions) can ratify, ie pass, an amendment.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:10 PM","abortion-debates","137"
"08-14-2008","11293",10,"Galactababe","320283","Shooterandproud: I'm having difficulty with your insistence on defending stupidity and irresponsibility in addition to calling Christian teaching of abstinence . How can I put this tactfully without being so crude as to get banned from the boards? If a man and a woman both have IQ's higher than 80 and are capable of figuring out which hole is used for the ""standard"" method of copulation which can result in the creation of a human being, they should automatically assume that doing so without protection can result in pregnancy. Which leads me to another exception for which I would allow abortion, in the case of a mentally retarded female, who truly was incapable of understanding the potential result of her actions.","Shooterandproud","320357","I'm having difficulty with your willingness to call anyone who doesn't follow your moral code ""stupid"", and then insisting on punishing them, with children no less. That's because the Christian teaching of abstinence only is . It is probably responsible for more abortions. Go figure, huh? What if they thought that there was only, say, a 50% chance of getting pregnant? Furthermore, what if they WERE stupid? Stupidity isn't a crime punishable by forcible parenthood. Also, what if they didn't know how to put on a condom? I didn't until this year in health. Any other way of putting it on (including unrolling it and just shoving it on) may cause breaks in the condom. So, unless we can educate everyone about that, failed contraceptive users should definitely have access to an abortion. You calling them stupid is all the more reason we don't want them to be parents. Yea, because that's likely. I propose that all of us choicers vote for an initiative that forces all pro-life men and women to abort their children. Obviously, I would withdraw it before it was put on the ballet, but maybe then the lifers would start to appreciate their reproductive rights, and see the horrible ramifications of their ignorance.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:52 PM","abortion-debates","138"

Shooterandproud: I didn't realize that you are a high school student. Please re-read my proposal. It does not force those who become pregnant due to ignorance to keep and raise their babies, but provides financing and services for them to receive pre-natal care, safe delivery, and a means to provide babies for adoption.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:45 AM","abortion-debates","141"

There was a Constitutional right to abortion found in Roe whether you like it or not, just as there was found a Constitutional right to burn the American flag under 1A in Texas v. Johnson. Have someone read the Roe decision to you, especially this part: This right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","09:30 AM","abortion-debates","142"
"08-15-2008","11293",10,"Galactababe","320374","Chester: The question becomes the interpretation of the word PERSON. If we accept the pro-Life position that a fetus is a person, then Roe vs. Wade violates the Due Process clause. It should also be noted that medical technology was in the relative dark ages when the 14th Amendment was written and that premie babies have survived when delivered as early as 21 weeks.","chester","320380","On the other hand, if we DON'T accept the profetallife position, as the US Census Bureau does not, then we come to a very different conclusion. The fact that micropreemies survive has NO relevance whatsoever to the issue of whether THIS woman in THIS situation wishes to take her pregnancy to term. You seem to be speaking in terms of Pregnancy Police. Is that what you want? BTW, I suppose you are congratulating yourself for bringing another forum to a crashing halt with your rants.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:34 AM","abortion-debates","145"

I had a very nice back and forth with Antonia, she's gone and I choose not to add anything further. Am I sitting on your hands? Why don't you try and generate some intelligent discourse yourself instead of your one-line hypocritical snarks? Don't blame me for no further posts being added to that thread. Please cite when the U.S. Census Bureau was declared a ""moral"" authority.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:39 AM","abortion-debates","146"
"08-15-2008","11293",10,"Galactababe","320385","It most certainly does. If the fetus is ""sustainable"" as a PERSON, then the mother, the doctor performing the abortion, and the government that allows it, are violating the baby's Due Process clause.","chester","320390","A fetus in utero is not covered by the Due Process Clause. Besides which, your ""compromise"" fails to take into account the responsibilities of the profetallifers. They should in this and all other cases be required to adopt the ""child"". Let's make sure they have some skin in the game before they go around so loudly declaiming what pregnant women may or may not do with their bodies.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:52 PM","abortion-debates","148"

So your desire to force people who may already have children into the fray is not only ludicrous, but totally unnecessary. And just think about the potential contributions that aborted people will never make because they weren't adopted and allowed to experience life. http://adopko.wordpress.com/2007/09/...dopted-people/","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:46 PM","abortion-debates","150"
