They want to be a princess 5. they get bored and think that the partnership is not living up to their expectations 6. consolidating the decision to divorce or break up the relationship 7. or unconsciously having an affair in order to break the relationship 8. revenge: the man cheated so she does the same: tit-for-tat 9.

"12-15-2008","11293",42,"nononsense","336713","All men are created equal. All life has the same inalienable right to life. A mother has no more value than a child. A child has no more worth as a human than a mother. Are you a clump of cells? Biologically, yes. But that is not the point. The point is protecting lives. One must not be required to be a doctor, lawyer, biologist, sociologist, anthropologist, psychologist, or other professional to acknowledge the inalienable right to lif and defend it. It is a basic principle of morality. An unfertilized egg lives for 12 hours in the fallopian tube before dying. The new human once created, lingers in the womb for several days before embedding into the wall. No one knows how many embryos have been lost due to the inablility to successfully attach to its womb. So please dispense with the so-called statistics on the subject. So you can stop the elephant hurling. Thank you.","Shooterandproud","336843","You miss one critical point: a fetus is not a person. There is no person inside of a fetus, like there is a person inside of a human being's body. It is shallow to value a human being simply because of the type of cells he/she is made of. What is even more shallow is valuing feti over women.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","09:44 PM","abortion-debates","619"

What also needs to be known is that at 19 and 20 we were young, innocent and gullible. We went to a family planning clinic and asked that lady/councilor specifically about the development of the baby at the 12 week point when the abortion would be performed. Her response is burned into my psyche as she pointed to her baby fingernail and said it's a blob of blood and tissue that's smaller than a peanut. Neither of us really wanted to do this but we were both afraid to tell our parents such news. And I wasn't a believer in Christ yet for another 3 years. Around 1981 I was married and was holding my second and youngest daughter, a newborn, in my arms as I watched the evening News. All of a sudden, the reporter said a new womb camera has been invented and you're about to see something that has never been seen before. And right there on the tube we see a 12 week old fetus in the womb and it was substantial compared to a peanut sized clot of blood and cells as shown here: Minti - 12 week old Fetus - Photo I was shocked and immediately, yet for the first time understood what i had done. So I wasn't a hypocrite back then as I had no spiritual or moral convictions either way about abortion. I was ignorant and knew no better just like the people here who argue in favor of abortion. I say this not to justify my actions, but to explain what happened and why.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:13 AM","abortion-debates","624"

However, you reinforce my point. Medical terms are used in hospitals, but the general population has familiar names with which to easily communicate. A neonate is simply one of many stages of human growth terms. A human is a human and always has been from the beginning of its being. It begins at the beginning, not at the end, and not in the middle, but at the beginning. So call humans by their stage of development if you will, but it is not acceptable in a world of civility and morality to use words to mislead. A baby is a person. An unborn, yet to be born baby is a person. Every unique individual human is a person.

A pregnancy is a child in its womb. It is not a disease. It is not a leach. It is in its rightful place growing as it should. No medical terms are necessary to define it. Birth is when the child travels down the birth canal and out. Labor is when the cervix opens so the baby can travel down the birth canal. Abortion is when a person forces the cervix open prematurely and scraps, suctions and removes the baby prematurely. Sometimes birth happens surgically when a baby is unable to be born in the normal way. Sometimes premature babies are born surgically and then killed, and that is one form of the so-called abortion. Killing the child is the goal of the abortion. But it is not avoiding birth. Abortion is giving birth prematurely to a dead baby. It entails the removal of the childs arms, legs, head or brains. So-called abortions hurt not only the child, but the mother, father and relatives also. Ultrasound pictures give us a window into the womb of a preborn child. Every woman with child who thinks life would be better if the child is destroyed needs to have an ultrasound so devilish people cannot tell them lies and that they just have some sort of lump inside them. Pictures don't lie...people do. Stop deceiving with words. Fools lie against the truth.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:37 AM","abortion-debates","626"
