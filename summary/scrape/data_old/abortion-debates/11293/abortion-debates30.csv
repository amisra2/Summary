"11-23-2008","11293",30,"Archangel","333883","So you're actually admitting that women's reason for killing their unborn babies is due to greed, selfishness and their personal self interest rather than considering the life growing inside them. And you are so shallow that this perspective seems perfectly rational to you. Talk about sheer disgusting cynicism!","Joel_Henderson","333995","Not rational-- RATIONALE. Theirs. They PRETEND it's ""my body, my choice"" etc--- but they REALLY mean ""my MONEY, my choice.""","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","09:41 PM","abortion-debates","436"

If she won the lotto on the way to the abortium, suddenly things would ""change.""","hollyh","334008","Oh contrare, all the money in the world would not make me continue a pregnancy acquired from rape! Or continue with a pregnancy that could either kill me, or produce a severely disabled child. It cannot be said that all women would continue on with unwanted pregnancy should riches befall, as you so ignorantly & arrogantly claim. I am a woman, therefore i have single handedly thrown your statement out the window. You cannot proclaim ""never"" when one would defy you.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:17 PM","abortion-debates","438"

Likewise, the vast majority of most ""date-rapes"" are decided AFTER the fact, when the man reveals that the sexual act won't entitle the woman to a lifetime income on the man's nickel-- and even the pregnancy doesn't work to trap the man like she planned . Which doesn't fall under the term ""elective,"" as I clearly stipulated. IF you weren't lying through your teeth, and I know that women see men as banks-- both kinds.

"11-24-2008","11293",30,"hollyh","333985","Sorry, abuse meaning the women who fail to use any contraceptive means and continuously use abortion as their safety net. These women abuse the system. I didnt say i would remove their right to have the abortion, i am pro choice, but i do believe they should face consequences for their multiple terms of blatant disregard, negligence and abuse of the situation. Surely they should be made to face some consequence (and no i dont mean nto allowing them to have the abortion)??","chester","334015","OK, holly. Just what ""consequence"" would you impose, a Scarlet A worn on the woman's clothing perhaps, and just exactly who should impose it? Hint, it's been tried. Google ""Hester Prynne"" for proof. Just who, BTW, would you empower to check to see how many times a woman chose to abort a pregnancy? Would you presume to violate doctor-patient confidentiality in the process? It's comfortable, I suppose, for you folks to bloviate in generalities about such things, but you and your ilk become remarkably vague when it comes to actual boots on the ground, rubber meeting the road practicalities.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:46 AM","abortion-debates","440"
"11-24-2008","11293",30,"Darn Republican","333926","But if that is the sole means of your argument, that isn't a legal argument. As men and women we are just different, the law clearly respects the differences between genders. But that doesn't change what we are... women cannot get pregnant without being impregnated, those means are typically during intercourse to which she would be fully engaging in consensually, she should [as a partner in the act] be prepared for the repercussions of not being protected. Same for the male... he ain't gettin' away with nothing either... Lol! I am just saying there is not ""equality"" that needs be considered there. Equality and fairness are liberal talking point that need to be parsed and translated into what they actually mean, equality = moral equivocation with that which is just and universally accepted as right and morally correct, and fairness is nothing short of a fascistic neutering and silencing of anything they don't agree with in favor of their own position on a given matter. However, I have to draw a line between what I see as your co-opting of ""our side""... I am a social conservative, which means I take a stance as a citizen to engage the culture but do so in a way the preserves the union, and does not take a position on anything not consistent with that. Abortion does not and is not in any way a benefit to any society... but we seem to have a legal framework that somehow must allow for interpretation to take root and have more effect than it should... I see your position as republican or moderate at best. But [again] I do respect your point of view...","CUNxTime","334024","And, of course, I respect yours. I'm libertarian in my views. Legally, I want the govt. OUT of my (and my fellow citizens') life. I don't want them telling me how to run my business. I don't want them concerning themselves with what I watch on TV. And I sure don't want them telling me (or my wife) what we can and can't do at the doctor's office. I don't want my govt. teaching me morality. I want them to keep terrorists from blowing me up and I want the roads clear so I can get from place to place to make money. When my elected officials are sworn in, they don't place their hand on the constitution and swear to uphold the bible. They place their hand on the bible and swear to uphold the constitution, that's ALL I want out of them.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:44 AM","abortion-debates","441"

In fact, my wife's cousin is blacklisted in all the abortion clinics within 200 miles of Myrtle Beach because she's had 5 or 6 abortions and they fear she's due to have problems from excessive scarring. Everyone I know finds this disgusting. But it isn't the abnormal cases that define a system. Just because this freak is a piece of &^$% doesn't give us the right to grill every woman who finds herself in a position that she doesn't want to be in (whether by rape or mistake, or contraceptive failure, or whatever). I don't want to see a panel of 70 year old men whom a woman must beseech and prove her need for abortion. That is between her and her doctor. Privacy and small govt. intrusion are ALWAYS better than the alternative!","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:50 AM","abortion-debates","442"
"11-24-2008","11293",30,"None","None","None","CUNxTime","334028","Joel, I think you are pigeonholing women and simplifying them beyond all semblance of reality. No human being can be boiled down to a dollar bill on any such simplistic subset of responses. We (men) aren't that simple and (if anything) women are (much!) more complicated than us. You can't really believe any adult can be that simple. If that were the case, our conservative ideology (of people's self-reliance/self-responsibility) would be invalid because you'd have the govt. EXPANDING its role into the doctor's office. I want a small govt. when it comes to business AND morality.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","09:08 AM","abortion-debates","443"
