There would have been no fetus to abort had he not been so negligent. In essence his lack of intervention on behalf of an unconscious, sexually assaulted child caused a pregnancy to result when one could have been prevented. He wasn't being expected to abort, he was however expected to prevent conception from occurring as within the treatment guidelines of every admitted rape victim. He willfully ignored this. The defense made him responsible for retribution of personal damages on behalf of the victim due to his negligence including now having to experience an abortion. Plus a multitude of other claims. The doctor created a situation for a procedure he was so against. Ironic. Like i said, they won, it turns out religious morality as a defense for medical negligence wasn't so legal after all. Medicine and its practice is legally free from religious morality. We cant exactly have mormon doctors running around refusing blood transfers can we?","nononsense","337376","Hyppocrates: I will, ""...never do harm to anyone,"" ""not give a pessary to cause an abortion."" The Hyppocratic Oath To destroy a human is obviously harmful to that person! Medical professionals who know that a child will be lost in giving a certain medication are right to be consistent with the premise of good medicine. It is so contradictory for abortion supporters to claim they care about people, but then, destroy them by the millions. That is not consistent. Without sacrifice, love is meaningless.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:42 PM","abortion-debates","736"

"12-19-2008","11293",50,"Winston Smith","337368","In my opinion although metaphors are pretty adornments of the literary and pictorial kind (well when it comes to painting we have allegories) they never illuminate any aspect for reality. Science does away with metaphors' However, let's have a closer look at your metaphor, it was ill chosen for in real life the character in the play becomes the actor in the play. There is no duality of existence, just life or death The opposite is true, to act against one's conscience is to compromise oneself.","antonia","337381","Oh blah, blah, blah. You just don't want to address the point that was made, and a few times, already. Baloney. The best science teacher I ever had used metaphors every day to illuminate scientific points. And Dawkins - a very famous scientist - uses metaphors, too. He wrote a book entitled with metaphor -- ""The Selfish Gene"". It was an excellent metaphor. That is the point of the metaphor. A character on paper is not an actor in a future Broadway production. Nor is the genetic coding in a cell an individual, later on. What the heck is this supposed to mean? Do you even think about the words you choose for your sentences and what they mean? Do you sweep the ground before you as you walk so as not to obliterate life? What do you mean -- ""the opposite is true""? I just said, if someone's conscience tells them abortion is murder, then don't have one. And don't work in a field of medicine where you'd have to compromise yourself.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","07:14 PM","abortion-debates","738"
"12-19-2008","11293",50,"Winston Smith","337370","my moral position on abortion has nothing to do with religion. It seems inconceivable to you that my morality is not based on religion but, it is, and what about you? is you conscience based on the tenets of a particular religion? I have explained ad nauseum my position but you still refuse to accept it: There is no discontinuity (it would be absurd) between an adult human being and one just conceived, just different stages of development. The weakness of your position is that where you draw the line between 'it' and 'she' is purely arbitrary, a matter of expediency. You could also commit infanticide and say that what you killed was not a human being. This is not moral relativism this is sophism of the worst kind. I am not confused at all with the separation of the secular and religious. Chile for your information has a constitutional separation of Church and State going back to the XIX century. I was declared a non-believer Reason works as well in Chile as anywhere else.","antonia","337384","My conscience is based on my human nature. The only line I have drawn are those drawn by the court in Roe, by stating that I was essentially a Roe traditionalist. What they said was not at all arbitrary, but based on science and evidence, and what we can agree that we know about the normal development of a fetus. I think what really disturbs you, Winston, is that the court does not play God and say, ""There it is! The magic moment of humanity! The line has been crossed!"" They reason on the basis of rough guidelines, leaving the rest between you and YOUR god or conscience. But you, Winston, you want to impose your morals and your personal-pipeline-to-God insight on everyone else. And btw, Winston, you do draw a line -- ""Conception!"" A la RCC. Actually, it is views like your own that create mass infanticide, as in places like Portugal, mentioned earlier. You are so tied to this castle-in-the-sky absolutism of yours, that you would pass laws that have poor rural uneducated women abandonning REAL babies in fields to die. You are the sophist of the worst kind. You most certainly are. Chile has some of the most barbaric abortion laws in the world, going back to the RCC. And I declare you a believer. Not as far as abortion is concerned.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","07:30 PM","abortion-debates","739"

There is no child after a rape, only cells and contamination. ECP prevents the conception from even occurring. The case we were discussing involved a doctor who did not administer ECP after receiving an unconscious raped child in the ER. He wasn't asked to abort. Like i said, and everyone else agrees with, he was willfully medically negligent and prosecuted for doing so. Dont tell me your against contraception to LOL, says the poster who would force her own mother to carry to term an unwanted rape pregnancy. (avoiding the question is a good as admitting guilt)Yep, you sure do care about women. ""abortion supporters"", another common cheap shot from an intellectually bankrupt pro-lifer. Do you people need a degree to understand the term pro-choice? I'd suggest you stay away from medicine then if you do.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","07:53 PM","abortion-debates","740"

Educate yourself on all of the places where pregnant girls can go to school and live, where pregnant women can get all the help they need, where mothers-to-be are loved. Find out how many people are waiting to adopt. I support my local Pregnancy Resource Center. As for me, I have three children and I am the step-parent of five. We have three married daughters and seven grandchildren.

"12-20-2008","11293",50,"antonia","337384","Singer's response came to Dublin reader Karen Meade's question: ""Would you kill a disabled baby?"" ""Yes, if that was in the best interests of the baby and of the family as a whole. Many people find this shocking, yet they support a woman's right to have an abortion,"" he said. He added that one point on which he agrees with the pro-life movement is that, ""from the point of view of ethics rather than the law, there is no sharp distinction between the foetus and the newborn baby."" ""Singer holds that man is no different from other forms a life, and therefore man's life is not worth more than, for example, a cow. He told readers he'd kill 10 cows before killing one human, but that's not because they are of less value, only that humans would mourn."" PETE SINGER, Princeton I hope that maybe some who support the killing of young humans no matter their age or ability will really thing it through. Where is it to stop? Without truth and without love, there is suffering immeasurable. Don't be ignorant, when human life is devalued, no life has value.","antonia","337408","[QUOTE=nononsense;337402] Nononsense, I don't support 3rd trimester abortions for normal pregnancies that don't threaten the life of the mother. In the U.S. though, I don't know of any women who seek them, unless their health was threatened or complications developed in the fetus and pregnancy. And I figure that should be between a woman and her doctor. I'm not clear what the context for this story is. I don't support killing disabled babies, either. However, I do support people wanting to be taken off life support systems if they are in a diresome medical situation -- and at any age -- which can include an infant whose parents speak on their behalf, instead. Since obviously the baby can't. My remark that you responded to, however, concerns the impact of very strict anti-abortion laws in Portugal. You wind up with very high rates of infanticide. Hence, the Catholic Priest's comment that the real infanticide in Portugal are the anti-abortion laws. Women will always seek abortions. You want them legal and safe, rarer, and hopefully, less unwanted pregnancies to begin with. There are no cut and dry solutions. On devaluation, I like what Eleanor Roosevelt once said: ""No one can make you feel inferior without your consent."" Once a person is here on this planet, their inherent worth as a human being is no different than anyone elses. We are all ""equal"". Even those going to Ivy League schools. With the better getting out, always get that, and sharing that truth.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:19 AM","abortion-debates","748"

If she made a choice to do so i would respect it. Pro life however is for the removal of choice and the enforcement of pain against ones will.

Women are forced to kill their own children and have them ripped from their womb every day! It is a violent act against woman and child. And it must be stopped. Pain is a part of life, but premature death does not have to be condoned by a civilized society. Every woman who enters a so-called family planning clinic is lied to about the child she is carrying. She is NOT given ALL the information available today. Therefore, they cannot make a choice. They are coerced. It has been widely reported that the so-called counselling from Planned Parenthood tells the women about ALL OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS THEY CAN DO WITHOUT A BABY. But it is too late. What they need to do is help them with the baby. Stop lying and tell the truth. Truly help instead of hurt. If every disclosure and option is not given to pregnant women needing help, then they have not been given a choice at all.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:22 AM","abortion-debates","750"
