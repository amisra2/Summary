"01-15-2009","11293",66,"Another opinion","340382","Either way, we already discussed this issue of whether people can have opinions about abortion law. Perhaps you are having a ""senior moment"" and don't remember our discussion. I really don't feel like repeating this whole discussion all over again for your benefit. Indeed, you do seem to repeat your questions quite often. If you don't like someone's answer, don't just repeat the question - address their answer. If you don't remember our discussion, it started pretty much around post #861. Unless you have something new to say that we didn't already discuss, then I think we pretty much covered it and left it at a disagreement.","chester","340385","Nope, this is a very different topic altogether. It deals with the egoism involved when someone attempts to make her/his opinion into a universal. Under what claim of right do you do so?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:30 PM","abortion-debates","976"

If you want to continue that discussion from where we ended it, or tap into some part of my answer that we did not address, fine. Otherwise, I feel no need to repeat the same answers I already gave to this same question that you pose. By the way, if you keep repeating this point in future posts without bothering to address the answers I already gave in that earlier discussion, then I will simply ignore those posts.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:33 PM","abortion-debates","977"

If a woman is denied autonomy over, ownership of her body, she may on the one hand be forced to be pregnant and to give birth against her will, but she may also be forced to have an abortion, again, against her will","Winston Smith","340422","she may this ... she may that ... This is pure unfounded speculation.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:41 AM","abortion-debates","978"

If one is anti-abortion they think one is into burning abortion clinics and killing doctors who perform abortions. I feel sorry for them.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","04:42 AM","abortion-debates","979"

On the other hand, just how many pro-choice people do you see murdering profetallifers? Yesterday on NPR, there was an interview with Randall Terry the founder of the misnamed ""Operation Rescue."" He went out of his way to say repeatedly that there is to be no compromise with ""baby killers."" Does this sound rational to you, or is it rather a sign of obsessive behavior? Now, try it again. Try to give reasoned points as to why your peculiar POV should be law in the universe.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:16 AM","abortion-debates","980"

As you would have to admit, those posters occur on both sides of the abortion debate. My rule of thumb when dealing with such posters is to engage them if the point they bring up might be considered reasonable by some other readers, where my answer would really be indirectly addressed to those hypothetical readers. Most of the time, even annoying posters whose posts contain more flaming than genuine content are still worth engaging if the content is relatively new and original. I usually give up on a poster only once they exceed my ""flame tolerance"" limit, or if they stop presenting any content worth addressing. That probably makes me more tolerant than most. Either way, it is the silent readers that I address more with my responses than such a poster themselves.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:46 AM","abortion-debates","981"

As a man, I am not entitled to an opinion on the topic. How many times do I need to say that my only opinion on the topic is that the choice of whether or not to continue a pregnancy is the sole province of the woman involved and that I will support whatever choice she makes? How many times do I have to say that this is an area where the law must needs be silent? Is that really so hard for the restrictionists here to understand?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:53 AM","abortion-debates","982"
