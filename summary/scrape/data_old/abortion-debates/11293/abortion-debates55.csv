Women shouldn't have to be desperate in order to get an abortion.","hollyh","337650","Believe me i am more than diligent in regards to contraception. OK your free to disagree with his perspective. I interpreted it as he would rather abortion be a procedure made safe for women (legal) than have them performed in back alleys. He doesn't condone it, but i read his view as one of pro choice. I found it balanced. Again, i respect if you disagree. Women shouldn't have to be desperate in order to get an abortion? i wasn't sure what you meant here and didn't want to infer anything without asking you to elaborate for me please. My concern is however that she never be in a situation of desperation because someone would attempt to criminalize the procedure. No one should remove her right to chose and have this procedure administered, by way of decriminalization, in a safe, sterile, medically sound environment.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:26 AM","abortion-debates","815"

"12-22-2008","11293",55,"hollyh","337644","Surely thats rhetorical I miss Archangel! I think that is a very balanced perspective, i tend to agree. I think the procedure that is abortion is horrendous, i hope i never have to consider it (rape and medical issues being the only reason i would). But i would never condemn those who would to an inhumane backyard butchery. I value women to much. Antonia: ""Btw, that poster isn't here. Didn't you see? He waved bye-bye because he left town to see a Degas exhibit with his poor wife ."" Wow this film looks very profound, i would love to see it, where did you find it?","Winston Smith","337664","I think Archie has said everything he had to say about abortion by now. I respect him for even when everyone is against him, he holds his ground. Of course his ground is shaky but still. Once he was saying that dragons existed and that was hilarious It is horrendous, even if for some persons it is a 'natural' act. Big Brother or should I say Big Sister would have been proud of their doubletalk, not Winston Smith of course. You know, a wise writer once said that to take the position 'in between' what you called balanced is the only honest position. I wished I could remember where I read it. I remember when I was young and the Vietnam war was at its peak I realised the war was lost and the facts supported my view. I mentioned once at dinner in the house of a Uni friend of mine, that the pacification program was a failure even according to TIME magazine a conservative magazine. His parents stared at me in silence and resumed eating. From that day I was not accepted in their house for I was a labelled a Communist. I learnt in Chile that between two ideologies runs a seismic fault and that if you stand in the middle you fall. The same with the pro and anti-abortion camps, a balanced view is not tolerated by either camp, you are one of us or against us. Zealots see everything in black and white. There are no greys. Once you are regarded to be the enemy, because you disagree with them, what follows is that you are demonized : ""I declare you a believer"" the hate word is ""believer"" and no matter how strongly you explain that you are not a believer you are not heard. This is my position on abortion: a human life, a human being in the making as we all are until we reach adulthood is destroyed by abortion. On the other hand we have the mother and her situation, if the pregnancy put her in an desperate position and will abort her baby no matter what then for her sake let's have society provide her with a doctor and a clinic. I don't expect people to change their views swayed by arguments, I know better than that. I just state my position and why it is my position. But even when I stopped talking to that person after explaining my reasons the insults continue, although I have never insulted her. I never said I was exiting 4forums or this thread just had enough of her insults It had a theatrical release but I haven't seen it myself. It is quite traumatic. Some anti-abortion people said that the abortion scene itself was not realistic enough, apparently not enough blood ... would you believe it? I haven't seen it in the video store or in World Movies yet.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:05 AM","abortion-debates","819"

On the other hand, this, ""Don't have sex, if you don't want to have children."" might jut lead many of us to conclude that you have a deep-seated hatred/fear of women's sexuality.

Yes, the rhethoric between the two opposing political camps has been fairly heated in the last years - especially since the rise of the neo-Conservative movement. However, there are quite a few people who do try to have real discussions, not just flaming - on both sides. There are certainly more than enough flamers to go around on either political side but that shouldn't blind you to the real discussions that do occur. Also, many, perhaps most, of those who flame are also capable of genuine open discussion as long as you are able to ratchet down the level of animosity in the rhethoric. I hold on to a firm belief that, as long as one keeps the discussion calm on ones own end, avoids any insulting rhethoric, and genuinely tries to understand and respond to the opposing arguements, then one can end up having a reasonable discussion with most posters - even flamers. This has happened often enough that it keeps me encouraged. That doesn't mean that there aren't those who are irrationally beligerent no matter what. You just have to recognize those and then ignore them until they go away (which they usually eventually do if enough people ignore them).","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:47 AM","abortion-debates","823"

Don't have sex, if you don't want to have children.","Another opinion","337685","When you say ""fully human"", what do you mean by that? In what way is a zygote or early embryo ""fully human""? I have often found that those on the pro-life side tend to imagine the embryo as the baby it will become, not for what that embryo actually is at that moment. I can understand that emotion, but it is based on imagination, not reality, so one cannot base a law on it. The early fetus / embryo has no mind yet that can feel pain, fear, joy, any will to live, feel any sensory input ...nothing. At that early stage, it is just a body with ""nobody home"". Any movements at that stage are only reflex action - not actions due to a mind controlling that movement or feeling their effect. Our imaginations can deceive us into thinking otherwise since, after all, it starts to ""look"" human fairly early on. It has a heart beat fairly early on and other aspects that make us try to relate to it. However, I find it important to be able to step back and judge objectively whether what one is imagining is actually true. Does the fact that it starts to look like us mean that it really is like us? In the most critical sense, I would say no since it cannot have any sense of mind / mental existence until fairly late in the pregnancy. That mental existence is what makes us us - it is the core aspect of our lives as people that one cannot due without. I, and many others on the pro-choice side, find that dividing line of the onset of potential mental existence as critically important in defining abortion rights. Before that human body gains any mental existence, it is, once again, just a body with ""nobody home"" which many of us view as not deserving rights (mere bodies don't deserve rights) so the woman can abort it at that stage for whatever reason she chooses since her right to her own body is unchallenged by any other right. However, once the fetus can start to have a mental existence (when there is a ""somebody"" now present in the body), then fetal rights to life also have to be taken into account. This happens around the beginning of the third trimester. Because of this, many of us on the pro-choice side would limit third trimester abortion rights to a handful of exceptions (risk to mother's life, health, etc.) but would keep first and second trimester abortions rights free. Indeed, around 84% of Americans think that third trimester abortions should be generally outlawed (generally meaning outlawed minus certain exceptions). Those statistics show that the majority of pro-choice supporters would also generally outlaw third trimester abortions - some for reasons similar to my own, some for reasons of viability or other arguements. Those here that argue the extreme of no restrictions on abortion rights for any reason ever, are definitely the minority with only about 10% of Americans supporting those views. What is also interesting is that about 2/3rds of Americans support first trimester abortions being legal - where those statistics would reveal that a minority of those calling themselves pro-life do support abortion rights if the abortions would happen very early on. So, the two camps are not as extreme as some of the rhethoric in this forum might suggest. The spread also shows that the issues are more complex. Note: The statistics I quote come from Abortion , a CNN/Gallup/USA Today poll from 2003 (the last one I have seen that divides the question into trimesters).","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:15 AM","abortion-debates","824"

Marriage does not magically make someone a responsible, capable parent. You have a very unrealistic, condescending and punitive towards a woman's sexuality.

You remind me of the drunk scuzzball in the bar who thinks he has some rights to me because he has penis. The point I am making and you are failing to grasp is that women facing an unwanted pregnancy are facing serious issues. Misogynistic comments about ""convenience"" and ""keeping their legs shut"" until they are the appropriate property of some fella serves NOTHING but your own ego. It will not help women or children. It astonishes me how many lifers really aren't interested in working on reducing abortion. Their goal is the illusion that they are somehow moral in the demonization of women in a difficult situation.
