Ignorance of a contract's obvious terms is never an excuse from being bound by them, once one consents to those legal and binding terms via accepting consideration (i.e. engaging in ""sexual congress"" as you put it); and if men think that sexual intercourse with a fertile woman doesn't involve the risk of pregnancy, they're inexcusably ignorant... like you. This creates an implied-in-fact contract between the the man and the woman, with the party conceived being beneficiary and subject thereto (i.e. parental rights over the child etc). Those are the clear and obvious terms, and therefore sexual intercourse is a contingency-agreement between the couple doing the coupling, and any potential offspring resulting therefrom. If they don't like the terms, they can act to reduce the chances, or avoid the contract entirely through simply abstaining from the agreemetn-- but they can't pact for the wrongful death of the unwitting third party, in order for their own personal benefit at that child's expense. Freedom is not carte blanche to do as one pleases, but only in a manner exclusive of the rights of others; and so social contracts are not not strictly about what you want, it's about what you CONSENT to-- whether by your actions or words-- consistent with those rights of everyone, whether pre- or post-natal; a woman's body is not another country, let alone another universe. The price of freedom isn't eternal vigilance-- it's RESPONSIBILITY to others, for what you choose do with that freedom.","simone","333148","Common law? The common law of which nation? And, who enforces this common law? Men on the verge of engaging in sexual congress with a woman, willing or not, fertile or not, have little thought of entering into an implied-in-fact contract. I would very much like to know from whence this implied-in-fact contract has been derived. I very much fear that it exploded suddenly from the untninking nether regions of certain people. Clear and obvious terms! In the midst of hormonal madness! Truly! What short of lala world creates these most unreal scenarios? Men in western culture which derives its beliefs and social mores from patriarchal religions, these men are not taught very much responsibility. Responsibility seems to be the sole obligation of women in these cultures. Women are responsible for all sin, for all evil, they must suffer for the sins of all others, a most unfair and misogynistic situation.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:45 AM","abortion-debates","346"
"11-17-2008","11293",24,"Joel_Henderson","None","As for the rest, This is more of the sort of ""defensive rationalization"" I talked about earlier, i.e. when people find it more rewarding to self-righteously defend their wrongdoings and thus shirk their responsibility to others, than to shoulder the burdens to those they have harmed, and thus they act in self-absorbed narcissism and sociopathic dissociation, while likewise waxing arrogant in self-deceiving affirmation of their own ""brilliance"" and other superiority to do as they please, by simply denying said consequences however obvious-- illustrated here, by simply calling a fetus a ""parasite"" and thus daintily strutting off away from one's obvious duties to it, despite admitting it's also human. However, a human being forced into dependency on another for its life, is not a ""parasite,"" but a VICTIM, and thus has the right to aid from the ones responsible for that dependency. Since you've admitted that it's human, then the remainder is plain; it also has the right to aid from the one responsible for its dependency, i.e. the man and woman in question who proximately caused it to be in its dependent situation through their willful actions in full knowledge of that risk. Here, the doctrine of Strict Liability would apply, in that normal sexual contact carries the inherent risk of pregnancy. This doctrine already applies to men, and should likewise apply to women who choose to abort in spite of their responsibility to the prenatal human in question, created and made dependent on her for its life through her intentional actions. The one with the COMMON LAW-- but since you don't have common sense, you probably never hoid of it. Ignorance of a contract's obvious terms is never an excuse from being bound by them, once one consents to those legal and binding terms via accepting consideration (i.e. engaging in ""sexual congress"" as you put it); and if men think that sexual intercourse with a fertile woman doesn't involve the risk of pregnancy, they're inexcusably ignorant... like you.

The price of freedom isn't eternal vigilance-- it's RESPONSIBILITY to others, for what you choose do with that freedom.","Another opinion","333198","Though I am jumping into the discussion here and have not followed it from the beginning, I need to address yours points. I get the impression that you view women as having a responsibility over their offspring from the point of conception on - i.e. not only in late term. I would contest this. Up to around the beginning of the third trimester, the embryo / fetus is nothing but a developing body with ""nobody home"" - i.e. no mental existence (no thoughts, no emotions, no sense of self, no feelings of pain, no ability to experience their environment - nothing). I do not see any reason to have forced responsibility over such a living mindless body. As at the end of life when the mind can be gone from accident or illness, it is not worth keeping the empty living body artificially alive. It is the person who effectively resides in the body (through mental brain function or belief in a soul) who we value - not the body itself. From discussions with those on the pro-life side, it seems clear that the thing that is valued in the embryo / early fetus is not as much what it currently IS but what it WILL BECOME. What it currently IS is only valued because it is on its way to becoming something / someone that we do value. The hypothetical question to test this was how much is such a life valued if it suddenly stopped growing so that it would never reach the stage of lifeform that has emotions, thoughts, feelings of pain, etc. Apparently, its value dropped significantly (at least that was the answer for those not afraid of anwering that question). However, once there is ""somebody home"" in that body, then I would agree that you now have another person whose rights should be taken into account. Biologically, neurologically speaking, such mental functions can't start before around the beginning of the third trimester. So, I support more clearly legally restricting third trimester abortion rights to the limited exceptions (mother's life, significant risk to health, mercy killing deformed fetuses, etc.). Then it makes sense to speak of an ""other"" to whom one has responsibilities. One last point. I have heard a few pro-life advocates make the same arguement you do that pro-choice supporters make their arguements simply out of a ""defense rationalization"", where you think they really do agree that they are doing wrong. You don't realize that they actually generally do believe all of what they say. As a general rule of thumb, I tend to think that most people believe what they say. However, many people have holes or inconsistencies in their thinking that one can highlight if one can tell what those holes or inconsistencies are. I have found that the best way to discover such holes and inconsistencies in reasoning is to see what type of questions people make an effort at avoiding to answer. Where the pro-life camp is concerned, I find that a major hole in their reasoning is to highlight what the embryo / early fetus is AT THAT MOMENT , independent of what it will become in the future. This has highlighted that it is only valued by what it WILL BECOME, not for what it currently IS. As for the extreme pro-choice side that would allow abortions at all times for any reason (note: they represent a minority of the pro-choice side), then they get very uncomfortable when you question them about the difference in a fetus one day from birth vs a newborn baby and force them to answer the question of whether or not they would allow a birth-minus-one-day abortion for any reason. So, instead of jumping to wrong assumptions about the reasoning of pro-choice supporters, search for holes in logic and reasoning that you can exploit. That would be far more effective than your false assumptions that they are harboring guilt.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","04:31 PM","abortion-debates","347"

I do agree that in the third trimester of a pregnancy the rights of another individual comes into play. If a woman does not want to be pregnant, she should have terminated her pregnancy long before that point. In the third trimester, I believe that the only good reason to terminate a pregnancy would be the endangerment of the pregnant woman's life, health, or if there were sound evidence that the fetus was profoundly disabled and would survive for only a short and torturous while, or would be profoundly disabled and traumatized throughout life -- able to survive only by extreme and intrusive and painful medical intervention. One must also consider who would be responsible for the maintenance of such a profoundly disabled individual.

The chance that she is capable of handling Americans wanting abortions on demand, or be willing to take legal responsibility for offering them abortions is very questionable and doubtful, imo. And regarding both countries, americans would be offered no legal protections by the US if they attempted to bypass american law by going there for abortions. And if caught after the fact, could still be charged with murder upon their return to the USA. And if this became a real issue once this system was in place, women of child bearing age could be required to give a urine sample at the borders before being allowed to leave the USA. And this isn't extreme at all. It is an abortion policy with teeth which any policy that results in the death of an innocent party to another persons so called wrongdoing ought to be.

"11-19-2008","11293",24,"Archangel","333428","You're attempting to create problems where none exist. The women would be tried in their home state for illegally usurping american abortion laws by going over the border. As for the man, unless he helped her usurp the law he isn't guilty of breaking that law. Remember, getting her pregnant isn't the crime, assisting her in killing the baby would be. If he did, then he is an accomplice and should be charged accordingly. And your attempt to indite me as guilty of anything illegal is fallacious, as I wouldn't have allowed Mary to get an illegal abortion back then, or now, so we wouldn't have been in a position to worry about such a consequence. And I wouldn't consider this a capital crime, but it could still qualify as a murder charge with the possibility of a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. It would be up to the prosecutor what to charge them with though, based on the individual circumstances of each case. The point is to make the personal cost high enough so that normally law abiding people would be motivated to not break the law in the first place. It would also cause both men and women to think twice before engaging in casual sex which is currently a sort of national past time. And why am I not surprised that you completely ignored my response to your challenge for a practical solution to this problem of genocide against America's pre-born.","chester","333434","Archie, Come back when you know something about how American law works. 1. Your idea of urine tests for every woman of childbearing age who wants to leave the country flies in the face of the Fourth Amendment. You need a particularized suspicion prior to a search, especially one aas invasive as the one you propose. How do you get around the idea of non-pregnant women selling their urine for samples, observe the sample being given? Who would you suggest be the observer? 2. Your idea of having the man, YOU for example, get off without charges is symbolic of both a double standard and misogyny. Why should the shipbuilder who laid the keel not be subject to the same strictures of the law as she who provides the cargo hold? Please don't say NOW that you would have forbidden ""Mary"" (obviously, thanks to you, not the Virgin one!) from her abortion when you have previously said you aided and abetted her obtaining one when she was barely out of her teens. That's just silly. 3. As to ""personal cost"" the Sherry Finkbeins (look it up!) will always obtain abortions, no mater what laws are in place. 4. Now, as to punishment, just exactly what do you propose? Remember that you must needs get it through elected legislatures, and the members just might not be too keen on the idea of facing their constituents after passing a law mandating the DP (You're the one who calls fetuses ""Innocent human beings!) as the penalty for obtaining or performing an abortion. 5. Just how much of the public purse will you divert from education, roads and bridges, highways, parks, and all the other functions of government in order to pursue your wet dream? Alternatively, how much higher will you raise taxes to pay for it? 6. Bottom line, in your monomaniacal zeal, you are proposing a wildly impractical, undesirable, and necessary solution to a non-existent problem.

That would set the precedent for justifying a urine sample from women of child bearing age. There is no double standard at all. If the woman attempted to by pass the mans part in it by seeking an abortion without his consent, then the responsibility is hers alone. I said that if he helped her, he would be equally culpable legally. And I aided my girlfriend in getting a legal abortion. Had they been illegal, we never would have attempted it. So to attempt to indite me for some perceived crime is crazy. I clearly outlined a plan that I would endorse based on your challenge to offer one. This is a rational plan which would probably cut the number of abortions from 1.3 million a year by 90% or more per year. Your hypothetical was never about legislation or getting it passed. This is my opinion in response to your challenge. More moving the goal posts huh! You take a hypothetical and attempt to turn it into a legislative session of Congress. I answered your challenge to offer a plan to limit abortions in a way that protects both mother and child, and puts teeth into the law for those who usurp the law.
