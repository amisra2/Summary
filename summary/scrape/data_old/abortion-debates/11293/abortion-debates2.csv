"07-29-2008","11293",2,"Archangel","318129","What I marvel at is that you're not even embarrassed to ask such an ignorant question. Because if it's a chicken egg, and if it's allowed to incubate to term, it sure isn't going to be a crow when it hatches. And to be even more simplistic, a chicken egg is still a chicken while it's in the egg. Just as a human being is still a human being in the womb.","Shooterandproud","318197","Thats funny, because these scrambled eggs sure don't taste like KFC to me.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:14 PM","abortion-debates","18"

There is none here, it is just a common term used by the pro-life side to misinform and deceive to get their way.

It doesn't mean that masturbation is a sin. If a sperm is given an egg and a uterus, it will become a baby. If an embryo is given a uterus, it will become a baby. There is no fine line. Yes, of course. Because we all know that embryos with fingers completely proves that they are ""infants"".","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","09:06 PM","abortion-debates","21"
"07-30-2008","11293",2,"Ellen","318302","Oh, really? Because at seven weeks, when the embryo has fingers, it is still completely legal to abort the ""infant"" (your word). Unless life starts at conception, any other possible beginning is completely arbitrary.","sinjin","318304","Beings have sentience. Many forms of ""life"" do not.

"07-30-2008","11293",2,"Another opinion","318312","Then let me ask you the same question I asked Archangel. If there were a hypothetical embryo that suddenly stopped growing but continued living, would you force the woman to continue supporting that embryo with her body? Again, this is a ""hypothetical"", meaning an artificial example that is brought up to make a point. In the case of this example, the question would be - what is the value of an embryo if you take away its potential. If you do not value that hypothetical embryo, then it would be clear that it really is potential that is the critical point. So, would you let her abort that strange hypothetical embryo or would you force her to carry it for years to come? Conception is just as arbitrary a point as birth for determining rights. In my deliberations on the point where human life gets rights, I thought about why, in my view, people deserve a right to life to begin with, and also considered the end of life - when brain-dead bodies supported by life-support no longer have rights. These deliberations made me come to the conclusion that our lives as human beings really start at the start of our mental existence. I did not begin to exist until I started to exist mentally. Before that, I was just a body. Once my mind dies (be it brain destruction or, if one is religious, the departure of the soul), then there isn't much worth to the artificially sustained living body. Since brain development doesn't really allow for mental existence before roughly the beginning of the third trimester (lower estimates put it at the end of the 2nd trimester), then I would limit abortion rights starting from roughly that third trimester, when mental existance could start kicking in.","Archangel","318326","First of all, your hypothetical is ridiculous as what you are describing is a tumor, except that tumors continue to grow. So there is nothing rational about a group of cells that stop growing yet remain alive as it breaks the laws of biology. And why anyone would insist that a woman with group of cells within her that have no chance of growing into a human being, should be forced to continue to carry it is so off the topic of aborting a viable and healthy unborn child as to baffle me. But I understand that you are reaching for straws in order to justify your selfish and narcissistic position. How very magnanimous of you, in your infinite wisdom to share with us the beginning of sentient life in humanity. Too bad your opinion is as arbitrary as the next guys whom you will dismiss because it opposes your position. And if brain function, or a lack of it determines our living value, then why is it that as we speak, we probably have thousands of head trauma victims laying in hospital beds across the country being kept alive on life support? They have no conscious brain function at all, they feel nothing, they think nothing that is measurable at all other than brain waves, yet they are kept alive for years in the hope that they will revive. And inevitably some do. So there is a definite double standard at play here.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:31 PM","abortion-debates","27"

If you believe that an unborn child is deserving of human rights, does that mean that they should be held accountable for their actions like all other human beings? If that's the case, if a woman dies during childbirth and the child survives should that count as manslaughter?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","07:19 AM","abortion-debates","28"

I'll tell you what cake, if you can prove that the child actively and purposely caused his mothers death with malice and forethought, then I would support charging him/her with manslaughter. But it is more likely that the blame should rightfully go to doctor who has a MEDICAL DEGREE and who has been responsible for overseeing her pregnancy throughout her complete gestation period. Can you think of any other example when the patient, which the unborn baby must be viewed as in this case, would be held responsible for a death of the other patient being treated?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:30 AM","abortion-debates","30"
