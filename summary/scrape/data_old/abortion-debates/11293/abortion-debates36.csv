"12-09-2008","11293",36,"Phyllis","335947","Congratulations! You are a moral relativist who believes that something is immoral. Were I a moral relativist, I at least would have the intellectual honesty not to declare that something is immoral. But then again, honesty and lying are equivalent in moral relativism. I'm not sure why you call it phony. It clearly is happening, unless you add to your repertoire of shady views the view that the government is really deceiving us that a war is happening in Iraq. If you go that route, I'm sure you have serious doubts about whether we landed on the moon and whether Hitler really did have concentration camps, all of which, of course, would establish you as a credible commentator. That is not really the point. The point is that you were trying to make the pro-lifers look bad on this forum for supporting measures to enforce would-be abortion prohibitions, all the while believing, not that the tax payer shouldn't have to spend money for a woman's personal decision to obtain an abortion, but that the tax payer should fund such decisions. So it really isn't about the money at all. Nor is it, at the end of the day, about choice. You are a funny chap. In the real world we usually do not let biased judges render decisions in cases in which they have an interest. Whether I have lost this debate to you would be just such a case, such that neither you nor I can truly declare a winner. But go ahead and sing the part. Nobody is really listening to you anyway.","chester","335949","Wrong, as a moral relativist, I have the right to determine for myself, bsed on logic and reasoning, what is or is not moral without input from anyone else, thank you very much. The government IS deceiving us about what is happening in Iraq. the Executive branch is constantly telling us we are there for the good of the Iraqi people when anyone with an ounce of sense knows that this phony war is and always has been about control of the Iraqi oilfields. Since the so-called ""surge"" has had a somewhat positive effect on Iraq, we should pull out now and leave Iraq to its own devices. If the people who live there are not willing to fight and die for their ""freedom"", they do not deserve it. Instead, we keep hearing lies. The rest of this paragraph is simply nonsense. Wrong again, sweetie. It is very much about money and your utterly ridiculous concept that the American taxpayers should have the opportunity to pick and choose which government programs to support. When and if you can get a majority, then you can make the law. That's called representative democracy in action. Since I have absolutely no stake in any woman's choice of whether or not she continues her pregnancy, I am about the least biased judge around. BTW, if no one is ""listening"" (Is there an audio version of this forum?), why do you respond? Is your ""ignore"" function inoperative? Poor Phyllis, left on her stool before the 8th round, just like Oscar de la Hoya.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:11 AM","abortion-debates","526"

You are an atheist who doesn't believe in an ""imaginary being"" called ""God"". Yet you believe in the sentience of a zygote? Those inhumane laws remain in countries still bound to church authority. In Portugal, for example, where abortion is outlawed and rural women abandon their newborn babies in the fields, a local priest was quoted as saying that the abortion laws are the real infanticide. Or perhaps you prefer some off-the-road third world spot in Latin America where women are chained to their hospital beds after committing ""the heinous crime""? Then thrown in prison for 16 years while their real (not imaginary) children are without their mother?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:27 PM","abortion-debates","527"

Unconscious presumes that there was a ""being"" in the first place that was conscious. This is an artificial comparison you are making. Between someone with consciousness who falls into a coma, and a person who has not yet come into ""being"". And is therefore imaginary -- unless one has religious faith or beliefs. I am also perplexed by the contradiction in the view you express here, and the one you state on the religion forum. Whereby you express contempt for any faith in a ""being"" that cannot be falsified, scientifically. That is, your emphatic words, ""imaginary"" and ""la la land"". And suddenly, you have stepped as dogmatically and irrationally, onto the other side. Either way, you do not seem to be distinguishing between empirical evidence and faith. Let alone recognizing what a product of the imagination is or may be. And what factual data is or isn't.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:52 PM","abortion-debates","531"

In terms of the scientific roadmap, we can't go any further than that. There's no brain or nervous system -- no evidence of anything going on with sentience or consciousness yet. Just because something could happen, doesn't mean it has to, or that it should. The factual and scientific is non-theistic. It is compatible with agnosticism, atheism, and various forms of theism. Though not all forms of theism. However, IMO, the view that abortion is a ""heinous crime"" is basically a theistic one. It's absurd for Winston Smith to assert a belief in God as ridiculous -- and then assert that a rationalist view of a human zygote is similarly out of touch with reality. But this is partly connected to a discussion on another board in the religion forum (compatibility of religion and science).","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:21 AM","abortion-debates","535"
"12-10-2008","11293",36,"None","None","None","Winston Smith","336111","I have never mixed religion what you call theism with abortion. I think you are totally confused squeezing apples with oranges and wondering where is the lemonade. I have never mentioned a zygote, or a blastocyst or an embryo. I am against abortion in general but in particular after the first trimester. Why? because after the first trimester the foetus experiences pain. This moral position of mine has nothing to do with theism or the Bible or any source of moral precepts, it is strictly secular. To kill a human being after or before she is born is a crime in my opinion. A new born is also not fully developed and helpless to live on her own, the only difference being that is outside the womb, so is it moral to kill her? Oh, she is sentient. But who decided that to kill a non-sentient human being who is at an earlier stage or her development is OK? You? On God: It is ridiculous to believe in an anthropomorphic God, that only shows how limited our imagination is. The existence of God cant be either proven or disproved and that is precisely the agnostic position : I dont think there is a way to ascertain the existence or non existence of God not to be confused with: I dont know if God exists or not.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:29 AM","abortion-debates","536"

Happily, for us, in the United States, the anti-choice movement will now have to accept that being etched in stone. Sooner or later, Portugal and some of those off-the-road Latin American third world spots, still abusing human rights with their abortion laws and views not unlike your own -- will go that way, too.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:52 AM","abortion-debates","537"
