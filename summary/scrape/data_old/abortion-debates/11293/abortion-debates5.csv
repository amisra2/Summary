"08-05-2008","11293",5,"jyoshu","319193","So, you seriously think no one can have an opinion on the issue of abortion unless they are female??? It's strictly a woman-only debate, and no men should even come to an opinion? That's pretty silly. And what about all the pro-choice men out there??? You do know you're saying they can't have an opinion either, right? Curious ... what if one is a woman, but is born sterile and therefore can't get pregnant? Do they still get to have an opinion? I have to admit I'm a little flabbergasted at your position that men aren't entitled to have any opinion on this issue.","chester","319198","Incorrect, and why you continue to misrepresent my POV eludes me. What I said, and which you STILL don't seem to get, is that no one except the pregnant woman has the right to make any decision regarding HER pregnancy. It's a matter of individual choice, one pregnancy at a time. Did you catch the singular this time?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:14 PM","abortion-debates","62"

One doesn't have to argue black and white - there are many shades of gray.","chester","319202","Not if we are talking about, as some insist, taking the life of ""the most innocent among us.""

I don't appreciate you trying to put words in my mouth. In late term, the fetus is that - a fetus. It is not a 'child"", nor a ""baby"", nor any pro-life term. However, it might have sentience/mental existence and, in my view and in the view of many if not most on the pro-choice side, that gives it some rights. However, those rights need to be balanced with the rights of the mother. This balance mainly leans on the side of the mother but doesn't give her absolute rights. For example, if there is a risk to the mother's life or significant risk to her health, then the mother's rights win out and she can abort the fetus, obviously resulting in its death. That is hardly an equal balance of rights. However, there could be rare cases when the mother, for example, just suddenly decides she doesn't want to have a baby after all and decides to abort the late term fetus - a social decision, not a medical one, etc. There, even with the general weighting toward the mother, the burden on the mother is much less than on the now sentient fetus, so the fetal rights win out. Alternatively, instead of looking at sentience, Roe vs Wade considers viability as the critical point at which the fetus needs to be considered and state restrictions can be applied. Since they roughly come out to the same timeframe, I am perfectly comfortable with Roe vs Wade - except for its vagueness on the outlines for state control in late term. Pregnancy is such a unique situation that one cannot make a complete comparison to the killing of a human in normal situations. Some differences include: 1) Though the fetus might get sentience and mental existence around the beginning of the third trimester, science cannot tell us for sure at what stage after this minimum it starts. So, it is uncertain whether or not it is yet a person (if you assume that person requires sentience). However, most of us would give it the benefit of the doubt. 2) In no other situation is another human as much of a burden on the body of another, challenging their bodily rights. So, there is some aspect of self-defense involved. However, as with regular self-defense, there are limits to what one can do. For example, one cannot kill someone who is about to punch your face. 3) The US hasn't fully explored the definition of personhood and when rights start. It seems to be accepted that born people are persons but there is still a lot of controversy about fetuses. These are just a few examples. This is not a clear cut issue that can be addressed with overly simplified arguements. So, one cannot just make a direct comparison to killing born people - there are just too many differences. --- Meanwhile, I am getting tired of answering your arguements while having you ignore most of mine. Unless you finally directly answer the question I asked you, I will no longer respond to your arguements. Fair is fair. The question was: Besides location, is there any difference between the fetus one day from birth and the newly born baby?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","04:40 PM","abortion-debates","69"

That is not a distinction I am qualified to make. Only the pregnant woman in the position has the right to make that determination, and I will defer to her.

There is no logic behind you stating that you have no qualification to give an answer to an intellectual question. You have the right to your opinion and to have answers to logical question. Your views may hold that you may have no right to impose those opinions on others, but that is separate from having a view to begin with. I think that we are just going to be stuck here. Frankly, I just can't continue a discussion if my arguements cannot be addressed because of an illogical arguement on your part that you are not allowed any opinions. If the debate cannot go both ways then it is not worth my trouble to continue it. I suppose we will just have to agree to disagree and end it there....","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:00 PM","abortion-debates","71"
