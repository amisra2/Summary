Or sometimes they claim someone they exchanged a few words with in Facebook as a ""good friend"" of theirs. It gets quite hilarious really.","antonia","336695","This is also reminding me of a person who makes a racist statement and then says they can't be racist because they have black friends.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:07 PM","abortion-debates","601"

Someone who values these bits of clotted matter higher than he values women...","nononsense","336713","All men are created equal. All life has the same inalienable right to life. A mother has no more value than a child. A child has no more worth as a human than a mother. Are you a clump of cells? Biologically, yes. But that is not the point. The point is protecting lives. One must not be required to be a doctor, lawyer, biologist, sociologist, anthropologist, psychologist, or other professional to acknowledge the inalienable right to lif and defend it. It is a basic principle of morality. An unfertilized egg lives for 12 hours in the fallopian tube before dying.

Now I get it, prostitution doesnt exist, it is just misogynist slander. A racist having black friends ? Gee! Sure! Care to name one? What is sad Antonia, is to kill unborn babies and have the immorality to say that is not a crime. It is not legally a crime but morally it is. What law considers legal one day it may regard as illegal later. The only absolute law is our conscience and our logic. It is very sad, Antonia, that you use abortion as a political statement for empowering women.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:37 AM","abortion-debates","607"

In my home country (Chile) where abortion is illegal, the morning after pill is legal. Why? Because we have a socialist government that declared it an anticonceptive not an abortive pill. Of course there were long and well reasoned debates by lawyers and doctors on both side of the abortion divide. (not like this thread, apart from me, that is LOL) To make a long story short: it was declared an anticonceptive, although stops an already fertilised egg from implanting in the uterus. The anti-abortion camp said it was an abortion for the egg was already fertilised. The pro-abortion camp said that it couldnt be established (no test is required to administer the pill) so it was only a precaution as it also prevents or delays ovulation. In any case it is legal in Chile and I totally support it. I learnt so much about it following the debates in El Mercurio. I bet all those pro-abortions women in this thread have never had an abortion. A typical case of do as I say ...","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:59 AM","abortion-debates","608"

They became a person a human being all of a sudden, they were never an 'it' (to be easily aborted without a second thought?) but always a 'she'.

George Wallace. A blastocyst is not an unborn baby. It is a blastocyst; nothing more and nothing less. But your conscience and logic and mine differ. So neither is absolute. I don't know what you mean by this statement. I believe in a woman's right to choose, mostly as reasoned out by the USSC in Roe V Wade. It sounds to me like you have a problem with women being empowered. Just like men.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:47 AM","abortion-debates","610"

Needless to say he was successfully prosecuted and ordered to pay damages. A doctor is bound by the ethics of his profession whilst treating patients, not by his/her own religious beliefs.

"12-15-2008","11293",41,"None","None","None","Winston Smith","336729","You have a point there. You know I was reading in The New Scientist that racism is another evolutionary trait, men as other animals form groups, for forming groups is good survival strategy and we bond to the group but are afraid and distrustful of strangers which also makes sense in evolutionary terms. But once you get to know the enemy most of us accept the enemy and the enemy becomes us, namely it becomes, if not friend, at least not a person to be hated or derided but to be regarded as equal to us and not a threat to us. Racism is alien to my nature, to me people are simply people, and the same when it comes to sexism. I consider women equal to men intellectually and I have met so many women that were much smarter than I (easy) and the men around them, and most of them less aggressive than men. I can not understand how in the USA racism passes from one generation to the next. Everybody ought to have the same chances in life and be treated equally. I feel sorry about the Aborigines, when my wife and I arrived in Australia decades ago, I remember meeting my first Aborigine while taking my wife to the Womens Hospital in Crown Street for a pre-natal check, You know what I felt? I felt like apologising to him for being in Australia, for being in his homeland uninvited by him. I really felt kind of ashamed, an intruder and also I felt bad for being in a better economic situation than him. I still have a queasy feeling about our presence here. Aborigines are wonderful people. I love Aboriginal paintings, I admire not only the beauty of their paintings but the lyrical stories they tell. I wished we, the invaders have never settled here. I feel that to say I am sorry to them as our present Prime Minister said was the least we could do. I couldnt go back to Chile then and now it is too late for us, our children were born and raised here. Australia is our country and theirs as well. You know that Aborigine I told above hardly noticed me. We were another young immigrant couple in his land, I wonder what he thought of us, did he resent our presence here? I dont know.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:05 AM","abortion-debates","613"

I was just referring to what I read in a women's magazine that my wife left around (written you would say by a woman obsesses with women cheating, and read by women obsessed with women cheating) I also read in a New Scientist magazine that scientists have found that men suspect women of cheating even when there is no reason for it and also that women are better at hiding it than men. According to the scientists this behaviour is a product of evolution for males dont want to care and raise children that are not their own. Why the female of the species cheat? The New Scientist didnt say, so for that you need that women magazine and you being women know it better than I. So why women cheat, Simone, Antonia ?","simone","336736","Why do men cheat?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:57 AM","abortion-debates","615"
