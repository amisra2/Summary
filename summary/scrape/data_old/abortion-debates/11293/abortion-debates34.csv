"12-06-2008","11293",34,"Phyllis","335615","I'm not soft on crime. We should do what we reasonably can do. No one has successfully ended all murder of born people. Doesn't mean we don't have laws against it. To not realize, and admit, that there is a very real logical and philosophical problem in a claim to truth, when the claimant does not believe truth exists, is to simply belie one's sophistry.","chester","335617","Could have fooled us, what with your not even making an effort to determine whether a ""crime"" has been or is about to be committed. You're not even trying in this case. For Shame, Madam ""Not Soft on Crime."" Yada, yada yada.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","09:02 PM","abortion-debates","497"

"12-07-2008","11293",34,"Phyllis","335753","What are you talking about?","chester","335813","The subject is the cost of enforcing an abortion ban. Please do not respond with another ludicrous statement about it costing $.05 per annum. I would suggest that cost should be nil, because if ever there was a victimless ""crime"", this is it.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","07:58 PM","abortion-debates","503"

Abortion on the other hand, has no victims unless complications arise from the surgery, which is rare.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","09:12 PM","abortion-debates","505"

Victimless means ""no victim."" Maybe there's a high percentage chance, but if we only punished crimes when there was a victim, then we would not punish those whose traffic violations prove to be victimless. Don't throw your brain out just because you want to end up with the result that abortion should not be punished. Try making a better argument instead.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","09:30 PM","abortion-debates","506"

"12-08-2008","11293",34,"chester","335462","Still more generalities do not answer the question. Can you please deal in specifics. After all, this is actions we are discussing that involve both the police power and the taxing power of the government. Hypothetical: If the USA outlaws abortion and Canada does not (They always were more enlightened than we.), do you advocate for pregnancy police at the border to check the status of every woman of child bearing age upon leaving and reentering the USA?","Steeeeve","335881","I was specific....but perhaps you want very specific ideas. I am actually flattered you want to know my specific ideas. I always knew you cared. Ok...my specifics for a poster who never answers anything. 1. Police from local level (they normally wear a variation of blue uniforms) and, when needed, certain FBI units similar to the way crimes are investigated today and very similar to the way it was done prior to 1973. 2. They will do so using the same tactics used by the police force in other crimes. This can include wiretaps, informants, people confessing, 911 calls, DNA evidence, the list goes on...perhaps you could watch an episode of CSI and get some ideas! 3. The cost question cannot be anymore specific as it is impossible to measure. What is the cost to police robberies? It depends on how many robberies occur in a given locality. For example if City x has 0 robberies in a year than the cost to that police force is 0. Surely someone as ""enlightened"" as Canada can figure this out...or maybe not. As for your forth question. I would say we should just outlaw visits to Canada. We don't want to run the risk of overwhelming their fantastic universal health care system .","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:48 AM","abortion-debates","510"
