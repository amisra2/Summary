All my compromise says is that those who protest against abortion should have some skin in the game. If they are already responsible parents, one more will not hurt a bit. If they're not, then they should keep to themselves. In the slum where I was raised, it's called putting one's self on the line. BTW, YOUR family history does not interest me in the least. What interests me is the success of my older son, whom we adopted at 4 months. For the record, we did spend the 1972 equivalent of the sum you quoted when we went to another country to adopt him another country, so don't sing that song to me.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:54 AM","abortion-debates","122"
"08-14-2008","11293",9,"Galactababe","320214","Another opinion: Open your eyes. Pro-Lifers, as a rule, oppose abortion under any circumstances. My proposal allows abortions for rape victims and mothers whose lives are endangered by the pregnancy. Continue to allow abortions to be performed in clean, accredited hospitals, but attach fines payable by both the doctor and the patient to the procedure. Pool that money and help pay the medical and legal expenses of those mothers that carry the baby to full term and put it up for adoption.","Another opinion","320289","If you look at the statistics, it shows that the majority of pro-life proponents do indeed support abortions when the mother's life is at risk, as well as for rape victims. There are a large number of surveys that support this. The web site http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm summarizes a wide range of polls on abortion. Just to name a few: The first one listed at this time, from Time Poll conducted by Abt SRBI. July 31-Aug. 4, 2008. N=808 likely voters nationwide. MoE 3.: The question was: 'Which of these positions best represents your views about abortion? A woman should be able to get an abortion if she wants one in the first three months of pregnancy, no matter what the reason. Abortion should be legal ONLY in certain circumstances, such as when a woman's health is endangered or when the pregnancy results from rape or incest. Abortion should be illegal in all circumstances, even if the mother's life is in danger."" Only 10% of US respondents said that abortion should be illegal in all circumstances. If 50% of US respondents are pro-life, that would mean that only 20% of all pro-life proponents would make abortion illegal in all circumstances. Quinnipiac University Poll. July 8-13, 2008. N=1,783 registered voters nationwide. MoE 2.3. It asks: ""Do you think abortion should be legal in all cases, legal in most cases, illegal in most cases or illegal in all cases?"" From ten different polls asking the same question from May '04 through July '08, very consistently only 12-15% of respondents said that abortion should always be illegal. Again, if 50% of respondents are pro-life, that means that at most 30% of pro-life proponents think that abortion should be always illegal and the others disagree. Those are just the first two polls on the list. Every poll I looked at had similar trends - meaning that either all or the great majority of polls reveal the same thing. So, it is clear that all the statistics support my original statement that the terms you propose are already those accepted by the majority of pro-life proponents.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:59 AM","abortion-debates","123"
"08-14-2008","11293",9,"Galactababe","320291","Symbiote: I beg to differ. Compromise is when people who want different things, each give up a little bit of what they want completely to reach an agreement on a solution that both parties can LIVE with. And they most certainly DO own half of the law, each voice is equal to the other, 50-50, 1-1. The unborn don't have a voice. Based on anotheropinion's informative post, it would appear that the pro-Lifers have compromised far more than the pro-abortionists like Chester who can only insist, ""It's my body, I'll kill it if I want to!""","Another opinion","320294","I'm not sure why you think my post shows that pro-lifers have compromised. My post and the included statistics simply show that the majority of pro-lifers views were never on the complete extreme to begin with. Compromise would mean that they would have moved from an extreme position to the current one. Since no statistics show that their majority ever had such an extreme position (no abortions ever) to begin with, then there was no movement in their position which would have revealed a compromise. The fact that pro-life proponents do allow for some exceptions has always been somewhat comforting to me. It shows that they are not COMPLETELY indifferent to the rights of women who find themselves pregnant. The main difference is that pro-life supporters place such a high value on the fetus at all stages of pregnancy that only the most critical reasons are accepted for abortion. As for movement and compromise, the pro-choice stance has always had a far larger variation than the pro-life stance. However, as with my arguement about pro-life compromise, compromise of any sort means giving up cherished beliefs in order to reach a political settlement. The fact that pro-choice views are more diverse doesn't necessarily mean that they are more open to compromise. It just means that there is more room for compromise compared to the current state of abortion rights.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","09:48 AM","abortion-debates","126"
"08-14-2008","11293",9,"Galactababe","320300","Anotheropinion: I accept your research, it's just from a ""laywoman""s perception, it seemed to me that the Pro-Life position was no abortion under any circumstances (3rd trimester, partial birth) and opposed to stem cell research. I happily stand corrected in my perception, but I do believe the RC Church still opposes birth control and abortion, no matter what the circumstances. I saw pro-life support for abortion under critical circumstances as a ""step-forward"". I see no such ""step-forward"" from the pro-choice sector.","chester","320301","Which is precisely why my proposal represents a compromise on their part. If they continue to espouse the position you state above, their compromise is that they each adopt one of those children. If one of the possible consequences of sexual activity is pregnancy, and if one of the consequences of pregnancy is that the fetus be carried to term, then one of the consequences of that position is that the person espousing that position be required to adopt the end product of that pregnancy.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:06 AM","abortion-debates","128"
"08-14-2008","11293",9,"Galactababe","320292","Chester: Oh, but I have a lovely singing voice, dontcha know? Just think, my favorite little Marxist, under my proposal, you would have had your pick of healthy American babies to adopt and you could have contributed some of what you would have spent going abroad to the system that helped deliver them instead!","chester","320302","There you go again, saying ""Marxist"" as though it were a bad thing, and as though it were relevant to this issue. BTW, there is no such term as ""Pro-abortion""; the correct term is ""Pro-choice"". My point was, is, and always will be that a man has no right to an opinion on the topic; it is a matter for the pregnant woman, in her whole discretion only.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:08 AM","abortion-debates","129"

"08-14-2008","11293",9,"Galactababe","320305","Anotheropinion: I guess I'm confused. What part of what I have posed as a solution do you deem inequitable and why?","Another opinion","320311","The time frame and the limited number of exceptions. For you, fetal rights seem to kick in at conception and dominate over any right a woman has to her body, except in extreme cases of rape or risk of mother's death. You would permit no other abortions at any stage of pregnancy. For the pro-choice side, a woman's right over her own body is very important. So, life itself is not enough to warrant the fetus having any rights. Potential is also important but not nearly as important as a woman's right to her own body. For a minority on the pro-choice side, such as chester, a woman's right to her own body outweighs any other consideration. For most of us on the pro-choice side, the only thing that starts outweighing in value the woman's right to her own body is when the fetus gets developed enough that it has the most critical aspects which we value in an aknowledged person. In my view and in the view of many others, this critical characteristic is mental existence. I don't view myself as having existed until I did so mentally, so my developing body did not deserve rights until there was ""somebody home"" in that body. A mental existence cannot start before around the third trimester, so I would allow full abortion rights until then and restricted abortion afterwards. Even then, I would add a few more exceptions - including significant risk to mother's health, and ""mercy killing"" if the fetus is severely deformed, etc. Meanwhile, others, including the justices deciding Roe vs Wade, find viability as the critical point when the state can interfere with the woman's right to her own body. Either way, our main differences lie in when we view the fetus as gaining rights and how much relative importance we put to fetal rights vs rights of a woman to her own body. A lot of these differences seem to be unresolveable. However, one step that I and likely most pro-choice supporters would be willing to make is to clarify restrictions on late term abortions. Some of the main impediments to this process is that the pro-life side would apparently like to slip in wording into any such proposal to allow for a slippery legal slope to outlaw all abortions.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:26 PM","abortion-debates","133"

And that is a large part of the lack of success in finding a compromise. However, the majority of US opinion seems to be somewhere between the two sides, so a compromise based on majority opinion might someday be realizable. I have quoted the same 2003 CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll from pollingreport.com/abortion.html in many posts already, but its conclusion (and the conclusion of identical polls in years earlier than that) was that 2/3rds of Americans support generally legal abortion in the first trimester but that most Americans would make abortion generally illegal in the second and third trimester. If majority held, then that would mean a law that restricts second and third trimester abortions but allows first trimester abortions. Indeed, I believe that France and Germany have just such provisions. This would actually be a position that is between the majority pro-life stance (no abortions except for very limited exceptions) and the majority of the pro-choice stance (only third trimester abortion restrictions). Neither of our sides would be happy, but it would represent a real compromise if it were to be enacted.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:41 PM","abortion-debates","134"

Just vote on it and you would probably get the result you are talking about. These are poor indicators in my opinion because if you ask it a different way you get a different result. For example if you ask it in a way like ""should abortion be allowed when mothers health and life are not a risk (and no rape)"" then you normally get over 50% saying this should be illegal. So these polls really mean nothing to me...furthermore, they are illogical positions as far as I can tell. This is an idiotic stance though....and we have talked about this. Trimester divisions really have no medical significance...they are merely an equal time division made popular by Roe vs Wade. It should be surprised that you get these kinds of results. I'd be willing to bet if you asked a majority of these people, they would think the different in 2months 29 days and 3months 1 day is from a cell to a crying baby. But that is not what we are discussing","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:20 PM","abortion-debates","135"
