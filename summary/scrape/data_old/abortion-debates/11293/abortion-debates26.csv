"11-20-2008","11293",26,"chester","333527","How presumptuous of you to claim to know the mind of ""God"". BTW, I'm still waiting for the cost estimate fo your preposterous plan. So far, all you have shown is a mushroom dream. Just how much will you soak the average American taxpayer to finance this absurdity. And, no, that's not goalpost shifting. You want the plan; tell us the cost. BTW, if ""Spiritual truths"" are absolute, why is there such a multiplicity of religious sects, yours included. Those truths must be opaque to begin with. Don't you think that if there were an Architect of the Universe that (s)he would have left clearer blueprints? OOPS, I forgot, you and you alone are capable of interpreting them, and we all have to follow your interpretation or be chastised for all eternity. What to Saul of Tarsus, Augustine of Hippo, and Calvin of Geneva have in common? They're all dead, worm food!","Archangel","333533","His holy word reveals his character and his principles. Know His word and you can know His will. Receive His Holy Spirit, and you become one with Him. Preposterous plan? Then why haven't you quoted any part of it and pointed out what is preposterous about it? As usual, you make unsubstantiated judgments without pointing out ANY specifics what so ever. BTW, I said this in my original response which outlined my plan: Let the money the government raises from abortions that is beyond what is needed to support the infrastructure, go towards supporting pregnant teens and supporting adoption services. So this plan would be self sustaining. Because men are out of balance with Gods absolute truths. Men start denomination within christianity which cling to certain doctrines as primary, but all of them universally accept the Lordship of Christ and accept the basic gospel message as the source of personal salvation. His blueprint, the bible is complete in guiding us in life. Just because man misinterprets His ultimate truths in some areas, does nothing to lessen the absolute truths which God has outlined for us. So don't blame God because man is hard of hearing. Quote where I ever made that claim! Must you attempt to lie and misrepresent what I believe in order to support your rebellion against my views of His truths? Their bodies of flesh and bone, yes. But they are alive and well in eternity as we take on immortal bodies when we shed this mortal flesh. How sad that you are spending your life unaware that you are destined for an eternal existence. It is your free will choice where you spend it. I realize posting this is a waste where you are concerned, but I post it for those who care what the bible say's about the part Gods Holy Spirit plays in making us one with Him. Rom 8:10 And if Christ [is] in you, the body [is] dead because of sin, but the Spirit [is] life because of righteousness. Rom 8:11 But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you. Rom 8:12 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors--not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. Rom 8:13 For if you live according to the flesh you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. Rom 8:14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. Rom 8:15 For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, ""Abba, Father."" Rom 8:16 The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:15 AM","abortion-debates","376"
"11-20-2008","11293",26,"Archangel","333385","Then why shouldn't men be allowed to create a situation where an innocent person is brought into their mistake, scam, crime or whatever the situation, even if it's a family member and then be given a legal pass to kill that person for the sake of their personal convenience? Because that is what abortion adds up to for women. Just because this is a newly conceived human being, with no voice of its own, it is relegated to the position of a throw away human being and that is just plain ole morally and ethically reprehensible by any standard of measure. For the man it's called murder, yet society has been duped into believing that for women, it's having control over her body. When what it actually is, is giving her control over the body and life of another innocent human being who played no part in causing the so called problem to exist at all, yet is expected to pay for it with his life.","CUNxTime","333549","Men have been giving each other passes on killing each other for a LONG time- innocent or otherwise. But more importantly, the truth is that it is a HORRIBLE decision for a woman to make and I don't care what you think- NONE of them have EVER made it lightly. But all important decisions are the hard ones. I can't imagine what it must be like to conceive (or even to have that potential) a life within myself. But I DO know what its like to have goals and dreams about the future. Some women have goals and desires that don't include having children and for our society to be just they must be able to decide for themselves whether or not they'll have kids. Look back through history at what's been done to women- buried alive with the Pharaoh to accompany him to the afterlife, raped before they are murdered because Allah doesn't permit virgins to be murdered, stoned to death for being raped... they've had a bad deal for most of history. Now we are finally reaching a point of true equality in OUR society, but for a bunch of men to decide that a woman MUST carry a baby to term would set our society only a small step above those I mentioned before. Abortion IS horrible and no one thinks of it as more-so than a woman who decides to have one. However, she's the only on who can make that choice.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:53 PM","abortion-debates","377"

Just because you are alive doesn't mean the government has to protect every little thing you do... To proclaim someone is ""entitled"" to survive is saying altogether some differently... and smacks of liberalism. The pro-choicer's have been trying to evolve a new argument in a strange philosophical manner and it simply doesn't make sense. It is broad, vauge... over reaching. It should say ""if you survive you should take care of your responsibility"" but - no it doesn't, curious.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:59 PM","abortion-debates","379"

One thing though pertaining to equal footing. As I've said, individual responsibility is paramount in society (which is why ours is declining-but that's a different thread). But to have equality of the sexes and thus, a legitimate society, women can't be held to different standards. Rubbers break and diaphragms fail and even the pill isn't 100% effective. Not having sex is the only sure way. But to say that a woman must forgo ALL sexual contact buts us right back into inequality. Furthermore, who's to say society isn't more robust because of the right to choose? We don't know what women have used the service so that they could focus on their career and have gone on to cure some disease. Or who's decided to have sex because they feel that they have the final decision about their body, accidental become pregnant and still kept the baby who grows up to invent a new energy form? How many women haven't died in a back ally abortion because of the ability to have safe means of reproductive control? I don't know what its like to have the ability to produce a baby, but I am certain that any woman who feels she must abort doesn't do so without the utmost sadness and regret. Everyone agrees that Abortions are a horrible choice to make, but the final decision MUST remain in the hands of women or our society runs the risk of being but a small step above those who bind feet and relegate women to a mere step above servant.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:11 PM","abortion-debates","382"

Sorry but the sight of the nation's most powerful bankers and auto execs sitting before Congress saying, ""I am not responsible"" for the current economic collapse and then flying back to their suites in their private jets makes the cry for individual responsibility the height of hypocrisy. Do they realize just how much they sound like the quotes at the end of Alain Resnais' Night and Fog. Jesse Jackson, whether one agrees with his politics or not, was spot on when he said, ""There are more criminals in the suites than in the streets."" ""The easiest way in America to rob a bank is to own one."" Randi Rhodes. And you want some poor teenage kid to accept ""individual responsibility"".

But I also understand that the baby doesn't enjoy giving its life because she doesn't FEEL like she's ready for the the responsibility it requires to be an unexpected parent. This attitude that it's only the woman who's suffering here is crazy thinking in my opinion. You say that I've got to understand that FORCING a woman to have a baby takes the basic right she has over her own body. But what about her need to take responsibility for her irresponsibility in having either casual or unprotected sex? Here are some stats for multiple abortions. Multiple abortions are the norm, not the exception. According to the survey, where the ""number of previous abortions was adequately reported,"" 53% of women had an abortion for the first time in 2000. That means 47% of women having abortions in 2000 were not having their first abortion. How many abortions do women have? The survey breaks it down by state, but stops counting at ""3 or more previous legal induced abortions."" In 2000, Maryland had the highest percentage of women having their fourth (or more) abortion: 16.7%. New York City had the second highest ratio, with 14.7% of women having at least their fourth abortion in 2000. Facts on Abortion. Statistics, Information, Abortion Facts, Statistics, Stats This is the aspect of this carnage which must be changed, by force of law if need be. Multiple abortions doesn't imply that it was a difficult decision at all but is used as a form of birth control.

I'm pro-choice, but i do believe in some sort of regulation to prevent abortion being used as a means of multiple forms of contraception.

I did have one question regarding your one abortion policy, whilst actually quiet good in theory, how would it pertain to all the woman whose second abortion was needed as a result of extreme circumstances? would their be an exception for them? Archie proudly proclaims that he is the most ardent profetallifer on this forum,and you say the policy he proposes is ""quite good."" I still have difficulty understanding how any pro-choice person could be in favor of any proposal which takes the decision of whether or not to continue a pregnancy out of the hands of the pregnant woman. I also have difficulty understanding how anyone who calls him/herself Pro-choice can go along with his proposal. Perhaps you can clear it up for me.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:46 PM","abortion-debates","387"

I have stated many times that i do not agree abortion should be abused by women who refer to it multiply as a means of contraception. That i believe is an abuse of a right. I did not say i agreed with the 'punishment' that was offered by Archangels laws, but i agreed with idea. Every law has regulations to prevent its abuse and so should abortion. Yes i am pro-choice, but i agree their is alot of merit on the sides of pro-life regarding the responsibility of women to NOT get pregnant. Yes accidents and mistakes happen, hence the 'one' abortion policy, but if you are foolish, irresponsible and downright negligent enough to get pregnant a third time (of course and always bar extreme circumstances) then you should be made to accept consequences for your behavior. What kind of consequence? i dont know, but i never stated she would be forced to have the baby, I'm saying some consequences should be enforced. Pro-lifers are right in saying we shouldn't provide a safety net for societies repeated ignorances, and repeated being the base of my argument here. This should not discriminate from a womens responsibility to ensure unwanted pregnancies are not created. So in conclusion, i am not for removing the right to choice, but i do believe that consequences should ensure those who abuse this right.

Quote me ever making that claim at all. Go on, back up your assertion. I was very sternly dressed down once by Phyllis for being willing to compromise on aborting deformed/seriously damaged fetuses which I believed have no hope of a quality life. And Chloe is a more staunch classical pro-lifer than I am regarding certain reasons for abortion. But what really matters here is that I have never claimed to be the most ardent anything on this forum, and that includes my christianity. I may be the most outspoken conservative in many difficult issues, but I have never held myself up as the most ardent supporter of any school of thought. And one more thing; if you can't handle the answer, then don't ask the question. You laid out the hypothetical and challenged me to offer a rational abortion policy and that is exactly what I laid out. Since then, you have never responded directly to it, pointed out one flaw in it, or showed where any aspect of it was unfair. Talk about philosophical cowardice, you define the term as you question another posters integrity for daring to agree with me.
