"11-15-2008","11293",23,"Joel_Henderson","332777","Yes, it seems you never learn, so I have no hope of educating you, and absolutely no intention. Since you ask nicely, the answer is ""Supreme soveriegn authority"", i.e. the fact that governments are established among men to secure their basic rights-- i.e. they not left to individual whims to respect or violate as each pleases, in the model of classic anarchy. States are thus delegated by their People, with the power to to protect these rights through laws . I believe we've gone over this before; you didn't understand it then, I doubt you will now... or ever. It's still true, however: ignorance is never disproof. If you form your own nation, you can name yourself the sovereign and construe the laws however you choose; however that's neither here nor there.","chester","332788","So then you admit that the same ""Supreme Sovereign authority"" to which you would give the power to ban abortions today would be the same SSA to which you would give the power to require them in the future. Sorry, but we do not live in Jean Jacques Rousseau's world of the General Will. Rather, we live in the world of Locke's Social Contract. Now, try taking an equally impotent stab at the other questions.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:24 AM","abortion-debates","333"

"11-16-2008","11293",23,"sinjin","332709","But psychologically speaking, a first trimester fetus is not a being since it lacks sentience. DNA is all it takes to confirm that something is human; like your fingernail pairings.","CUNxTime","333010","This is the argument concerning 'choice' that, to me, rings untrue and is a potential weak point. The whole 'when does life begin/when is it human?' isn't where those that favor woman's rights should stake their claim. I support a woman's right to control her body and I feel that one of the best ways to 'judge' a culture is to see how they treat women. I think that it is imperative to allow a women to control her body, regardless of when life begins, etc... Now I also abhor abortions and I extol responsibility. However, #$%( happens and a woman MUST be able to retain the ability to decide what to do in the event of an unexpected pregnancy. Now, considering responsibility important, I can understand and appreciate time limits and whatnot, because that is humane. But we should call a spade a spade... a fetus is or will be human and an abortion does 'kill' it. Its horrible that it happens, but we have to allow women that right.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:18 PM","abortion-debates","339"

""Most"" men aren't like that and taking that simplistic view is equal to all the things I'm sure you hate about men being chauvinist and simplistic. You're wrong and you should apologize. Boiling most men down to a penis is the same as boiling most women down to a uterus.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:52 PM","abortion-debates","342"

Ignorance of a contract's obvious terms is never an excuse from being bound by them, once one consents to those legal and binding terms via accepting consideration (i.e. engaging in ""sexual congress"" as you put it); and if men think that sexual intercourse with a fertile woman doesn't involve the risk of pregnancy, they're inexcusably ignorant... like you. This creates an implied-in-fact contract between the the man and the woman, with the party conceived being beneficiary and subject thereto (i.e. parental rights over the child etc). Those are the clear and obvious terms, and therefore sexual intercourse is a contingency-agreement between the couple doing the coupling, and any potential offspring resulting therefrom. If they don't like the terms, they can act to reduce the chances, or avoid the contract entirely through simply abstaining from the agreemetn-- but they can't pact for the wrongful death of the unwitting third party, in order for their own personal benefit at that child's expense. Freedom is not carte blanche to do as one pleases, but only in a manner exclusive of the rights of others; and so social contracts are not not strictly about what you want, it's about what you CONSENT to-- whether by your actions or words-- consistent with those rights of everyone, whether pre- or post-natal; a woman's body is not another country, let alone another universe. The price of freedom isn't eternal vigilance-- it's RESPONSIBILITY to others, for what you choose do with that freedom.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:14 PM","abortion-debates","343"
