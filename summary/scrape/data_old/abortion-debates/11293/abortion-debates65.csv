I suspect that, when two pro-choice advocates disagree, it often can end up being an issue such as this - i.e. each one is imagining a different stage of pregnancy. Indeed, it does look like you, Gansao and I do pretty much agree on the general outlines of abortions rights - unquestioned in the first and second trimester, but restricted to certain exceptions in the third. The issue of trimesters (or other such stage-of-development identification) is also useful to bring up in debates between pro-life and pro-choice advocates since I get the strong impression that pro-life advocates mostly have a late term fetus in mind when they argue for fetal rights to life and then extrapolate those rights to all stages of a pregnancy out of principle.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:52 PM","abortion-debates","961"

Chester makes interesting points, once we hand over reproductive rights to the law we loose all rights to any opinion on the matter. What is pro-choice will no longer be freedom to 'chose' at all, but rather to act apon what the law will dictate as choices. The abortion laws in Oz have been amended to include a later term for non medical abortions, but that is today, tomorrow they could criminalize the whole procedure should they see fit. What is a right today could very well be illegal tomorrow. This is the result of the law controlling our reproductive rights, not ourselves. There is no victory to be gained here on either side. Should the law remain silent? this is a very intriguing angle for consideration. It is not an argument for or against abortion at all, but rather an argument for or against allowing the law to finalize and dictate our reproductive rights, whatever they may be.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","07:36 PM","abortion-debates","963"

This is exactly the point I have been trying to make. I only wish that those who would have the government prohibit some types of abortion today have no complaint if at some future time that same government moves to require them.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:52 PM","abortion-debates","964"

There are still questions about the health exception and in what situations that applies, but that does not change the fact that legal structures are already in place for the state having some say in abortion rights. In the ideal world, if we could decide on a law and it would stick, then I would choose third trimester restrictions just from principle's sake since I do view fetal rights as needing to be balanced in in late term. However, we do not live in the ideal world. What is the state of the world (US in this case), then, where abortion rights are concerned? The state is that the balance of justices on the Supreme Court is still in favor of Roe vs Wade but just barely. Though safe during the Obama administration, the scale could just tip the other way in a future administration. This is because of the strength of the pro-life movement. However, if you take away their use of third trimester abortions as a tool to advertise against all abortions, then you are taking away much of the strength of their message and weakening the movement - hopefully, enough to keep the rest of abortions safe, as seemed to be the case in the UK after they largely restricted third trimester abortions. So, even from a real world politics point of view, third trimester abortion restrictions seem to make sense. One more thing to note: In a Democracy such as ours, if the majority is large enough, then the whole Constitution could be rewritten via a new Constitutional Convention. Given current politics, that is extremely unlikely, but the calling of a new Constitution is built into our political system as an option. The bottom line is that a large enough majority can decide on pretty much whatever law they want anyway so we should focus on current US and world politics, not on where a future majority might lead us.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:27 AM","abortion-debates","968"

We are currently only about 5 states away from calling a Constitutional Convention on the issue of the tax code. This has been flying under the radar for many years now. It is not beyond the realm of possibility that such a Convention could just as well pass a so-called Human Life Amendment as it could pass a Required Abortion Amendment. There simply are no rules in either the Constitution or the statutes to guide such a convention. If it fell into the control of the demagogues, we could end up with their scenario.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:59 AM","abortion-debates","969"

Perhaps it might be a point that is debated in the fringe press, but it has never made it to the mainstream press in any truly visible way (ex. more than a couple of stray articles that very few notice). If you think this is a real current risk, then prove it by citing numerous articles from the mainstream press. I do not bother being worried about events that have a negligible chance of coming true. I concentrate my efforts on the reality that we actually currently face.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:03 AM","abortion-debates","970"

Have you ever stopped to think that perhaps YOU could be wrong? Either way, we already discussed this issue of whether people can have opinions about abortion law. Perhaps you are having a ""senior moment"" and don't remember our discussion. I really don't feel like repeating this whole discussion all over again for your benefit. Indeed, you do seem to repeat your questions quite often. If you don't like someone's answer, don't just repeat the question - address their answer. If you don't remember our discussion, it started pretty much around post #861. Unless you have something new to say that we didn't already discuss, then I think we pretty much covered it and left it at a disagreement.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:15 PM","abortion-debates","975"
