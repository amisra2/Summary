The best solution to such a problem is most certainly not to make abortions readily available. Even disregarding the moral implications, that leaves quite a number of health issues (many that can also lead to death) which are not taken care of. Now to the topic at hand. Yes, every woman has the right to survive pregnancy. But every person has a right to life. And the right to survive pregnancy CANNOT overrule the most basic right to life (it was mentioned first in the Declaration of Independence for a reason). Not when the chance for complications for the mother is only that - a chance. And not when other measures can be taken to ensure the mother's life. And most definitely not when the abortion is merely a matter of convenience for the mother.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:20 AM","abortion-debates","5"

"07-30-2008","11293",2,"Another opinion","318312","Then let me ask you the same question I asked Archangel. If there were a hypothetical embryo that suddenly stopped growing but continued living, would you force the woman to continue supporting that embryo with her body? Again, this is a ""hypothetical"", meaning an artificial example that is brought up to make a point. In the case of this example, the question would be - what is the value of an embryo if you take away its potential. If you do not value that hypothetical embryo, then it would be clear that it really is potential that is the critical point. So, would you let her abort that strange hypothetical embryo or would you force her to carry it for years to come? Conception is just as arbitrary a point as birth for determining rights. In my deliberations on the point where human life gets rights, I thought about why, in my view, people deserve a right to life to begin with, and also considered the end of life - when brain-dead bodies supported by life-support no longer have rights. These deliberations made me come to the conclusion that our lives as human beings really start at the start of our mental existence. I did not begin to exist until I started to exist mentally. Before that, I was just a body. Once my mind dies (be it brain destruction or, if one is religious, the departure of the soul), then there isn't much worth to the artificially sustained living body. Since brain development doesn't really allow for mental existence before roughly the beginning of the third trimester (lower estimates put it at the end of the 2nd trimester), then I would limit abortion rights starting from roughly that third trimester, when mental existance could start kicking in.","Archangel","318326","First of all, your hypothetical is ridiculous as what you are describing is a tumor, except that tumors continue to grow. So there is nothing rational about a group of cells that stop growing yet remain alive as it breaks the laws of biology. And why anyone would insist that a woman with group of cells within her that have no chance of growing into a human being, should be forced to continue to carry it is so off the topic of aborting a viable and healthy unborn child as to baffle me. But I understand that you are reaching for straws in order to justify your selfish and narcissistic position. How very magnanimous of you, in your infinite wisdom to share with us the beginning of sentient life in humanity. Too bad your opinion is as arbitrary as the next guys whom you will dismiss because it opposes your position. And if brain function, or a lack of it determines our living value, then why is it that as we speak, we probably have thousands of head trauma victims laying in hospital beds across the country being kept alive on life support? They have no conscious brain function at all, they feel nothing, they think nothing that is measurable at all other than brain waves, yet they are kept alive for years in the hope that they will revive.

Consider this if you will: 1 Prenatal Memory and Learning: our Intelligent Fetuses By Soumy Ana. August 2003- Rajab 1424 -------------------------------------------- Twins have been seen developing certain gestures and habits at twenty weeks gestational age which persist into their postnatal years, such as games that they would typically play in the womb with a membrane separating the both of them. Fetuses quickly learn kicking anywhere on cue. The mothers voice rhythm is repeated by the baby or can be used to stimulate feeding. Babies are leaning their native language before birth from 16 weeks gestation on. The proof is that they prefer looking at people using this language. Researchers discovered the presence of chemosensory receptors in utero. Many chemical compounds, including those from the mother's diet, pass through the placenta and reach the baby in utero while others flow in the capillaries of the nasal mucosa. By breathing and swallowing amniotic fluid, a baby becomes familiar with the mother's diet, including things like garlic. Even before post-nasal exposure to breast milk, babies already know and prefer their own mother's milk. They can smell it! Smell does not need air to spread! Traumatic events can happen at birth and stay with the child its entire life like the fear of adhesive tape if it is linked to pain or fear at the time of the birth. Unborn babies participate in their mothers emotional upset, especially when she is watching a movie. And babies whose mother experienced depression during pregnancy themselves display signs of depression at birth. All of this proves that memory and learning are a normal behavior of the unborn child and the human being. Education begins in the womb and continues in life. Being in the womb, the fetus is constantly stimulated by what is going on around it. The fetus is even more vulnerable because it grows billions of brain cells that are on their way to be programmed for future life outside the womb. We have to think that this growing organism is an individual with its own personality and its own hearing and feeling apparatus. Fetus and personality: After three months, babies show signs of personality; one fetus behaves differently from another in the womb, already showing if it will be active or not, how curious it is and how open to the world outside. Prenates choose the way they are lying in the womb and they decide the time of labor by releasing protein in the mothers blood stream. Many babies presenting in the breach position just before labor have been convinced by their mothers to turn and shift in a way it would facilitate birth for both of them, showing there is a real communication going on between parents and fetuses. There is evidence that babies share in their mothers' emotions via the hormones associated with them. For centuries many cultures have believed it, and for this reason were cautious to avoid the mother any unhappiness or discomfort as well as keeping her pure in body and mind. Prenatal researchers believe that there is indeed some connection between what a mother thinks and how her baby feels. Studies revealed a tendency for anxious mothers to produce anxious babies. Mothers who resent being pregnant or feel detached from their babies are more likely to have children who will have emotional problems. Some children whose mothers were depressed during pregnancy appear to be depressed themselves, rarely smiling, sobbing often or not feeding well. Preborns register not only the mothers emotions but the lilt of her voice and the pattern of her language and of those talking to her. Preborns may be leaning their native language before birth from 16 weeks on, so that by 27 weeks of gestation, the fetus voice already contains some of the speech characteristics of its mother. [1] Preborns also use their memory actively. A study by Donald Shelter, professor of education at the University of Rochester's Eastman School of Music, shows that fetuses can remember wordless tunes, no matter how complex. [2] Certain children can even reproduce the tune if given a musical instrument, without errors and without being taught it before. Twins can be seen developing certain gestures and habits at twenty weeks gestational age which persist into their postnatal years, showing they are actively remembering. [1] In one case ""brother and sister were seen playing cheek-to-cheek on either side of the dividing membrane. At one year of age, their favorite game was to take positions on opposite sides of a curtain, and begin to laugh and giggle as they touched each other and played through the curtain."" [3 ] Fetus and feelings: http://www.ummah.com/islam/taqwapalace/prenatal.pdf Here's an excerpt to another link that shows that fetuses dream, and much more. Science has shown us a lot about the fetus. Whoever deliberately commits abortion is subject to the penalty for homicide. Life Begins at conception, when the fetus is killed, its life is over. Religions fuel much of the intensity of the abortion debate. Twenty three weeks after conception, the fetus begins to dream. It would then go on to live a normal life. Basically , what has been written throughout this essay, implies that abortion is murder. When somebody is killed, a life has been lost. Therefore putting this together, I have come to the conclusion that ending the life of a fetus, is murder. There has never been a human with the same genetic code. Murder, is to put an end to a human beings life. Many laws have been enacted to protect the rights of the unborn, yet laws still protect abortion, an act that infringes upon the most sacred right of all, life. These groups feel pro-life because of passages from their holy texts. During the first trimester, a fetus is considered by most physicians to become sentient. http://www.megaessays.com/viewpaper/31362.html This link deals with fetal pain and evidence that it is evident in the unborn. http://www.ampainsoc.org/pub/bulleti...3/article1.htm That's the problem with the natural man Ao, you all have moral and ethical standards that are based on your personal comfort zones but are never based in a higher good that goes beyond your own personal desires. Your complete values system is based on what feels right to your human, and very flawed perspectives. And there is nothing diverse at all about the pro-abortionists stance. You all insist that a baby isn't human until you can see it, or by some other arbitrary standard that is intended to justify abortions rather than actually face the truth of the value inherent within each unique unborn child. As an example, I will await your combined condemnation of this evidence I'm providing here. None of you will say hmmm, this demands that we reconsider our stance.

Regarding the bolded, of course the medical degree prepares the dr for taking full responsibility for any natural, or expected complications that can arise during the pregnancy. That is the point of medical school, to prepare him/her for every possible contingency. And regarding your comparison of pregnancy to cancer; one is a deadly disease that kills if left untreated while the other is a completely natural condition that leads to the continued propagation of the human species if allowed to continue in 98% of all cases. Statistically the exact opposite outcome of cancer. So why would you use such a corrupted comparative example unless you want to compare new life to a deadly disease? So you're comparing the conscious act of drinking then driving with an unborn child who made no initial decision to even be conceived?

This view is not widely accepted, however, and is rejected by Fitzgerald herself. Prior to 26 weeks, the thalamocortical fibers have not yet penetrated the cortical plate, and it seems unlikely the cortical structures considered necessary for pain are responding to noxious stimulation (Mrzljak, Uylings, Kostovic, & van Eden, 1988). Pain experience is now widely seen as a consequence of an amalgam of cognition, sensation, and affective processes, commonly described under the rubric of the biopsychosocial model of pain. Pain is no longer regarded as merely a physical sensation of noxious stimulus and disease, but is seen as a conscious experience that may be modulated by mental, emotional, and sensory mechanisms with sensory and emotional components. The biopsychosocial concept emphasizes the multidimensional nature of illness, injury, and pain, rather than emphasizing pain as a purely physical fact of illness or injury. Pain has been described as a multidimensional phenomena for some time (Melzack & Casey, 1968), and this understanding is reflected in the current IASP definition of pain as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage (Merskey, 1991). If this multidimensionality is the basis of conscious pain experience, it seems unlikely we can attribute this experience to the neonate or unborn fetus, which is naive to the cognitive, affective, and evaluative experiences necessary for pain awareness. This is accepted in the current definition of pain, which is further expanded to state, Pain is always subjective. Each individual learns the application of the word through experiences related to injury in early life. Pain does not, so to speak, spring forth from the depths of the persons mind prior to any experience, but is gradually formed as a consequence of general conscious development. Interestingly, even those authors who support a concept of fetal pain tend to back away when confronted with the need to explain pain phenomenology. Giannakoulopoulos et al (1994), for example, distanced themselves from any implied fetal pain experience with the statement, a hormonal response cannot be equated with the perception of pain. Lloyd-Thomas and Fitzgerald (1996) have suggested if feeling and pain are properly understood, the fetus cannot be said to feel pain.","Another opinion","318436","Interestingly enough, even your own web site supports much of my view.

Quoting a few passages:","Archangel","318479","So if my link say's something you agree with, it isn't so sketchy all of a sudden huh? Well it also say's this Ao. The New England Journal of Medicine ran an editorial calling on clinicians to Do the right thing, concluding, it is our responsibility to treat pain in neonates and infants as effectively as we do in other patients (Rogers, 1992). Since then, it has become normal practice to assume neonates feel pain, and this has inevitably led to speculation that the fetus may also experience pain (Anand & Hickey, 1987; Giannakoulopoulos, Sepulveda, Kourtis, Glover, & Fisk, 1994; Richards, 1985). Discussion of fetal pain has attracted the attention of the media and governments because of links to abortion practice (Derbyshire, 1999). This year, the Minnesota Senate enacted legislation requiring physicians to inform women of the possibility of fetal pain prior to performing abortions (Minnesota Senate Bill 187). This article evaluates the evidence for and against fetal and neonatal pain, considering the implications for current clinical practice (other than abortion), and the contemporary understanding of pain. Further support comes from the work of Fitzgerald (1987, 1994), who has reviewed the biological development of the fetus and examined the possibility of fetal pain at each stage of development. At 7.5 weeks gestation, reflex responses to somatic stimuli begin, and touching the perioral region results in a contralateral bending of the head. The palms of the hands become sensitive to stroking at 10.5 weeks, and the rest of the body and hindlimbs become sensitive at approximately 13.5 weeks. Shortly after the development of sensitivity, repeated skin stimulation results in hyperexcitability and a generalized movement of all limbs. This hyperexcitability has been interpreted as evidence for the presence of a functional pain system, reflecting an immature but intact pain response with early hypersensitivity to stimulation (Barr, 1994). This view is not widely accepted, however, and is rejected by Fitzgerald herself. Prior to 26 weeks, the thalamocortical fibers have not yet penetrated the cortical plate, and it seems unlikely the cortical structures considered necessary for pain are responding to noxious stimulation (Mrzljak, Uylings, Kostovic, & van Eden, 1988). The evidence for cortical involvement post-26 weeks is enhanced by behavioral studies that have demonstrated focused and organized responses to noxious stimulation that can be better discriminated from other distress responses (Craig, Whitfield, Grunau, Linton, & Hadjistavropoulos, 1993). As with the hormonal response to surgery, the behavioral responses can be reduced with the use of appropriate anesthetic (Fitzgerald, Millard, & McIntosh, 1989). Having established the necessary neurobiology for pain is in place and that behavioral responses to noxious stimulation are present in premature babies of approximately 26 weeks gestation, it is logical to suggest a fetus of at least 26 weeks gestation will respond similarly to invasive practice as observed in neonates undergoing surgery. Giannakoulopoulos et al. (1994) from the Queen Charlottes Hospital in London, England, successfully demonstrated intrauterine needling to obtain blood samples from fetuses at 20 to 34 weeks gestation results in a hormonal stress response. They demonstrated that needling the innervated intraabdominal portion of the umbilical vein, rather than the placental cord (which is not innervated) resulted in increased cortisol and b-endorphin concentrations in fetal plasma. If this group or others can demonstrate the hormonal and neural stress response can be prevented with the use of appropriate anesthetics, they will have mirrored the criteria that have led to the widespread acceptance of neonatal pain. Like any objective source, this link gives both sides of the issue. So your posting the other side does nothing to nullify the fact that evidence exists that fetuses feel pain at 26 weeks or even less possibly, according to the bolded info above. And the point is that if fetuses feel pain, and if they dream, then they have thoughts at some level. Nobody would claim that fetuses experience stimuli exactly as we do as adults. I remember being a child and being so sensitive to hot water that my mother washed the dishes with and soaked her hands in. I marveled at how she handled hot temperatures. But today, my Jacuzzi is set at 107 degrees when the directions recommend between 101 and 103. The higher temp is nothing to me now, but do you think we would stick a baby in that water? The point I'm attempting to make is that if anything, fetuses are more sensitive to stimuli than we are. This is further proven by premies who can't even be touched by nurses for at least 2 months because their nerve endings are so raw until they develop further. Premature babies 'feel true pain' Researchers carried out brain scans on babies Premature babies experience feelings of pain rather than simply displaying reflex reactions, a study says. Experts have never been sure how a premature baby responds to pain, the Journal of Neuroscience reported. But a team from University College London found that they do feel pain after analysing brain scans taken when blood samples were being drawn. They hope the findings will lead to more formal plans for managing pain in premature babies. Lead researcher Professor Maria Fitzgerald said: ""We have shown for the first time that the information about pain reaches the brain in premature babies. We strongly believe there is no justification for babies to be in pain and that more attention should be paid to providing comfort and relief Spokeswoman for Bliss ""Beforehand, although we could assume it, we did not know for sure that these babies could feel pain. ""These babies' brains are so immature that it was difficult to genuinely know that the pain was going to their brain."" http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4875196.stm Here's another link: http://www.cultureandmediainstitute....222175943.aspx","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:19 PM","abortion-debates","40"

"08-01-2008","11293",3,"Archangel","318589","That isn't the consensus at all Ao. In fact current info is accepting the opposite conclusion. Here's an excerpt from the link. Ultrasonographic findings report specific fetal movements in response to needle punctures in utero (Robinson & Smotherman, 1992; Sival 1993). Moreover, a controlled study of intrauterine blood sampling and blood transfusions in fetuses between 20 and 34 weeks of gestation showed that hormonal responses that were consistent with fetal perception of pain, and were correlated with the duration of the painful stimulus (Giannakoulopuolos et al, 1994). Preterm neonates born at 23 weeks gestation show highly specific and well-coordinated physiologic and behavioral responses to pain, similar to those seen in full-term neonates, older infants, and small children (Pain in Neonates, Anand & McGrath, 1993). All of the scientific references I have just made, are from research breakthroughs in the last 10 years. This information was not available in 1973. As a result of this newly emerging understanding of fetal pain development, Anand and Craig, in a 1996 Editorial in the Journal PAIN, called for a new definition of Pain, a definition that is not subjective, and that is not dependent on the patient's ability to provide a self-report. 2. Increased sensitivity to pain in preterm infants Contrary to previous teaching, current data indicate that preterm neonates have greater pain sensitivity than term neonates or older age groups. Several lines of scientific evidence support this concept. http://judiciary.senate.gov/oldsite/jw12198.htm And let's not lose sight of the focus of this info. It is given as evidence of how early infants feel and therefore should be considered people with rights and protections against being aborted. The ability to feel pain is one of the criteria for sentience and add to the the eye flutter of young fetuses that show they dream while sleeping, and any reasonable doubts you are left with should lean in favor of the child just for the sake of humanity.","Another opinion","318611","So, you are now refuting the first link that you mentioned - the one that we both agreed was from a seemingly reliable source, the American Pain Society? Remember, YOU were the one who introduced that link. Do you no longer consider it reliable since it turns out to mainly argue against early fetal pain? As for this new link, it is from one individual's testimony before congress. It does not represent a consensus of scientists and does not address the arguements that most scientists have about the cerebral cortex needing to be involved (meaning that, with late development of the cerebral cortex, pain could only be felt in late pregnancy). Remember, just because some of the parts necessary for pain reception are there, that doesn't mean that everything is in place for the fetus to experience pain. Instead of listening to only one scientist's voice, who can pick and choose his prefered results depending on his biases, I put much more trust in conclusions reached by groups of scientists - where most such personal biases can be averaged out. There haven't been many organized groups of scientists or comprehensive reviews of scientific literature, but the ones that I have come across all seem to support fetal pain only in late pregnancy: Here is one from the Journal of the American Medical Association - http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/local/s.../fetalpain.pdf They summarize: Evidence Acquisition Systematic search of PubMed for English-language articles focusing on human studies related to fetal pain, anesthesia, and analgesia. Included articles studied fetuses of less than 30 weeks gestational age or specifically addressed fetal pain perception or nociception. Articles were reviewed for additional references. The search was performed without date limitations and was current as of June 6, 2005. Evidence Synthesis Pain perception requires conscious recognition or awareness of a noxious stimulus. Neither withdrawal reflexes or hormonal stress responses to invasive procedures prove the existence of fetal pain, because they can be elicited by nonpainful stimuli and occur without conscious cortical processing. Fetal awareness of noxious stimuli requires functional thalamocortical connections. Thalamocortical fibers begin appearing between 23 to 30 weeks gestational age, while troencephalography suggests the capacity for functional pain perception in preterm neonates probably does not exist before 29 or 30 weeks. For fetal surgery, women may receive general anesthesia and/or analgesics intended for placental transfer, and parenteral opioids may be administered to the fetus under direct or sonographic visualization. In these circumstances, administration of anesthesia and analgesia serves purposes unrelated to reduction of fetal pain, including inhibition of fetal movement, prevention of fetal hormonal stress responses, and induction of uterine atony. Conclusions Evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester . Little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques. Similarly, limited or no data exist on the safety of such techniques for pregnant women in the context of abortion. Anesthetic techniques currently used during fetal surgery are not directly applicable to abortion procedures. Another is from the British Medical Association (BMA), referencing, among other things, a full inquiry that was made by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The BMA concludes (from http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/Content...s~Factors~pain ): Interpretation of the evidence on fetal pain is conflicting, with some arguing that the fetus has the potential to experience pain at ten weeks gestation, others arguing that this stage is not reached until 26 weeks gestation (see below) and still others arguing for some unspecified gestational period in between, for example 17 weeks. It has been argued, however, that those who adopt a stage early in fetal development confuse the notion of pain as an experience with reflex or hormonal 'stress' responses. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, following a detailed review of the evidence, argued that there is no possibility of fetal awareness before 26 weeks: 'It is possible by direct means to identify the minimum stage of structural development that is necessary but not that which is sufficient to confer awareness upon the developing fetus. This minimum stage of development, with structural integration of peripheral nerves, spinal cord, brain stem, thalamus and, finally, the cerebral cortex, has not begun before 26 weeks gestation. ' Although debate continues about whether, and if so when, the fetus can experience pain, current mainstream professional guidance suggests that a fetus cannot begin to have the possibility of experiencing pain until after 26 weeks gestation . This view is reflected in practical guidance on the use of analgesia during invasive procedures carried out on the fetus in utero. The BMAs view is that even if there is no incontrovertible evidence that fetuses experience pain, the use of pain relief, when carrying out invasive procedures, may help to relieve the anxiety of the parents and of health professionals. Again, it is more important what the scientific community concludes than what an individual scientist claims, since you will never have ALL scientists agreeing on the subject. If you can find a link that shows the conclusion of such a consortium of scientists from a non-biased organization (i.e. not politically motivated or sponsored in either the pro-life or pro-choice sides), that also addresses the arguements that cortical connections are necessary, then it might be evidence worth exploring.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:40 PM","abortion-debates","45"

You seem to say that the woman should make the choice at all stages of pregnancy, for whatever reason she chooses. That is a minority view even among pro-choice proponents. In the most recent poll I found on the subject (from http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm , a CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll. Jan. 10-12, 2003. N=1,002 adults nationwide. MoE 3 ) it found that 84% of respondence thought that third trimester abortions should be generally illegal - meaning illegal minus certain exceptions. Only 10% thought that third trimester abortions should be generally legal. Assuming that 50% of the respondents were pro-choice, this means that at least 68% of pro-choice advocates also thought third trimester abortions should be generally illegal. Note: Interestingly, the poll also found that 66% of respondents thought that first trimester abortions should be generally legal - which would include a minority of pro-life proponents as well. It should also be noted that a few polls I had seen from earlier recent years show similar numbers - so these numbers seem to be pretty reliable. Why does such a majority of the pro-choice side want to limit abortion rights in the third trimester? Mainly, because we realize that the third trimester fetus is getting awfully close to having all the same characteristics as a born baby and the same sympathy we have for born babies start kicking in. In other words, at late term, one needs to consider two sets of rights (whether or not they are officially labelled at this point as rights) as opposed to one. Two people might be involved now, not just one - both mother and late term fetus.

Pictures of aborted first trimester embryos / fetuses draw much less sympathy.

I do not HAVE a position on ""abortion rights"". As a man, I am not entitled to an opinion on the issue. My position is as it has always been, that this is a choice that must needs be left to the pregnant woman alone. There are those who believe a person exists from conception, such as the RC Church, and there are others who believe there is no person present until birth., such as the US Census Bureau. Because of this, the law must, for its own sake, and for ours, remain silent. Now, try as you might to conflate the issue, that is not a position on abortion ; it's a position on the law . If you believe otherwise, please lay out just what sanction the law should take against a woman who chooses a late-term abortion. We all know that, in order for the government to ensure that its laws are obeyed, there must be a penalty for breaking it. While you are pondering that issue, remind yourself, please, that there are many who consider abortion to be murder, and we also know that those same folks consider it to be the murder of the ""most innocent in society"". If that indeed be that case, any sanction short of the Death Penalty would seem to be highly inappropriate, wouldn't you say?

I don't appreciate you trying to put words in my mouth. In late term, the fetus is that - a fetus. It is not a 'child"", nor a ""baby"", nor any pro-life term. However, it might have sentience/mental existence and, in my view and in the view of many if not most on the pro-choice side, that gives it some rights. However, those rights need to be balanced with the rights of the mother. This balance mainly leans on the side of the mother but doesn't give her absolute rights. For example, if there is a risk to the mother's life or significant risk to her health, then the mother's rights win out and she can abort the fetus, obviously resulting in its death. That is hardly an equal balance of rights. However, there could be rare cases when the mother, for example, just suddenly decides she doesn't want to have a baby after all and decides to abort the late term fetus - a social decision, not a medical one, etc. There, even with the general weighting toward the mother, the burden on the mother is much less than on the now sentient fetus, so the fetal rights win out. Alternatively, instead of looking at sentience, Roe vs Wade considers viability as the critical point at which the fetus needs to be considered and state restrictions can be applied. Since they roughly come out to the same timeframe, I am perfectly comfortable with Roe vs Wade - except for its vagueness on the outlines for state control in late term. Pregnancy is such a unique situation that one cannot make a complete comparison to the killing of a human in normal situations. Some differences include: 1) Though the fetus might get sentience and mental existence around the beginning of the third trimester, science cannot tell us for sure at what stage after this minimum it starts. So, it is uncertain whether or not it is yet a person (if you assume that person requires sentience). However, most of us would give it the benefit of the doubt. 2) In no other situation is another human as much of a burden on the body of another, challenging their bodily rights. So, there is some aspect of self-defense involved. However, as with regular self-defense, there are limits to what one can do. For example, one cannot kill someone who is about to punch your face. 3) The US hasn't fully explored the definition of personhood and when rights start. It seems to be accepted that born people are persons but there is still a lot of controversy about fetuses. These are just a few examples. This is not a clear cut issue that can be addressed with overly simplified arguements. So, one cannot just make a direct comparison to killing born people - there are just too many differences. --- Meanwhile, I am getting tired of answering your arguements while having you ignore most of mine. Unless you finally directly answer the question I asked you, I will no longer respond to your arguements. Fair is fair.

There are a large number of surveys that support this. The web site http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm summarizes a wide range of polls on abortion. Just to name a few: The first one listed at this time, from Time Poll conducted by Abt SRBI. July 31-Aug. 4, 2008. N=808 likely voters nationwide. MoE 3.: The question was: 'Which of these positions best represents your views about abortion? A woman should be able to get an abortion if she wants one in the first three months of pregnancy, no matter what the reason. Abortion should be legal ONLY in certain circumstances, such as when a woman's health is endangered or when the pregnancy results from rape or incest. Abortion should be illegal in all circumstances, even if the mother's life is in danger."" Only 10% of US respondents said that abortion should be illegal in all circumstances. If 50% of US respondents are pro-life, that would mean that only 20% of all pro-life proponents would make abortion illegal in all circumstances. Quinnipiac University Poll. July 8-13, 2008. N=1,783 registered voters nationwide. MoE 2.3. It asks: ""Do you think abortion should be legal in all cases, legal in most cases, illegal in most cases or illegal in all cases?"" From ten different polls asking the same question from May '04 through July '08, very consistently only 12-15% of respondents said that abortion should always be illegal. Again, if 50% of respondents are pro-life, that means that at most 30% of pro-life proponents think that abortion should be always illegal and the others disagree. Those are just the first two polls on the list. Every poll I looked at had similar trends - meaning that either all or the great majority of polls reveal the same thing.

And they most certainly DO own half of the law, each voice is equal to the other, 50-50, 1-1. The unborn don't have a voice.

My post and the included statistics simply show that the majority of pro-lifers views were never on the complete extreme to begin with. Compromise would mean that they would have moved from an extreme position to the current one. Since no statistics show that their majority ever had such an extreme position (no abortions ever) to begin with, then there was no movement in their position which would have revealed a compromise. The fact that pro-life proponents do allow for some exceptions has always been somewhat comforting to me. It shows that they are not COMPLETELY indifferent to the rights of women who find themselves pregnant. The main difference is that pro-life supporters place such a high value on the fetus at all stages of pregnancy that only the most critical reasons are accepted for abortion. As for movement and compromise, the pro-choice stance has always had a far larger variation than the pro-life stance. However, as with my arguement about pro-life compromise, compromise of any sort means giving up cherished beliefs in order to reach a political settlement. The fact that pro-choice views are more diverse doesn't necessarily mean that they are more open to compromise.

For you, fetal rights seem to kick in at conception and dominate over any right a woman has to her body, except in extreme cases of rape or risk of mother's death. You would permit no other abortions at any stage of pregnancy. For the pro-choice side, a woman's right over her own body is very important. So, life itself is not enough to warrant the fetus having any rights. Potential is also important but not nearly as important as a woman's right to her own body. For a minority on the pro-choice side, such as chester, a woman's right to her own body outweighs any other consideration. For most of us on the pro-choice side, the only thing that starts outweighing in value the woman's right to her own body is when the fetus gets developed enough that it has the most critical aspects which we value in an aknowledged person. In my view and in the view of many others, this critical characteristic is mental existence. I don't view myself as having existed until I did so mentally, so my developing body did not deserve rights until there was ""somebody home"" in that body. A mental existence cannot start before around the third trimester, so I would allow full abortion rights until then and restricted abortion afterwards. Even then, I would add a few more exceptions - including significant risk to mother's health, and ""mercy killing"" if the fetus is severely deformed, etc. Meanwhile, others, including the justices deciding Roe vs Wade, find viability as the critical point when the state can interfere with the woman's right to her own body. Either way, our main differences lie in when we view the fetus as gaining rights and how much relative importance we put to fetal rights vs rights of a woman to her own body. A lot of these differences seem to be unresolveable. However, one step that I and likely most pro-choice supporters would be willing to make is to clarify restrictions on late term abortions. Some of the main impediments to this process is that the pro-life side would apparently like to slip in wording into any such proposal to allow for a slippery legal slope to outlaw all abortions.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:26 PM","abortion-debates","133"

"08-15-2008","11293",11,"Another opinion","320379","If abortion were already outlawed in the US, I doubt that the pro-life side would be enthusiastic about voting in a situation where the majority would allow first trimester abortions. Similarly, as a pro-choice advocate, I am not enthusiastic about having such a vote where the majority would choose to make second trimester abortions generally illegal. Both of our sides hope to use the political process to get as close to our views as possible. Polls can be misleading, as you say, which is why one needs to be as specific as possible. People do think differently about the fetus at different stages of pregnancy and the exceptions and reasons they would allow do vary depending on that stage. The poll that I quoted (with 66% allowing first trimester abortions and 84% not allowing third trimester abortions) was also taken in years previous to that with very similar results - which suggests numbers that are stable enough to be significant. where legal and illegal in the question did allow for general un-named exceptions. Since this is so consistent, it is clear that people DO take state of development into account. I even remember seeing a pro-life web site once which tried to convince believers that they should also be concerned about early term abortions since apparently they saw not enough concern about those early fetuses. I agree that weeks would be a better way of delineating state of development. I asked you at the time that we had this debate how you would have phrased such a poll given weeks and you never answered.","Steeeeve","320408","It was up for votes prior to 1973. It was at least a legitimate way to do things. The idea that one would remove a subject from the democratic debate for the sole reason that they don't want it to be there is not a good stance to have. and there are legitimate ways and not legitimate ways. Getting a court to do your dirty work is without a doubt the wrong way and a dangerous way. I have no doubt the same question is consistent over the years but they still are inconsistent in terms of asking a question a different way. Furthermore, I don't define what is right based on public opinion polls. I'm not sure what you are referring to here but I'm not really sure it matters either. My point is that I suspect people don't really have a consistent view. If you show them a picture of a 2 month old fetus and say ""would you allow abortion when the baby looks like this?"" You'd probably get a response by 50-55% saying no (pure guess by the way). Would you not agree? I have no proof of this but judging from the polls I've seen people seem to think that abortion for ""birth control"" is no good. I don't mean to make any claim about this other than that I don't feel people are consistent when it comes to abortion. You can't. People know nothing about the stage of development at certain weeks...I certainly can't ramble it off at the top of my head. My point is that the question about abortion never seems to come down to the basic question of when do we value human life when asked in a poll. Polls seem to reflect an emotional response based on the mothers situation. For example, if you say ""should this 30yr old ugly unemployed girl who has already had 3 abortions be allowed to have another abortion at any time for any reason"" you might get a different response than say ""should this 17yr old girl who is trying to get into college and made a mistake one night be allowed to get an abortion at anytime for any reason"". I often feel the abortion debate is skewed because you can see a mother but not the fetus. The phrase ""out of sight out of mind"" is appropriate. It has often been the case that when some are shown a picture of their baby or a baby at 1-2-3 months then all of a sudden you have a picture of something that is real. This is the very reason some states require an ultrasound first.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:25 PM","abortion-debates","152"

"08-18-2008","11293",12,"Another opinion","320432","I am simply saying that, as a pro-choice advocate, I would not be the one pushing for such a vote. If the pro-life side would want such a vote, then they have to push for it. However, the legitimate way of pushing for such a vote would require that they be willing to abide by the results - which is something I do not think the pro-life crowd would be ready to do since most Americans would support first trimester abortion rights. The US Supreme court is there to uphold constitutional rights. Those rights are there to protect our rights from the swings of public opinion, where the public is not necessarily educated on certain subjects. I, for one, am certainly happy that we have this buffer to pure democracy and that one would need a substantial majority to overcome any constitutional ammendment. As for interpretation of the constitution and which interpretations are legitimate, that is too long a subject to get into here... I do not claim that opinion polls show what is right. However, if they are detailed enough, they do give a good impression of how most Americans feel on a wide range of subjects. In a Democracy, ultimately we might end up having to abide by that majority opinion, even if it doesn't fit in with our particular value system. I have seen quite a few posts where people think very ill of abortion while simultaneously supporting abortion rights. So, what one thinks about abortion and how that translates into their expectations in law are two different things. Where polls are concerned, one has to get a feel for the trends and structure the poll based on those trends. Trends show that state of development does matter in peoples minds. Trends show that certain exceptions (ex. rape or risk of death) are almost universally accepted whereas others (ex. risk to mental health) are less so. Trends may show that most people would not view abortion as moral but, simultaneously, may not expect their sense of morality about abortion to be imposed by law. Polls need to therefore be structured based on a full intelligent analysis that takes all these trends into account, not purely to get a desired result by manipulating wording. That may be a tall order, but it seems that some polls are more successfull than others in acheiving this. Then you are saying that there is no poll that you can think of that would address the question of the importance of fetal development on people's opinions about abortion. In any arguement of majority opinion having its say, then I would think that this development-dependence is such a critical issue that one would have to find some way of finding out public opinion. Meanwhile, unless some other poll comes out with better wording, I find the poll that I quoted, imperfect as it may be, still quite revealing about public opinion on the subject of fetal development and abortion rights. That is one reason why I bemoan the fact that there is so little full intelligent public debate on the subject. It is mostly sound bites from either side. In a full intelligent debate, the pro-life side might present such pictures but the pro-choice side would counter that, for early to mid-term, our gut reactions are not based on reality since there is ""nobody home"" yet in those bodies that people wrongly assume suffer based on seeing those photos. The debate could also bring up the issue of potential, or why it is that we protect human life to begin with, or when rights should start, etc. There are many subjects that could be reasonably debated in the public media but, instead, mainly reside in forums such as this.","Steeeeve","320708","You can say there is a legitimate way to do things and an illegitimate way to do things. Furthermore, who would you think the pro-life people wouldn't abide by the results? They abide by the current ""law of the land"" for the most part. This is fine, but I feel the Supreme Court took this issue away from the people where it had been for so long. To do so was illegitimate. Indeed, which is why I stated above you should have a vote on these things...otherwise you say the minority is above the majority...which makes no sense. I'd say it is obvious that most Americans believe abortion is ok in many circumstances. Which is beyond me...seems crazy. I wouldn't go that far...or rather go any farther. I'm sure development does matter to a lot, but what part of develop cannot be known from the polls. It may just be that people feel it should ""look like a person"" or perhaps have eyes or have a brain....you really only know that at 3months 1 day people feel the baby has developed to a point to get rights. Yeah. Which is hypocritical I'm not sure where you are going with this...I know what the polls say. I'm sure you could but it would be very complicated and I doubt very much someone would do it. I suppose you could interview 1,000 people and say ""when exactly do you think abortion should not be allowed and why?"" and then get specifics such as ""oh well when you can see its eyes"" or something. Even then, you could show pictures of different stages of development and might get a different answer. That actually might be interesting. Show a picture of each week with a brief explanation of what characteristics exist at that time (known) and say when does this human get a right to live (assuming the respondent said development). Well, I say it is very limiting. and, of course, the nobody home argument could be countered by saying it would be the same as a 40yr brain damaged guy who would without a doubt recover and regain consciousness.

After all, they ""created"" it.","Shooterandproud","320761","If thats the way the woman sees it, then thats the way it is. She is carrying it inside her body, and it is feeding off her and will cause her intense pain when it comes out. The fact that you think she should do this against her will is ridiculous. And since she is carrying it, she gets to decide if she wants to call it a baby or a parasite. Is the newborn infant growing inside her body, feeding off of her food and growing? How many times have you gotten pregnant, Galactable? Or how 'bout this. What if you were walking along, having a jolly good day when you were kidnapped. Four men in ski masks push you into a van and drive off while you are blindfolded. They take off your blindfold inside of a mansion, and on the bed you see, lets say, Tom Cruise dying. They forcibly hook you up to a machine that devotes your bodily resources to him. They say you must lie there for the next 18 years, because if you leave before then, Tom Cruise will die. Should this be legal? Now, this is a METAPHOR. This argument can stump a lot of pro-lifers, which leaves them to say ""OMG! how stupid! that can never happen!!!!!"". So, should kidnapping someone and forcing them to devote their bodily resources to someone else, even if they're dying, be legal?

I find that hard to believe. Why is it so crazy for people to hold opinions while accepting that others might have other views? Not everyone expects others to bend to their will. The poll didn't address WHY people thought later pregnancy was more significant than early pregnancy when it came to fetal rights. Nevertheless, it is quite significant that the poll consistently showed that fetal development DOES matter. Given the trends in Europe where most Western developed countries set abortion limits somewhere between end of first trimester and end of second trimester, this shows that such a fetal development-dependent stance is quite common. Either way, I agree the question of importance of fetal development would be tricky to phrase perfectly in a poll. Nevertheless, it seems obvious that the CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll from 2003 that I quoted (along with its earlier identical polls) show that fetal development DOES matter. The reasons why it matters is an important but secondary question to the fact that fetal development does matter.","Steeeeve","320837","You put in ""and"" in there when you probably shouldn't have.

Because it means you are willing to accept what happens and in the abortion debate it makes the least amount of sense because a pro-life person believes two people are involved so to say ""well, let people have their views"" would be to agree you can actually push your view on another person (mother killing child)...which is crazy.

First, any group likes to portray themselves based on what they value. In the pro-life case, you value human life (independent of whether there is ""somebody home"" in that living human body) so you call yourselves pro-life. Pro-choicers value a woman's choice in how her body is treated, so we call ourselves pro-choice. To score political points, opponents sometimes prefer calling a group by the negatives which they view. However, if you are going to rename a group based on what you view as negative, then you have to be accurate. Otherwise, it is simply a lie. From that point of view, the labelling of pro-life advocates as anti-choice is accurate and truthful since pro-life proponents indeed deny a woman a choice of whether to have an abortion. However, the labelling of pro-choice advocates as pro-abortion is innacurate and false since, in my experience, I have never heard of any pro-choice proponent advocating that any woman SHOULD get an abortion. Indeed, most pro-choice proponents would also hope that the number of abortions performed reduces with time but, critically, we would hope that this would be accomplished by fewer women choosing abortion (due to fewer unwanted pregnancies to begin with, or due to better socio-economic conditions letting them keep the baby, etc.). The more accurate renaming would be ""pro-abortion rights"". At least that would be accurate and truthful. Alternatively, one could call us ""anti-embryo rights"" if you want something that sounds negative to some portion of the population. If you think that pro-choice proponents are pro-abortion, meaning that they think that women SHOULD get abortions, then I challenge you to find a quote from a major poster here that suggests that.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","04:45 PM","abortion-debates","194"

No. Sometimes there are unfortunate necessities that one would prefer to avoid but that are better than the alternative - the lesser of two evils. Abortion is just such a thing. One would prefer to avoid having abortions, but sometimes the situation requires it. Pro-choice proponents simply view that, in the great majority of cases, the woman is in the best position to decide - especially since it is HER body that we are talking about. I don't know of any pro-choice proponents who go around saying ""Oh, what a great thing abortion is.."". Pro-choice proponents are certainly not driven by any love of abortion. They are driven by the fear of the alternative - that women with unwanted pregnancies are forced to carry those pregnancies against their will, leading to a wide range of problems both for her personally and for society in general. Similarly, though some on the pro-choice side might disagree, it seems that most pro-life proponents are not driven by glee at seeing women carrying a pregnancy against their will, they are largely driven by the repulsion and sympathy at seeing embryos and fetuses that they value aborted.

I also believe that many people are pro-choice because they do not believe an abortion to be as important a date as you claim - instead, they believe that there is a very long causal chain from pre-intercourse to post-birth, and that breaking that chain before a foetus develops mental awareness (and even potential independance) is valid wherever that break may be - be it a close-to-deadline abortion, or using (effective) contaception.

Here is the foundation upon which Planned Parenthood was built. Now just watch shooter deny reality and attempt to defend against this documented history of what he supports so staunchly and easily. Here's page 1 of this disgusting history of what this racist woman and Planned Parenthood represents. (This article first appeared in the January 20, 1992 edition of Citizen magazine) How Planned Parenthood Duped America At a March 1925 international birth control gathering in New York City, a speaker warned of the menace posed by the ""black"" and ""yellow"" peril. The man was not a Nazi or Klansman; he was Dr. S. Adolphus Knopf, a member of Margaret Sanger's American Birth Control League (ABCL), which along with other groups eventually became known as Planned Parenthood. Sanger's other colleagues included avowed and sophisticated racists. One, Lothrop Stoddard, was a Harvard graduate and the author of The Rising Tide of Color against White Supremacy. Stoddard was something of a Nazi enthusiast who described the eugenic practices of the Third Reich as ""scientific"" and ""humanitarian."" And Dr. Harry Laughlin, another Sanger associate and board member for her group, spoke of purifying America's human ""breeding stock"" and purging America's ""bad strains."" These ""strains"" included the ""shiftless, ignorant, and worthless class of antisocial whites of the South."" Not to be outdone by her followers, Margaret Sanger spoke of sterilizing those she designated as ""unfit,"" a plan she said would be the ""salvation of American civilization.: And she also spike of those who were ""irresponsible and reckless,"" among whom she included those "" whose religious scruples prevent their exercising control over their numbers."" She further contended that ""there is no doubt in the minds of all thinking people that the procreation of this group should be stopped."" That many Americans of African origin constituted a segment of Sanger considered ""unfit"" cannot be easily refuted. While Planned Parenthood's current apologists try to place some distance between the eugenics and birth control movements, history definitively says otherwise. The eugenic theme figured prominently in the Birth Control Review, which Sanger founded in 1917. She published such articles as ""Some Moral Aspects of Eugenics"" (June 1920), ""The Eugenic Conscience"" (February 1921), ""The purpose of Eugenics"" (December 1924), ""Birth Control and Positive Eugenics"" (July 1925), ""Birth Control: The True Eugenics"" (August 1928), and many others. These eugenic and racial origins are hardly what most people associate with the modern Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), which gave its Margaret Sanger award to the late Dr. Martin Luther King in 1966, and whose current president, Faye Wattleton, is black, a former nurse, and attractive. Though once a social pariah group, routinely castigated by religious and government leaders, the PPFA is now an established, high-profile, well-funded organization with ample organizational and ideological support in high places of American society and government. Its statistics are accepted by major media and public health officials as ""gospel""; its full-page ads appear in major newspapers; its spokespeople are called upon to give authoritative analyses of what America's family policies should be and to prescribe official answers that congressmen, state legislator and Supreme Court justiices all accept as ""social orthodoxy."" Blaming Families Sanger's obsession with eugenics can be traced back to her own family. One of 11 children, she wrote in the autobiographical book, My Fight for Birth Control, that ""I associated poverty, toil, unemployment, drunkenness, cruelty, quarreling, fighting, debts, jails with large families."" Just as important was the impression in her childhood of an inferior family status, exacerbated by the iconoclastic, ""free-thinking"" views of her father, whose ""anti-Catholic attitudes did not make for his popularity"" in a predominantly Irish community. The fact that the wealthy families in her hometown of Corning, N.Y., had relatively few children, Sanger took as prima facie evidence of the impoverishing effect of larger families. The personal impact of this belief was heightened 1899, at the age of 48. Sanger was convinced that the ""ordeals of motherhood"" had caused the death of her mother. The lingering consumption (tuberculosis) that took her mother's life visited Sanger at the birth of her own first child on Nov. 18, 1905. The diagnosis forced her to seek refuge in the Adirondacks to strengthen her for the impending birth. Despite the precautions, the birth of baby Grant was ""agonizing,"" the mere memory of which Sanger described as ""mental torture"" more than 25 years later. She once described the experience as a factor ""to be reckoned with"" in her zealous campaign for birth control. From the beginning, Sanger advocacy of sex education reflected her interest in population control and birth prevention among the ""unfit."" Her first handbook, published for adolescents in 1915 and entitled, What Every Boy and Girl Should Know, featured a jarring afterword: It is a vicious cycle; ignorance breeds poverty and poverty breeds ignorance. There is only one cure for both, and that is to stoop breeding these things. Stop bringing to birth children whose inheritance cannot be one of health or intelligence. Stop bringing into the world children whose parents cannot provide for them. To Sanger, the ebbing away of moral and religious codes over sexual conduct was a natural consequence of the worthlessness of such codes in the individual's search for self-fulfillment. ""Instead of laying down hard and fast rules of sexual conduct,"" Sanger wrote in her 1922 book Pivot of Civilization, ""sex can be rendered effective and valuable only as it meets and satisfies the interests and demands of the pupil himself."" Her attitude is appropriately described as libertinism, but sex knowledge was not the same as individual liberty, as her writings on procreation emphasized. The second edition of Sanger's life story, An Autobiography, appeared in 1938. There Sanger described her first cross-country lecture tour in 1916. Her standard speech asserted seven conditions of life that ""mandated"" the use of birth control: the third was ""when parents, though normal, had subnormal children""; the fourth, ""when husband and wife were adolescent""; the fifth, ""when the earning capacity of the father was inadequate."" No right existed to exercise sex knowledge to advance procreation. Sanger described the fact that ""anyone, no matter how ignorant, how diseased mentally or physically, how lacking in all knowledge of children, seemed to consider he or she had the right to become a parent."" Religious Bigotry In the 1910's and 1920's, the entire social orderreligion, law, politics, medicine, and the mediawas arrayed against the idea and practice of birth control. This opposition began in 1873 when an overwhelmingly Protestant Congress passed, and a Protestant president signed into law, a bill that became known as the Comstock Law, named after its main proponent, Anthony Comstock. The U.S. Congress classified obscene writing, along with drugs, and devices and articles that prevented conception or caused abortion, under the same net of criminality and forbade their importation or mailing. Sanger set out to have such legislation abolished or amended. Her initial efforts were directed at the Congress with the opening of a Washington, D.C., office of her American Birth Control League in 1926. Sanger wanted to amend section 211 of the U.S. criminal code to allow the interstate shipment and mailing of contraceptives among physicians, druggists and drug manufacturers. http://www.blackgenocide.org/sanger.html","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:22 PM","abortion-debates","236"

"08-25-2008","11293",17,"None","None","None","Another opinion","321359","Though I haven't been really following this latest interchange in any detail (I generally stop listening once conversations turn to mutual flaming), I did notice a couple of tangential issues come up that are worth addressing. One is the single child policy in China. I had a chance to travel to China in 2006 and this issue came up in conversation. As I understand it, women who get pregnant while already having a child are not directly forced to get an abortion. However, there are large fines associated with having more than one child and the second child is discriminated against by the system - in school, etc. So, the difficulties associated with having more than one child effectively forces most families to opt for abortion. I have mixed feelings about the one child policy. I would love families to be able to have full choice about their reproductive rights. However, I can see that, on a societal level, the overpopulation that would result in China would have many bad reprecusions. According to their statistics, the one child policy has resulted in a population that is 300 to 400 million people smaller than it would have been if this policy had not been put into place. Chinese have traditionally had large families since children were expected to support their parents in old age. Because of this expectation of support, there has been an unintended consequence of the one child policy where female fetuses have been disproportionally aborted compared to male fetuses since sons are thought, usually accurately, to be better providers for aging parents than daughters (except if daughters marry rich or have good careers of their own). The country does not have a social security system as we do. People have to largely fend for themselves. So, it is not an easy situation there with no easy answers. As for communism, my folks immigrated to the US from communist Poland in the 60s so I have had fairly direct feedback about communist systems, as they had turned out in reality. Though the poorest of the poor might find some benefit in communist systems, the great majority of upper lower class, middle class, and rich certainly live better lives under the restrained forms of Capitalism prevalent in the West. I would think that the main problems with Communism are that the system fails to give people incentives to work hard since you get the same salary and career benefits whether you are a slacker or a hard worker - inspiring most people to be slackers. Also, there seems to be a lack of what I would call ""corruption control mechanisms"". Essentially, there was little if any accountability for failed programs - only political accountability for criticising the wrong person or even criticising the system in general. That is a recipe for corrupt oligarchies and essentially fascist systems. However, many conservatives seem to equate the social democracies that one finds in modern day Europe with communism, which is absurd. Countries such as Sweden are democracies but much of their industry is state owned and the state has more control over the practices of industry. The average salaries are quite high, and people apparently do feel a sense of freedom just as we do. I have heard that, compared to the US, whether or not such a system is beneficial depends on your socio-economic standing. The taxes are high but you get a lot of benefits from those taxes - safety nets, social programs, etc. There is a smaller spread in salaries - which tends to benefit the poorer to central middle class. However, it is not as beneficial a place to live if one is ambitious or has an entreprenereal spirit. I knew a successful Swedish engineer who stayed in the US after graduate schoold for precisely the reason that he knew that, at his level, he could be more successful in the US. So, social democracies have both advantages and disadvantages. Anyway, those are a few thoughts on some of the issues brought up here. Rarely can one put one line answers to issues and be accurate. Even these paragraphs are simplifications of the real situation. I just decided to include these to demonstrate that sound-byte answers are just not suited to reality - which is almost always much more complex.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:00 AM","abortion-debates","253"

Also, what specific internal corruption control mechanisms does your version of communism support? Again, it depends on ones socio-economic standing. Most people probably are happier under such a system. However, it is not as beneficial to people who are more ambitious or who have an entreprenerial spirit - there is just more beaurocracy and difficulties for people who wish to push themselves to exceed far above their peers. So, the system has a tendency to have a flattening effect when it comes to socio-economic differences, which is fine for most people who wouldn't rise above the crowd anyway, but does have its disadvantages, as were outline by the Swedish engineer who I knew who immigrated here to the US.","chester","321370","I think that both questions can be answered in the same manner.

As I have understood it from my limited reading of history, it was fear of a full change to socialism that made the elites give in to the most critical changes needed to make capitalism palatable to the masses of poor workers - where many of these changes were socialist ideas. Indeed, there was a similar trend in the 19th century when it was the fear of uprisings such as had happened in the French revolution and later smaller upheavals throughout Europe that convinced the elites that they had to give in to at least some of the democratic aspirations or risk losing all their power - Bismark was particularly adept at such transformations. Either way, that history is now past. What we face today is restrained capitalism vs other alternatives. You fail to state any clear advantage between communism and the current version of capitalism, with all of its restraints benefiting employees (8 hour work day, employer subsidized health care, etc.). Again, communism showed itself to be a failed system in comparison to this current version of capitalism. If you wish to present a better version of communism than the one that failed, then you need to address those points which made the first version fail. Specifically, you need to address the two points I brought up: 1) What incentives would exist for people to work harder on their jobs than their friends and neighbors? 2) What specific internal corruption control mechanisms does your version of communism support?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:09 PM","abortion-debates","260"

The price of freedom isn't eternal vigilance-- it's RESPONSIBILITY to others, for what you choose do with that freedom.","Another opinion","333198","Though I am jumping into the discussion here and have not followed it from the beginning, I need to address yours points. I get the impression that you view women as having a responsibility over their offspring from the point of conception on - i.e. not only in late term. I would contest this. Up to around the beginning of the third trimester, the embryo / fetus is nothing but a developing body with ""nobody home"" - i.e. no mental existence (no thoughts, no emotions, no sense of self, no feelings of pain, no ability to experience their environment - nothing). I do not see any reason to have forced responsibility over such a living mindless body. As at the end of life when the mind can be gone from accident or illness, it is not worth keeping the empty living body artificially alive. It is the person who effectively resides in the body (through mental brain function or belief in a soul) who we value - not the body itself. From discussions with those on the pro-life side, it seems clear that the thing that is valued in the embryo / early fetus is not as much what it currently IS but what it WILL BECOME. What it currently IS is only valued because it is on its way to becoming something / someone that we do value. The hypothetical question to test this was how much is such a life valued if it suddenly stopped growing so that it would never reach the stage of lifeform that has emotions, thoughts, feelings of pain, etc. Apparently, its value dropped significantly (at least that was the answer for those not afraid of anwering that question). However, once there is ""somebody home"" in that body, then I would agree that you now have another person whose rights should be taken into account. Biologically, neurologically speaking, such mental functions can't start before around the beginning of the third trimester. So, I support more clearly legally restricting third trimester abortion rights to the limited exceptions (mother's life, significant risk to health, mercy killing deformed fetuses, etc.). Then it makes sense to speak of an ""other"" to whom one has responsibilities. One last point. I have heard a few pro-life advocates make the same arguement you do that pro-choice supporters make their arguements simply out of a ""defense rationalization"", where you think they really do agree that they are doing wrong. You don't realize that they actually generally do believe all of what they say. As a general rule of thumb, I tend to think that most people believe what they say. However, many people have holes or inconsistencies in their thinking that one can highlight if one can tell what those holes or inconsistencies are. I have found that the best way to discover such holes and inconsistencies in reasoning is to see what type of questions people make an effort at avoiding to answer. Where the pro-life camp is concerned, I find that a major hole in their reasoning is to highlight what the embryo / early fetus is AT THAT MOMENT , independent of what it will become in the future. This has highlighted that it is only valued by what it WILL BECOME, not for what it currently IS. As for the extreme pro-choice side that would allow abortions at all times for any reason (note: they represent a minority of the pro-choice side), then they get very uncomfortable when you question them about the difference in a fetus one day from birth vs a newborn baby and force them to answer the question of whether or not they would allow a birth-minus-one-day abortion for any reason. So, instead of jumping to wrong assumptions about the reasoning of pro-choice supporters, search for holes in logic and reasoning that you can exploit. That would be far more effective than your false assumptions that they are harboring guilt.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","04:31 PM","abortion-debates","347"

I do agree that in the third trimester of a pregnancy the rights of another individual comes into play. If a woman does not want to be pregnant, she should have terminated her pregnancy long before that point. In the third trimester, I believe that the only good reason to terminate a pregnancy would be the endangerment of the pregnant woman's life, health, or if there were sound evidence that the fetus was profoundly disabled and would survive for only a short and torturous while, or would be profoundly disabled and traumatized throughout life -- able to survive only by extreme and intrusive and painful medical intervention.

I do agree that in the third trimester of a pregnancy the rights of another individual comes into play. If a woman does not want to be pregnant, she should have terminated her pregnancy long before that point. In the third trimester, I believe that the only good reason to terminate a pregnancy would be the endangerment of the pregnant woman's life, health, or if there were sound evidence that the fetus was profoundly disabled and would survive for only a short and torturous while, or would be profoundly disabled and traumatized throughout life -- able to survive only by extreme and intrusive and painful medical intervention. One must also consider who would be responsible for the maintenance of such a profoundly disabled individual.

Most people are not up to it. That would leave them wards of the state - where I would hope that the pro-life crowd would not be so tax-averse as to cut programs supporting such children, or would otherwise be willing to support them through charities.

And the issues you raise show that much would need to be considered to fine tune a complete and fair policy.

By that I mean, that if we researched the levels of juvenile delinquency in the US now, or any other childhood malady; and I don't know those numbers. But just for the sake of argument, let's say it's at 0.5% per hundred thousand; then add that 1.3 million lives saved and apply the same percentages to them in every category you consider based on real world stats. Most all of the women who are getting these abortions are working, productive, intelligent vital members of society with families and support systems available to them, and even if they're poor or teens.

You should know that the estimates of 5,000 to 10,000 deaths a year given by the pro-abortion advocates of the time was a complete and total lie. And that has been confirmed by the source of that lie as he admits that he knew he was being deceptive for the sake of the movement he was committed to. Here are the facts of the history of the actual numbers of women who died receiving illegal abortions prior to Roe's passage. Before Roe v. Wade, did 10,000 women a year die from illegal abortions? May 28, 2004 Dear Cecil: Boston Globe columnist Ellen Goodman recently wrote, ""After all, those of us who remember when birth control was illegal and when 10,000 American women a year died from illegal abortions don't have to imagine a world without choices. We were there."" I write a blog about life after abortion, and one of my co-bloggers says that the claim of 10,000 deaths is well known to be an urban legend. However, Ellen Goodman is a famous journalist, and she clearly believes that it is the truth. Is it? Emily of After Abortion, via e-mail Dear Emily: No. Establishing exactly how many women died due to botched illegal abortions is obviously impossible, since many of these deaths likely weren't reported as such. However, even a generous reading of the statistics we do have indicates that Goodman is off by a factor of ten; a stickler might say she blew it by a ratio of 250 to 1. It's not like this is a news flash, either. A reasonable approximation of the annual total in the 60s has been public knowledge for 35 years. To be fair, the number Goodman uses is consistent with estimates that were widely cited prior to the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973. But some say those numbers were knowingly inflated by proponents of abortion rights. The star witness for this claim is Bernard Nathanson, a former abortion clinic doctor who in 1969 cofounded the group now called NARAL Pro-Choice America (the letters originally stood for National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws). Since Roe, though, he's turned against his former comrades he made the highly controversial 1984 antiabortion film The Silent Scream and has authored several books describing his conversion on this issue and critiquing the abortion-rights movement. In Aborting America (1979) Nathanson writes: ""In NARAL we generally emphasized the drama of the individual case, not the mass statistics, but when we spoke of the latter it was always '5,000 to 10,000 deaths a year.' I confess that I knew the figures were totally false, and I suppose the others did too if they stopped to think of it. But in the 'morality' of our revolution, it was a useful figure, widely accepted, so why go out of our way to correct it with honest statistics?"" (Emphasis is his.) Better late than never. For 1972, the last full year before Roe, the federal Centers for Disease Control reported that 39 women died due to illegal abortion. (The death total for all abortions, including legal ones, was 88.) That figure is low, thanks to underreporting, but in any case the number of deaths had been dropping sharply for the previous few years. A statistic perhaps more typical of the pre-Roe era was reported in a 1969 Scientific American article cowritten by Christopher Tietze, a senior fellow with the Population Council: ""The National Center for Health Statistics listed 235 deaths from abortion in 1965. Total mortality from illegal abortions was undoubtedly larger than that figure, but in all likelihood it was under 1,000."" Had the number been higher in still earlier years? Yes. Tietze comments in his article that ""some 30 years ago [i.e., around 1940], it was judged that such deaths might number 5,000 to 10,000 per year."" He gives no source, but if we turn to W. Cates et al (""Trends in national abortion mortality, United States, 1940-1974,"" Advances in Planned Parenthood, 1976), we find that 1,682 abortion-related deaths were officially reported in 1940. If we guess that this figure represents roughly a quarter of actual mortality due to illegal abortion, we get 6,800 deaths somewhere below the middle of the range given by Tietze, whereas Ellen Goodman's number is at the very top. But that was in 1940, remember. I didn't Google Ms. Goodman to determine when she was born; I'll just say that if she's pushing 80, as her statement ""those of us who remember when 10,000 American women a year died from illegal abortions"" would imply, she's remarkably well preserved. None of this argues for or against abortion, but the claim that legalization has prevented the deaths of thousands upon thousands of women doesn't hold up. Roe v. Wade saved some lives, but the numbers were small reported deaths due to illegal abortion declined from 39 in 1972 to 5 in 1974. The biggest factor in reducing abortion mortality was undoubtedly the overall improvement in prenatal and obstetrical care after World War II. The rate of pregnancy-related deaths from causes other than abortion dropped at roughly the same pace as the abortion death rate from 1940 through 1974 (though abortion-related deaths did decline faster after 1965, which Cates attributes largely to advances in contraception and the state-by-state relaxation or repeal of abortion laws). Self-induced and back-alley abortions were becoming a thing of the past long before Roe: sex researcher Alfred Kinsey estimated in the 1950s that around 85 percent of illegal abortions were performed by physicians, even if the physicians weren't all in good standing. The fact is that prior to legalization abortion had become relatively safe and easy to obtain for those who could afford it. Studies done at the time show that the risks were borne disproportionately by those who couldn't, mostly minorities. Were abortion to be recriminalized, that would likely be the case again. The Straight Dope: Before <em>Roe</em> v. <em>Wade</em>, did 10,000 women a year die from illegal abortions? Now, notice that [I]For 1972, the last full year before Roe, the federal Centers for Disease Control reported that 39 women died due to illegal abortion. (The death total for all abortions, including legal ones, was 88.)/I] So the fact is that 39 women died from illegal abortions but 10 more than that, or 49 women who received LEGAL abortions that year died. More died from legal than illegal. So the problem with the so called facts which are thrown around by the abortion proponents and often cited by honestly sincere people are fallacious and blatantly dishonest since they were lying in order to accomplish their agenda. Just some food for thought for your consideration.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:01 PM","abortion-debates","399"

Likewise, abortion makes women ""equal"" by letting them thus EARN as much money as men, by not being tied down via unwanted pregnancies and kids, and related expenses; in addition they can earn MORE by hooking a rich guy (since 90% of women will ONLY marry men who earn more than they do) rather than being a dirt-poor single mom. When women ""strike the jackpot"" financially with a rich husband, they chiefly just want to settled down and have kids. IT'S THE MONEY! Meanwhile, socialist countries want to save money by skimping on scant resources, so they simply ""re-define"" when life begins, ""Playing God"" as a matter of convenience in order to avoid spending vast sums on saving nascent children-- since those who would have been aborted, end up costing the most in various public services, and hence are voted as unfit to live, with every problem-pregnancy being aborted-- whether for financial reasons or medical.

Also, why doesn't it apply to Peta who also throws red paint which represents blood on women wearing furs? Again, we see inconsistency in the laws which limit one group while giving others a pass using the same tactics. To protect women and abortion-clinic doctors and staff, Congress in 1994 passed a law called F.A.C.E. the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (18 U.S.C., Sect. 248). The law prohibits injuring, intimidating or interfering with any person who obtains or provides reproductive health services. It provides for civil and criminal penalties against violators. The law has survived several First Amendment challenges. Sometimes courts will pass a special injunction providing for even greater control over anti-abortion demonstrators.

And Hitler's Final Solution set a precedent for ethnic cleansing in Germany too-- your point? Not approvingly; actually every state is sovereign by law, but the federal government illegally USURPED authority over the states during the antebellum era. That's why we had the World Wars, socialism, the Great Depression, the New Deal the Cold War,-- and now the War on Terror. Socialism was disproven as a political sophistry in ancient Greece c. over 2400 years ago, but came about in the 20th century due to American globalism resulting from this bellum-era usurpation and consequent destabilization; elective abortion was also prohibited about 400 B.C. under Hippocrates, but this is simply a co-morbid barbarism.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","04:37 PM","abortion-debates","464"

To wit, from the article I mentioned earlier on Portugal, By contrast, in Spain, which has a similar law, the legislation is liberally interpreted, and abortions are routinely performed. That has created a lucrative market for legal abortions in Spain for those Portuguese women who can afford to travel there. The Portuguese newspapers carry advertisements every day of clinics over the border in Spain offering voluntary treatment of pregnancy. Even within the clergy, there are divisions. On Thursday, a 79-year-old priest, the Rev. Manuel Costa Pinto, from the small town of Lamego, stunned the church hierarchy in declaring that he planned to vote yes. I dont take it lightly, he said of his decision, according to the news agency Lusa. I know my responsibility as a Catholic and as a priest. Calling the current law the real infanticide, he described the crisis of women who are too poor and too afraid to terminate their pregnancies illegally. They put their babies into a bag and throw them into the garbage, into the gutters or abandon them in the middle of the fields, he said. http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/11/wo...pagewanted=all Here's a group putting research together on infanticide in Latin America, Call for Papers LASA 2009: ""Abortion and Infanticide in Latin America"" Best to have abortion legal, safe, easily available, and rarer.

I couldnt go back to Chile then and now it is too late for us, our children were born and raised here. Australia is our country and theirs as well.

A pregnancy is a child in its womb. It is not a disease. It is not a leach. It is in its rightful place growing as it should. No medical terms are necessary to define it.

Abortion is when a person forces the cervix open prematurely and scraps, suctions and removes the baby prematurely. Sometimes birth happens surgically when a baby is unable to be born in the normal way. Sometimes premature babies are born surgically and then killed, and that is one form of the so-called abortion. Killing the child is the goal of the abortion. But it is not avoiding birth. Abortion is giving birth prematurely to a dead baby. It entails the removal of the childs arms, legs, head or brains. So-called abortions hurt not only the child, but the mother, father and relatives also. Ultrasound pictures give us a window into the womb of a preborn child.

Deobandism is an Islamic movement started in British India with two of its main goals being to unify and reform Muslims in India, there being a small population of Muslims and an imposing threat of British culture that could corrupt many young Muslims. The Taliban took the teachings from this sect of Deobandism and fused them with their own beliefs from Afghanistan. This group began to take over Afghanistan in 1994. In 1996 they imposed a form of Islamic holy law, or Sharia, in controlled areas. Under Sharia all citizens are entitled to five rights: life, intellect, family, property and religion. The Taliban took these rights mainly from women by making it so that women could not be educated over the age of eight, could not work at all, could not reveal more than their eyes and palms and could not leave the house without a male relative. Other restrictions upon the general population were the banning of television, photography, movies, kite-flying and chess. Punishments of breaking these laws are harsh, for example, the public amputation of the hand if you steal, stoning to death if you commit adultery or imprisonment if your beard was not the required length. This same year Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, was taken and the year after the Taliban effectively controlled 2/3 of the country. The Talibans interpretation of Islam being greatly influenced from a Deoband education in Pakistan it is possible that other people have been and can be educated by these same people spreading their fundamentalist interpretation of Islam. The Taliban itself can spread its constrictive interpretation of Islam to other people through education. This is still a problem because the people learning these disjointed Islamic views can form Taliban-like groups and are likely to be recruited by terrorist organizations due to their educators close ties with these organizations. normlife.com","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:48 AM","abortion-debates","710"

They're o.k. with some of the functions of a soldier, but they don't head down to the local Uncle Sam office and volunteer if they don't feel o.k. about other things soldiers do.

Science does away with metaphors' However, let's have a closer look at your metaphor, it was ill chosen for in real life the character in the play becomes the actor in the play. There is no duality of existence, just life or death The opposite is true, to act against one's conscience is to compromise oneself.","antonia","337381","Oh blah, blah, blah. You just don't want to address the point that was made, and a few times, already. Baloney. The best science teacher I ever had used metaphors every day to illuminate scientific points. And Dawkins - a very famous scientist - uses metaphors, too. He wrote a book entitled with metaphor -- ""The Selfish Gene"". It was an excellent metaphor. That is the point of the metaphor. A character on paper is not an actor in a future Broadway production. Nor is the genetic coding in a cell an individual, later on. What the heck is this supposed to mean? Do you even think about the words you choose for your sentences and what they mean? Do you sweep the ground before you as you walk so as not to obliterate life? What do you mean -- ""the opposite is true""? I just said, if someone's conscience tells them abortion is murder, then don't have one.

It seems inconceivable to you that my morality is not based on religion but, it is, and what about you? is you conscience based on the tenets of a particular religion? I have explained ad nauseum my position but you still refuse to accept it: There is no discontinuity (it would be absurd) between an adult human being and one just conceived, just different stages of development. The weakness of your position is that where you draw the line between 'it' and 'she' is purely arbitrary, a matter of expediency. You could also commit infanticide and say that what you killed was not a human being. This is not moral relativism this is sophism of the worst kind.

They reason on the basis of rough guidelines, leaving the rest between you and YOUR god or conscience. But you, Winston, you want to impose your morals and your personal-pipeline-to-God insight on everyone else. And btw, Winston, you do draw a line -- ""Conception!"" A la RCC.

""Singer holds that man is no different from other forms a life, and therefore man's life is not worth more than, for example, a cow.

I am so tired because I have been running from myself for too long. 34 years and I have just caught up with myself. I got pregnant at the age of 16. My parents forced me into an abortion. The father had been in trouble prior to this and they threatened to have him sent away. They carried guns with them and told me if they ever saw me even talking to him that they would kill him and then themselves. That was the final straw. I could not hurt him or his family anymore. I gave in. He thought that I miscarried. They let me see him again afterward but only if they were in the room with us. I knew that I loved him enough that I had to let him go. He never understood what happened. I told him that when both of my parents were gone that I would explain. I went on to get married and had 2 beautiful children, but one had severe handicaps. I felt that this was my punishment. But why did my daughter have to be punished for my sins? I wanted to confront my parents about what they did to me, but kept putting it off. My daughter was 1 1/2 and my mother died suddenly. I never got to ask her why? I had almost 21 more years with my father and never got the nerve to confront him. When he was diagnosed with cancer, how could I confront a dying man with what he had done to me? At the same time I panicked, knowing the promise that I had made with the father of my lost baby. I lived with the guilt of what I had done alone for years. I finally told a couple of close friends. They would listen and try to understand but didn't really. My husband knew and thought that it was all about the father of the baby. For all those years, I did too. I met with the father of the unborn baby and confessed. I thought that I would feel closure. I didn't. It took telling the baby's father and my dad dying to realize that this pain was about me and all that I had been through. My husband just didn't get it. He heard my words but just didn't listen to and hear my pain. I regret not confronting my parents when they were alive and now it's too late. They died thinking that I was fine and that they did the best thing for me. They were so wrong. I just seemed fine because I got good at it. I wore a mask to hide my pain for 34 years. Listen.

Couples and families often have very personal ways of dealing with the death of an unborn child no matter how or when it died. As a calligrapher, I have had couples ask me to make them a memorial certificate for their unborn child who died. Part of the problem with grieving openly is the ridicule they receive from ignorant hard-hearted individals. With the wide use of ultra sound, the child is readily seen and its sex is determined. The child is often named as a result of knowing the sex and seeing it. Therefore, it is expected that parents would grieve at the loss of the child. Furthermore, the abortion clinics do NOT let the mother see her dead child. They sometimes do and it is very traumatic for them. Planned Parenthood also does not allow the press to get out that women have died as a result of an abortion at their clinic. You cannot hear. You do not listen. You do not care. Carolina Review: January 2006 While I was with the doctor, I asked her what she would tell a pregnant UNC student who did not know what options were available to her. Immediately the doctor handed me a Planned Parenthood pamphlet and told me that they offer a variety of servicessurgical abortion, chemical abortion, and birth control. ""The counseling Planned Parenthood offers students, on the other hand, is completely inadequate. When talking to students who are trying to decide whether or not to keep their baby, they discuss the following: a person is ready for parenthood, they say, when they are ready to make a child feel loved and wanted (implying that the child has no inherent worth of its ownit is all based on the mothers feelings at the moment), and when they have the support of family and friends (implying that if your friends do not want you to have a baby, then you should simply kill it)."" ""This is no counseling for a college student, and will automatically make the parenting option seem completely unfeasible. Students need real counsel. I was shocked at the sheer lack of any choice in the options the doctor laid out."" Carolina Review, NCU-Chapel Hill, An Investigation of Abortion Practices at the University, January 2006 Fact: Above is only one article written about the manipulative so-called counseling pregnant women receive when they enter a Planned Parenthood. With only one mention of adoption, saying you will have to go thru such and such to give your baby up... they pretend they have ""given all the options."" But their goal is to promote abortion for crisis pregnancies. And they overwhelmingly meet their goal. Only 1-2% of cases are referred to adoption agencies.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:05 AM","abortion-debates","771"

Interestingly enough, a number of these protelifers are obsessed with this issue of ""personhood"". Yet their disturbance revolves around not seeing women as persons, like themselves. With the same kind of needs and boundaries in life. I would agree with that, in some cases. For example, someone taken up with the issue of monogamy might have had a mother or father, or both, in serial affairs. Sometimes they see the father putting down the mother as if it were the most normal thing in the world. There's a family of origin dynamic, though, that colors their view of the world.

When Roe is overturned based on the fact that, first of all, it is unconstitutional, secondly, it contradicts itself and implies a pneumbra for women but not for children. Finally, Blackmun skirted around the truth of when human life begins, thus committing an egregious error in his opinion. Good people change bad laws, and we will overturn Roe v Wade. We never advocate a nanny state, but a state which protects not only some lives but all lives....after all, it is an inalienable right. We will do what we have been doing, but on a grander scale. We will fund only clinics which are effective in keeping young girls and women healthy. We will provide education on healthy living. We will provide services and help for those needing help with their babies. We will place babies in homes waiting to adopt. As for the law, it will operate like every other piece of legislation. Doctors are to do no harm, and will live up to that expectation. Anyone providing an illegal abortion will face legal action. You stupidly act like every law breaker in the world will be proscecuted, when you know that is never the case. As for abortions (legal) causing harm to a woman, that is still the case today. Planned Parenthood has been the cause of many damaged uteruses, caused many to become infertile, and has caused deaths due to their so-called ""safe abortions."" The more cases there are the more chance for damage and death. Women who abort may not always nor immediately suffer, but they will in time. It is ironic that abortion is sold as a way to relieve women from harmful conseqences and billed as something which never harms women, while it hurts every woman, child and family it touches. Physicians know and believe that life begins at conception. Many testified before congress.... In the words of Dr. Lejeune: ""Each of us has a very precise starting moment which is the time at which the whole necessary and sufficient genetic information is gathered inside one cell, the fertilized egg, and this is the moment of fertilization. There is not the slightest doubt about that and we know that this information is written on a kind of ribbon which we call the DNANature has used the smallest possible language to carry the information from father to children, from mother to children, from generation to generationAt no time is the human being a blob of protoplasm. As far as your nature is concerned, I see no difference between the early person that you were at conception and the late person which you are now. You were and are a human being."" This is an excerpt from a thouroughly researched and thought out argument against Roe. If any of you are interested in actual facts: Recall the 1857 Dred Scott v. Sanford decision, which declared that slavery could not be prohibited by Congress in any territory of the U.S. and that African Americans were not full persons and not afforded the same rights as ""full persons."" Sound familiar? President Lincoln argued that the slaves were persons, not possessions, and that their unalienable right to liberty was protected by the Declaration of Independence unborn. To add to the irony, after the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, came the Thirteenth (1865) and Fourteenth (1868) Amendments, all which overthrew slavery and the erroneous Dred Scott Supreme Court decision. The Fourteenth Amendment...how ironic. One of the Amendments which helped overturn Dred Scott is now used to further the ""non-person"" argument -the same argument the Amendment was created to prevent! How can the Supreme Court use the Fourteenth Amendment to help justify denying the unborn unalienable rights when this Amendment was supposed to protect people from such selective rights attribution?

Big Brother or should I say Big Sister would have been proud of their doubletalk, not Winston Smith of course. You know, a wise writer once said that to take the position 'in between' what you called balanced is the only honest position. I wished I could remember where I read it. I remember when I was young and the Vietnam war was at its peak I realised the war was lost and the facts supported my view. I mentioned once at dinner in the house of a Uni friend of mine, that the pacification program was a failure even according to TIME magazine a conservative magazine. His parents stared at me in silence and resumed eating. From that day I was not accepted in their house for I was a labelled a Communist. I learnt in Chile that between two ideologies runs a seismic fault and that if you stand in the middle you fall. The same with the pro and anti-abortion camps, a balanced view is not tolerated by either camp, you are one of us or against us. Zealots see everything in black and white. There are no greys.

On the other hand we have the mother and her situation, if the pregnancy put her in an desperate position and will abort her baby no matter what then for her sake let's have society provide her with a doctor and a clinic.

"12-22-2008","11293",55,"Winston Smith","337664","You know, a wise writer once said that to take the position 'in between' what you called balanced is the only honest position. I wished I could remember where I read it. I remember when I was young and the Vietnam war was at its peak I realised the war was lost and the facts supported my view. I mentioned once at dinner in the house of a Uni friend of mine, that the pacification program was a failure even according to TIME magazine a conservative magazine. His parents stared at me in silence and resumed eating. From that day I was not accepted in their house for I was a labelled a Communist. I learnt in Chile that between two ideologies runs a seismic fault and that if you stand in the middle you fall. The same with the pro and anti-abortion camps, a balanced view is not tolerated by either camp, you are one of us or against us. Zealots see everything in black and white. There are no greys. Once you are regarded to be the enemy, because you disagree with them, what follows is that you are demonized : ""I declare you a believer"" the hate word is ""believer"" and no matter how strongly you explain that you are not a believer you are not heard.","Another opinion","337680","I don't think that the situation is as bleak as you describe.

Don't have sex, if you don't want to have children.","Another opinion","337685","When you say ""fully human"", what do you mean by that? In what way is a zygote or early embryo ""fully human""? I have often found that those on the pro-life side tend to imagine the embryo as the baby it will become, not for what that embryo actually is at that moment. I can understand that emotion, but it is based on imagination, not reality, so one cannot base a law on it. The early fetus / embryo has no mind yet that can feel pain, fear, joy, any will to live, feel any sensory input ...nothing. At that early stage, it is just a body with ""nobody home"". Any movements at that stage are only reflex action - not actions due to a mind controlling that movement or feeling their effect. Our imaginations can deceive us into thinking otherwise since, after all, it starts to ""look"" human fairly early on. It has a heart beat fairly early on and other aspects that make us try to relate to it. However, I find it important to be able to step back and judge objectively whether what one is imagining is actually true. Does the fact that it starts to look like us mean that it really is like us? In the most critical sense, I would say no since it cannot have any sense of mind / mental existence until fairly late in the pregnancy. That mental existence is what makes us us - it is the core aspect of our lives as people that one cannot due without. I, and many others on the pro-choice side, find that dividing line of the onset of potential mental existence as critically important in defining abortion rights. Before that human body gains any mental existence, it is, once again, just a body with ""nobody home"" which many of us view as not deserving rights (mere bodies don't deserve rights) so the woman can abort it at that stage for whatever reason she chooses since her right to her own body is unchallenged by any other right. However, once the fetus can start to have a mental existence (when there is a ""somebody"" now present in the body), then fetal rights to life also have to be taken into account. This happens around the beginning of the third trimester. Because of this, many of us on the pro-choice side would limit third trimester abortion rights to a handful of exceptions (risk to mother's life, health, etc.) but would keep first and second trimester abortions rights free. Indeed, around 84% of Americans think that third trimester abortions should be generally outlawed (generally meaning outlawed minus certain exceptions). Those statistics show that the majority of pro-choice supporters would also generally outlaw third trimester abortions - some for reasons similar to my own, some for reasons of viability or other arguements. Those here that argue the extreme of no restrictions on abortion rights for any reason ever, are definitely the minority with only about 10% of Americans supporting those views. What is also interesting is that about 2/3rds of Americans support first trimester abortions being legal - where those statistics would reveal that a minority of those calling themselves pro-life do support abortion rights if the abortions would happen very early on. So, the two camps are not as extreme as some of the rhethoric in this forum might suggest. The spread also shows that the issues are more complex.

I used to listen to my father and friends discuss politics but because they had similar views centre to centre right I only came face to face with the sort of individuals you see in this thread for example, during my University years. As I mentioned in my previous posting those were the 60s when Vietnam, Cuba, the Cold War etc were hot topics and for us in South America a matter of life and death. I was staunchly anti-Communist (still am) but I couldnt help to see that Vietnam was a horrible tragedy and an unwinnable war and said so to anyone who cared to listen. One of the first things I found out arguing with the Communists was that they would attack your sources of information, which were always printing lies (unless they supported their arguments), they lied because all media was compromised, the Imperialists controlled everything, the CIA was behind every curtain blah blah Only they, the Communists knew what was really happening, they had the monopoly of truth. Another method was the Karl Rove method, the Antonia method, demonize and insult your opponents, any prominent anti-Communist was a f-a-g, a libertine, a liar, corrupt an agent of the CIA etc. When there were debates on TV the Communists used to insult their opponents, spit on them and other niceties. When Allende took power the first thing he did was to clamp on any media outlet that criticised him. You can see the same tactics employed here by some persons: since the Catholic Church opposes abortion anyone who opposes abortion has to be a believer and even if the person is not, some person will I declare you a believer for it suits her agenda. Demonization a la Karl Rove. When one reaches this point in the debate it is time to bid Adios and stop talking with that person, for there is no dialogue at this point. Of course according to zealots no one but them has the right to voice an opinion about the issue being discussed. In Chile I had no right to speak my mind about politics because I was a rich kid out of touch with the lives of the poor, according to the Communists (although all of their leaders came also from affluent families) here I am a man therefore I have no right to voice my opinion on womens issues. Who gave these people the right to assign or deny rights? Another question without an answer. The goal of these people is to shut up and drive away anyone who disagrees with them. Oh, one more thing, whatever they do they accuse the other side of doing, they are the only ones guilty of, such as this: some people can dish it our but cannot take it. Hollyh is the only one here who saw that complex issues have no clear answers and therefore we hold contradictory positions in our minds. I am always an optimist and I always argue in good faith, with a touch of humour, and take other peoples words at face value but soon the zealots with an axe to grind and a big chip on their shoulders begin to swing the axe and it is the end of the conversation. It is OK with me, for forums are not my intellectual life at all. I read newspapers and other sources of info in the Net and to gauge what readers think, I read their letters to the editor.

We never advocate a nanny state, but a state which protects not only some lives but all lives....after all, it is an inalienable right. We will do what we have been doing, but on a grander scale. We will fund only clinics which are effective in keeping young girls and women healthy. We will provide education on healthy living. We will provide services and help for those needing help with their babies. We will place babies in homes waiting to adopt. As for the law, it will operate like every other piece of legislation. Doctors are to do no harm, and will live up to that expectation. Anyone providing an illegal abortion will face legal action. You stupidly act like every law breaker in the world will be proscecuted, when you know that is never the case. As for abortions (legal) causing harm to a woman, that is still the case today. Planned Parenthood has been the cause of many damaged uteruses, caused many to become infertile, and has caused deaths due to their so-called ""safe abortions."" The more cases there are the more chance for damage and death. Women who abort may not always nor immediately suffer, but they will in time. It is ironic that abortion is sold as a way to relieve women from harmful conseqences and billed as something which never harms women, while it hurts every woman, child and family it touches. Physicians know and believe that life begins at conception. Many testified before congress.... In the words of Dr. Lejeune: ""Each of us has a very precise starting moment which is the time at which the whole necessary and sufficient genetic information is gathered inside one cell, the fertilized egg, and this is the moment of fertilization. There is not the slightest doubt about that and we know that this information is written on a kind of ribbon which we call the DNANature has used the smallest possible language to carry the information from father to children, from mother to children, from generation to generationAt no time is the human being a blob of protoplasm. As far as your nature is concerned, I see no difference between the early person that you were at conception and the late person which you are now. You were and are a human being."" This is an excerpt from a thouroughly researched and thought out argument against Roe. If any of you are interested in actual facts: Recall the 1857 Dred Scott v. Sanford decision, which declared that slavery could not be prohibited by Congress in any territory of the U.S. and that African Americans were not full persons and not afforded the same rights as ""full persons."" Sound familiar? President Lincoln argued that the slaves were persons, not possessions, and that their unalienable right to liberty was protected by the Declaration of Independence unborn. To add to the irony, after the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, came the Thirteenth (1865) and Fourteenth (1868) Amendments, all which overthrew slavery and the erroneous Dred Scott Supreme Court decision. The Fourteenth Amendment...how ironic. One of the Amendments which helped overturn Dred Scott is now used to further the ""non-person"" argument -the same argument the Amendment was created to prevent! How can the Supreme Court use the Fourteenth Amendment to help justify denying the unborn unalienable rights when this Amendment was supposed to protect people from such selective rights attribution?

Where fetal vs women's rights are concerned, the Constitution was not sufficiently precise, which has led to a lot of back-and-forth about abortion rights. Roe vs Wade is the current standard for the limits of restrictions on abortion rights but even Roe vs Wade allows the state to interfere in the third trimester. The reason Roe vs Wade gives is viability since, at the time, there was insufficient evidence or concensus to make any conclusions about the ""personhood"" question, so it left that question open.

The same is true for all people of all ages, sexes and nationalities. If all people were good and wise, then we wouldn't need any laws. Laws exist because people make decisions which are sufficiently harmful to others or to society that the state needs to intercede. This is also true for the case of abortion. The great majority of people would find it very unjust for a woman to abort a fetus one day from birth for reasons that are not dire (such as strong risk to her life, etc.). You apparently don't. You certainly have the right to your opinion. The rest of us also have the right to our opinions and we vote accordingly. I personally prefer if people vote on concensus that is determined from discussion and debate than when people vote on an issue simply because they ""know"" they are right. Debate and discussion helps illucidate aspects of an issue that people might not have considered - which is the main usefulness of debate. When you claim that people do not have the right to hold an opinion on this issue, you are not only being hypocritical (since you yourself hold an opinion that you profess) but you also get ignored since this claim doesn't stand up to scrutiny. If you really want to change people's minds, you cannot tell them that they have no right to think, you have to counter their arguements - not ignore them.

In fact, this is common, not statutory law you are discussing. You also know but refuse to consider the fact that the common law rules were established at a very different place and time. Law is evolutionary, and the common law of the 19th Century was obviously unable to foresee the changing position of women in the 21st.

In a Democracy, the people have a say in the limitations imposed on them in how they vote for politicians.

This is such a basic point that I am continuing to repeat that it surprises me that you do not understand it. Laws are made by politicians and their imposition in particular cases is controlled by the justice department. Where abortions are concerned, if there was a third trimester abortion done by a doctor (under this third trimester abortion restriction scenario) for reasons other than reasons that are accepted by popular vote through the political process (ex. risk to mother's life, health, etc.), then the doctor should get punished, as well as the woman (depending on her circumstances).

Since you are the first person I have seen who expect this, on any forum over at least five years of my participation in forums, it seems that your expectations are not shared by anyone else but yourself. Yes, theoretically, I could sit down, start taking time to review the procedures that they have in UK and the rest of Europe, try to figure out what if any parts of that could be adapted to the US. Also, it would require me to sit down and look at the specifics in how laws are translated into legal punishments here, the flexibility or lack thereof of justices in determining particular sentences, etc. If a third trimester restriction would someday be implemented then that would eventually be necessary but not by me (where I am far from an expert) but by the politicians and legal experts who have the time and expertise and power to implement such policy. My going through such efforts would be a complete waste of time since I have no power to implement such changes and since it adds nothing to the general point that is being debated about whether or when to restrict abortion rights. As I said before, you are putting the cart before the horse and have unrealistic and waste-of-time expectations that nobody else I have ever encountered on forum participation over five years has ever expected.

The imposition of punishments is a second and independent step to the idea that something should be legal or illegal. The only reason not to debate the first step on its own (i.e. whether or when to impose limits) is if no execution of such a law would be possible. That is not the case. You still have not made the point of why one would need to go into the details of punishment before one makes a consensus of what it would be that one would be punishing for. As for the two examples you brought up of people's proposed punishments, those are the type of gut reactions that you would expect from people that I was hesitant in giving since gut reactions are rarely well thought out. For example, a $5k fine for a doctor is negligible compared to what he makes in a year and will hardly serve as a deterent, as will $2.5k for a woman of reasonable means, while $2.5k might be utterly unaffordable for someone who is barely surviving from paycheck to paycheck or living on welfare. The life sentences imposed on a woman with a family would cause much more harm than good. I already mentioned my gut reaction solution in an earlier post ""Either jail time (say, a year or two), a large fine (withdrawn from the first years of their working life, not paid by their parents), or large amount of community service, depending on their circumstances (ex. less penalty for first offenders, for those who are younger, etc.)"". At least I had the honesty to say that these are initial thoughts and that, since I am not an expert, full decisions on punishment would have to be taken up by those that are. The only general statement I will make is that any punishment should be harsh enough to serve as a deterent, but not so harsh as to stop the person from continuing some level of normal life (though not necessarily as good as if it were blemish-free), and which should take into account extenuating circumstances - ex. family to support, first time offender, age of offender, mental state, etc. So, you have not given examples of people who have given full thought to the type of details you asked for but of people who have given you gut reactions out of pressure. Fine, I already gave you the same gut reactions. If you want more detail than that, then show me an example of someone who gave you more detail.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:04 PM","abortion-debates","907"

If the fetus was so well developed that an anesthetic was required to relieve it's suffering then how can a civilized society justify destroy it without a compelling reason. Anesthetic or not!

"01-07-2009","11293",63,"Another opinion","339298","Lets apply those same question to the rest of reality. You think that all women are responsible in their decisions about abortion. So, you deny that women are capable of being irresponsible. Otherwise, you might think that there are no negative consequences to any decision a woman makes about abortion so it is not possible for her to act irresponsibly since all decisions have only positive consequences. There, I would disagree on two points. First, she might be irresponsible to her own safety since late term abortions are more medically dangerous than early term. Secondly, I know you deny this, but there is a sentient human that can now feel, suffer, experience pain and emotions that most Americans feel the need to protect but that you apparently don't. Killing such a late term fetus thus does carry negative consequences that need to be balanced with good reasons. Who decides on the reasons acceptable for late term abortions? The same people that usually decide in the case of laws restricting human behavior (as I have said in many posts already) - legislatures outline general rules while judges decide on specific cases. That is how it works for all other laws, why not for laws limiting abortion? That is your opinion, not absolute truth. The same could be said for any other curtailing of freedom. Again, applying your reasoning to the rest of reality, then you would not curtail any freedoms and say that it is not a justice's business to interfere in any human behavior. Why should abortion be treated any differently than other rights and freedoms? They all have their limits. Just because your answer is simple does not mean that it is thought out. You have avoided over and over any discussion about the rights and/or value of the fetus out of an illogical claim that you have no right to even consider any aspects of the fetus - sentience, etc. You claim a right as absolute and then avoid discussing any of the competing claims. The fact that you avoid addressing the competing issues makes it very clear that you have not thought out your arguement but blindly stick to just repeating unsupported claims.","chester","339349","Now you have to explain how you get from A to B in your last sentence. Once again, you fail to provide any definition whatsoever of the word ""irresponsibly"". What does the word mean to you? What standards will you use? Who should make this determination? As to your two points later on, those are matters for HER and her alone to decide. If she believes the negative consequences outweigh the positive ones, she has the choice to refrain from terminating her pregnancy. If she believes the fetus feels pain, then she should act accordingly. In both cases, she has the right to make that determination without the coercive force of the law. Softball question. Because, with our privacy fast disappearing, this remains perhaps the most intimate of choices, and it must be so in order to preserve whatever shred of privacy remains to an individual. Once again a false dichotomy. Lincoln gave the correct response to a heckler who posed one of these to him. He said, ""Why do you suppose that, because I do not want a black woman as my slave that I would want her for my wife?"" You STILL don't get it, do you? IT'S NOT MY CALL!!! If a woman cares to give credence to the ""competing issues"", I will give her my full support. If another woman chooses otherwise, I will give that woman my full support also.

The issue of trimesters (or other such stage-of-development identification) is also useful to bring up in debates between pro-life and pro-choice advocates since I get the strong impression that pro-life advocates mostly have a late term fetus in mind when they argue for fetal rights to life and then extrapolate those rights to all stages of a pregnancy out of principle.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:52 PM","abortion-debates","961"

There are still questions about the health exception and in what situations that applies, but that does not change the fact that legal structures are already in place for the state having some say in abortion rights. In the ideal world, if we could decide on a law and it would stick, then I would choose third trimester restrictions just from principle's sake since I do view fetal rights as needing to be balanced in in late term. However, we do not live in the ideal world. What is the state of the world (US in this case), then, where abortion rights are concerned? The state is that the balance of justices on the Supreme Court is still in favor of Roe vs Wade but just barely. Though safe during the Obama administration, the scale could just tip the other way in a future administration. This is because of the strength of the pro-life movement. However, if you take away their use of third trimester abortions as a tool to advertise against all abortions, then you are taking away much of the strength of their message and weakening the movement - hopefully, enough to keep the rest of abortions safe, as seemed to be the case in the UK after they largely restricted third trimester abortions. So, even from a real world politics point of view, third trimester abortion restrictions seem to make sense. One more thing to note: In a Democracy such as ours, if the majority is large enough, then the whole Constitution could be rewritten via a new Constitutional Convention. Given current politics, that is extremely unlikely, but the calling of a new Constitution is built into our political system as an option. The bottom line is that a large enough majority can decide on pretty much whatever law they want anyway so we should focus on current US and world politics, not on where a future majority might lead us.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:27 AM","abortion-debates","968"

There are many opinions I also hold that I also would not make law since it is quite clear that there can be a wide range of opinions and approaches to a wide array of subjects, where one cannot say that one approach is the right one. However, in a Democracy, we the people need to set some directions in what we expect from our government in terms of laws and we cannot shirk those responsibilities completely. There are some issues that one eventually does need to make a stand on. Murder of born people, for example, is an issue that most would agree should be controlled by law. Then, I would think that most would consider that the question ""Would you stand to make this opinion against murder of born people universal law?"" should be answered YES! Sometimes, the answer to that question needs to be yes if we are to have any laws at all. How does one decide, then, which opinions to apply as universal laws (in our voting habits, responses to polls, or any other civic activity)? That can be a tough question but it seems that most of the rhethoric I hear concerning laws are questions of balancing rights and responsibilities. There is no one answer to how one strikes these balances but to fail to present an opinion about law is just to abdicate responsibility purely to a party one votes for that one blindly trusts to get it right. I don't know about you, but I think that there are very few politicians that fully think these ethical issues through. The age of the politician / philosopher is over and many, if not most, politicians can have as knee-jerk reactions as many in the public have. That is why debate is so important in a society. I, for one, do not blindly trust my politicians on ethical issues. Unfortunately, there seems to be a lack of genuine open-minded debate on these issues in the grander public sphere (ex. no televised debates about abortion rights between experts who know both sides of the issue fully, where they actually listen to each other). Therefore, the only place seemingly left for actual discussion on these topics is forums such as this. I feel that it is part of our civic duty as citizens of a Democracy to engage in such debates and act on their conclusions in the form of our voting habits, responses to polls, letters to our representatives, or any other form of civic activity that gets us actually INVOLVED in our democracy instead of being complacent and apathetic about it. So, my bottom line is that, if you hold your view strongly enough, have a strong foundation of rational support behind it, and it doesn't interfere with major rights granted us in the Constitution, then you have every right to think that your view should become law and play your part in supporting that view through your voting habits, civic activity and expressions in forums such as this. Nobody has the rational right to tell you otherwise. After all, in a Democracy, if the people (and you as part of ""the people"") do not have a right to shape the direction of the laws that are imposed on them (through the choices they make in their voting habits, etc.), then who does?

I am perfectly happy with the legal system the way it currently is - in terms of judges (who know the details of the case) making the final determination of punishment for a particular guilty verdict, guided by general outlines that are determined by legislatures / criminal experts which, in turn, might be swayed by very general outlines from opinion polls.

I certainly have heard of the back-alley abortions and have read about various cases where such abortions occurred and resulted in severe injury or death so one cannot discount it entirely. However, I do not have the statistics on hand to state how prevalent such back-alley abortions were and how often they resulted in severe medical problems so I will not respond there. However, the book Freakonomics made a reasonable case using statistics to show how the introduction of abortion rights helped reduce future crime rate (> 15 years down the road) since there were far fewer unwanted children in poor families whose unfortunate family situation helped lead them to a life of crime once they reached peak crime years (teenage and 20s). So, outside of the effect on the individual live's of the women involved, that reduction in crime is one positive effect that the introduction of abortion rights had on society. Either way, as you say, one should not do something evil to do something good. Our main difference lies in what we consider evil - where you think even early term abortions are evil whereas I do not.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:18 PM","abortion-debates","1033"

Rarely can one find a law where everyone is in agreement. Either way, I don't often use the word ""evil"" except for the most heinous crimes - serial killers, mass murderers, torture of innocents, etc. So, no, I would not consider late term abortions evil - just bad enough to restrict when they don't meet certain exceptions in order to protect the now sentient fetus.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:11 AM","abortion-debates","1035"
