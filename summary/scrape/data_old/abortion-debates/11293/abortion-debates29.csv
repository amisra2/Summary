We ""handle"" them by making it none of our business.

These: JH, Ok, let me explain something: Women electively abort for one reason-- MONEY; either she or the father doesn't have enough. If either or both had a billion dollars, there'd be no abortion. Therfore her abortion is soley to save (or make) her a LOT of money in comparison-- in addition to helping her try to find a richer guy (i.e. MORE money). were not my words. This was copied from J Henderson's post #416 to be precise. Apology accepted - not that I expect one from you. Bottom line: If any of my daughters or granddaughters should choose to terminate their pregnancies and you are blocking the clinic door, expect shoe prints up your back and handcuffs on your wrists. We will take all the action the law allows.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","04:23 AM","abortion-debates","423"

"11-23-2008","11293",29,"Joel_Henderson","333848","What about the 1.3 million aborted?","CUNxTime","333919","It is horribly sad. But everyone must have the final say in controlling their own bodies, women included. Sorry, but women are NOT cows or sheep. If they don't want to carry a baby, it would be WORST than abortion to force it.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:54 AM","abortion-debates","427"
"11-23-2008","11293",29,"Darn Republican","333850","You make sarcastic, but great point... but don't you mean follow the ideology? It is the feminist and environmental lobby that that have been the largest proponents of abortion. As a nation we face a great problem ahead if we don't settle up with national disater, it is effecting social security... we'd have at least a 30% larger tax base to support our economy. We've got to act on this...","CUNxTime","333920","Actually, I would think that (esp.if JH is right) if abortion is mostly about money then it is mostly done by the lower economic bracket of society then the net/net may not be a 'drag' on the economy. (Pretty morbid, but I didn't start down that path;p)","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:03 PM","abortion-debates","428"

Anyways you slice it... economically, we are not better off by leveling off our population growth and that is exactly what abortion is. It has just been repackaged here by the feminist movement as a perceived personal right.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:13 PM","abortion-debates","429"

Not for any economic reasons. But, I'd have to say that it stands to reason that if sheer numbers determined our economic viability, then our borders would be left open and all comers would be legalized and put into the system. Our side (conservative) has argued that this is not the case. How can it be both ways?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:22 PM","abortion-debates","430"

As men and women we are just different, the law clearly respects the differences between genders. But that doesn't change what we are... women cannot get pregnant without being impregnated, those means are typically during intercourse to which she would be fully engaging in consensually, she should [as a partner in the act] be prepared for the repercussions of not being protected. Same for the male... he ain't gettin' away with nothing either... Lol! I am just saying there is not ""equality"" that needs be considered there. Equality and fairness are liberal talking point that need to be parsed and translated into what they actually mean, equality = moral equivocation with that which is just and universally accepted as right and morally correct, and fairness is nothing short of a fascistic neutering and silencing of anything they don't agree with in favor of their own position on a given matter. However, I have to draw a line between what I see as your co-opting of ""our side""... I am a social conservative, which means I take a stance as a citizen to engage the culture but do so in a way the preserves the union, and does not take a position on anything not consistent with that. Abortion does not and is not in any way a benefit to any society... but we seem to have a legal framework that somehow must allow for interpretation to take root and have more effect than it should... I see your position as republican or moderate at best. But [again] I do respect your point of view...","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:42 PM","abortion-debates","431"

These women abuse the system. I didnt say i would remove their right to have the abortion, i am pro choice, but i do believe they should face consequences for their multiple terms of blatant disregard, negligence and abuse of the situation. Surely they should be made to face some consequence (and no i dont mean nto allowing them to have the abortion)??","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:54 PM","abortion-debates","432"
