I am refering to women killing their infants after they are born. Usually, by abandonning them -- to exposure to the elements. Because they are unable to get access to a safe, legal, early term abortions. It was also common in London, when abortion was illegal, to see babies in garbage pails or gutters. To wit, from the article I mentioned earlier on Portugal, By contrast, in Spain, which has a similar law, the legislation is liberally interpreted, and abortions are routinely performed. That has created a lucrative market for legal abortions in Spain for those Portuguese women who can afford to travel there. The Portuguese newspapers carry advertisements every day of clinics over the border in Spain offering voluntary treatment of pregnancy. Even within the clergy, there are divisions. On Thursday, a 79-year-old priest, the Rev. Manuel Costa Pinto, from the small town of Lamego, stunned the church hierarchy in declaring that he planned to vote yes. I dont take it lightly, he said of his decision, according to the news agency Lusa. I know my responsibility as a Catholic and as a priest. Calling the current law the real infanticide, he described the crisis of women who are too poor and too afraid to terminate their pregnancies illegally. They put their babies into a bag and throw them into the garbage, into the gutters or abandon them in the middle of the fields, he said. http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/11/wo...pagewanted=all Here's a group putting research together on infanticide in Latin America, Call for Papers LASA 2009: ""Abortion and Infanticide in Latin America"" Best to have abortion legal, safe, easily available, and rarer. Rarer usually accomplished by a comprehensive approach (including legal, safe and easily available, and) that also makes birth control and family planning education widespread, starting at early ages. Along with social policies that make it easier for parents to have children, if they wish to folllow through on the pregnancy. That is pre-natal care, childcare, early childhood education, etc. If we had the medical system that you have in Australia, that in itself would likely make it much easier for women to decide to follow through on their pregnancies. But simply treating abortion like a crime does nothing but hurt people.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:09 AM","abortion-debates","545"
