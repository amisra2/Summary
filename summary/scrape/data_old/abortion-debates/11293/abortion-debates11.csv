The unicorns in your brain are real. A fetus in utero is not covered by the Due Process Clause.","Steeeeve","320406","Dear Hypocrite, If the Supreme Court rules one way and years later it is reserved, then one decision was naturally wrong (assuming you are a logical person). Roe v. Wade was all but overturned with Casey (only keeping the holding) and I believe both cases are wrong as no right to abortion exists in the constitution...nor does a ""right to privacy"" for that matter. Wow, you got something right! Too bad the Due Process Clause is also not a substantive guarantee and as such, abortion is not covered by it. Substantive due process is a basically a contradiction in terms.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:06 PM","abortion-debates","151"
"08-15-2008","11293",11,"Another opinion","320379","If abortion were already outlawed in the US, I doubt that the pro-life side would be enthusiastic about voting in a situation where the majority would allow first trimester abortions. Similarly, as a pro-choice advocate, I am not enthusiastic about having such a vote where the majority would choose to make second trimester abortions generally illegal. Both of our sides hope to use the political process to get as close to our views as possible. Polls can be misleading, as you say, which is why one needs to be as specific as possible. People do think differently about the fetus at different stages of pregnancy and the exceptions and reasons they would allow do vary depending on that stage. The poll that I quoted (with 66% allowing first trimester abortions and 84% not allowing third trimester abortions) was also taken in years previous to that with very similar results - which suggests numbers that are stable enough to be significant. where legal and illegal in the question did allow for general un-named exceptions. Since this is so consistent, it is clear that people DO take state of development into account. I even remember seeing a pro-life web site once which tried to convince believers that they should also be concerned about early term abortions since apparently they saw not enough concern about those early fetuses. I agree that weeks would be a better way of delineating state of development. I asked you at the time that we had this debate how you would have phrased such a poll given weeks and you never answered.","Steeeeve","320408","It was up for votes prior to 1973. It was at least a legitimate way to do things. The idea that one would remove a subject from the democratic debate for the sole reason that they don't want it to be there is not a good stance to have. and there are legitimate ways and not legitimate ways. Getting a court to do your dirty work is without a doubt the wrong way and a dangerous way. I have no doubt the same question is consistent over the years but they still are inconsistent in terms of asking a question a different way. Furthermore, I don't define what is right based on public opinion polls. I'm not sure what you are referring to here but I'm not really sure it matters either. My point is that I suspect people don't really have a consistent view. If you show them a picture of a 2 month old fetus and say ""would you allow abortion when the baby looks like this?"" You'd probably get a response by 50-55% saying no (pure guess by the way). Would you not agree? I have no proof of this but judging from the polls I've seen people seem to think that abortion for ""birth control"" is no good. I don't mean to make any claim about this other than that I don't feel people are consistent when it comes to abortion. You can't. People know nothing about the stage of development at certain weeks...I certainly can't ramble it off at the top of my head. My point is that the question about abortion never seems to come down to the basic question of when do we value human life when asked in a poll. Polls seem to reflect an emotional response based on the mothers situation. For example, if you say ""should this 30yr old ugly unemployed girl who has already had 3 abortions be allowed to have another abortion at any time for any reason"" you might get a different response than say ""should this 17yr old girl who is trying to get into college and made a mistake one night be allowed to get an abortion at anytime for any reason"". I often feel the abortion debate is skewed because you can see a mother but not the fetus. The phrase ""out of sight out of mind"" is appropriate. It has often been the case that when some are shown a picture of their baby or a baby at 1-2-3 months then all of a sudden you have a picture of something that is real. This is the very reason some states require an ultrasound first.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:25 PM","abortion-debates","152"

"08-15-2008","11293",11,"Galactababe","320374","Chester: The question becomes the interpretation of the word PERSON. If we accept the pro-Life position that a fetus is a person, then Roe vs. Wade violates the Due Process clause. It should also be noted that medical technology was in the relative dark ages when the 14th Amendment was written and that premie babies have survived when delivered as early as 21 weeks.","Shooterandproud","320437","Hey, haven't we ever considered that maybe a woman is a person too? What if squeezing something 7-9 pounds out of her vagina is depriving her of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? Also, in order for something to be a person, it must have a mental existence, and be intelligent. Having your nucleotides in a certain order doesn't automatically qualify you. That's why its illegal to have an abortion past 21 weeks .","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:30 PM","abortion-debates","158"

Trying to play with words will not change the meaning of naturalized. It obviously means an alien from another country becoming a citizen.
