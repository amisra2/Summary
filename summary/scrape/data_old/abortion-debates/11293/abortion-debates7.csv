I always find it interesting how many men seem to have more passionate views on the subject than women. As an adult female who survived the free love 70's without an abortion, not a church goer but a Truthseeker, mother of 2 grown delightful children, here's my take: - unless biology has changed drastically, it still requires a man and a woman to make a baby. - in this day and age with all of the birth control available, there is no excuse for unwanted pregnancies. There are thousands of childless couples seeking to adopt. - if a woman willfully engages in sex, she should be willing to bear the responsibility of carrying that child to term - if a woman is raped, she should be permitted to take the day after pill or have an early term abortion. -if a life-threatening medical condition develops for the mother due to the pregnancy, she should be allowed to abort.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:44 AM","abortion-debates","91"

We constantly get pushed further over the edge by the other side regarding this issue. Back in the 60s and 70s, the big argument for legalizing abortion was that because the catholic church condemned birth control, abortions were needed in order to prevent a population explosion of unwanted pregnancies. But today, since that is no longer an issue as nobody cares about the RCCs beliefs about birth control, they argue that it is necessary because birth control fails. Any excuses other than the obvious irresponsibility on the part of the couple. It's as if it's the child's fault for being conceived.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:47 AM","abortion-debates","92"
"08-12-2008","11293",7,"chester","319704","Sorry, but it IS a gender issue. The issue is who gets to make the choice of whether or not to continue a pregnancy, the pregnant woman or the government in the person of some nameless, faceless bureaucrat. I think it would be instructive to see just exactly why you favor the bureaucrat. It would also be instructive to see just exactly what punishment you would have society impose on a woman who chose to terminate her pregnancy and on the physician who performed the termination.","Archangel","320041","I favor a law that protects the unborn for the same reason I support a law that protects you from being killed by someone who knows you and getting away with it because you are known to them. The rationale that a woman has a right to kill her own unborn child just because it is growing inside of her is not only the epitome of immorality, but is the definition of hubris in valuing the personal convenience of the woman that created the so called problem more than the very life of the baby who is perceived as the problem by her. What is so sad is that you are unable to how irrational your blind justification for abortion is.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:58 AM","abortion-debates","93"

Unless and until the first man in history becomes pregnant, we have no right to an opinion on the topic. BTW, ""Unborn Child"" was, is, and will forever be an oxymoron.

"08-12-2008","11293",7,"Penfold","319536","The comprehension deficit is not with Chester....The meaning may not have been intended, but Archie clearly defines the parameters of his argument in terms of when the abortion is performed, and not if. You appear to have contracted the same myopia as Archie. "" ... we ere on the side of caution regarding how late in the pregnancy abortions are allowed to be performed?"" Archie clearly argues not if, but when it should be done. Ere we go on, it's ""err""","Steeeeve","320108","I think it is clear from previous posts what the meaning was.

Compromise can be a wonderful thing.","chester","320172","Where's the compromise? A little balancing of responsibilities would seem to be in order. If we are going to compromise, let's also include a provision in the law that each and every profetallifer who supports this proposal be required to adopt the baby once it is born if the birth mother feels she is incapable of raising it with the love, discipline, and money it takes to have that child become a productive member of society. Any takers?? Second, what sanctions will your proposal include for those women and, presumably, their doctors, who, despite the law, choose to terminate their pregnancies? If you want this law to be effective, there MUST be a legal sanction for breaking it. Ponder and get back to us later. Bottom line for me? I will oppose to my last breath any law which or any individual who tries to take the decision of whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term out of the hands of my daughters and granddaughters, or anyone else's daughters or granddaughters.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:09 PM","abortion-debates","102"
