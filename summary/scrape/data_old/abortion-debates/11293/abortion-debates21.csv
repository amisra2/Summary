You're starting to sound more like archie on account of your inability to have a civil debate.","chester","322051","Gee, sweetie, whose words have you quoted, certainly not mine. Just in case you haven't noticed, both the 14th Amendment and the census refers only to born persons. Be that as it may, since some very upright and moral people are on both sides of the abortion issue, it ill behooves the law to endorse one position over the other. Do you really want the government to tell your daughters and granddaughters that it is better qualified to determine the future of their pregnancies than they themselves are? I certainly do not want that for mine.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:41 PM","abortion-debates","302"

Run along and play some video games or better yet, read a book.","Shooterandproud","322069","Prejudice is a nasty nasty thing. Do you know how many countless lives have been lost to racism, sexim, and homophobia? How many Black people hanging from trees will it take to show you how wrong prejudice is? It disgusts me that you or anyone who even claims to be an intelligent and modern thinker would even think of using prejudice in any form. The thought of it makes me puke. Nearly any poster (with the exception of your buddy archie) will back me up on this. I should have vowed to myself long ago that I would never debate with prejudice pigs. If this were real life, I would spit. To think that a 15 year old is not only kicking your butt in an online forum, but has the basic decency skills you lack and has had to resort to giving you a lecture on how wrong prejudice is because your mommy and daddy didn't teach it when you were young. Reported to the admin. I seem to remember the rules specifically stating ""Bigoted, racist, prejudiced or broad-brushed statements are not allowed."" and ""no offensive generalizations"".","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:34 PM","abortion-debates","303"

There are natural terminations of pregnancies, very many of them, as a matter of fact. Most abortions in the world are naturally occurring abortions, because of bodily or hormonal malfunctions, starvation, disease, injury in warfare, deprivations of all sorts because of warfare and terrorism, much of the terrorism created by Bush's America.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:36 PM","abortion-debates","311"

Please tell us on what basis the state is better able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is. What theory of law would you use to support your point? Hypothetical situation: Roe is overturned, returning control over abortion to the states. State ""A"" bans abortions; state ""B"" permits them under most circumstances. 1. What sanction does State ""A"" put in place to punish those who have abortions within its borders? Upon whom is the sanction applied? The woman? The doctor? 2. How does state ""A"" prevent its citizens from traveling to state ""B"" to have the abortion performed? 3. How will state ""A"" determine that one of its citizens has traveled to state ""B"" to have the abortion performed? 4. Can state ""A"" punish one of its citizens for traveling to state ""B"" to have a legal act performed on her? 5. By what claim of right is any man entitled to an opinion on the question? After you finish those, Joel, I have a few more for you.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:47 PM","abortion-debates","315"
