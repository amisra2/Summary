Ok...my specifics for a poster who never answers anything. 1. Police from local level (they normally wear a variation of blue uniforms) and, when needed, certain FBI units similar to the way crimes are investigated today and very similar to the way it was done prior to 1973. 2. They will do so using the same tactics used by the police force in other crimes. This can include wiretaps, informants, people confessing, 911 calls, DNA evidence, the list goes on...perhaps you could watch an episode of CSI and get some ideas! 3. The cost question cannot be anymore specific as it is impossible to measure. What is the cost to police robberies? It depends on how many robberies occur in a given locality. For example if City x has 0 robberies in a year than the cost to that police force is 0. Surely someone as ""enlightened"" as Canada can figure this out...or maybe not. As for your forth question. I would say we should just outlaw visits to Canada. We don't want to run the risk of overwhelming their fantastic universal health care system .","chester","335892","If abortion is kept safe and legal, the cost, as well as the Draconian measures you propose, drop away. Is it really worth it to you to intrude in this manner on the most personal decision a woman can make? BTW, citing a report from the far right wing Fraser Institute does not add credibility to what you say.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:29 PM","abortion-debates","511"

Is it worth it to you to intrude on my most personal opinion on the matter? The zero reports you cite still leave you with zero credibility.

Even if not, Medicaid payment (poor Women) for abortion is still a fraction of what prosecuting women for procuring ""illegal"" abortions as the righttofetallifers would have us do.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:27 PM","abortion-debates","515"

You say you support choice. You say you support the choice of women to obtain abortions from any point during pregnancy until birth. But you do not support the choice of the taxpayers not to participate in that supposedly purely ""personal"" decision.

The decision to go to war was a personal decision of the POTUS who had his minions lie to the Congress in order to gain its support for his action. Should I be exempt from paying that portion of my taxes that go to support that misguided effort?
