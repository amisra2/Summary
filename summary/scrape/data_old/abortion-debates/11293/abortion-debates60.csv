Its quite a slippery slope that's seen in almost all totalitarian governments. We should obviously legislate what we need to make society function and protect human beings from harm, but pointing to a sack of skin, calling it a human, and forcing a woman to squeeze it through her vagina is where the real immorality lies.","gansao","338635","Once again, this your opinion. You are entitled to your opinion whatever it may be. What you are not entitled to do is feel that your opinion is so 'right' that others cannot have a different opinion. I may trash your opinion , you may hate my opinion. So what! It is up to each of us to defend our positions and if we cannot maybe learn from others. for instance , you believe that a fetus is a sack of skin and the act of giving birth is squeezing this sack of skin through a vagina. ( the sack of skin then becomes a baby apparently). This is your opinion. Oxymoron or not I prefer not to describe an unborn baby as a sack of skin and I feel that the fetus should be given some protection towards the end of the pregnancy. That is my opinion. The only opinion that should not be tolerated is that we should not have an opinion.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:45 PM","abortion-debates","886"
"01-02-2009","11293",60,"chester","338569","Still wrong, I'm afraid. One more time; perhaps you will get it. If the pregnant woman believes that the ""fetus is ever worthy of protection"", the true pro-choice position supports her right to not only believe this but also to act on her belief. If a different pregnant woman, or the same pregnant woman as in example #1 but in different circumstances believes otherwise, the true pro-choice position supports her right not only to believe as she does but also to act on her belief as well. Just because that position pushes your ICK!! button doesn't delegitimize it. Frankly, what percentage of people does or does not agree with me is the most irrelevant thing you can say. Now, if you say the government should interpose itself between the pregnant woman and her choice, please describe the mechanism by which it can do so.","Another opinion","338667","You are arguing extremes and claiming that the extreme position is the only true position. In this instant, you are arguing that pro-choice means no limitations on what the woman does with her pregnancy ever for any reason, even if it means aborting a fetus one day from birth on a whim. You certainly have a right to your opinion but an opinion that carries the pro-choice arguement to the extreme is just as limited and blind as a pro-life arguement that is taken to its extreme (no abortions ever for any reason). Most people see through the limitations and hold views in between. Apparently you do not. Do you extend all arguements to these extremes? For example, when people espouse the idea of freedom, does that mean to you that they are free to do anything they want for any reason? Most people would say no. Given your logic, you would say yes. How about freedom of speech? In your logic, it would give people the right to give up state security secrets with no consequences, read XXX literature aloud in front of kindergardens, openly speak out for assasination of politicians and describe the methods best to use, etc. How about the right to bear arms? In your extreme logic, you would allow even children to carry machine guns in their school backpacks. My main point is that it is absurd to say that the only valid stance is the extreme stance. Most people can see that extreme stances are far too limited since they only see one side of the story without balancing in the other side. The truth almost always lies in the middle.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:19 PM","abortion-debates","887"

How do you propose to judge what a person's ""whim"" is, and why is it important to you do discover whether the choice is so based? The point is that individuals have the right to autonomy over their own bodies. Whether or not a woman wants to continue her pregnancy is a matter that she and she alone has the right to choose. If another individual wishes to commit suicide, that is for that person and that person alone to choose. The rest is sheer nonsense, although a case can be made under the First Amendment to advocate the assassination of an individual as an idea, just as long as it does not result in incitement. After all the First Amendment does say, ""Congress shall make NO LAW abridging freedom of speech..."" The rest is the result of judicial activism. Now, you conveniently neglect the second part. What will your restrictions be? How will they be enforced? Upon whom will the sanctions apply for violation? How much of the taxpayers' money will you dedicate to the pursuit of those who violate the restrictions? Can you not see the morass you are letting yourself be ensnared into? No, society is ill served by the entanglement with the law you propose.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:51 PM","abortion-debates","888"

Just because you choose to ignore the other considerations does not mean that they do not exist. Even legally, Roe vs Wade allowed for state interference in the third trimester. During the founding of our country and roughly the first century, British common law was followed when it came to abortions - meaning that abortions were legal up to ""quickening"" but could be made illegal afterwards. So, your extreme position exists only in your imagination - never in reality. Go ahead and imagine what you will. Only a small minority will vote in your direction. The rest of us will vote our consciences and quite freely ignore your view since it does not rest on debated logic but on unsupported claims. As to who will decide - who do you think decides in a Democracy? The elected politicians decide, limited by the Consitution and by judicial precedent of the Supreme Court. The main influence of ""we the people"" is in how we choose our politicians and I, for one, will vote for politicians that are pro-choice in the majority view of pro-choice. If the issue ever came up for largely restricting third trimester abortions, then I would write my congressman in support of it and argue in these forums in support of it in the hope of influencing some opinions. You can go ahead and keep making your unsupported claims but, so far, the only thing you have achieved is to invite flaming. If that is what you enjoy then keep on doing what you are doing. However, if you are under the opinion that you might actually be changing minds, then you are seriously deluding yourself. The only way to influence others is to debate a point where you also address the opposing points, not just keep repeating your points over and over and over and over again, ad nauseum.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","09:37 PM","abortion-debates","889"
"01-02-2009","11293",60,"None","None","None","chester","338684","And I will continue to repeat them until you get how truly simple they really are. Choice means exactly that - choice. As to the fetus, there's no THERE there; there's no person there until it's born. Now, will you please tell the forum just exactly how your proposal will work. We notice that you have not deigned to respond to a single one of the questions that was posed. I fail to understand how you can favor something, in this case restrictions on late-term abortions, in the abstract and not have a well thought out plan for legislation, complete with sanctions, for those who would violate your restrictions. Fially, one more time, can you please tell us by what method you would determine whether or not a particular woman terminated her pregnancy on a ""whim"" and what you would do with those women who you determined, by whatever method you might choose, were being whimsical. No, thank you, I prefer my arguments clear and precise; that's why I am pro-choice. Shall I repost them, or do you know what they say?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:38 PM","abortion-debates","890"
"01-03-2009","11293",60,"Another opinion","338700","Once again, as you don't seem to understand, in a Democracy, the details of a law are ironed out by politicians and experts in the field of criminal law. I can just imagine if someone were to say that murder of born people is wrong, you would expect them to outline all the punishments and all the details of every exception that exists before you would accept that statement...","chester","338710","You're sidestepping the question and abdicating your responsibility to provide details. You are the one who is suggesting restrictions or bans on third trimester abortions, therefore it is incumbent upon you to flesh out the proposal in detail. Sorry, but that is exactly what I would expect. If someone is going to take that position, the least that I would expect is that they would tell the world whether, for example, they favor capital punishment for those convicted of murdering a born person. For the record, to use your example , would you favor the death penalty for those women who aborted their fetuses on a ""whim"" one day prior to delivery? Do you feel that is the legal equivalent of the murder of a born person? If so, would you support the same penalty for each act? Let's be specific, I have 3 daughters of childbearing age and one granddaughter who soon will be. If, in a hypothetical situation, any of them were to abort their fetuses on what you would consider a ""whim"" one day prior to delivery, just what penalty would you have the law exact on them? Please be specific this time; no more vague generalities about leaving it to experts. What is YOUR proposal? Why do you who favor any restrictions on women's choice as to whether or when to terminate their pregnancies find it so difficult to put your boots on the ground and provide the consequences of your ideas? I also find it ironic that you would accuse me, a retired lawyer and law teacher, of being ignorant of either the law or its processes.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:32 AM","abortion-debates","892"
"01-03-2009","11293",60,"Another opinion","338752","Either jail time (say, a year or two), a large fine (withdrawn from the first years of their working life, not paid by their parents), or large amount of community service, depending on their circumstances (ex. less penalty for first offenders, for those who are younger, etc.) Those are just initial thoughts, not firm policy since, once again, as a voter (not a politician), it is not my responsibility nor my expertise to iron out all the details. That is the responsibility of those who are expert in criminal law and the politicians they advise. If I were in their position, I would look at the laws and consequences that exist in Western European countries with similar laws, as well as the types of exceptions and considerations made for people's circumstances (ex. if they already have kids to support, if they are first time offenders, etc.). Also, I would support punishing the doctor performing the operation. Once again, as a voter, my only responsibility is to bring up general directions. Anyone, such as yourself, who expects a full proposal is seriously delusional. Then do you deny that Roe vs Wade allows for state interference in the third trimester? How about the idea that during the founding and for the first century of the US, abortion was only freely allowed up to ""quickening"" - do you deny that? If not, then what specifically are you denying in reference to the legal aspects I mentioned?","chester","338764","Not so. The onus is on the one who proposes a change to spell out the details of that change so that the others know just what is being proposed in order that they may also participate. that was the case here in Colorado with our proposed Amendment 48. Once the people knew the details behind the seemingly innocuous wording, it was defeated 2-1. The state interference is the great weakness of Roe As far as the rest is concerned, we are not living in the ""first century of the US"", so the comment is totally irrelevant.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:35 PM","abortion-debates","894"
"01-03-2009","11293",60,"Another opinion","338767","You are mistaking me for a politician proposing a law. I am not a politician, I am simply a voter debating a topic on a forum. Just as with every other person debating here, our goal is not to propose specific laws but to debate general topics and concepts. Precedent is important in our law making. The current precedent most cited on abortion rights is the Roe vs Wade decision. You may have whatever opinion you like about its strengths and weaknesses, but that doesn't change the facts. As for the early US history of abortion, it is relevant for those who want to guess the intent of the founders in their approach to abortion rights and/or when rights start. Since they were fairly silent on the subject, the only thing one can point to is the laws that were prevelant during those times.","chester","338809","That is precisely the problem that exists with the restrictionists on this forum. You and they discuss vague generalities but fail to come to grips with the practicalities of the of the restrictions you declare yourselves in favor of. As such, the failure to consider the consequences of boots on the ground realities as they apply to a specific pregnant woman renders your positions, however restrictive they may be, irrelevant. In fact, this is common, not statutory law you are discussing. You also know but refuse to consider the fact that the common law rules were established at a very different place and time. Law is evolutionary, and the common law of the 19th Century was obviously unable to foresee the changing position of women in the 21st. Keeping the law out of this most personal and intimate issue of and for women is the simplest, most elegant solution.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:42 PM","abortion-debates","896"

What a stupid and outrageous claim! You must really, really hate women if you truly believe that women could behave in such an irresponsible way.

"01-04-2009","11293",60,"Another opinion","338956","My comment about aborting on a whim was only meant to point out to Chester that his extreme view would allow late term abortions for bogus reasons as well as for real reasons. Do keep up please before you chime in...","chester","338960","Once again, just who gets to decide what reasons are ""bogus"" and which are ""real""? I know, let's put the woman on the witness stand and ask her. Fifth Amendment prohibition against self-incrimination? Who cares, right?

"01-05-2009","11293",60,"chester","338960","Once again, just who gets to decide what reasons are ""bogus"" and which are ""real""?","Another opinion","339000","As I have said over and over, the people who decide are the usual people who decide - the elected legislature, limited by the Constitution and judicial precedent. I don't understand why you are not getting this point. You do realize that in civilizations, people are not completely free to do anything they want but that their actions are limited in circumstances that are decided by their government. In a Democracy, the people have a say in the limitations imposed on them in how they vote for politicians. It is then these politicians, limited by the constraints of the Constitution, and advised by appropriate experts, that come up with the details of the constraints (i.e. laws). This is such a basic point that I am continuing to repeat that it surprises me that you do not understand it. Laws are made by politicians and their imposition in particular cases is controlled by the justice department. Where abortions are concerned, if there was a third trimester abortion done by a doctor (under this third trimester abortion restriction scenario) for reasons other than reasons that are accepted by popular vote through the political process (ex. risk to mother's life, health, etc.), then the doctor should get punished, as well as the woman (depending on her circumstances). It is the general way in which all laws work. What is it that you don't get?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:28 AM","abortion-debates","900"
