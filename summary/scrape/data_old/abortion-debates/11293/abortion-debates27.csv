Again it boils down to effect a moral adjudication... she won't have just cause because pf her consent - she should done what was best for her in doing the most she could to avoid a situation where conception would result, and that again boils down to the predominate purpose for sex - procreation... see the house of cards closes quick on those who support promiscuous proliferation of sex on demand.

But until men can play an equal part in determining the fate of the pregnancy then they are denied their rights as the co-parent. But you don't want to acknowledge that reality, do you! If a married husband wants his pregnant wife to have their baby that she's carrying, he has no legal say if she decides to abort what is his baby too. How is that fair, right. legal or ethical by any standard of reasonableness? And if the father of a baby his girlfriend is carrying wants to keep the baby and even signs a contract saying she is relieved of all responsibility of raising the baby, why should she be allowed to kill the baby anyway? And let's reverse the question for the sake of fairplay; If the man doesn't want the baby and the woman does, it matters not to the law, he will still be forced to pay for that baby for 18 years, like it or not. So don't you dare try to hold the man culpable for her pregnancy or claim he has a role in it when no matter what the outcome, she makes all the decisions and controls the outcome based her her whims at the time. Men have been relegated to the status of sperm donors because of abortion laws, and the only way to equal the playing field is to redefine the abortion policies which right now, favors only the woman to the detriment of the man and the baby in every single case where she decides to abort her child.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:48 PM","abortion-debates","394"

You should know that the estimates of 5,000 to 10,000 deaths a year given by the pro-abortion advocates of the time was a complete and total lie. And that has been confirmed by the source of that lie as he admits that he knew he was being deceptive for the sake of the movement he was committed to. Here are the facts of the history of the actual numbers of women who died receiving illegal abortions prior to Roe's passage. Before Roe v. Wade, did 10,000 women a year die from illegal abortions? May 28, 2004 Dear Cecil: Boston Globe columnist Ellen Goodman recently wrote, ""After all, those of us who remember when birth control was illegal and when 10,000 American women a year died from illegal abortions don't have to imagine a world without choices. We were there."" I write a blog about life after abortion, and one of my co-bloggers says that the claim of 10,000 deaths is well known to be an urban legend. However, Ellen Goodman is a famous journalist, and she clearly believes that it is the truth. Is it? Emily of After Abortion, via e-mail Dear Emily: No. Establishing exactly how many women died due to botched illegal abortions is obviously impossible, since many of these deaths likely weren't reported as such. However, even a generous reading of the statistics we do have indicates that Goodman is off by a factor of ten; a stickler might say she blew it by a ratio of 250 to 1. It's not like this is a news flash, either. A reasonable approximation of the annual total in the 60s has been public knowledge for 35 years. To be fair, the number Goodman uses is consistent with estimates that were widely cited prior to the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973. But some say those numbers were knowingly inflated by proponents of abortion rights. The star witness for this claim is Bernard Nathanson, a former abortion clinic doctor who in 1969 cofounded the group now called NARAL Pro-Choice America (the letters originally stood for National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws). Since Roe, though, he's turned against his former comrades he made the highly controversial 1984 antiabortion film The Silent Scream and has authored several books describing his conversion on this issue and critiquing the abortion-rights movement. In Aborting America (1979) Nathanson writes: ""In NARAL we generally emphasized the drama of the individual case, not the mass statistics, but when we spoke of the latter it was always '5,000 to 10,000 deaths a year.' I confess that I knew the figures were totally false, and I suppose the others did too if they stopped to think of it. But in the 'morality' of our revolution, it was a useful figure, widely accepted, so why go out of our way to correct it with honest statistics?"" (Emphasis is his.) Better late than never. For 1972, the last full year before Roe, the federal Centers for Disease Control reported that 39 women died due to illegal abortion. (The death total for all abortions, including legal ones, was 88.) That figure is low, thanks to underreporting, but in any case the number of deaths had been dropping sharply for the previous few years. A statistic perhaps more typical of the pre-Roe era was reported in a 1969 Scientific American article cowritten by Christopher Tietze, a senior fellow with the Population Council: ""The National Center for Health Statistics listed 235 deaths from abortion in 1965. Total mortality from illegal abortions was undoubtedly larger than that figure, but in all likelihood it was under 1,000."" Had the number been higher in still earlier years? Yes. Tietze comments in his article that ""some 30 years ago [i.e., around 1940], it was judged that such deaths might number 5,000 to 10,000 per year."" He gives no source, but if we turn to W. Cates et al (""Trends in national abortion mortality, United States, 1940-1974,"" Advances in Planned Parenthood, 1976), we find that 1,682 abortion-related deaths were officially reported in 1940. If we guess that this figure represents roughly a quarter of actual mortality due to illegal abortion, we get 6,800 deaths somewhere below the middle of the range given by Tietze, whereas Ellen Goodman's number is at the very top. But that was in 1940, remember. I didn't Google Ms. Goodman to determine when she was born; I'll just say that if she's pushing 80, as her statement ""those of us who remember when 10,000 American women a year died from illegal abortions"" would imply, she's remarkably well preserved. None of this argues for or against abortion, but the claim that legalization has prevented the deaths of thousands upon thousands of women doesn't hold up. Roe v. Wade saved some lives, but the numbers were small reported deaths due to illegal abortion declined from 39 in 1972 to 5 in 1974. The biggest factor in reducing abortion mortality was undoubtedly the overall improvement in prenatal and obstetrical care after World War II. The rate of pregnancy-related deaths from causes other than abortion dropped at roughly the same pace as the abortion death rate from 1940 through 1974 (though abortion-related deaths did decline faster after 1965, which Cates attributes largely to advances in contraception and the state-by-state relaxation or repeal of abortion laws). Self-induced and back-alley abortions were becoming a thing of the past long before Roe: sex researcher Alfred Kinsey estimated in the 1950s that around 85 percent of illegal abortions were performed by physicians, even if the physicians weren't all in good standing. The fact is that prior to legalization abortion had become relatively safe and easy to obtain for those who could afford it. Studies done at the time show that the risks were borne disproportionately by those who couldn't, mostly minorities. Were abortion to be recriminalized, that would likely be the case again. The Straight Dope: Before <em>Roe</em> v. <em>Wade</em>, did 10,000 women a year die from illegal abortions? Now, notice that [I]For 1972, the last full year before Roe, the federal Centers for Disease Control reported that 39 women died due to illegal abortion. (The death total for all abortions, including legal ones, was 88.)/I] So the fact is that 39 women died from illegal abortions but 10 more than that, or 49 women who received LEGAL abortions that year died. More died from legal than illegal. So the problem with the so called facts which are thrown around by the abortion proponents and often cited by honestly sincere people are fallacious and blatantly dishonest since they were lying in order to accomplish their agenda. Just some food for thought for your consideration.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:01 PM","abortion-debates","399"

Feminism has historically been opposed to child labor and other exploitation of children, feminism has stood for the incredible values of women's unpaid labors in our society, feminism has stood for the protection of families through fair compensation for labor, i.e., making a ""living"" wage, meaning making enough money through hard work to keep a roof over one's head, food in one's belly and access to medical care and decent education, ideas that are anathema to conservatives.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:01 PM","abortion-debates","401"

That's about as close as a man could get to knowing what it would be like to have a forced pregnancy. Imagine a woman whose trained all her life for some career or another but had to give up her chance (let's say she's an astronaut) because her birth control failed. If men can tell women what they can and can't do with their body, our society can never be fully just. Having an abortion must surely be the hardest decision a woman could ever make and I'm sure many regret it forever.
