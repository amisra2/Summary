Do you think it will make a difference in our approach to the main concept of when abortion rights should be limited?","Steeeeve","339235","I don't mind interjecting here and pointing out that Chester has been banned on these forums many times which shows the style of posting you are dealing with. With that in mind, this is simply a diversion tactic for debating. So that is your answer to why Chester is asking for details when this is an illogical part of the current question you pose.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:38 PM","abortion-debates","916"

The use of false dichotomies is a weak debting technique.

Why are you using diversion as a debating technique as well? Nothing I said was a false dichotomy. Finally, it is ironic that you now place value on ""person"" when you didn't in your previous arguments. Hypocritical posts and fallacies are just your style I suppose. People who have been banned have a ""banned"" tag on their name. Go back and look at your previous accounts to see them (such as bhbcu64). Furthermore, it is a know fact from private discussions that you have had many accounts on here.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","09:24 AM","abortion-debates","919"
"01-07-2009","11293",62,"chester","339233","Certainly it does. Check the number of variables required by a restrictionist regime with the much fewer required under a woman-controlled system. You will find that the phenomenon of the freedom of women, which is a detectable reality, is far better explained with no restrictions.","Another opinion","339277","Of course, the simplest system of all would be to have no laws all together. That would allow everyone full freedom of action and would certainly save all the hastle and costs of courts, legislatures, etc. After all, every person in existence is responsible and would never consider taking any wrongful actions. Anyone thinking otherwise is simply disrespectful to humanity and arrogant in their belief that someone might actually consider taking irresponsible action. Either way, how can anyone possibly properly judge whether someone's actions are irresponsible or not. Since nobody is a perfect judge, the logical conclusion is that there should be no judges or laws......... I personally prefer the current version of reality to your logic about women and abortion since it is quite absurd when applied to the rest of reality.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:20 AM","abortion-debates","920"

Another Opinion never said the alternative to abolitions of laws restricting abortion is abolition of law. Another Opinion simply pointed out that using the simplest solution doesn't work here and furthermore your idea wasn't the simplest.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:50 AM","abortion-debates","922"

I do think that, once a general direction of restrictions is decided on (if that ever happens), then it is important to debate the second point of how to enforce those restrictions and the questions of punishments then becomes important. However, Chester seems to be blind to the fact that punishments are a secondary point to the introduction of the laws themselves and don't really affect that main point. I am curious. What specific rule was Chester banned on?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:53 AM","abortion-debates","923"

Once again, false dichotomy.","Another opinion","339283","You seem to claim that: 1) All women are responsible in their decisions on abortion and/or 2) No justice would be qualified to decide whether or not a woman's decision on abortion is justified. Those were the two points that I was extrapolating to the rest of reality. Do you deny either of those two points?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:55 AM","abortion-debates","924"

Unless and until you can come up with a definition of ""responsible"", I have no clue what you are talking about. Once again, who decides what ""responsible"" is? What guidelines do they use? How were the guidelines established? Who is to say whether the guidelines, which are ""one size fits all"" are applicable in a particular situation? Why do YOU feel the law has the right to hold a veto over a woman's choice? #2 is an absolutely correct statement. No justice should have the right to supersede a woman's choice of whether or not to continue her pregnancy, or to decide whather her choice is ""justified"". It is simply in none of my, your, the justice's, or society's business. Finally, why are you demanding answers from me when you have none of your own to my questions? Unlike you, I have given great thought to the consequences of my POV. Please note that my POV does not require me to have a position on the ultimate question. I defer to each and every pregnant woman, as I am simply do not have the right to an opinion on the topic. I'm done answering until you come up with some of your own answers.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:13 PM","abortion-debates","925"

"01-07-2009","11293",62,"gansao","339203","If there were a grave danger to the mother them really ( in my opinion) there can be no objection to a termination. If the fetus was so well developed that an anesthetic was required to relieve it's suffering then how can a civilized society justify destroy it without a compelling reason. Anesthetic or not! I personally think that abortions should be freely ( but not free!) available until the fetus develops into the fetus that we discussed.( not very good English I'm afraid!) This would mean in fact, that very ,very few abortions would be refused.","Another opinion","339318","It looks like we are in fairly close agreement, then, about abortion rights - freely available in roughly the first and second trimester, but restricted from around the beginning of the third trimester when the fetus can develop some level of mind / mental existence. It may or may not surprise you to know that most pro-choice proponents would support third trimester abortion restrictions - since 84% of Americans support generally restricting third trimester abortions (minus exceptions) while about half of Americans are pro-choice, that would make ~68% of pro-choice proponents supportive of third trimester abortion restrictions. Only 10% of Americans support Chester or Shooterandproud's position of no abortion restrictions ever. Those statistics are from a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll from 2003 (the latest poll I found dividing by trimesters, and very similar to poll results taken years earlier) that can be found on pollingreport.com/abortion.htm . It is interesting to note that the poll also shows that about 2/3rds of Americans support first trimester abortion rights - which would include a minority of pro-life supporters. Also, that poll shows that about 2/3rds of Americans would also restrict second trimester abortions (though that would translate to a minority of pro-choice supporters). I've never met someone who would set those limits (setting the limits at the end of the first trimester) so I never have heard the reasoning behind that. There are many pro-choice supporters on this forum, silent as most have been lately, that hold the majority pro-choice view (as you and I hold) that limits abortions only in late term - mainly for the same type of reasoning about mental existence / sentience, etc.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:22 PM","abortion-debates","928"
