More particularly, if you are male, are you willing to impose YOUR truth on pregnant women? Again, if so, why? If you are female, are you willing to impose YOUR truth on other women? Why?","trebor","338060","I personally find this to be a reasonable concept. The third trimester does seem to be when the brain starts functioning properly. In addition, abortions after the second trimester become increasingly dangerous for the woman. If you notice, another opinion DID say that that there are limited exceptions to this. I suggest that the limited exceptions are specific medical reasons. On the other hand, I don't think that any woman , after carrying a fetus for 6 months, will suddenly think ""Oh, I don't want to bring a child into the world'. While that might happen, I am sure that would be a very strong exception to the reason most late term abortions are preformed. I will say that when it comes to restricting or allowing abortion, the primary concern is the health/well being of the woman.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","04:07 PM","abortion-debates","856"

"12-30-2008","11293",58,"chester","338062","In either case, the question still remains. Why are you willing to have YOUR truth become THE truth for all pregnant women?","Another opinion","338258","For the same reason that YOU are willing to have YOUR truth become THE truth for all pregnant women and fetuses. Perhaps it has escaped your notice, but we are living in a democracy, not a dictatorship. In Democracies, people DO have opinions on various issues and vote accordingly. The Constitution does protect the populace from the temporary fads or illogic of the populace by setting certain limits. Where fetal vs women's rights are concerned, the Constitution was not sufficiently precise, which has led to a lot of back-and-forth about abortion rights. Roe vs Wade is the current standard for the limits of restrictions on abortion rights but even Roe vs Wade allows the state to interfere in the third trimester. The reason Roe vs Wade gives is viability since, at the time, there was insufficient evidence or concensus to make any conclusions about the ""personhood"" question, so it left that question open. The personhood question is one of the questions that we are debating here. Either way, your accusation is bogus and illogical. Not only are you not on legal ground in claiming that abortions should be legal always for all reasons, but also only 10% of Americans share your opinion. In a Democracy, that means that you have no reasonable ground to stand on and any accusation of others overstepping their mandate by expressing their opinion rings hollow when your view represents such an extreme minority.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:56 PM","abortion-debates","861"

This is not an outdated law. This is a law still agreed apon as withstanding in the millennium by both society, government and judicial arms. It may not be agreed or approved by all, it never was when it was invoked, but it has withstood all those who attempt to over rule it.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","07:36 PM","abortion-debates","863"

Most people in the US, as well as the justices who decided Roe vs Wade, view that she doesn't have that absolute right but that it does stop somewhere since, unlike you, they do place value or rights in the fetus at least at some stage during the pregnancy. The fact that you don't is unique to you and to the other ~10% of Americans that agree with that opinion of yours that you would like to make law. You only look at one set of rights (the woman's) while ignoring or claiming nonexistence of another set of rights (the fetuses). That is as extreme an opinion as those on the pro-life side who do the opposite (ignoring the woman's rights while stating that fetal rights are paramount). Most people in the US lie somewhere between the two extremes. Just because you do not consider that your view is an opinion, doesn't mean that it isn't an opinion and that there aren't other perfectly defendable views. I do believe that you genuinely believe what you say, but you are simply deluding yourself into thinking yourself unbiased.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","07:39 PM","abortion-debates","864"

However, if a consensus did emerge as to when ""personhood"" (or the beginning of rights) starts, then that would open the possibility of new judicial review and/or legislation. I continue the debates in this forum in the likely unrealistic hope that such a consensus might someday emerge. It certainly will never emerge if we don't debate the topic at all. Also, Roe vs Wade is not guaranteed to stand forever since it represents one of many styles of jurisprudence. Republicans have made many attempts to bring in justices who espouse other styles of jurisprudence which, once they reach a majority, risk overturning Roe vs Wade. Therefore, another reason I hold (probably also unrealistic) is that discussions such as these between the two sides could help us reach some sort of compromise.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","07:46 PM","abortion-debates","865"

I do shudder at the thought though. Absolutely Maybe, but even with the republicans holding office for so long and now with the democrat rule the idea seems even more unlikely. Hmmm, I'm curious, i like the way you think What would be your idea of a compromise though?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:16 PM","abortion-debates","866"
"12-31-2008","11293",58,"Another opinion","338383","Note: a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll from 2003 (the latest that asked such question) had 84% of people in support of third trimester restrictions, ~2/3rds of people in support of second trimester restrictions, and ~2/3rds of people saying that first trimester abortions should be generally legal (only ~30% thinking otherwise). Anyway, that shows that, from the point of view of popular support in a Democracy in the US, pure democracy would decide on abortion restrictions starting somewhere between the beginning and the end of the second trimester.","chester","338392","In other words, a majority of Americans would interpose the law between a woman and her choice as to whether or not to continue her pregnancy. And we worry about the nanny state when it comes to health care? This strikes me as orders of magnitude scarier. Once again, this is an area where the law must needs be silent. No, AO, that's not an opinion on abortion; rather, it's a position on the legitimate reach of the law. Why are you restrictionists so afraid to trust women to make decisions in their own interest? Conversely, why are you so eager to impose your view on women who might not share it?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:00 PM","abortion-debates","868"

You, I, and the law must needs be silent on the topic.[/QUOTE] This would be a reasonable argument if you consider the unborn child to be nothing more than a piece of flesh, a wart, a cancer that can and should be removed if required by the patient. If you consider the unborn child to be a seperate entity from the mother then it should be protected even if it means protecting it from its own mother! If one has the view that the mother should have the right to terminate the birth at any time between the conception and natural term, then the merits of that view should be considered. If one feels that we should be silent in deference to that view then at least this part of it has no value( This a debating site. Keeping quite about a subject because one man thinks that his view is undeniably right kind of stifles the debate!)","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:36 PM","abortion-debates","869"
