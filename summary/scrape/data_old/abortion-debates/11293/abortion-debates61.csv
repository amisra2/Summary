I get the impression that you expect the level of detail that a politician would present in a complete packaged bill that would be presented to Congress. If that is the case, then it is very unrealistic since that is not the purpose of these forums. We are not presenting packaged bill proposals but debating general concepts. Heck, even many bills presented to Congress do not include specifics about the types of punishments imposed. Either way, if we cannot agree on the most general directions for abortion rights, it makes no sense to start ironing out all the details. Currently, the abortion debate ranges the gamut from no abortions ever to abortions allowed always. One has to address step one (when or if to ever limit abortion rights) before one goes to step two (how to enforce that limit). You are putting the cart before the horse. That includes specific penalties. As for the reasons that are considered valid or unvalid, that is why I brought up the idea of exceptions many posts ago. In my view, these would include the ones that are often sited in these forums - risk to mother's life, significant risk to her health, risk of significantly deformed fetus, rape, incest, etc. If someone comes up with another exception worth considering, then they are free to present it here for debate. The health exception would also have to be debated in more detail since those on the pro-life side do have a point that automatically assuming that ANYTHING can be claimed as a health exception is also unreasonable. I tried to start a thread here on that once but it didn't get very far. Either way, nothing we say here matters much anyway except in how it affects our decision-making when it comes to electing our politicians, or in how we respond to polls about abortion rights. Again, it is the politicians we elect who decide. We could only give them input through polls, letters to our Congressmen, etc. about what type of laws we would support. As a last point, I really don't see the reason why you are pushing so hard for us to iron out details of the punishments this early in the debate (again putting the cart before the horse). Do you think it will make a difference in our approach to the main concept of when abortion rights should be limited?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:48 PM","abortion-debates","902"

Once again, you fail to deal with the implications of this statement. Who gets to decide whether the reasons are valid or invalid in a particular case? What standards do they use? Who decides whether the standards used a re valid or not? What, if any, appeal from the decision would be permitted? Just so. That's exactly why I asked you what you would say to your Congresscritter were you to write to her or him. You still have not responded. Because you are proposing that the government interfere with the choices a woman makes. That necessarily involves the legal process. If there are going to be restrictions in place, then there must needs be some sanction in the law if it is to have any force whatsoever. It therefore becomes incumbent on the restrictionists to spell out in detail just what the law's sanctions will be and upon whom they will be applied.

"01-05-2009","11293",61,"gansao","338635","Once again, this your opinion. You are entitled to your opinion whatever it may be. What you are not entitled to do is feel that your opinion is so 'right' that others cannot have a different opinion. I may trash your opinion , you may hate my opinion. So what! It is up to each of us to defend our positions and if we cannot maybe learn from others. for instance , you believe that a fetus is a sack of skin and the act of giving birth is squeezing this sack of skin through a vagina. ( the sack of skin then becomes a baby apparently). This is your opinion. Oxymoron or not I prefer not to describe an unborn baby as a sack of skin and I feel that the fetus should be given some protection towards the end of the pregnancy. That is my opinion. The only opinion that should not be tolerated is that we should not have an opinion.","Shooterandproud","339086","I am in completely agree, and the law should remain this way. You should be free to practice your opinion, and I should be free to practice mine. Don't like abortions? Don't have one. Simple as that.

You are asking for detailed specifics before this forum has even come anywhere close to a consensus about whether or when abortion rights should be restricted. Again, we are not politicians here presenting bills but voters debating general topics. This is something that you just don't seam to get. Since you are the first person I have seen who expect this, on any forum over at least five years of my participation in forums, it seems that your expectations are not shared by anyone else but yourself. Yes, theoretically, I could sit down, start taking time to review the procedures that they have in UK and the rest of Europe, try to figure out what if any parts of that could be adapted to the US. Also, it would require me to sit down and look at the specifics in how laws are translated into legal punishments here, the flexibility or lack thereof of justices in determining particular sentences, etc. If a third trimester restriction would someday be implemented then that would eventually be necessary but not by me (where I am far from an expert) but by the politicians and legal experts who have the time and expertise and power to implement such policy. My going through such efforts would be a complete waste of time since I have no power to implement such changes and since it adds nothing to the general point that is being debated about whether or when to restrict abortion rights. As I said before, you are putting the cart before the horse and have unrealistic and waste-of-time expectations that nobody else I have ever encountered on forum participation over five years has ever expected. Therefore, I feel no responsibility to come up with details that are not more than initial guesses or gut reactions. If you think that such expectations are reasonable, then show me a quote of someone in this forum who outlined the type of details you suggest - on any topic, not just abortion. Then, I will see that it is not purely loopiness on your side but that at least one other person conceded to such unrealistic expectations.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:28 AM","abortion-debates","905"

One who formerly posted here suggested a fine of $5K for the physician and one of $2.5K for the woman. Another poster suggested life in prison for both. Be that as it may, we are left with the conclusion that you have not fully thought out the implications of your proposal. Unless and until you do, I would suggest that it is difficult to take what you put forth seriously. Ideas have consequences, and you need to consider them prior to staking out a POV. I realize that sounds condescending, but that is not my intent. The implication of the thought that each woman needs to have the right to make the choice for herself with the law remaining silent is simple; it is the autonomy of women. If that pushes some folks' ICK! button, they are perfectly free to do whatever their values impel them to do.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:40 AM","abortion-debates","906"

The imposition of punishments is a second and independent step to the idea that something should be legal or illegal. The only reason not to debate the first step on its own (i.e. whether or when to impose limits) is if no execution of such a law would be possible. That is not the case. You still have not made the point of why one would need to go into the details of punishment before one makes a consensus of what it would be that one would be punishing for. As for the two examples you brought up of people's proposed punishments, those are the type of gut reactions that you would expect from people that I was hesitant in giving since gut reactions are rarely well thought out. For example, a $5k fine for a doctor is negligible compared to what he makes in a year and will hardly serve as a deterent, as will $2.5k for a woman of reasonable means, while $2.5k might be utterly unaffordable for someone who is barely surviving from paycheck to paycheck or living on welfare. The life sentences imposed on a woman with a family would cause much more harm than good. I already mentioned my gut reaction solution in an earlier post ""Either jail time (say, a year or two), a large fine (withdrawn from the first years of their working life, not paid by their parents), or large amount of community service, depending on their circumstances (ex. less penalty for first offenders, for those who are younger, etc.)"". At least I had the honesty to say that these are initial thoughts and that, since I am not an expert, full decisions on punishment would have to be taken up by those that are. The only general statement I will make is that any punishment should be harsh enough to serve as a deterent, but not so harsh as to stop the person from continuing some level of normal life (though not necessarily as good as if it were blemish-free), and which should take into account extenuating circumstances - ex. family to support, first time offender, age of offender, mental state, etc. So, you have not given examples of people who have given full thought to the type of details you asked for but of people who have given you gut reactions out of pressure. Fine, I already gave you the same gut reactions. If you want more detail than that, then show me an example of someone who gave you more detail.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:04 PM","abortion-debates","907"

For me, the significant criteria I use is whether or not the fetus might have what I generically term a ""mental existence"". From that point, I view that it deserves rights. It seems that your reasoning is similar. However, I do have a couple of questions. First, you say that you would limit late term abortions because the fetus can experience stress and pain. My understanding is that, for necessary late term abortions (ex. to save the mother's life, etc.), there are anesthetics that can be used to keep the fetus from suffering. Since such anesthetics exist, that would take away any suffering of the fetus for abortions that are done for any reason. Is it, then, the suffering alone that guides your protest against late term abortions? Secondly, where do you draw the line between fully allowed abortions (for any reasons) and restricted abortion rights? End of second trimester?

If the fetus was so well developed that an anesthetic was required to relieve it's suffering then how can a civilized society justify destroy it without a compelling reason. Anesthetic or not! I personally think that abortions should be freely ( but not free!) available until the fetus develops into the fetus that we discussed.( not very good English I'm afraid!)
