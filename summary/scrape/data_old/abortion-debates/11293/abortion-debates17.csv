Anyone his age who is so irresponsible as to make these kinds of unfounded accusations against opponents who simply disagree with him, in this day and age, is way to dangerous to deal with at all. Beside being a sick accusation to make, it could put us at peril legally, and I didn't come to this forum to end up being accused of being an internet stalker.","Shooterandproud","321197","Using your buddy to team up on me will not help the situation at all. I notice that there is nothing in this post of Archie's that is anything productive. All I see is name calling, and derogatory insults. When will you grow up and actually get a real argument. I am seriously sick of you following around on this forum and calling me a ""child"". Calling me a child is like calling a black person the N word. I don't like it, and I do not want to be referred to that way. Sure, I'm younger than you (just like a black person is blacker than a white person), but it gives you no right to insult me and dismiss my arguments. Your serious insults and the terms you use to describe me leave me no choice but to report your actions. I'm not accusing you of anything. I'm just saying you implied that I should prove the things I did in real life. I refused. You freak out. All I say is that it looks a little suspicious. You make tons of arguments and accusations that IMO no one in their right mind would make, then when I tell you I do this, you say ""uh huh, sure"" like you're wanting me to prove it. I'm not accusing you of anything, I'm just saying for safety reasons I will not prove the statement I made before.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:49 PM","abortion-debates","243"

Please note that, once you scratch the veneer off the profetallifers, they stand revealed as not the type you would want to have borrow a cup of sugar from. They have no understanding of sweetness. BTW, the babe throws the word ""Marxist"" around as though it were a BAD thing. My mother's first Presidential vote was for William Z. Foster, and I will bet that the babe doesn't even know who that is. I continue a proud family tradition!","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","07:07 PM","abortion-debates","244"

Glad to know you approve of female infanticide and government sterilization Chester. What an American you are! And to think, you are allowed near children, it makes my skin crawl! ...babe The babe still uses the word ""Commie"" as though it were a bad thing. When in doubt, she also hurls unsupported accusations that she knows she cannot back up.

"08-25-2008","11293",17,"None","None","None","Another opinion","321359","Though I haven't been really following this latest interchange in any detail (I generally stop listening once conversations turn to mutual flaming), I did notice a couple of tangential issues come up that are worth addressing. One is the single child policy in China. I had a chance to travel to China in 2006 and this issue came up in conversation. As I understand it, women who get pregnant while already having a child are not directly forced to get an abortion. However, there are large fines associated with having more than one child and the second child is discriminated against by the system - in school, etc. So, the difficulties associated with having more than one child effectively forces most families to opt for abortion. I have mixed feelings about the one child policy. I would love families to be able to have full choice about their reproductive rights. However, I can see that, on a societal level, the overpopulation that would result in China would have many bad reprecusions. According to their statistics, the one child policy has resulted in a population that is 300 to 400 million people smaller than it would have been if this policy had not been put into place. Chinese have traditionally had large families since children were expected to support their parents in old age. Because of this expectation of support, there has been an unintended consequence of the one child policy where female fetuses have been disproportionally aborted compared to male fetuses since sons are thought, usually accurately, to be better providers for aging parents than daughters (except if daughters marry rich or have good careers of their own). The country does not have a social security system as we do. People have to largely fend for themselves. So, it is not an easy situation there with no easy answers. As for communism, my folks immigrated to the US from communist Poland in the 60s so I have had fairly direct feedback about communist systems, as they had turned out in reality. Though the poorest of the poor might find some benefit in communist systems, the great majority of upper lower class, middle class, and rich certainly live better lives under the restrained forms of Capitalism prevalent in the West. I would think that the main problems with Communism are that the system fails to give people incentives to work hard since you get the same salary and career benefits whether you are a slacker or a hard worker - inspiring most people to be slackers. Also, there seems to be a lack of what I would call ""corruption control mechanisms"". Essentially, there was little if any accountability for failed programs - only political accountability for criticising the wrong person or even criticising the system in general. That is a recipe for corrupt oligarchies and essentially fascist systems. However, many conservatives seem to equate the social democracies that one finds in modern day Europe with communism, which is absurd. Countries such as Sweden are democracies but much of their industry is state owned and the state has more control over the practices of industry. The average salaries are quite high, and people apparently do feel a sense of freedom just as we do. I have heard that, compared to the US, whether or not such a system is beneficial depends on your socio-economic standing. The taxes are high but you get a lot of benefits from those taxes - safety nets, social programs, etc. There is a smaller spread in salaries - which tends to benefit the poorer to central middle class. However, it is not as beneficial a place to live if one is ambitious or has an entreprenereal spirit. I knew a successful Swedish engineer who stayed in the US after graduate schoold for precisely the reason that he knew that, at his level, he could be more successful in the US. So, social democracies have both advantages and disadvantages. Anyway, those are a few thoughts on some of the issues brought up here. Rarely can one put one line answers to issues and be accurate. Even these paragraphs are simplifications of the real situation. I just decided to include these to demonstrate that sound-byte answers are just not suited to reality - which is almost always much more complex.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:00 AM","abortion-debates","253"

It was pure and simple military dictatorship. As to the social democracies of Scandinavia and France prior to Sarkozy, the trade off is well worth it. Universal health care, college attendance and all the rest of the social benefits that accrue are eliminating poverty and destitution, because of the simple principal that the world of Thomas Hobbes with its war of each against all is simply untenable in this time. It's no accident that poll after poll shows the Danes to be the happiest people on earth.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:40 AM","abortion-debates","254"
