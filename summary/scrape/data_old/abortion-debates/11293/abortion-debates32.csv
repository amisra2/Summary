I will say this: JH: Sexist rhetoric gets the debate nowhere and makes your fellow conservatives look bad. You are welcome to hold your anti-female beliefs, however you're just fueling the stereotype that all anti-abortionist males are sexist. You should stop.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:35 PM","abortion-debates","466"

You want to limit the discussion to dollars and cents when abortion is an issue of life and death and giving individuals the right to make that choice for another innocent bystander who did absolutely nothing to create the situation they are expected to die for. That just isn't true at all. My plan outlined how the social issues could be self sustaining based on the moneys earned from the legal abortions which are allowed to take place. And again, morality has never been, and should never be determined by the monetary costs of doing the right and ethical thing. Doing the right thing may cost more, but never have we refused to do the right thing because it's too expensive, and the day we do that, we become no better than the societies we condemn for placing the States interests over the rights of the people. But why would i expect someone who respects communism to get that?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","07:49 AM","abortion-debates","468"

The simple fact is that the LAW says, and has said for the past 35 years, that a woman has the right to choose whether or not to continue her pregnancy. End of that discussion. Now, as to the money involved, frankly many of us are sick to death of the platitudinous bloviations of the righttofetallifers here. Why not let us know just how many dollars of folks' tax money you are willing to spend in pursuit of your impossible dream? Why not let us know just what type of Draconian restrictions you are willing to put on people in pursuit of your impossible dream? Why not let us know why you are willing to sacrifice, for example, the educations of real, born people in order to throw money at your impossible dream? We are constantly told in the USA that we cannot solve problems in the country by throwing money at them, yet that is just what you propose. If you were faced with spending our money on weapons for our military or establishing checkpoints that would prohibit pregnant women from traveling from states with restrictive abortion laws to those with liberal laws, which would you choose?

Why not let us know just how many dollars of folks' tax money you are willing to spend in pursuit of your impossible dream? Why not let us know just what type of Draconian restrictions you are willing to put on people in pursuit of your impossible dream? The right to life is not ""draconian,"" rather laws protecting life are right, and just. Why not let us know why you are willing to sacrifice, for example, the educations of real, born people in order to throw money at your impossible dream? The unborn are real, and they are human people. Whether or not they have traveled down the birth canal does not have any affect on their humanity whatsoever. The life is what we are protecting. When lives are devalued, all lives lose value . We are constantly told in the USA that we cannot solve problems in the country by throwing money at them, yet that is just what you propose. If you were faced with spending our money on weapons for our military or establishing checkpoints that would prohibit pregnant women from traveling from states with restrictive abortion laws to those with liberal laws, which would you choose? (Not that I expect a straight answer.) One component to solving our social problems is giving a good education to all, that means to teach the truth about our origins and the worth of each human. No guns are necessary. It is a fact that mothers are less likely to kill their own unborn child once the are educated with an ultrasound of him or her in utero.
