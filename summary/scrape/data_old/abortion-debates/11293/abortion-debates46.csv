A fetus is just as much a part of a woman's body as a tumor, and she is free to remove neither, one or the other, or both as she chooses and as her free will determines.","nononsense","337196","Pure malarky. What is a body? No woman has two bodies. Every unborn child in its womb depends on its mother for nurturing. Why would anyone suggest that she go to a man wearing a white coat wielding a sharp knife to cut the child out of its place of comfort and protection. It is egregious that such a thing is promoted, and furthermore that she is expected to pay for it. No woman has two of every limb, organ and blood type! Stop promoting such foolishness!","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:16 PM","abortion-debates","676"
"12-18-2008","11293",46,"nononsense","337195","Now, are you going to continue to have tantrums? I am sure that you have not realized it, but you have been misled considering the first amendment to the US Constitution and the reasoning from which it came into existence. Perhaps you did not know that all of the signers of the Declaration of Independence were Christians. They were members of different churches, and so the idea was to avoid favoring one church over the other....and make it a state church. Also, it is important to note that all of our founding fathers had ""faith,"" and faith in God is not prohibited in political nor public life, but is rather desired. More importantly for one to realize is that Atheism and Humanism are religions. When you take God out of political and public life you are thus promoting a religion....and that is violating our Constitution. Belief in God is not a religion, it is a relationship with our Creator. All throughout American history from the New England Primer used to teach the alphabet to children in school to the prayer of every Supreme Court Justice, belief in God is and has been very important to America. Forsaking God will lead to much trial and pain in America if all knowledge of him is removed from the public square.","chester","337197","Again, this is germane to the topic in what ways? Rhett Butler's riposte to Scarlett seems apropos. People can believe any fool thing they want as far as I care. What they do not have the right to do is to impose their foolishness on those whose traditions are different. If you believe that abortion is wrong, by all means put your belief into practice in your family; just leave my family alone.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:37 PM","abortion-debates","677"

That is nonsense. Human development is systematic and purposeful with a set timetable. Information of an intelligent nature is the cause of it. In matters of truth, opinions don't matter. If any so-called human rights group promotes hurting and killing and maming, then they are deceivers of the worst kind. I don't care what they say. We all began at the beginning of conception. We have all begun at the beginning, not at the end, and not in the middle, but at the beginning of our being.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:26 PM","abortion-debates","686"

What IS it about you folks anyway that you feel that you must call those whose opinions differ from yours ""nuts""? Get this, Jack, as a man, I have no right to an opinion on the subject of abortion. That's a matter for each pregnant woman, not you, not I, and certainly not the nanny state, to decide based on her judgment and the exercise of her free will. Now, let's see some nuts and bolts of just how you would put your ban into operation. What laws would you pass? How would you enforce them? What would the penalties be for breaking them? Upon whom would the penalties be assessed? How much money would you allocate to your silly crusade? Where would the money come from? My taxes? Don't wait up! Why don't you end the pontification and bloviation and deal with the real world of THIS pregnant woman right before you? You know, the teenager who was raped by her funny uncle, the woman who was told that bearing another child would kill her, in fact, ANY woman. YOU tell her what the law says regarding the power of the state and how it will make her a slave to her fetus. BTW, I have three daughters of childbearing age and two granddaughters who soon will be. The choice is theirs, and woe betide any of you profetallifers who would dare take it from them.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:28 PM","abortion-debates","687"

I read a whole commentary of people in this situation who did not find it nonsense. So again i ask, would you declare your right to existence if it condemned your mother into devastation? You wont answer will you? ... i'd wager no. If you were to say 'yes' you would force her it would identify a most unfavorable description of yourself. If you would chose not to force your existence onto your mother then you would be welcomed into the pro-choice camp. A logic also unfavourable to you. By preaching pro-life that is exactly what you are doing to woman in situations of sexually abusive distress. Forcing your existence and consequences apon them unwillingly. You would remove your mothers choice, should she have chosen not to have you after such violent force of conception. You would have forced your mother to have you ... bravo.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:48 PM","abortion-debates","690"
