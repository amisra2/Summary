But nonwhite women in this country face both, and suffer real consequences as a result: African-American women are four times more likely than white women to die in childbirth .","simone","313710","Then why does the following occur?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:07 PM","abortion-debates","4"
"07-29-2008","11293",1,"None","None","None","Ellen","318092","Why does it occur? Because black women have significantly less access to proper health care. The best solution to such a problem is most certainly not to make abortions readily available. Even disregarding the moral implications, that leaves quite a number of health issues (many that can also lead to death) which are not taken care of. Now to the topic at hand. Yes, every woman has the right to survive pregnancy. But every person has a right to life. And the right to survive pregnancy CANNOT overrule the most basic right to life (it was mentioned first in the Declaration of Independence for a reason). Not when the chance for complications for the mother is only that - a chance. And not when other measures can be taken to ensure the mother's life. And most definitely not when the abortion is merely a matter of convenience for the mother.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:20 AM","abortion-debates","5"

Your logic is as inconsistent as it is irrational. Is a tomato that is too young to pick yet, not a tomato yet? Is a goat that is too young to give milk, not a goat yet? Of coarse not on both counts. Then why do you people insist that a child which is not yet ready to be born is not yet human or deserving of human rights yet? Especially since it's undeniable on all counts that you yourself were once in their exact position and have personally seen what a fetus can become if only allowed to grow.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:24 PM","abortion-debates","7"

"07-29-2008","11293",1,"sinjin","318127","Is an egg a chicken?","Archangel","318129","What I marvel at is that you're not even embarrassed to ask such an ignorant question. Because if it's a chicken egg, and if it's allowed to incubate to term, it sure isn't going to be a crow when it hatches. And to be even more simplistic, a chicken egg is still a chicken while it's in the egg. Just as a human being is still a human being in the womb.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:06 PM","abortion-debates","9"

We aren't talking about ""if allowed to incubate"", we are talking at a specific point in its development. Are you already in fact an angel? You shouldn't marvel that I'm not embarrassed, I've no shame whatsoever despite early and intensive indoctrination designed to fill me with it.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:13 PM","abortion-debates","10"

So far, any discussion that I have had with you on the subject on other threads comes down to the idea that you think that what WILL BE is the same as what currently IS. So, if an embryo or zygote will become a full human that we cherish, that means that it already is a full human to be cherished (while you also ignore that the unfertilized egg only needs one extra step and it also WILL BE a full human being). Potential seems to be your sole arguement. Otherwise, if there is more to your arguement than purely the value you place on potential, then answer me this... If, immediately after conception, the zygote/embryo stopped growing so that it really was only the small batch of human cells, then would you still value it enough to force the woman to carry it forever after? If not, why not? If so, then why? After all, the only difference between the hypothetical embryo I just described and a real one is its potential. Take away that potential, and this is what you would have.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:33 PM","abortion-debates","11"

And no human being picks and chooses which eggs will fertilize or not. If the embryo stopped growing after conception, that means that it died and would automatically be flushed out of the woman's body during her next menstrual cycle. It is a totally natural process. And I marvel that you are so ill informed that you think we could dictate whether the woman continues to carry dead cells or not. And on the obverse of your argument, your question also makes my point regarding the value of the embryos life. And that is that the evidence of its unique value as a human being is that it as a fertilized egg, it grows at all. Growth = life, and life = value as a human being.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:59 PM","abortion-debates","12"

It's not a chicken until it hatches, and it's not a person until it's born. Even so, no one, not you, not I, not the law - NO ONE - has the right to dictate to a pregnant woman whether or not to continue her pregnancy.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:38 PM","abortion-debates","14"
