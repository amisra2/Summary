Point 2: The point is that it is not the original soft tissues that survive. They are always replaced my minerals which are much better at resisting geological stress. Point 3: Argument from personal incredulity. Just because your mind is limited, stop imposing it on the rest of us.... I did consider that, and then fell off my chair laughing. The guy is a nutter who seems to be conviced for no evident reason that subduction does not occur. Never mind the fact that it fits observed data, or that a changing size of planet would result in gradually increasing force of gravity, playing havoc with observed natural processes....","Archangel","310783","I am a YECer, so don't change your superior opinion of me just yet. I don't want anyone thinking that you and I think alike at all. I offer the 70 million year age based on the claims of the article I posted only, not on my beliefs at all. This is only partially true based on your link, and completely irrelevant since Some regions of the demineralized bone matrix are highly fibrous, and the matrix possesses elasticity and resilience. If the soft tissue was replaced by minerals as you imply, then the possibility of retrieving DNA wouldn't exist, nor would the matrix be elastic and resilient. Soft-Tissue Vessels and Cellular Preservation in Tyrannosaurus rex Mary H. Schweitzer,1,2,3* Jennifer L. Wittmeyer,1 John R. Horner,3 Jan K. Toporski4 Soft tissues are preserved within hindlimb elements of Tyrannosaurus rex (Museum of the Rockies specimen 1125). Removal of the mineral phase reveals transparent, flexible, hollow blood vessels containing small round microstructures that can be expressed from the vessels into solution. Some regions of the demineralized bone matrix are highly fibrous, and the matrix possesses elasticity and resilience. Three populations of microstructures have cell-like morphology. Thus, some dinosaurian soft tissues may retain some of their original flexibility, elasticity, and resilience. It's more than personal incredulity Gazza, it's common sense also, but why would I expect you to get that? Lay a piece of steel, or a thousand pieces of steel in any part of the world, and in 70 million years nothing will remain of it. If steel wont make it, neither will bone, much less soft tissue. I don't care how many scientists make a ridiculous claim, that doesn't make their claim anymore rational. Your problem, like all pseudo intellectuals is that you believe this stuff just because someone you think is intelligent tells you that it's right or true. You don't have the common sense or discernment to see through the smoke and mirrors to understand that those scientists don't know any more than you do in reality. Of course you did. Because anything that doesn't fit with your world view is rejected out of hand. And yet you accuse me of being close minded. And he did offer evidence for his claims, next time turn the volume up and listen to it. And I realize none of this is definitively provable, but neither is the cr*p you spew. The bottom line is though, when all is said and done in life regarding these questions, I will most definitely be proven right and you will find that your faith in science and intellectualism was seriously misplaced.","freedom-speach","06:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","61"

It is you who is nitpicking considering we are discussing 68-70 million year old bones ALLEGEDLY. They extracted viable and testable material otherwise this wouldn't have been a story of interest to anyone at all. In a related study, a team led by Mary Higby Schweitzer of North Carolina State University conducted tests that also revealed the presence of collagen in the T. rex remains. In one experiment, antibodies that normally react in the presence of chicken collagen reacted strongly to the dinosaur protein, suggesting a similar molecular identity. For the protein sequencing study, Asara's team isolated seven fragmentary chains of amino acidsthe building blocks of proteinsfrom the T. rex specimen. http://news.nationalgeographic.com/n...o-tissues.html So pandion, learn, then speak. And by the way, i'm not the only sceptic regarding this discovery. Evolutionary anthropologists agree that for such material to last more than a million years is incredible to say the least. One self-proclaimed skeptic is Christina Nielsen-Marsh, an expert on ancient bone proteins at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. ""I would love it to be true,"" she said of the new T. rex findings. ""But I do have serious doubts. I know of no other research group that has been able to extractlet alone sequenceindigenous proteins from fossils older than a million years. ""Based on what we presently understand, these T. rex sequences make no sense at all,"" Nielsen-Marsh said. ""That doesn't mean they are wrong. But if they are right, then we all need to rethink how molecules survive in the geological environment."" Schweitzer and her collaborators, including paleontologist John Horner of Montana State University, agree that their discovery should prompt such a rethinking, which could lead to changes in how fieldwork is conducted. Regarding the bolded above, What amazes me about such seemingly intelligent people is that they will rethink how molecules survive in the geological environment rather than consider that their dating techniques are irreparably flawed and the T-Rex isn't anywhere near 70 million years old. That is the only rational explanation for this evidence.","freedom-speach","08:32 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","63"

What's not amazing to me at all is that you expect scientists to look at one interesting occurrence and -- instead of analyzing what we've thought to be true -- throw out all of the data we have that confirms radiometric dating's accuracy and geologic time scales. This is like punching ""2+2="" into a calculator and getting ""4"" ten thousand times, then getting a ""0"" once due to a strange anomaly and declaring that we have sufficient reason to disbelieve that four is the correct answer.","freedom-speach","09:06 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","64"

And it isn't even rational because nothing about evo has been proven absolutely at all, which means it's all just wishful thinking on your part, which I've been patiently explaining to you forever now, it seems. I mean, you're acting like tons of 70 million year old fossils have given testing results and I'm saying this one destroys that track record because it doesn't. That would be a valid analogy. But for you to scream at me in your usual condescending fashion as if your high school teaching job makes you a superior intellect, and insist that the evidence for evo is overwhelmingly in your favor simply proves how deluded you are. After all, I didn't just post my opinion, but the opinion of an evolutionary anthropologist who also believes it impossible by a factor of 70.

You, on the other hand have immutable certainty, in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Ancient collagenthe main protein component of bonehas been extracted from the remains of a 68-million-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex, according to two new reports. The new studies provide strong support for the hotly debated claims that organic material previously extracted from the T. rex's leg bone is original dinosaur soft tissue that somehow escaped fossilization.","Archangel","310804","By all means, post this overwhelming evidence to the contrary that my God exists. I challenge you to produce it right now. And then in your infinite wisdom, explain how genetic material can survive an alleged 70 million years. You then must explain how that bone lasted 70 million years without the complete fossilization process being completed in it? That's the only way any genetic material could survive you know, if the bone was never completely fossilized. I quote from my link above: So can you explain that genius? 70 million years under ground without being fossilized? And remember that my source is Nat Geo, not some creationist site that you would just dismiss as ignorant christian rants.","freedom-speach","10:48 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","69"
