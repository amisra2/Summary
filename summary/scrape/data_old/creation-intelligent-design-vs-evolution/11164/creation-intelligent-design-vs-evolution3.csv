P2: ID is real science. C1: ID is used to argue against the existence of God. (Modus ponens.)","Collin","309610","Actually, that's a categorical syllogism. Your argument is valid just the same, but modus ponens has one premise stating a conditional relationship between X and Y and one premise affirming the antecedent of that relationship, which allows the affirmation of the consequent in the conclusion. Ex: If P, then Q. P Therefore, Q What you have is akin to this: A is B. C is A. Therefore, C is B.","freedom-speach","11:08 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","31"

Well then, the Epic of Gilgamesh, The Illiad, and The Oddysey must also be true by that reasoning. They've survived just as long, and are still being studied to this day for their insights into those ancient cultures.","Archangel","309817","Sure, and here's a rebuttal to your talk origins piece. http://creationwiki.org/Polonium_hal..._a_young_earth 1. Polonium forms from the alpha decay of radon, which is one of the decay products of uranium. Since radon is a gas, it can migrate through small cracks in the minerals. The fact that Po-haloes are found only associated with uranium (the parent mineral for producing radon) supports this conclusion, as does the fact that such haloes are commonly found along cracks. The fact that all three forms of Polonium are part of the uranium decay chain and that the haloes are only found in association with uranium has caused some creationists to question Gentry's conclusion. However only 210Po haloes are found along such cracks. 210Po has longest half life (138 days) of the Po isotopes involved in these haloes. Reference: Polonium Radiohalos: Still ""A Very Tiny Mystery"" by Andrew Snelling, ICR Impact #326. Aug 1, 2000 2. The biotite in which Gentry obtained some of his samples (Fission Mine and Silver Crater locations) was not from granite, but from a calcite dike. The biotite formed metamorphically as minerals in the walls of the dike migrated into the calcite. Biotite from the Faraday Mine came from a granite pegmatite which intruded a paragneiss which formed from highly metamorphosed sediments. Thus all of the locations Gentry examined show evidence of an extensive history predating the formation of the micas; they show an appearance of age older than the three minutes his polonium halo theory allows. It is possible God created this appearance of age, but that reduces Gentry's argument to the omphalos argument, for which evidence is irrelevant. While Talk Origins may have a point here, it needs to be noted the alleged evidence for extensive history assumes uniformitarian geology. Because of this fact, this response adds up to: Your theory doesn't work under my theory, so your theory is wrong.  If you can show how literally billions of people today live their lives according to the principles in those books, then you'll have a valid point. Until then your argument is totally fallacious and off topic because those are poems and stories, but in no way considered sacred texts.","freedom-speach","11:37 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","39"

Some creationist dupe posts it on the internet and others just keep posting it and reposting it, never bothering to actually learn the physics or to look into it any farther than some creationist hack. A person would have to be pretty dumb to continue to make claims about polonium halos and still not be aware of why. As for a mindless demand that I prove that something doesn't exist. Refute a claim that there is no evidence for creationism? How can I until you present some?","freedom-speach","12:08 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","40"

That's what has you so riled. I mean, just because you evolutionists demand that creationists back up every bit of evidence that you can't refute with multiple sources, it doesn't mean we have to jump through those hoops.
