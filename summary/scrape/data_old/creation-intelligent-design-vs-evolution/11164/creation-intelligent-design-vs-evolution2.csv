"04-21-2008","11164",2,"electrolyte","309284","So any long publication must be due to a panic attack? It takes a few minutes to read those posts, but it takes an hour and a half to watch Expelled ; does that mean that IDers are having the mother of all panic attacks? Your logic can't even be described as ""tortured,"" marc, because it's completely nonexistent. Irrelevant. Even if we assume that accusations of religion's negative influence are misplaced, two wrongs don't make a right. Either Darwinism and social atrocities are related, or they are not. Frankly whether they are has nothing to do with whether evolutionary theory is true or whether science expels dissenting opinion. The topic is completely tangential to the alleged point of the movie, which is because the movie is pure propaganda intended to dupe people like marc into thinking that these issues are topical. The classic example is: gravity makes countless people fall to their deaths every year. This isn't an example of one Holocaust-like instance of mass death; no, this is continual, yet nobody has made a fuss about it in the scientific community. This is because scientists are evil and out to destroy dissenters by letting gravity do the dirty work. We must dispel this mythical gravity idea as pseudoscience and replace it in schools with Intelligent Falling theory. 1) You think that most viewers of the movie will be informed? You sure as hell weren't until you came back and read a link that you wouldn't have read on your own. 2) Presenting the scenario as if Stein were addressing an actual audience when the ""audience"" is composed of virtually nothing but stand-ins is dishonest no matter which way you slice it. To say that it's okay to be misleading because it's a movie just backs up the point that we've been making all along. These people aren't interested in presenting truth; it's all about propagandism. Some of them know (from experience, because many nutjob anti-evolutionists are positively dishonest -- like Mathis & Co.) that statements have to be phrased carefully for at least one of (at least) two reasons: First, these people know a sh*tload less about the technicalities than the interviewers do; second, words may be chosen more carefully to try to prevent snippets being used out of context. You can see both in this instance, with the explanation of one postulation involving crystals and Dawkins referring to the ultimate Darwinian development of any theoretical panspermia initiators (which got cut off to be spun into a ridiculous quote mine). Notice that nowhere here do you address the claims and evidence -- which the movie apparently lacks -- about the assertions of ""the expelled."" Trying to deflect attention from your inability to respond substantively won't fly with us; these guys are fudging the stories and sharing only selected pieces in a specific attempt to hide what really happened. For what it's worth, I feel a hell of a lot more vulnerable as an atheist in my profession and location than IDers should feel in research and teaching academia. HOLY SH*T, marc. You're doing EXACTLY WHAT THE REVIEW SAYS YOU PEOPLE DO . You're making the claim without giving any explanation. ""OMG TEH SCEINCES IS ATHIESTIC BECUZ THEY JUST AER!!"" Thanks for making it extremely clear. Refuting a point by demonstrating it isn't very effective. Seriously, how disconnected from reality does one have to be in order to do something like this? Believe me, marc, we certainly can. The fact that it damns your argument is no skin off our backs. In fact, it damns your argument so much that the producers know it. See below. He didn't refuse because the filmmakers specifically avoided having him a part of it. (Why, because it would ""confuse"" the viewers. Of course it would confuse the viewers: Miller is disproof of the entire concept of atheistic bias in science!) If they approached him with the lie that the project was for ""Crossroads,"" I bet he'd have agreed. If they'd been honest and told him that it was a smearing propaganda piece... well, what do you think, oh-so-informed-viewer? You must never get tired of making stupid arguments and having your points eviscerated, marc. See you tomorrow.","marc9000","309386","Well no, it takes longer than just a ""few minutes"" to read Dawkins rant alone (that you linked) about the movie. When that's combined with all the other links you and your helpers posted, plus all the further rabbit trail links associated with them, all the reading could take longer than an hour and a half, even for a very fast reader. It's not a black and white issue, it's a worldview thing. Even the most highly intelligent random mutations and mindless natural selection winners like you and Dawkins aren't allowed to make that determination for all of us more unlucky monkey decendents. Neither was Hitler. If you won't watch the movie, there's not much to discuss with you. You seem to know about as much about it as you know about what paper Collin signed. One thing you constantly make clear, you make a lot of guesses, and make them look very positive. These kind of childish, sarcasitic examples that are put fourth by those who claim to be in education are a big help in calling attention to this political problem. Just have to fight fire with fire. After all, evolution is a slippery word. Atheists are constantly telling us that Catholics are in full agreement with them about evolution. It's not really all that complicated. They simply wouldn't have spoken their minds about the harm they believe religion does, and how strongly they feel about combating it. That's what it appears they were angry about. That's the lovely thing about truth, sometimes it just slips out all by itself! I didn't take an audio recorder, and record every word spoken by the people who were victims of discrimination. What they said was convincing. But you'll never watch it, so you'll never know. Don't worry, you have the ACLU on your side. No, because Dawkins, Provine, Myers, and others say it in the movie . Not as disconnected as one has to be to sputter with rage, use four letter words, and make assertions about a movie that they have no intention of seeing. But you never DO it. Whenever the heat is on just a little bit, theistic evolution is introduced by atheists. To do with any kind of detail, it would have required the movie to be 3 or more hours long. Theistic evolution wasn't the subject of the movie. Evolution in academia was. Only to atheists, not to anyone with much of a knowledge of Christianity, or to anyone who has actually read his book. I'm waiting for you to link me to his comments on the movie, just like I'm waiting for you to get your book back so you can give me the page numbers of where he refers to his Catholic beliefs. You're a legend in your own mind.","freedom-speach","08:44 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","16"
