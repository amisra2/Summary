I find myself loving when you go on and on so that I can continue to wail on you with the Truth Stick of No Mercy. It's usually you who is responsible for shutting yourself up. No, you're branded as a religious zealot when you make arguments that people who don't share your exact beliefs should have their rights taken away. Liberals were responsible for things like abolition of slavery and women's suffrage that overturned the oh-so-traditional status quo. Now we're working toward death with dignity for the terminally ill, reasonable gun control, access to abortion and contraception (without sparking the ire of fundy parents and community members)... are these things that are despised by the rest of the world? No, but things like slavery, sexism, rampant crime, and politicization of private issues are. The main cause of so much hate and disrespect is the phony war we're fighting and our tactics in violation of international law, our attitude of superiority in the world, and our outright bullying of others, all of which are being pushed the most by -- you guessed it -- not liberals. No, Archie, you and your boys can take the blame for that one. Archie's projection complex strikes again! Pretty much, we can take whatever Archie says and know that the truth is the precise opposite.","freedom-speach","04:16 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","6"

I can see why some reviews have called it ""important"" and ""powerful"". It was very good, not a comedy as some may attempt to describe it. It had a little of Ben Stein's mysteriousness and humor to it, but it was generally serious, and some may say, depressing. It was nice to see the people whose writings I had seen on the net, but had never seen speak before or even a picture of - Myers, Ruse, Berlinski, etc. I'll address the six points from your first link, that's all I have time for tonight. 1) Nitpicking. The movie wasn't attempting to link euginics and the holocaust to Darwin himself nearly as much as it was showing its relationship with Darwinism in general. I don't think linking Darwinism and societal atrocities are an unprovoked first assertion. It's a response to atheists/evolutionists who constantly link religion with societal atrocities. 2) Informed viewers of Expelled might NOT think Stein was giving speeches on college campuses, if they had any knowledge of ""speech codes"" and other games played in todays universities to keep conservatives out. When I saw that scene, I sure didn't think it was a college campus. I didn't give much thought to where it was, but it was no crime to stage it. It is a movie, after all. 3) Crying that they didn't know what they were being interviewed for? If they'd have known, would they have refused to participate, or lied about something? 4) Yes, there are all kinds of long winded rants about all the details of how the ID proponents were being treated perfectly fair. It's up to anyone who actually watched the movie to decide if these people just weren't intelligent enough to make the grade, while ALL the Ward Churchill's of the academic world seldom seem to have any problems. 5) HELLO!! THAT'S WHY!! Then we see the standard dance of how innocent and objective science really is. 6) And the standard ""theistic evolution"" dance. Atheistic evolutionists can't get along without it! I wonder if Kenneth Miller will see the movie, and comment on it. I wonder if he'd have refused to be a part of it.","freedom-speach","08:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","9"

Your logic can't even be described as ""tortured,"" marc, because it's completely nonexistent. See Collin's response below. Irrelevant. Even if we assume that accusations of religion's negative influence are misplaced, two wrongs don't make a right. Either Darwinism and social atrocities are related, or they are not. Frankly whether they are has nothing to do with whether evolutionary theory is true or whether science expels dissenting opinion. The topic is completely tangential to the alleged point of the movie, which is because the movie is pure propaganda intended to dupe people like marc into thinking that these issues are topical. The classic example is: gravity makes countless people fall to their deaths every year. This isn't an example of one Holocaust-like instance of mass death; no, this is continual, yet nobody has made a fuss about it in the scientific community. This is because scientists are evil and out to destroy dissenters by letting gravity do the dirty work. We must dispel this mythical gravity idea as pseudoscience and replace it in schools with Intelligent Falling theory. 1) You think that most viewers of the movie will be informed? You sure as hell weren't until you came back and read a link that you wouldn't have read on your own. 2) Presenting the scenario as if Stein were addressing an actual audience when the ""audience"" is composed of virtually nothing but stand-ins is dishonest no matter which way you slice it. To say that it's okay to be misleading because it's a movie just backs up the point that we've been making all along. These people aren't interested in presenting truth; it's all about propagandism. Some of them know (from experience, because many nutjob anti-evolutionists are positively dishonest -- like Mathis & Co.) that statements have to be phrased carefully for at least one of (at least) two reasons: First, these people know a sh*tload less about the technicalities than the interviewers do; second, words may be chosen more carefully to try to prevent snippets being used out of context. You can see both in this instance, with the explanation of one postulation involving crystals and Dawkins referring to the ultimate Darwinian development of any theoretical panspermia initiators (which got cut off to be spun into a ridiculous quote mine).

One word answers, usually not showing much of a connection to the topic, hardly legible... Or maybe it's just me. Anyway, there's quite enough freedom of speech going on around. The problem is people will often hide the true reasons they lost their jobs. Like a ""Santa"" actor, who claimed that he was fired because the ""Ho ho ho"" was insulting to women, while in truth, he disregarded a series of rules about how to behave while being Santa (the booming laugh was found to sometimes scare the children, so it was to be avoided and similar). With religion, it's similar. Believing in ID is one thing. But then ignoring things that are vital to the job because they conflict with ID is a different thing. Imagine taking your pet to a vet and finding out that the doctor didn't believe in the bacterial theory of infection and instead started performing an exorcism ritual on it...","freedom-speach","06:05 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","14"

When that's combined with all the other links you and your helpers posted, plus all the further rabbit trail links associated with them, all the reading could take longer than an hour and a half, even for a very fast reader. It's not a black and white issue, it's a worldview thing. Even the most highly intelligent random mutations and mindless natural selection winners like you and Dawkins aren't allowed to make that determination for all of us more unlucky monkey decendents. Neither was Hitler. If you won't watch the movie, there's not much to discuss with you. You seem to know about as much about it as you know about what paper Collin signed. One thing you constantly make clear, you make a lot of guesses, and make them look very positive. These kind of childish, sarcasitic examples that are put fourth by those who claim to be in education are a big help in calling attention to this political problem. Just have to fight fire with fire. After all, evolution is a slippery word. Atheists are constantly telling us that Catholics are in full agreement with them about evolution. It's not really all that complicated. They simply wouldn't have spoken their minds about the harm they believe religion does, and how strongly they feel about combating it. That's what it appears they were angry about. That's the lovely thing about truth, sometimes it just slips out all by itself! I didn't take an audio recorder, and record every word spoken by the people who were victims of discrimination. What they said was convincing. But you'll never watch it, so you'll never know. Don't worry, you have the ACLU on your side. No, because Dawkins, Provine, Myers, and others say it in the movie . Not as disconnected as one has to be to sputter with rage, use four letter words, and make assertions about a movie that they have no intention of seeing. But you never DO it. Whenever the heat is on just a little bit, theistic evolution is introduced by atheists. To do with any kind of detail, it would have required the movie to be 3 or more hours long. Theistic evolution wasn't the subject of the movie. Evolution in academia was. Only to atheists, not to anyone with much of a knowledge of Christianity, or to anyone who has actually read his book. I'm waiting for you to link me to his comments on the movie, just like I'm waiting for you to get your book back so you can give me the page numbers of where he refers to his Catholic beliefs.

Polonium forms from the alpha decay of radon, which is one of the decay products of uranium. Since radon is a gas, it can migrate through small cracks in the minerals. The fact that Po-haloes are found only associated with uranium (the parent mineral for producing radon) supports this conclusion, as does the fact that such haloes are commonly found along cracks. The fact that all three forms of Polonium are part of the uranium decay chain and that the haloes are only found in association with uranium has caused some creationists to question Gentry's conclusion. However only 210Po haloes are found along such cracks. 210Po has longest half life (138 days) of the Po isotopes involved in these haloes.

The biotite formed metamorphically as minerals in the walls of the dike migrated into the calcite.

I don't want anyone thinking that you and I think alike at all. I offer the 70 million year age based on the claims of the article I posted only, not on my beliefs at all. This is only partially true based on your link, and completely irrelevant since Some regions of the demineralized bone matrix are highly fibrous, and the matrix possesses elasticity and resilience. If the soft tissue was replaced by minerals as you imply, then the possibility of retrieving DNA wouldn't exist, nor would the matrix be elastic and resilient. Soft-Tissue Vessels and Cellular Preservation in Tyrannosaurus rex Mary H. Schweitzer,1,2,3* Jennifer L. Wittmeyer,1 John R. Horner,3 Jan K. Toporski4 Soft tissues are preserved within hindlimb elements of Tyrannosaurus rex (Museum of the Rockies specimen 1125). Removal of the mineral phase reveals transparent, flexible, hollow blood vessels containing small round microstructures that can be expressed from the vessels into solution. Some regions of the demineralized bone matrix are highly fibrous, and the matrix possesses elasticity and resilience. Three populations of microstructures have cell-like morphology. Thus, some dinosaurian soft tissues may retain some of their original flexibility, elasticity, and resilience. It's more than personal incredulity Gazza, it's common sense also, but why would I expect you to get that? Lay a piece of steel, or a thousand pieces of steel in any part of the world, and in 70 million years nothing will remain of it. If steel wont make it, neither will bone, much less soft tissue.

It is you who is nitpicking considering we are discussing 68-70 million year old bones ALLEGEDLY. They extracted viable and testable material otherwise this wouldn't have been a story of interest to anyone at all. In a related study, a team led by Mary Higby Schweitzer of North Carolina State University conducted tests that also revealed the presence of collagen in the T. rex remains. In one experiment, antibodies that normally react in the presence of chicken collagen reacted strongly to the dinosaur protein, suggesting a similar molecular identity. For the protein sequencing study, Asara's team isolated seven fragmentary chains of amino acidsthe building blocks of proteinsfrom the T. rex specimen. http://news.nationalgeographic.com/n...o-tissues.html So pandion, learn, then speak. And by the way, i'm not the only sceptic regarding this discovery. Evolutionary anthropologists agree that for such material to last more than a million years is incredible to say the least. One self-proclaimed skeptic is Christina Nielsen-Marsh, an expert on ancient bone proteins at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.

I know of no other research group that has been able to extractlet alone sequenceindigenous proteins from fossils older than a million years. ""Based on what we presently understand, these T. rex sequences make no sense at all,"" Nielsen-Marsh said. ""That doesn't mean they are wrong. But if they are right, then we all need to rethink how molecules survive in the geological environment."" Schweitzer and her collaborators, including paleontologist John Horner of Montana State University, agree that their discovery should prompt such a rethinking, which could lead to changes in how fieldwork is conducted.

The main Science article appears as a fairly straightforward report that when the mineral component of a tyrannosaur femur was removed, there remained an organic mass with characters similar to those found in ostrich bone.
