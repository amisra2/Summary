I mean, just because you evolutionists demand that creationists back up every bit of evidence that you can't refute with multiple sources, it doesn't mean we have to jump through those hoops. Id prefer it if you would just disprove it as absolutely as you claim that evo has all the answers.","T.Q","309836","Your haloes have been refuted, with multiple sources, and multiple times. That's why it's called a PRATT. As for ""jumping through hoops"", why do you consider actually backing up your claims with solid evidence to be ""jumping through hoops.","freedom-speach","03:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","46"

It comes from the dancing around of issues and avoidance of questions that a poster on other forums is known for (goes by afdave and DaveHawkins).","freedom-speach","04:58 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","48"

There isn't any evidence presented there. Just lies and wishful thinking in order to dupe the stupid. I have also seen Carl Baugh's laughable museum. A load of invention and #### piled on top of some really, really bizarre theology. So you actually read Genesis 1 and 2 and think that Gen 2 just repeats Gen 1? How weird. Please cite the verses in Genesis 1 that tells us about a garden in Eden. Please cite the verses in Genesis 2 that tell us about night and day before the sun was created. I find it hard to believe how anyone could have been duped to such an extent.","freedom-speach","11:07 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","50"
"05-10-2008","11164",4,"electrolyte","309239","What a crock. I find myself loving when you go on and on so that I can continue to wail on you with the Truth Stick of No Mercy. It's usually you who is responsible for shutting yourself up. No, you're branded as a religious zealot when you make arguments that people who don't share your exact beliefs should have their rights taken away. Liberals were responsible for things like abolition of slavery and women's suffrage that overturned the oh-so-traditional status quo. Now we're working toward death with dignity for the terminally ill, reasonable gun control, access to abortion and contraception (without sparking the ire of fundy parents and community members)... are these things that are despised by the rest of the world? No, but things like slavery, sexism, rampant crime, and politicization of private issues are. The main cause of so much hate and disrespect is the phony war we're fighting and our tactics in violation of international law, our attitude of superiority in the world, and our outright bullying of others, all of which are being pushed the most by -- you guessed it -- not liberals. No, Archie, you and your boys can take the blame for that one. Archie's projection complex strikes again! Pretty much, we can take whatever Archie says and know that the truth is the precise opposite.","lpdm","310710","Don't be too sure of yourself because he's said a lot more truthful things in his life than you could hope to say. also your ""science"" is scissors, glue, and tape. no proof of it exists if the earth was millions of years old than there would be no fossils of dinosaurs and people and don't say preseservative because they don't last that long ill let you think about that","freedom-speach","12:41 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","51"

Of course, overwhelming your comprehension probably isn't hard at all, so perhaps that's not saying much. To say that Archie has a better track record with the truth here than do I is pretty much admitting that you haven't been following along, can't read, or are delusional as Archie is. I won't rule out a combination. Which is why your computer doesn't work, right? Okay, I won't say ""preseservative,"" whatever the hell that is. (I can't say I'm impressed with what you think passes for literacy.) Fossils aren't bones; there are fossils of dinos and fossils of hominids, but not together. Plus, you can't refute multiple independent radioactive date correlations, millions of varves, millions of annual ice layers, plate tectonics, ferrimagnetic pattern reversals... Ah, see, that's the thing. I think about it enough to understand it. Clearly, you don't. You don't understand a damn thing.","freedom-speach","02:22 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","52"

What do you know about his life? What we can be sure of it that he isn't careful about telling the truth on this discussion board. Sometimes he says what he thinks is true because he hasn't bothered to educate himself. At other times he tells intentional lies. Hey! You two seem to be a lot alike. His science? And I just thought it was science, no matter who did it. So, if he has his science, why can't I have my own science? By the way, please tell us about your science, i.e., your education in science. Where did you earn your degrees that give you the expertise to judge science. I am a biologist and have degrees from Montana State University, the University of Montana, and El Instituto Tecnolgico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey. Can you say run-on sentence? I knew you could! It seems that we have another scientific illiterate (as well as another English semi-literate). Before you talk about science, learn what it is and how it works. Science does not ""prove"" things. It explains them. Science is the investigation of natural phenomena through observation, theoretical explanation, and experimentation, or the knowledge produced by such investigation. How is it that you think that rocks that were once bones are not old. Are you not aware that fossils are not the preserved remains of organisms? The organic materials have been replaced by minerals and they are rock. Ever actually see a fossil? Ever actually hold one?","freedom-speach","11:10 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","53"

Well, I guess we'd already established that you're nearly illiterate. And no, Darwin didn't recant when he died . Even if he had, we've gathered so much supporting evidence since Darwin's time that a recantation wouldn't matter. Yeah, pandion already addressed this. Don't blame me if you can't understand.

"05-11-2008","11164",4,"GazzaElliott","310767","Preservatives have nothing to do with the fossilization process. Preservatives are chemical compounds created to preserve meat or they are chemical compounds used to preserve material. Fossils are frequently treated with epoxy, which is a resin (sp?) not a preservative... Please don't try the 'fossils aren't old' argument. You will get fried, and I'm too tired to argue with another fundie. The data is out there, if you deign to read it...","Archangel","310770","Maybe you're naive enough to believe that soft tissue will survive 70 million years under the environmental and geological pressures they must go through in that incredible period of time, but I'm not. I believe a discovery like this one irrefutably proves that the dating methods of these fossils are terribly flawed and unreliable. I don't believe any bones could ever survive 70 million years under the best of circumstances and the best evidence of this is mans attempts at preserving bodies over the past 5000 years and the fragile state of mummies that were placed in shielded sarcophagi. Just take a preserved mummy and drop it in a hole and tell me how it will fare after getting ground up through 70 million years of Earth upheavals, floods, and environmental and ecological changes. http://news.nationalgeographic.com/n...ofttissue.html Now consider this theory as explained in this video and see how, if true, it would affect the theories you base your World view on. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjgidAICoQI","freedom-speach","02:10 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","59"
