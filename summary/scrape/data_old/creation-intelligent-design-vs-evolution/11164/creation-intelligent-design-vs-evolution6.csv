"05-11-2008","11164",6,"Collin","310807","You don't seem to understand where he's coming from, AA. We reject AIG because it is demonstrably false. You post an AIG article, and we show how it's bullocks. You on the other hand simply reject sources from the other side because they're from the other side. As is the case here, you didn't even try to look at it. ""It's from a site run by evolutionists, therefore it must be false"" is a pretty pathetic fallacy. In one experiment, antibodies that normally react in the presence of chicken collagen reacted strongly to the dinosaur protein, suggesting a similar molecular identity. AND THIS: Schweitzer and colleagues independently used a variety of chemical and molecular tests to identify the preserved collagen. The main Science article appears as a fairly straightforward report that when the mineral component of a tyrannosaur femur was removed, there remained an organic mass with characters similar to those found in ostrich bone. Schweitzer et al believe they have recovered material that represented osteocytes, blood cells, and vessels. They state, ""The vessels and contents are similar in all respects to blood vessels recovered from extant ostrich bone.""","Archangel","310811","No collin, both sites are dedicated to their respective missions. For every article you post from TO, AIG has an answer for and vice versa, so the two sites cancel each other out. Child posts that cr*p so confidently as if he's actually contributing something to the debate, and TO is absolutely flawlessly right without question. And I obviously reject that rationale out of hand. For example, explain this contradiction between two allegedly reliable and consistent sources of info regarding the same issue. Here And yet your ultra scientific TO said this about the same T Rex case. So why such inconsistency regarding the type of foul? Can't they get any more accurate than that? After all, the genetic material they're comparing the T-Rex results to are contemporary and known to us. So why do two scientific sources contradict each other based on the same science and scientific results? Where's the lack of communication within the community? I mean, if Schweitzer et al is putting out chicken proteins, why is TO getting Ostrich results from that?","freedom-speach","11:47 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","76"
"05-12-2008","11164",6,"Archangel","310800","After all, I didn't just post my opinion, but the opinion of an evolutionary anthropologist who also believes it impossible by a factor of 70. I repeat for your edification:","electrolyte","310813","Repeat all you want, but you might want to learn to read first. The scientist in question speaks of reconsidering our conclusions about substance longevity but not our conclusions about radiometric dating . You did post your opinion: You want to hold up this scientist as an example of a good and knowledgeable scientist. You , at the same time, say that we should reject dating data even though she says nothing of the sort. You can't have your cake and eat it, too.","freedom-speach","12:13 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","77"

I think we should make sure we're not on the same page of the EAC handbook. I'm on page 13; 'Repealing the truth'. I suggest you use page 89; 'Creating fallacies'. He'll never suspect! Oh damn.

"05-12-2008","11164",6,"Archangel","310811","So why such inconsistency regarding the type of foul?","pandion","310827","I presume that you are talking about birds and not baseball or some other sporting event. That's why I had such a good laugh at another example of creationist semi-literacy. If you mean baseball, then I don't understand. If you mean birds then that should be fowl .

"05-12-2008","11164",6,"GazzaElliott","310814","4: Two scientists contradict each other based on the same evidence because each have a different approach to the problem allowing multiple perspectives. It's how science works.","Kronus","310844","Actually, the two scientists didn't contradict each other at all. One said that he got a reaction similar to that from chicken protien, the other said stuctures are similar to those seen in ostriches. These are both just observations of fact, and don't contradict in the least. They're both just saying that dinosaurs had traits in common with some modern birds; they're not saying that they were chickens or that they were ostriches. The only contradiction is between what they said and what Archie thinks they said.","freedom-speach","01:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","86"

Archie admits that he doesn't understand the stuff he links to, so you should by no means accept his interpretation as being remotely correct. His reading was probably along these lines: Author 1: T-rex bone blah-blah-blah chicken Author 2: T-rex bone blah-blah-blah ostrich Ah-ha! One said chicken and the other said ostrich. Clearly they're in fundamental disagreement, even though I don't know what they were talking about, which proves I'm right about whatever... Of course, if I'm wrong about this it'll be trivial for Archie to prove it. All he has to do is describe, in his own words, what contradiction he was refering to. Of course if he just does the same cut and paste again that'll just support my point.","freedom-speach","03:35 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","88"
