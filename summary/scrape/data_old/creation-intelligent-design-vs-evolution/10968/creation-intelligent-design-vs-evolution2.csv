"02-26-2008","10968",2,"Peeling","303441","A double standard would be the application of a different methodology to different problems. an ethical or moral code that applies more strictly to one group than to another What you're questioning is the application of the same methodology to two different problems. We can test claims of a global flood because we can use our understanding of fluid dynamics, geology and so forth to make positive predictions about what we ought to see if there had been a global flood, and compare that with what we actually see - which is that there's no way a global flood could have occurred. So what about design? What positive predictions and comparisons can we make? Answer: none. This is because all possible observations could be explicable via design, especially once you factor in the 'unknowable mind of god'. Imagine a pile of sand. Is the position and shape of each grain a result of design? It could be. We can't exclude the possibility, particularly if we posit an omnipotent entity to whom such a feat would be negligable. Design is, in the end, selection from within a pool of alternatives. Whether those options all have physical presence, or some are mental abstractions with only the chosen option being realised, whether the design is evaluated as a whole or via its components or iteratively, in the end a design is just a selection of one option from many. It therefore doesn't make sense to ask whether any given thing was designed. It only makes sense to ask what was involved in its selection. At that point, it's always possible to suggest 'god', because 'god' is the catch-all. God could have been responsible for the pile of sand. Of course, that's overkill: there are simpler, more specific explanations involving wind and gravity. But what about (sigh) a pocket-watch? Paley almost had a point. We infer a watchmaker from seeing a watch not because the watch 'looks designed' but because there's no evidence that alternatives from which the watch was selected ever existed in reality to be discriminated between by non-intelligent agents. Volcanos don't spew out prototype watches; hydrodynamic sorting doesn't bring the most accurate timepieces to the surface. I realise that's a bit of a headful, but stay with it; it's important. If most of the selection process occurs in the abstract, with only the final result being reified, then we won't see evidence of 'natural' processes generating and filtering alternatives. That's why the watchmaker analogy is wrong: there's no evidence of natural processes producing alternative watch configurations and selecting between them, so we're justified in inferring that much of the process must have occurred in the abstract - hence a designer. But there's ample evidence of natural processes producing and discriminating between alternative 'designs' of living creatures. Bolting on a designer is overkill. Every time you say god must have done what the bible says, you limit him.","marc9000","303626","I cant agree with that, that would be two completely unrelated applications. Dictionary.com says this about a double standard; It says ~an~ ethical or moral (or scientific) code - not plural. So a double standard would be the same methodology, applied with different strictness , to different problems. Claims of the flood, claims of design, theyre both from the past, and they should be compared with an identical strictness, concerning testablilty. Historical writings should mean something, science shouldnt be so arrogant that it can call for anything historical to be put on our present day table, all written history thrown out, and allow nothing but present day experimentation to determine if its true or false. There seem to be a few claims out there that the WW2 holocaust never happened. Should we let nothing but present day scientific experimentation determine whether it did or didnt, and completely disregard what was written about it? Has science assumed a position of divinity, standing alone, and disregarding everything else? No, different methodology to two very related problems, since they both happened in the past, and we cant go back and observe either one. Why is it that we cant test the claims of evolution the same way? If weve made advances in fluid dynamics and geology that allows us to more critically examine the possibility of a worldwide flood, why cant we use the recently discovered complexities of the simplest forms of life, complete with all their associated probabilistic complexities, conditionally independent patterns, specified complexities, and mathematical odds, to more critically examine the possibility of purposelessness, godless evolution? I know the reason we dont because atheists dont WANT to! Is that a good enough reason? Equally, all possible observations can be explicable via mindless natural selection and random chance, especially once you factor in the atheist worldview. Theyre not kept on equal terms, as they should be. You and the others here imply that science is independent of God. That people like Stenger on the one side, and.Michael Behe for example, on the other side both include their personal opinions in their work, with actual science falling somewhere in the middle. Yet if we go to talkorigins, you know, that neutral mainstream scientific site, and search those two names, why cant we find them both referred to somewhat equally, praised somewhat equally, attacked somewhat equally? Heres what we find, 8 references to Stenger (8 lovefests with Stenger, maybe?) to 154 references to Behe. Do you think all 154 references to Behe were lovefests? Do you think ONE of them was? Or were most of them personal put-downs? Ruling out a designer is also overkill, but it seems like youre drifting off the topic a little. I agree that the watchmaker analogy, as well as the tornado building a 747 from a junkyard are not good analogies non living matter behaves differently than does living matter, when it comes to random processes. But when it comes to complexity, to several units working together to perform one function, there are similarities between living and non living complex units, those that are made up of a series of simpler units. But all thats not really what your OP was about. It was about the innocence of science, how it does not address, or rule out the supernatural. I want to know why the MANY best selling books like Stengers dont anger you, or anyone else in science, enough to make you or someone take a serious, detailed exception to them? Why do posters like Electrolyte get mad at ME, when I point out the title of Stengers book? Shouldnt he be getting mad at Stenger? Why is there NO conflict between naturalistic science & atheism? Explain that one to me. You limit him more when you say he didnt do what the Bible says.","regarding-assumptions","08:12 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","16"
"02-26-2008","10968",2,"obvious_child","303530","Which God are we talking about? As others have pointed out, you are again only assuming that one type of God exists and ignoring the issue that other Gods may exist which blows holes in your terribly crafted argument. Your inability to win any arguments here says much more then your insults. You, as always, have ignored massive holes in your arguments. You completely ignored my post because it shreaded your claims entirely.","marc9000","303628","Only one God does exist when it comes to politics in the western world. I've explained that to you before. There are other gods that exist of course, some of them are completely irrelevant gods from the far east, some of them are other irrelevant mistaken creations of human minds, and some of them are intentional creations of atheist minds, simply created to confuse the issue, so authors like Stengers meanings can be flip flopped, as Trebor did. If we go to chapter 9 in Stengers book, we find the title Possible and Impossible gods. He lists, with numbers, the God he believes he has disproved. 1)A God who is responsible for the complex structure of the world 2)A God who has given humans immortal souls.. 3)A God whose interactions with humans, including miraculous interventions, have been reported in scriptures. 4)A God who miraculously and supernaturally created the universe. 5)A God who fine-tuned the laws and constants of physics for life.. 6)A God who communicates directly with humans by means of revelation 7)A God who is the source of morality and human values.. 8)The existence of evil. The only god he leaves room for are irrelevant, far east gods which have nothing to do with western politics, or spaghetti monsters and other gods created by atheists. One of those atheist creations he sums up to finish the chapter; ""a hideous god"". I've been ignoring you a lot lately. Since you got BUSTED in your ""numbers"" thread on the 14th of this month, youve gone into a panic and started a total of 8 new threads, either in unrelated taunts to me, or in other subjects, to try to divert attention to the busting. About 10 other times, mainly on the 23rd and 24th after your increasing taunts convinced me that the busting needed to be made more clear in the liars corner, you brought my name up as a put down in threads that I had very little to do with. Im not going to complain to administration, maybe youll succeed in trolling me out of here, oh lover of free speech. I do have a life. Or maybe you'll get a little overzealous in your efforts and get yourself banned first. We'll find out.","regarding-assumptions","08:15 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","17"
"02-26-2008","10968",2,"Archangel","303624","Do any of these definitions of evolution credit any deities at all with the process of evolution or how man came into being?","obvious_child","303629","That's a bad question and you know it. Science cannot test the supernatural. Science, if you understood it, which has already proven to be untrue, is the study of the natural world. Deities are by definition supernatural and reside outside of the natural world. Science cannot disprove nor prove what lies outside its jurisdiction and realm of study. In the same fashion that you would not ask a psychologist to determine if the financial EVA projections are correct as that is clearly outside of their jurisdiction and realm of study, asking science to do the same thing is ridiculous. What science can disprove is the claims about what Gods have done in the natural world. The flood for example has been utterly refuted in the literal sense. That does not prove that the Abrahamic God does not exist. It just proves that the flood didn't happen in a literal way. And your logic dictates that if one does not credit, one is attempting to disprove someone else. Since Darwin in ""Origin of Species"" did not credit Wallace who actually came up with much of the theory before Darwin, your logic dictates that Darwin was trying to disprove Wallace even though they had essentially the same argument. How about for once since you joined you deal with your bad logic instead of blaming others for your failures? I'd love to see an explanation about how the study of the natural world disproves the existence of all Deities. I see you, like Marc9000 won't answer this.","regarding-assumptions","08:19 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","18"

You're welcome to believe that I'm stupid, but the evidence says nothing of the sort. The accusation of lying is not dependent upon opinion, however, so as soon as you can show where I've lied, you go ahead with that, too. Your argument has no merit at all.

I gave the psychologist/financial eva as an example of why your question is not only bad, but stupid. I'm predicting the future based on historical data and given how the thread has progressed, I'm obviously correct. The definitions are irrelevant. None of them are wrong. What you fail to acknowledge is your complete lack of any understanding of how science actually works. You are asking science to examine something that is completely outside of its realm of study. Would you ask a clinical psychologist who has no financial background to make an opinion on the accuracy of a financial EVA projection? No. That would be stupid and silly. In the same way you are asking science to do the same thing. Only because you don't understand science, you asked the question. So no, you don't actually understand what it's a bad question. Reject and disprove are two different things. Simply because one rejects God does not mean they have the capacity to disprove God. If it was that simple, the first atheist would have done it and there would be no discussion on atheism vs theism. You only think that because you fail to recognize that reject and disprove are two very different things. People reject the help of others. Are they disproving the existence of those offering help? Obviously no. Many people once they grow up reject the belief that Santa does not exist. That does not equate to proof that Santa does not exist. Reject =/= Disprove. Learn that before replying. Because you say so. And you've already made several key errors in your last post you have failed to rectify. Evolution rejects Literal Creationism. That does not mean Evolution rejects all deities or a metaphorical interpretation of Genesis. You have NEVER dealt with this aside from asserting that your interpretation is correct because you say so. I'd love to see how evolution rejects a deistic God. But you won't answer that because you and Marc9000 have pigeonholed God into only being the Abrahamic one. Aside from the issue that Gods may have created the mechanisms for natural selection and then let nature take over. Your failure to address the myriad of Deities will always be your failure.
