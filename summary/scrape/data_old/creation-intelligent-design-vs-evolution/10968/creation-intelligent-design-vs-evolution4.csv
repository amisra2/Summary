I realize you evos here have an emotional investment in never admitting you're wrong in this, but that in no way negates the correctness of my argument. So believe what you will Trebor, I see no reason to continue beating a dead horse.","regarding-assumptions","12:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","48"
"02-29-2008","10968",4,"foundit66","303990","Part of the problem is that we are talking about ""your prior posts"", and you are trying to rewrite reality in what evolution actually is. It would be like me arguing against Christianity by describing it as cannibalistic. If a Christian comes along and corrects me, I attempt to refer to ""my prior posts"" which label it as cannibalistic. The problem here is that the ""evolution"" process does not SPECIFY the presence of God, but it also does not EXCLUDE the possibility of God's involvement either. And it is that last bit you routinely can't comprehend.","Archangel","304002","[QUOTE=Archangel;303648]The issue isn't what science can prove or disprove but is what it claims by its very definition. Here is the FACT of what the ToE claims to represent in REALITY. It is undeniable that the very definition, shown here: What is it about THE PROCESS OF NATURAL SELECTION THROUGH RANDOM MUTATION THAT PROMOTES, OR ALLOWS FOR THE BELIEF OF AN INTELLIGENT CREATOR AT ALL IN YOUR OPINION? It denies the participation of a SUPREME BEING in any way of being responsible for the existence of any life on Earth at all, be it plant or animal. So the question isn't about proving or disproving God exists, Which science admits it cannot do, but simply acknowledging the part He played in the Creation of life on Earth which the Biological Theory of Evolution rejects out of hand. Now can you deny that what I'm saying is true and accurate? If so refute it with facts rather than just continuing to insist that I am wrong and you are right. And start with defining the NATURAL in selection and the RANDOM in mutation in regards to the existence of life on Earth and then tell me how my understanding is in error in any way. I went back and reposted #23 to show what my original argument was on this thread regarding this issue to show that I'm not attempting to redefine my position at all.. But foundit, if christianity insisted we condemn cannibalism yet every time we took communion, you saw a pastor or priest cutting bits of flesh off of a sacrificed baby and the parishioners eating them, then i would have a hard time convincing you that my denials were true, wouldn't I? Well that's the problem I have with your claims that evolution doesn't deny the existence of God. You say that; yet the very definition of it bellies your claim. And rather than ramble on and repeat myself, I will let my earlier post above explain my position and ask you to objectively read that post and then explain to me what is wrong or inaccurate about it. I agree that it never vocally EXCLUDES God from existing. But it does imply that our existence came about by completely Natural forces that don't allow for a Creator God in any way. The very term Random mutation just screams of our existing through Natural Selection, a completely biological process that does deny any intelligent designer played any part in our existence.","regarding-assumptions","03:34 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","50"
"02-29-2008","10968",4,"None","None","None","Penfold","304005","The process is neutral on the question. It neither detracts not supports the God proposition. It does not address the supernatural in any way, shape, or form. It is a naturalistic natural observation of natural occurences in nature, brought to their natural conclusions. You appear to want it to do something not in the specification. As it was put elsewhere.. the answer to 2+2 cannot ever be ""green"".","regarding-assumptions","04:08 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","51"

One that claims He personally created us in His image? You never considered that one huh? And what is at all similar about the ToE and the Creation account? How do they mesh in any way? Doesn't the 4 billion year old Earth that evolution rests its hat on conflict with the Creation account also? So in what way again was this all Gods idea?","regarding-assumptions","05:59 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","53"
"02-29-2008","10968",4,"foundit66","304015","Now you're changing the subject. Earlier you were talking about evolution disproving the EXISTENCE of a creator. NOW you are talking about a SPECIFIC CLAIM of a creator.","Archangel","304018","Did you not see the post by obvious child that I answered foundit?

"02-29-2008","10968",4,"foundit66","304014","But to answer your challenge simply, even though you will ignore it... Evolution accounts for how life DEVELOPED into its current state. It actually discusses NOTHING about how life first came to be.","Archangel","304027","Why would you assume I'm afraid of this point foundit? You are once again departmentalizing what is normally taken as connected studies. You know as well as I do that the process of abiogenesis preceded the process of evolution and the two go hand in hand to any evolutionist who is discussing it honestly. Why would you act as if they aren't connected schools of thought now?","regarding-assumptions","07:07 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","59"
"02-29-2008","10968",4,"electrolyte","303650","Just how thick does a skull have to be to prevent the fact that science is incapable of making proclamations about the existence of supernatural entities from sinking in? I like how we use the dictionary to try to prove our point, and then change the dictionary definition at will. You lie. My degree is in biochemistry. Do you think I just overlooked the complexities? Hey marc, how about you post those eight ""lovefests""? Or are you just lying again? I nailed you for misrepresenting his book , Holmes. You said that Stenger argued against all concepts of God when he doesn't. Another way to look at this is that you lied . Stenger convincingly shows in this book that a combination of factual evidence with a simple logic makes the belief in the supernatural entities untenable. So when I make no claims whatsoever , I'm limiting God? Explain that one to me.","marc9000","304028","Not nearly as thick as one has to be to deny that scientists are writing best selling books that make proclamations about the existence of supernatural entities. I just slightly and logically extended it, to include what the source of the different codes could be, I didnt change it. The word ""code"" was the key word in the definition. Yes!! Thanks for asking! Just making a general point that makes you angry. 8 (generally positive) to 154 (generally negative) its an example of mainstream science not reflecting the neutral innocence thats assigned to it by atheist scientists. And yet another way to look at this is that youre ignoring the review that I posted earlier. I c/pd it in my post #8 is your memory really that short? Lets look at part of it again; Notice it doesnt carefully say certain, select supernatural entities it clearly implies ALL supernatural entities. This review goes along perfectly with what it actually says on the front cover of the book. It says; "" HOW SCIENCE SHOWS THAT GOD DOES NOT EXIST "". Notice how the review, and what the cover of the book says, go together perfectly? You didn't really nail me for anything did you? You are misrepresenting his book, aren't you? If you're telling me that you've made ""no claims whatsoever"" anywhere on these forums about God's activity as described in the book of Genesis, you may be.......lying.","regarding-assumptions","07:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","60"
