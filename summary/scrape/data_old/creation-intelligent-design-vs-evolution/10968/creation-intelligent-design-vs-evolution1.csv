"02-20-2008","10968",1,"None","None","None","Peeling","302708","The word assumption gets hurled around a lot in evolution/creation debates, rarely justifiably. First of all, it is not an assumption to interpret new evidence that correlates with a well-established theory as if it were explained by that theory. Example: the ongoing recovery and classification of hominid fossil remains. Common descent has proved itself beyond any reasonable doubt as far as pretty much all contemporary scientists are concerned. So when a new fossil is found which - yet again - correlates with the ToE by virtue of its appearance, geographical location and date, it is not an assumption to interpret that fossil as being explained by the ToE - eg, interpreting it as being related in some fashion to other extinct hominids. It is a well-founded conclusion . Analogy: There's a convicted serial killer whose MO was to bury the bodies of his victims in his garden, wrapped in newspaper. Years later the police track down some more previous addresses of his, dig up the gardens and find more bodies, each wrapped in newspapers bearing dates that correlate with the killer's residence in that domicile. Despite the lack of any forensic evidence directly linking the killer to those bodies, the authorities announce that he was responsible for their deaths. Is that an assumption, or a well-founded conclusion? What if all the bodies had been found in the communal gardens of shared accommodation, where the killer's was the only name that appeared on every tenant agreement? Would it be an assumption to pin the deaths on him, or a well-founded conclusion based on the extreme unlikelihood of an innocent man happening to share a series of houses with a series of killers who each independently employed the same MO and who each, without fail, began and ended their killing sprees to coincide with his arrival and departure? It doesn't matter if you disbelieve evolution, and it doesn't even matter if you're right: scientists are not making an assumption when they classify fossils. For them to be doing that, they would have to be arbitrarily choosing one interpretation from a range of interpretations that are equally likely given their understanding of the accumulated evidence . They aren't. Secondly, the pursuit of naturalistic explanations for phenomena does not require an assumption of the non-existence of god. Take the following equation: E = N + S Any (E)xplanation consists of (N)aturalistic and (S)upernatural components. N consists of anything that is amenable to the scientific method: testable, repeatable etc. Note that it is nothing to do with tangibility (eg gravity, inertia, statistics) nothing to do with how complete our understanding is, and nothing to do with its origin. Nothing explicitly excludes god from N. He might, for instance, be personally responsible for moving all matter in the universe as if it was subject to the force we perceive as gravity. It is the testability and consistency of observed gravitational phenomena which makes it part of N, not an assumption of non-divine origin. S contains explanations or part-explanations that are untestable. By definition, we cannot verify an explanation in S; we cannot ever know if we are right to employ it. Miraculous explanations fall into S. N is therefore the interesting part of any given explanation. If we can show that the contents of N are sufficient to explain a phenomenon to a high degree of plausibility, we have shown S to be empty, without ever, at any point, assuming it to be empty. Nor have we excluded the divine; we have merely shown that if god exists and is involved he is being consistent.","regarding-assumptions","12:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","1"

We are explaining natural phenomena by natural means. We do so simply because we can test natural explanations while we cannot test the supernatural. We use methodological naturalism (not, by any means, philosophical naturalism) to observe, test and explain the natural. This is not a denial of god or an assumption about the existance of a god. It is a recognition of the fact that we cannot investigate the supernatural by natural means. Even methodological naturalists can be theists - Kenneth R. Miller for example.","regarding-assumptions","06:49 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","2"

Especially the Deistic Gods. And I'd love to see how science is suppose to disprove a being that is not bound by logic, reason or any laws. What science can do is disprove that God was directly responsible for this or that, the sun rising, the rain season, etc. Did you perhaps realize that many scientists are Buddhists because Buddhism which has beings that behave as Gods with such powers and exist partially within the natural and supernatural? Or are you again assuming all religions don't exist except for Christanity? Now as I have asked you perfectly legitimate questions, without any attacks on your personal self, and I have asked you to support your assertions, will you return and defend your beliefs and claims?

So I'll do it once more, bookmark this post, and then link you to it every time you pretend to be so terribly persecuted again. Science is incapable of testing the supernatural. Period. By the very mechanism of science -- methodological naturalism -- no conclusions about the supernatural can be drawn. However, when claims of the supernatural overlap into the natural realm, then those claims can be tested. Science tells us that there was no global flood a la Noah, not that there is no God. Now, if you choose to interpret that as a reasonable person and realize that science shows that ""a Noah's flood-causing God"" does not exist, then kudos. This does not mean that there is no God whatsoever. The error you are making is that you are equating creationism with God. We've disproved special creation. Handily. So one might say that there's good evidence that a God represented by a literal interpretation of the Bible does not exist. But that doesn't mean that no God exists, or that a Christian God doesn't exist. Then again, if you've pigeonholed God into a constrictive box based on your own understanding, but you insist that God exists, perhaps you should rethink why you felt the need to cram your God into a tiny box. Science can only disprove a God to whom some human attributes a limitation.","regarding-assumptions","09:43 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","7"

The one that has ""how science shows that God does not exist"" on the front cover?","trebor","303416","The thing is Marc, Stenger , in his book, specifically points out the Abrahamic god . .. not 'God' in general. The 'jewish/christian/islamic' god concept, reading literally, makes some very specific claims.. Those claims are falsified. He can not counter (by his own admission btw), the concept of 'God' in general. He can only counter when religion makes specific physical claims, such as in the origin of the world, the origin of man, or a being with the traditional attributes of the judeo-christian god (from a literal reading of the Bible). If you take many of those stories as allegory, then that is different.","regarding-assumptions","08:47 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","9"

Why is there a double standard? Why is it that claims of a flood can be tested, yet claims of design cannot be tested? That's the standard dance. Victor Stenger didn't say it that way. On the back of his book, one review puts it this way; It didn't say ~some~ supernatural entities, did it? Do you think it would be a valuable addition to every school library? Would that be constitutional? Science pigeonholes God into a constrictive box, not me.","Dane","303433","Is that in a peer-reviewed, scientific journal? Or are you trying to portray one person's opinion as the gold-standard for science? For something to be testable, it has to be falsifiable. That is, it has to be physically possible to prove it wrong. ""goddidit"" is not testable. After all, creationists have made plenty of the claims in the vein of ""God did this, but it is hidden to us so we can't see it"" nonsense and then claiming it scientific. Also irrelevant. Show it consensus from the scientific community rather than a book written but not peer-reviewed, and you would have an argument. As it is not actual science, why would anybody care? Outright false, as Science doesn't deal with God at all. CREATIONIST claims about God, limiting God to be based on evidence rather than Faith, THAT limits God. Go look up the term ""God of the gaps"" for an explanation.","regarding-assumptions","01:35 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","10"

You're getting as bad as your helper OC.","Peeling","303441","A double standard would be the application of a different methodology to different problems. What you're questioning is the application of the same methodology to two different problems. We can test claims of a global flood because we can use our understanding of fluid dynamics, geology and so forth to make positive predictions about what we ought to see if there had been a global flood, and compare that with what we actually see - which is that there's no way a global flood could have occurred. So what about design? What positive predictions and comparisons can we make? Answer: none. This is because all possible observations could be explicable via design, especially once you factor in the 'unknowable mind of god'. Imagine a pile of sand. Is the position and shape of each grain a result of design? It could be. We can't exclude the possibility, particularly if we posit an omnipotent entity to whom such a feat would be negligable. Design is, in the end, selection from within a pool of alternatives. Whether those options all have physical presence, or some are mental abstractions with only the chosen option being realised, whether the design is evaluated as a whole or via its components or iteratively, in the end a design is just a selection of one option from many. It therefore doesn't make sense to ask whether any given thing was designed. It only makes sense to ask what was involved in its selection. At that point, it's always possible to suggest 'god', because 'god' is the catch-all. God could have been responsible for the pile of sand. Of course, that's overkill: there are simpler, more specific explanations involving wind and gravity. But what about (sigh) a pocket-watch? Paley almost had a point. We infer a watchmaker from seeing a watch not because the watch 'looks designed' but because there's no evidence that alternatives from which the watch was selected ever existed in reality to be discriminated between by non-intelligent agents. Volcanos don't spew out prototype watches; hydrodynamic sorting doesn't bring the most accurate timepieces to the surface. I realise that's a bit of a headful, but stay with it; it's important. If most of the selection process occurs in the abstract, with only the final result being reified, then we won't see evidence of 'natural' processes generating and filtering alternatives. That's why the watchmaker analogy is wrong: there's no evidence of natural processes producing alternative watch configurations and selecting between them, so we're justified in inferring that much of the process must have occurred in the abstract - hence a designer. But there's ample evidence of natural processes producing and discriminating between alternative 'designs' of living creatures. Bolting on a designer is overkill. Every time you say god must have done what the bible says, you limit him.","regarding-assumptions","08:05 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","12"

You completely ignored my post because it shreaded your claims entirely. How does science, which does not even discuss God at all, pigeonhole it? Furthermore, you have clearly pigeonholed God by citing a book that talks only about one God. You have deliberately ignored issues of other Gods and how science cannot disprove Gods themselves.

Most non-scientists seem to be quite confused about precise definitions of biological evolution. Such confusion is due in large part to the inability of scientists to communicate effectively to the general public and also to confusion among scientists themselves about how to define such an important term. When discussing evolution it is important to distinguish between the existence of evolution and various theories about the mechanism of evolution. And when referring to the existence of evolution it is important to have a clear definition in mind. What exactly do biologists mean when they say that they have observed evolution or that humans and chimps have evolved from a common ancestor? One of the most respected evolutionary biologists has defined biological evolution as follows: ""In the broadest sense, evolution is merely change, and so is all-pervasive; galaxies, languages, and political systems all evolve. Biological evolution ... is change in the properties of populations of organisms that transcend the lifetime of a single individual. The ontogeny of an individual is not considered evolution; individual organisms do not evolve. The changes in populations that are considered evolutionary are those that are inheritable via the genetic material from one generation to the next. Biological evolution may be slight or substantial; it embraces everything from slight changes in the proportion of different alleles within a population (such as those determining blood types) to the successive alterations that led from the earliest protoorganism to snails, bees, giraffes, and dandelions."" - Douglas J.

Science cannot test the supernatural. Science, if you understood it, which has already proven to be untrue, is the study of the natural world. Deities are by definition supernatural and reside outside of the natural world. Science cannot disprove nor prove what lies outside its jurisdiction and realm of study. In the same fashion that you would not ask a psychologist to determine if the financial EVA projections are correct as that is clearly outside of their jurisdiction and realm of study, asking science to do the same thing is ridiculous. What science can disprove is the claims about what Gods have done in the natural world. The flood for example has been utterly refuted in the literal sense. That does not prove that the Abrahamic God does not exist. It just proves that the flood didn't happen in a literal way. And your logic dictates that if one does not credit, one is attempting to disprove someone else. Since Darwin in ""Origin of Species"" did not credit Wallace who actually came up with much of the theory before Darwin, your logic dictates that Darwin was trying to disprove Wallace even though they had essentially the same argument. How about for once since you joined you deal with your bad logic instead of blaming others for your failures?
