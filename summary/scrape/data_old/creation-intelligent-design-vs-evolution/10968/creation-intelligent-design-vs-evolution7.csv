You accept getting roasted to a crisp with about as much grace as your lil buddy obvious_child. The words ""Judeo Christianity"" appear nowhere on the cover of the book. The book is dishonest of course - it meanders back and fourth between any god and the Judeo Christian God just enough so that your claim can be argueably made, especially with lots of needling fallacies, coupled with a gang. At the top of page 234, under the heading of ""What gods remain"", it says this in the first paragraph, which sums it pretty well; Now, a believer is certainly free to argue that ""none of these Gods is my god."" I have nowhere claimed that I can rule out every conceivable god, just those with the selected empirically detectable attributes. If a believer's god does not have any of those attributes, then I have no quarrel with her. Now, a believer is certainly free to argue that ""none of these Gods is my god."" I have nowhere claimed that I can rule out every conceivable god, just those with the selected empirically detectable attributes. If a believer's god does not have any of those attributes, then I have no quarrel with her. One thing that stands out to me, is that he referred to God as a ""her"". Wonder if that was a fallacy, or just a militant atheist taunt? Would the scientific community that loves him give him an equal break if he'd have referred to God as black, or oriental? But mainly, he doesn't have a problem with any god that has NO ATTRIBUTES. To question it, results in RAGE from those who represent evolution.","electrolyte","304436","When I mentioned the boatloads of specific (Judeo-Christian) characteristics attributed to ""God"" in this book, was it bald assertion or was it evidence? I'll give you a hint: you can still go back and read the links. I don't know how I can possibly make this any clearer: the text makes it clear from the get-go that the main target is the Judeo-Christian-Islamic God. It stands to reason that this is the meaning of ""God"" that he uses throughout the book, and that view is supported by reading page 22. Swing and a miss. You see, marc, in order to get roasted, one has to be wrong. If you'd just read , you'd see that I'm not. Yes, folks, this is literally marc judging a book entirely by its cover. In marc's fantasyland, there's no need for actual text; we just read a title and we instantaneously know what we've for years foolishly required multiple, sometimes hundreds, sometimes thousands of pages to explain. Dear God ... can people really be this absolutely disconnected from reality, or is it all just an act? Right: the book is dishonest because it looks exactly like it's not arguing against all conceptualizations of god. Clearly, this is because it is trying to disprove all conceptualizations of god. Your evidence for this is that it looks exactly like it's not arguing against all conceptualizations of god. Therefore, the book is arguing against all conceptualizations of god. And this excerpt that explicitly shows that Stenger acknowledges that he hasn't disproved all conceptualizations of gods is proof that Stenger is trying to disprove all conceptualizations of God. F***ing hell, it's like slamming my head against a wall. Again, how the hell can I not expose your reading comprehension when you make these bonehead comprehension mistakes. When Stenger says ""her,"" he is referring to the believer. Frankly, I wonder why it's such a huge deal, unless the bigotry is based on the clear anti-female sentiment in the Bible. In fact, I don't see why the Christian God would have a sex at all (you know, except for the part about fabricating it all for humans' selfish reasons). Science can't disprove a deity that doesn't have testable effects. Period. Keep your religion out of the realm of science, and you keep your religion out of the line of fire. Frankly, you can't fault science for stepping on its toes. That's like my saying that I have every right to spend time in your foyer without having to follow your house rules, accomodate your living in the house, or acknowledge your existence in any way whatsoever. No, marc, what is aggravating is that you and Archie apparently don't know how to read, or think, or come to grips with reality. The book says exactly what I've said it does, and you even post excerpts to that fact, and yet here you are saying that I'm wrong. I'm sorry, I just can't fix that kind of willful stupidity.","regarding-assumptions","12:13 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","92"

Because every time he claims someone he disagrees with was proven wrong, it is almost always self declared and revisionist history.","regarding-assumptions","01:09 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","93"
"03-04-2008","10968",7,"GazzaElliott","304473","Marc9000: That sounds like he knows you're right, thought he's laying down furious cover fire as he retreats.... I was waiting for the gang comment. Amazing how when it's AA + Marc v. 1 it's not unfair, but the moment their posts get so ridiculous others of us weigh in all you hear is cries of 'foul'! I like being in a gang! Do I get something? A badge perhaps..... (Hint hint 'lyte)","obvious_child","304491","And it's obviously that any argument that Marc disagrees with is fallacious independent of it actually being fallacious.","regarding-assumptions","12:43 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","95"

But in those cases, I don't have to correct any misconceptions. In fact, it's not that his being wrong is the problem. When I don't know about a topic, I listen to and refer to people who know more than I do. The problem that marc and Archie have is that they are sure that they are right and that all the highly experienced, highly trained experts are wrong. They don't listen at all to any argumentation and seem hellbent on finding a tiny scrap of evidence that they can spin into support for their persecution conspiracy theory, even -- or rather, especially -- if it means ignoring the mountains of evidence and the most basic logic that says otherwise.","regarding-assumptions","07:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","96"
