Why would you act as if they aren't connected schools of thought now?","foundit66","304029","I acknowledge that ""abiogenesis"" is an IDEA that exists, but it is NOT a part of evolution. Furthermore, it would be an insult to what the word ""theory"" stands for and requires to call ""abiogenesis"" a theory. Evolution exists INDEPENDENTLY of abiogenesis. And no. They are NOT taken as ""connected studies"". With abiogenesis, there is ridiculously little to ""study"". There has been no shown example of abiogenesis. Nothing to ""study"". It would be more accurate to say that abiogenesis and creation are competing ideas, but EITHER can fit in with the theory of evolution.","regarding-assumptions","07:32 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","61"

The issue is your dishonest misrepresentation of what conclusions can be drawn from what Science doesn't say rather than what it does say.","regarding-assumptions","08:33 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","63"
"02-29-2008","10968",5,"Archangel","304002","I agree that it never vocally EXCLUDES God from existing. But it does imply that our existence came about by completely Natural forces that don't allow for a Creator God in any way. The very term Random mutation just screams of our existing through Natural Selection, a completely biological process that does deny any intelligent designer played any part in our existence.","Dane","304041","Finally. Sheesh!!!! No, it doesn't. Once again you display your ignorance of how Scientific Data can be interpreted. As that has been explained to you before, and as you have chosen to ignore it for the sake of continuing your false claim, you are now dishonest. As explained prior, Science is based solely on Evidence. If there is no Evidence on a subject, then Science is not able to speak for or against it. That YOU chose to claim that it speaks against God when it does not, and that you REPEAT that blatantly false claim after it was pointed out to you, that makes you floridly dishonest. You are directly bearing false witness here. Nope, another false claim based on an interpretation that Science does not make. Only YOU make that interpretation and then try to blame it on Science. Your claim is again false.","regarding-assumptions","08:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","64"

The sciences are utterly different, Abiogenesis being a field in chemistry, not biology. So again your claim is outright false and expresses extreme ignorance coupled with contrived false witnessing. It is nothing but sophistry. Probably because they are not, and because when we talk about Evolution, we are not talking about Abiogenesis and vise versa.","regarding-assumptions","08:47 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","65"

"02-29-2008","10968",5,"Peeling","303700","An emotive but irrelevant question. Since there are no scientific tests I'm aware of that could even in principle evaluate the truth of the matter one way or the other, what are your grounds for suggesting such a contretemps might come to pass? And there, from a logical perspective, the similarity ends. It's very, very simple: one statement is positive (a flood happened) while the other is negative (evolution can't have happened via natural processes) You are, understandably, going to protest that we can phrase both claims positively: ""life was designed"". However, if you go back and read my little discourse on design further up, you can see that to claim life was designed is effectively to assert that some of the selection process occurred in the abstract rather than via natural processes. And since our definition of 'natural processes' includes anything testable, anything amenable to science, it follows that this 'abstract' or 'god' cannot be directly tested. We cannot check to see if god exists (positive claim) we can only test to see whether naturalistic explanations are insufficient (negative claim). That, we are already doing. All creation science does is jog alongside yelling ""We still don't know everything!"" It can't, by its own definition, contribute anything positive. We can and do, because we're interested in understanding what's really going on. Look at it this way for a moment: science looks for naturalistic explanations for phenomena, right? And it has peer review and a requirement for reproducible results to ensure those explanations aren't just made up, right?[ So if the creation hypothesis is correct, we'll hit something we can't find an explanation for, no matter how hard we try, right? Ok, now let's see what Creation Science buys us. Here we have some guys dilligently trying not to find naturalistic explanations for phenomena. They can be right, or they can be wrong. If they're right, then regular science won't find an answer even if we aren't listening to them. If they're wrong and we do listen to them, we won't find an answer even though one exists. I still don't understand the relevance of this book by Stenger - describing his conclusions - in a thread concerning assumptions. You can't rule out a designer, that's the whole point. All you can do is show that one isn't necessary. Same reason there's no conflict beween naturalistic science and theism - they don't overlap. What you're confusing, Marc - what every theistic opponent of what science has to say regarding evolution confuses - is the existence of god with you being right . God can exist and you can still be wrong about all the little details you believe are tied up with him. Here, let me show you what I mean: I'm an atheist. Still, I'm prepared to admit I might be completely wrong about the existence of a god, a supreme being. You're a Christian. Are you prepared to admit that you might be right about the existence of god, but wrong about evolution? See? The existence or non-existence of god isn't the issue at all. What you care about is being right. That's both the strength and weakness of religious dogma: it's strong and durable because it proclaims itself to be the word of god, but it's also vulnerable because once you've made that claim, you're exposed on a lot of fronts concerning which ancient people were pretty ignorant. You find yourself having to defend something preposterous like six day creation because you've bet the farm on everything being true. More than that, you constantly compound your own inflexibility by vocally deriding science for changing its mind so much in the light of new evidence - so now you can't backpedal and do the same. You end up trying to swim with millstones around your neck. You think? How many possibilities for god's actions in the past do you eliminate if you insist the bible is true? And how many do you eliminate if you show it to be false? If I say I went out for a meal last night and then to the cinema, do I limit my historical actions more or less than if I say I didn't go out for a meal and then to the cinema? Think about that for a bit.","marc9000","304047","There are all kinds of tests that could be performed to present evidence, both for and against claims of the holocaust, archeological testing in the areas where it was described to have taken place, genealogical testing of the people involved, etc. If there is no scientific way to test that, there certainly couldn't be any scientific way to test if there was a flood thousands of years ago. My grounds for suggesting that coming to pass is that it would have political and philosophical applications, just like the Biblical flood or other Biblical events. But since naturalism can't fill all the gaps, it does what it you're accusing ID of - it makes abstract assumptions, that life arose from non-living substances naturally. It does exactly what you accuse creation science of doing, it yells ""We still don't know everything"". The contributions are equal, from both worldviews. Searching for LACK of desigh contributes equally to a society as does searching FOR design. Yes, and you have, you can't find an explanation for the beginning of life. It's not fair to classify them that way. They are trying to study, with natural human limitations, how naturalism and the supernatural can be seen together. When it comes to guys dilligently trying NOT to find something, that designation goes to evolutionists, who refuse to consider ID. ID is not a designer search, it is a design search. There is a big difference. Check, so far that ones paning out pretty predictibly. Listening to them doesn't mean abandoning other ideas. It doesn't mean that godless evolution studies will be forbidden by the courts, in the public arena concerning funding and education. His conclusions are a result of his assumptions. He's shouting his very opinionated conclusions from the rooftops, and millions of impressionable minds are listening. Mainstream science winks and nods - it doesn't take exception to THIS side of scientific assumption, but it takes strong exception to the OTHER SIDE of scientific assumption, that there may be evidence for design. Why is there a desire to show that one isn't necessary? Not according to Stenger and Dawkins. If there's no conflict between naturalistic science and theism, then there should be plenty of conflict between naturalistic science and Stenger/Dawkins. We don't see it. We just see winks and nods. Those were two different questions. But I'm not as concerned about being right myself as I am with people in authority being wrong, and falsely teaching future generations to be wrong. I know you'll say that goes both ways. The difference is, mainstream science seeks to block ID legally. Representatives of ID don't indicate that they intend to legally block mainstream scientific evolution studies. Future generations should have a choice. Science changes it's mind in small ways, but its millstones, its inflexibility always shows up in its constant adoration of Darwin. You may have a point if all we were concerned with were God's actions of the past . But Christianity is largely about the present, and the future. The Bible says that God is eternal, unchangeable, omnipresent, omniscient, perfect, incomprehensible, holy, and good. If that's true, then the possiblities for his actions in the future would be pretty impressive, wouldn't they? Yet if what he said about his creation is false, maybe it would imply that his other attributes I referred to above could also be called into question.","regarding-assumptions","09:00 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","67"

"02-29-2008","10968",5,"Archangel","304013","If He did then why does Genesis give a completely different account of how we got here? One that claims He personally created us in His image? You never considered that one huh? And what is at all similar about the ToE and the Creation account? How do they mesh in any way? Doesn't the 4 billion year old Earth that evolution rests its hat on conflict with the Creation account also? So in what way again was this all Gods idea?","obvious_child","304067","For the same reason that Genesis gives a different account of everything else. Explaining how things actually worked to people who don't understand the basics of it is stupid. I already gave examples of this before. You don't start explaining things to people who don't understand at a complex level. You are proof of this. We have failed because we tried to discuss evolution and science with you, who can't even figure out what theory actually means. In the same fashion, trying to explain an old Earth to nomads is idiotic and futile. Not a problem. Your logical skills are bad and hence you didn't think I already had an answer. Unfortunately I already had the answer to this problem at least two years ago, maybe longer. God is assumed and believed to exist out side of time. Therefore God knows what will be and what has happened before it created matter. Therefore, God knows what species will arise. Furthermore, since God is inherently incorporeal and has the ability to assume any form it so wishes, having the mechanism it created to produce species that it could fathom before creation doesn't result in any contradiction. Which Creation account? Literal? Figurative? Which story? If you take them figuratively, I don't see any problems. Literal you start running into a huge problems, and not just with evolution. Basic hydrology that is used by the Army Corp of Engineers and local water municipalities in managing water aquifers for use must be thrown out despite it being proven to be true for at least a hundred years. While it is true that some of radiology is based on assumptions, and these assumptions are based on a very old Earth and Universe, the same radiology is used to power nuclear reactors. If such assumptions were indeed false, that creates a problem of how such a field of study could have such massive problems yet use the same problem riddled methods to produce practical, tangible results. Pragmatism and commercial application largely prove much of the science based on old earth assumptions to be true. One of the major failings of creationists claims in my opinion is that there are no practical applications based on the so called 'science' of creation. If something was indeed true, one would be able to apply it to real world settings. Old Earth Geology is used by the oil industry. Old Earth hydrology by local municipalities. Evolutionary biology by big pharmaceuticals. The same methods used by biologists studying evolution are the same used in criminal forensics cases. As opposed to nothing by YEC 'science.' Evolution and the old Earth, (which are not dependent by the way) has relatively little to do with literal Creationism on its own. The existence of creation has no impact upon the actual truth of evolution. Evolution is never argued to be true on the basis of Creationism's wrongness, where Creationism is rarely argued to be true on the basis of its merits. I don't speak for God and neither should you. However, it is possible that evolution is merely a tool of God. Deism actually requires evolution (or something similar) as the Deistic set of Gods are not present and do not interfere.","regarding-assumptions","11:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","72"

To even MAKE such a remark as yours is indicative that you seek information to confirm your already made-up conclusion rather than honestly looking at the evidence and base your conclusion on it. That's the hallmark of creationism and one of the points evidencing how creationism is the opposite of honest, scientific inquiry. And you nicely demonstrated it. It is the theocrats' pretend-science right up there with the show held back in the old Soviet with the mandatory ""elections"" of one person. The idea that you will make the evidence conform to your already decided conclusion, which makes it an utter sham. yet, you are derisive against one of the main methods of preventing such sham and keeping the exploration honest.
