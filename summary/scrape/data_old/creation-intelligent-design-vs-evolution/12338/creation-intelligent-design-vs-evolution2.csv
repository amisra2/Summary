One atheist poster here told me that we wouldnt be able to purify and distribute drinking water if we werent certain that the earth was billions of years old. Explorations of the technicalities of these claims arent really possible at these forums it usually results in insult fests involving 10 or 15 posters against one, and the research for the one can be enormous. But all technology we have today is the result of working with material that we have in the here and now. It depends on what you mean by scientific discoveries. Completely unlimited scientific research (embryonic stem cell research, for example) can clash with widely accepted traditional morals. Life is short for all of us, no matter how much humanism/science tries to keep us alive. How much scientific research should be done on borrowed money? Science is never far from politics. But evolution / biology is what were talking about its what your songofgenesis link is all about life. According to a 1998 survey of members of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), nearly 95 percent of NAS biologists are atheists or agnostics. Either biology is converting them to atheism, or people with an interest in atheism are taking up biology. It has to be one of the two, doesnt it? Which do you suspect it is? I suspect the latter. All evolutionists are not atheists, but all atheists are evolutionists. Of course it is, though shes Jewish, not Christian. But does that make the factual research she did any less valid? Its much easier to document recent political history than it is to document events from millions of years ago. People tend not to notice things that theyre not keeping an eye out for. Did you know about all of those books I listed above, all with copyrights very recent and close to each other? There is an anger, almost a rage in most evolutionists. Its obvious in those book titles, in many posters at these forums who claim to have an education in it, or just about anywhere evolution is discussed. Have you read through some of the threads at this forum? We cant keep relgious discussion out of the science classroom. Example; All it takes is for one student to refer to anything on talkorigins, and religion enters the science classroom, because talkorigins has dozens of pages of creationist (religion) put downs. Creation has been declared not to be science, so any reference to it is a kind of religious discussion. Adam is one of the few people that God spoke directly to. God was directly disobeyed. If you dont believe God spoke directly to Adam, do you believe he spoke directly to Noah, or Moses? His direct speaking to certain people in those times is basic to all that Christianity is. When Genesis is treated as poetry, how can we stop the whole Bible and all of Christianity from being poetry? It was the beginning of the sinful relationship. To disregard it changes our sinful relationship with God to something not clearly defined. It makes its severity something open to different interpretations, making it practically meaningless. It waters it down to a harmless evolutionary factor, and thats not what it is. Man is more than a ""higher"" animal. I haven't noticed the NAS, or any anti-creationist on these forums make a single compromise. Thats it exactly they want all morals and religion out of their way, and they wont broaden their perspective to poetry! Songofgenesis / theistic evolution is right next to atheism, pure and simple. Darwin made the simple transition from theistic evolution to non-belief, it's an easy step. An objective subject (like science should be) cannot simultaneously show God vividly and show that he does not exist.

I have read enough to reject all their ""evidence."" One of the attacks on evolutionary science is to attack C14 decay. I have worked with a group that separated tree rings and analyzed each ring. The tree ring chains that allow us to cringsorrect the C14 analysis back for thousands of years are solid. Furthermore, there are similar layer dating systems, ice core, lake core, stalactite rings among others. These help scientists, even other Christian scientists, to verify other radioactive dating systems. Therefore, when the bones are dug up from the earth and are dated millions of years apart, They have substantial nonevolutionary science backing them up. They also show that the layers are not flood layers, laid down in one years time as some of the Creation scientists maintain. Then, when a chain of bones of a family of animals shows up with the dating agreeing with the pattern of changes, the evidence seems substantial. Whether Whales, Horses or dinosaurs to birds, the chains seem clear. Not only that, but continuing research finds more intermediate species just as the evolutionary Anthropologists had predicted. Well, most of the time. Some times the chian proposed is different from the chain later found, but it is still an evolutionary chain. As I said, I am a devout Fundamentalist Christian, but I must face the facts. Even if a facet of the Evolutionary theory is found wrong, the replacement is also a form of evolution. Some believe in steady changes but more and more believe in punctuated evolution. Even if part of the theory was wrong, the theory as a whole is solid. I went and analyzed the book of Genesis. I thought I might find that genesis was poetry like the songingenesis person states. Instead, I found high accuracy. Especially startling was the story of Adam and Eve. When I didn't bring in any traditional interpretations, but let the Bible speak for itself, I found it preserved the exact location of the domestication of wheat.
