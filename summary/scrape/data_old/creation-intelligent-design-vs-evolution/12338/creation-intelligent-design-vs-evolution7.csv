Animism is the earliest building block in man's primitive religious belief systems. In seeking to understand the world around him, he apportioned supernatural causation to things not understood, and first conceived the concept of the soul. Animism lies at the foundation of all religion. It signifies man's earliest attempts to understand his surroundings, and take to himself the perception of control of them. Events outwith his control or understanding were attributed to supernatural causes. ID is no more than animism rationalised with a thin veneer of pseudoscientific jargon.","obvious_child","358249","Ssssh. Arch is not capable of moving beyond the surface.

But you can't do that because it is a patently ridiculous proposition. Intelligent Design proposes that God, an all powerful intelligent being created all that is, not that everything created by the intelligent designer has a soul which animism proposes.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","06:22 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","93"

No-one is suggesting rocks have souls, although if souls existed, why not all living things? Animism first proposed the existence of magical beings who made everything. Animism included everything in that creation, and included multiple creators and multiple receivers of souls. Such inclusion evolved to exclude many things (such as rocks, plants, trees, animals) until some religions evolved to the extent of exclude all gods but one, which resided in only one of its creations. ID is merely an updated version of that early superstition, which postulated that since the making of the world was beyond their capability, it must have been some imaginary invisible undetectable being.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","06:58 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","94"

Animism believes that every object has a soul which is why animists worship stone and wooden idols and idols made of any inanimate objects. They even believe that weather systems have souls. To equate this belief to ID is to corrupt and pervert ID at its most basic level. ID believes that an intelligent designer created all that is, not that everything in existence shares the universal soul of the intelligent designer who created everything.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","07:31 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","95"
"06-22-2009","12338",7,"Archangel","358201","Although the bolded is technically true from a secular/humanistic perspective, according to the living God who is offended by any form of idolatry, any philosophy which detracts from Him or draws His children away from Him is deemed as idolatry. That is why christians see evolution as a philosophical enemy of God. Not because it specifically teaches that God doesn't exist, but because it doesn't acknowledge the part God played in creating all that exists in time and space. It attempts to explain our existence apart from an intelligent being.","chester","358270","Believe what you will. I very much prefer this: ""The correct scientific response to something that is not understood must always be to look harder for the explanation, not give up and assume a supernatural cause.""

David Attenborough","Archangel","358286","Attenborough's premise would be fine if God did not in fact create all that is. So that question is answered. As for using science to investigate the unknown, my belief system is fine with that, of course.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","10:59 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","98"

That is why science will not investigate weather or not there is a god because there is no way to answer that question and trying to would be a waste of time and money. The conflict between science and religion has a direction and that direction is religion opposes science, science does not oppose religion. People think that since we have found that the bible is untrue in many respects, that it means science and reason have disproved god but nothing could be farther from the truth.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","11:55 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","99"

Penfold is discussing the reasons for why Animism assigned its animistic beliefs and thus its core logic. You are stuck at the surface as to why Animism did rather than move below the superficial into its core logic and principles. Instead of talking about why you are only talking about what . Hence why we laugh at you. You are trying to argue that the superficial appearance of Animism negates our arguments about the primary core logic and principles of why Animism did what it did. You are arguing that the ocean is calm by looking at the surface while we are discussing the turbulence of underwater currents. We move below the surface, while you are stuck.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","04:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","100"

"06-23-2009","12338",7,"marc9000","358103","Because the scientific community seeks political and economic stature, and many ethical standards of religion get in its way.","Larni","358380","This is simply untrue. Individual scientists may seek political power just like anyone else. But the scientific community as a whole does not. Would you argue the same things against Lawyers? Your god does not come into the equation when a prosecution and defence is layed. Do you beleive they are against your particular god? I'm current involved in carrying out research and I can tell you that the only ethical standards I have to reach are those set by the locale Ethics Board. This is not part of the 'ethical standards of religion' and is the most torturous set of hoops any one can jump through. I could no more do harm because of the hypersensitivity of this Board than I could walk to the moon. Nothing to do with the 'ethical standards of religion'. You seem to characterise scientist as one homolgous group. Nothing can be further from the truth: if you want to see two people fight it out, put two scientist with slightly different paradigms in a room, then stand back.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","03:53 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","103"

The only reason for regecting the findings of science is if it conflicts with with your version of a god. This is an a priori assumption and obviously flawed. If you regect science on these grounds I support you right to do so, but should you not regect all science? Biology uses the scientific method no different to psychology or physics.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","03:58 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","104"
