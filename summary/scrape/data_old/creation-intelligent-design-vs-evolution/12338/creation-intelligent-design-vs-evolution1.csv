All of this stuff about creation versus evolution is a smoke screen. It doesnt matter a fig unless you want it to!

Have you considered endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) or inactive genes to metabolize vitamin C, or perhaps you've overlooked the field of biogeography? What do you make of continental islands compared to oceanic islands and their subsequent distribution of species? This should give you somewhere to start. BTW, when you see the word ""theory"" being used when referencing things scientific, you should replace it with the word ""fact"" in your mind. Because, you see, the theory of evolution is supported by mountains of evidence from literally every field of science. Unfortunately, creationists and ID'ers have been brainwashed to think otherwise.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","01:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","7"

So, if what scientists claim happened, and what Genesis claims happened are so similar to one another, what's the problem? Why is there so much disagreement? Poetry does not mean fiction. Science helps those who seek to understand God in a more profound way, to learn about the intricate and complex unfolding of His creation. In modern times, The Rabbinical Council of America (RCA) has ""maintained that evolutionary theory, properly understood, is not incompatible with belief in a Divine Creator, nor with the first two chapters of Genesis."" Perhaps the problem is that creationists do not seem to ""understand"" the process of evolution? Charles Darwin was a believer, and a deeply spiritual man . Darwin delayed the publication of his observations in The Origin of the Species for eight years, because he feared becoming another Galileo! It is too bad that he has become demonized by people who misunderstand his findings. There is nothing in scripture to support the idea that mankind should remain ignorant by ignoring all that science has to offer. Our public school children should not be subjected to this one narrow view of our God or our universe. They have the right to enjoy the discovery of our loving creator God's marvelous power by exploring the world of science! Let them learn!","marc9000","356357","It's always interesting to look at websites like www.songofgenesis.org and and try to figure out if they are some person or groups sincere belief, or if they are simply an atheist trick. This one has several red flags that tell me it's probably atheism. It asks this question; It is well written and not really offensive, yet it blames creationists 100% for the disagreement, and atheists 0% for the disagreement. I simply don't believe that the writer(s) are unaware that Victor Stenger wrote a book called "" How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist "". A sincere person with the beliefs of that article simply couldn't ignore that, and all the other militant atheism in the scientific community. They also can't ignore the simple fact that reasons for disagreement between literal Genesis and science is political. Another quote from songofgenesis; But poetry will never be taken seriously in political decisions. Atheists have a lot to like in songofgenesis, don't they? another quote And science helped Stenger write his book. How can the same subject make a stronger case for both of two completely opposing viewpoints? another Could be another problem - that perhaps Victor Stenger and Richard Dawkins do not properly understand when to stop coming to dramatic conclusions about evolution? Why no reference to that problem? and another This perversion of history is often put fourth by atheists, as they constantly switch back and fourth between associating/disassociating evolution with atheism. Darwins life has been carefully and extensively studied by many people, and its almost unanimous among those historians that Darwins faith faded as his life went on, and that he was an unbeliever when he died. and That would be incorrect. There is nothing in scripture that encourages man to cross examine his faith with worldly things. Mark 10:15 warns against it. Other parts of the Bible warn against false teaching. finally Should Victor Stenger teach them? No warnings about that? Sorry -Songofgenesis doesn't cut it.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","08:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","11"

I believe the writers are aware that there are atheists in the scientific community, since they make passing reference to them, but since the purpose of this site ( www.songofgenesis.org ) is to help people of faith see that science doesn't have to conflict with religion, what would be the point of dwelling on the stance of non-believers like Stenger? His views were certainly not relevant to their case! Also, do you suppose that atheists have perhaps become ""militant"" in order to counter the political activism of creationists? ""...Darwins faith faded as his life went on, and that he was an unbeliever when he died,"" Yes, that is unfortunate and sad. I'm sure he despaired when everyone turned against him. However, he WAS a believer at the time, and that was the important part. His observations were NOT an attempt to ""disprove"" God! ""There is nothing in scripture that encourages man to cross examine his faith with worldly things. Mark 10:15 warns against it."" Mark was warning about becoming obsessed with materialism, not advocating ignorance.
