Have you considered endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) or inactive genes to metabolize vitamin C, or perhaps you've overlooked the field of biogeography? What do you make of continental islands compared to oceanic islands and their subsequent distribution of species? This should give you somewhere to start. BTW, when you see the word ""theory"" being used when referencing things scientific, you should replace it with the word ""fact"" in your mind.

So, if what scientists claim happened, and what Genesis claims happened are so similar to one another, what's the problem? Why is there so much disagreement? Poetry does not mean fiction. Science helps those who seek to understand God in a more profound way, to learn about the intricate and complex unfolding of His creation. In modern times, The Rabbinical Council of America (RCA) has ""maintained that evolutionary theory, properly understood, is not incompatible with belief in a Divine Creator, nor with the first two chapters of Genesis."" Perhaps the problem is that creationists do not seem to ""understand"" the process of evolution? Charles Darwin was a believer, and a deeply spiritual man . Darwin delayed the publication of his observations in The Origin of the Species for eight years, because he feared becoming another Galileo! It is too bad that he has become demonized by people who misunderstand his findings. There is nothing in scripture to support the idea that mankind should remain ignorant by ignoring all that science has to offer. Our public school children should not be subjected to this one narrow view of our God or our universe. They have the right to enjoy the discovery of our loving creator God's marvelous power by exploring the world of science! Let them learn!","marc9000","356357","It's always interesting to look at websites like www.songofgenesis.org and and try to figure out if they are some person or groups sincere belief, or if they are simply an atheist trick. This one has several red flags that tell me it's probably atheism. It asks this question; It is well written and not really offensive, yet it blames creationists 100% for the disagreement, and atheists 0% for the disagreement. I simply don't believe that the writer(s) are unaware that Victor Stenger wrote a book called "" How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist "". A sincere person with the beliefs of that article simply couldn't ignore that, and all the other militant atheism in the scientific community. They also can't ignore the simple fact that reasons for disagreement between literal Genesis and science is political. Another quote from songofgenesis; But poetry will never be taken seriously in political decisions. Atheists have a lot to like in songofgenesis, don't they? another quote And science helped Stenger write his book. How can the same subject make a stronger case for both of two completely opposing viewpoints? another Could be another problem - that perhaps Victor Stenger and Richard Dawkins do not properly understand when to stop coming to dramatic conclusions about evolution? Why no reference to that problem? and another This perversion of history is often put fourth by atheists, as they constantly switch back and fourth between associating/disassociating evolution with atheism. Darwins life has been carefully and extensively studied by many people, and its almost unanimous among those historians that Darwins faith faded as his life went on, and that he was an unbeliever when he died. and That would be incorrect. There is nothing in scripture that encourages man to cross examine his faith with worldly things. Mark 10:15 warns against it. Other parts of the Bible warn against false teaching. finally Should Victor Stenger teach them? No warnings about that?

I believe the writers are aware that there are atheists in the scientific community, since they make passing reference to them, but since the purpose of this site ( www.songofgenesis.org ) is to help people of faith see that science doesn't have to conflict with religion, what would be the point of dwelling on the stance of non-believers like Stenger? His views were certainly not relevant to their case! Also, do you suppose that atheists have perhaps become ""militant"" in order to counter the political activism of creationists? ""...Darwins faith faded as his life went on, and that he was an unbeliever when he died,"" Yes, that is unfortunate and sad. I'm sure he despaired when everyone turned against him.

One atheist poster here told me that we wouldnt be able to purify and distribute drinking water if we werent certain that the earth was billions of years old. Explorations of the technicalities of these claims arent really possible at these forums it usually results in insult fests involving 10 or 15 posters against one, and the research for the one can be enormous. But all technology we have today is the result of working with material that we have in the here and now. It depends on what you mean by scientific discoveries. Completely unlimited scientific research (embryonic stem cell research, for example) can clash with widely accepted traditional morals. Life is short for all of us, no matter how much humanism/science tries to keep us alive. How much scientific research should be done on borrowed money? Science is never far from politics. But evolution / biology is what were talking about its what your songofgenesis link is all about life. According to a 1998 survey of members of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), nearly 95 percent of NAS biologists are atheists or agnostics. Either biology is converting them to atheism, or people with an interest in atheism are taking up biology. It has to be one of the two, doesnt it? Which do you suspect it is? I suspect the latter. All evolutionists are not atheists, but all atheists are evolutionists. Of course it is, though shes Jewish, not Christian. But does that make the factual research she did any less valid? Its much easier to document recent political history than it is to document events from millions of years ago. People tend not to notice things that theyre not keeping an eye out for. Did you know about all of those books I listed above, all with copyrights very recent and close to each other? There is an anger, almost a rage in most evolutionists. Its obvious in those book titles, in many posters at these forums who claim to have an education in it, or just about anywhere evolution is discussed. Have you read through some of the threads at this forum? We cant keep relgious discussion out of the science classroom. Example; All it takes is for one student to refer to anything on talkorigins, and religion enters the science classroom, because talkorigins has dozens of pages of creationist (religion) put downs. Creation has been declared not to be science, so any reference to it is a kind of religious discussion. Adam is one of the few people that God spoke directly to. God was directly disobeyed. If you dont believe God spoke directly to Adam, do you believe he spoke directly to Noah, or Moses? His direct speaking to certain people in those times is basic to all that Christianity is. When Genesis is treated as poetry, how can we stop the whole Bible and all of Christianity from being poetry? It was the beginning of the sinful relationship. To disregard it changes our sinful relationship with God to something not clearly defined. It makes its severity something open to different interpretations, making it practically meaningless. It waters it down to a harmless evolutionary factor, and thats not what it is. Man is more than a ""higher"" animal. I haven't noticed the NAS, or any anti-creationist on these forums make a single compromise. Thats it exactly they want all morals and religion out of their way, and they wont broaden their perspective to poetry! Songofgenesis / theistic evolution is right next to atheism, pure and simple. Darwin made the simple transition from theistic evolution to non-belief, it's an easy step. An objective subject (like science should be) cannot simultaneously show God vividly and show that he does not exist.

I don't say it is exactly right. In fact, I enjoy the changes as scientists learn more. I also enjoy the debates over different Theories, such as the one over the humanoid fossils. Is X in the direct chain to mankind or just a dead end side chain? I recognize that details of the theory, or even major chunks can change, but still I am comfortable with the science, and the theory. Now, I know that no science can prove that there is no God guiding evolution, and no science can prove that there is a God guiding evolution. Neither should be taught in schools, just the science. I do see Christians teaching interpretations of the Bible, like the world wide flood, which cause many to turn away from God. I also see other Christians trying to mash the Bible to show that Noah's flood was the flooding of the Black Sea. Now the flooding of the Black Sea was an amazing scientific/historic event, but it doesn't fit Noah's flood. I have searched scripture to see what is possible, within the Biblical statements, and then looked to see which of the possibilities fit science. We can't convince anyone that there is a God by these studies. We can only avoid driving people away by unscientific interpretations. That is only possible if there are solid interpretations that also fit science. My study of the Garden lead me to conclude that it described the moment of Domestication. As a followup, it lead me to give up the Creationist teaching and come to peace with evolution, a conclusion I didn't really want to make. Now, I still am convinced that God is involved in the process, but all I would try to convince you is that the Garden was set in a point in history. If you wanted to talk about the existence of God, I would use a completely different strategy.

If a change or changes took place, a carbon year may not necessarily equal a calendar year. Radiometric dating and real time may be assumed to be equivalent only if the following criteria are met: For C-14 dating the conditions are: 1. The material to be dated must be organic 2. The organism to be tested must have gotten its C-14 from the atmosphere 3. The sample has remained chemically and physically a closed system since its emplacement. 4. That we know what the atmospheric concentration of C-14 was when the organism lived. From your first paragraph where you discuss dating objects at thousands of year ages, you then make the giant leap in this next paragraph and extrapolate that to then extend and accept the dating of fossils at millions of years is rational and a naturally correct progression. Nothing could be more fallacious and wrong to make such a leap based on your perceived, yet unproven C-14 Dating methods. But let me ask you this as one fundamental Christian to another. How do you align the concept of the Genesis Creation story which clearly states that God created the Universe and everything within it in 6 days time which were broken up into 24 hour days, with evolution which claims that man evolved from lower animals over hundreds of millions of years, if not billions of years if we consider the alleged appearance of original life on Earth according to evolution hypothesis? What does the evolution account do to the Genesis accounts introduction of sin into the world by way of A&Es fall from grace, and Mans need for reconciliation to God because they disobeyed God, and ate of the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? Don't you agree that if evolution is true then there is no need for God or the need for Mans redemption as outlined in the bible? The whole bible is about mans need for reconciliation to God due to our initial rebellion by disobeying His very clear warning that the day that we ate of that tree we would surely die through A&E. And because of that, the need for Jesus plan for salvation became a spiritual necessity.

Don't you agree that if evolution is true then there is no need for God or the need for Mans redemption as outlined in the bible? The whole bible is about mans need for reconciliation to God due to our initial rebellion by disobeying His very clear warning that the day that we ate of that tree we would surely die through A&E.

He says this: Even he admits how convoluted his explanation is and he ties nothing together at all in the end. No wonder you accept that as evidence. In another post on the same thread he says this, and I quote: [greentwiga said:] Goliath's height was six cubits and a span. A cubit was the length from the elbow to the fingertip and it varied from one person to another and from one culture to another. A typical 6 foot tall person has a cubit (1/4 of height) of 1 1/2 feet. Six cubits is 9 feet. Sumerians had a cubit slightly longer (19 or 20 inches) A tribe with men averaging 5 feet tall would have a cubit of 1 1/4 feet. Thus Goliath would have been 7 1/2 feet tall. He could have been a perfectly normal giant with none of the health problems that come from a pituitary abnormality. This leaves us with an interpretation of the Bible that does not contradict science. So my alleged fundamentalist friend is all over the place as he attempts to marry science with theology. What he will eventually realize hopefully is that all he accomplishes in doing so is to deceive himself and miss the precious truth in Gods word. Here, let me explain how his explanation contradicts Gods word and message in the end. It is exposed in this attempt to once again compromise Gods truth with a secular humanist interpretation which he supports with no spiritual or theological sources at all. [greentwiga also said:] The second problematical interpretation is that all men died in the flood. The word for World in Gen 6 & 7 is also translated region or country. In Peter, he refers to the creation of the world and the final destruction of the world with the word ""Ge."" He refers to the destruction of the world by the flood with the word cosmos . This means the organized world. An literal interpretation of the Bible can be that just Sumer was flooded. Then the Nephilim were not all destroyed in the flood, Goliath was one of the Anakim who were descended from the Nephilim, and there is no contradiction. So, if you read greentwigas second paragraph here and place it side by side with the Genesis account regarding Gods reason for destroying the Earth by flood as told here: Gen 6:1 Now it came about, when men began to multiply on the face of the land, and daughters were born to them, Gen 6:2 that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose. Gen 6:3 Then the LORD said, ""My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; nevertheless his days shall be one hundred and twenty years."" Gen 6:4 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore {children} to them. Those were the mighty men who {were} of old, men of renown. Gen 6:5 Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. Gen 6:6 The LORD was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart. Gen 6:7 The LORD said, ""I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, from man to animals to creeping things and to birds of the sky; for I am sorry that I have made them."" So, we see that according to greentwiga God totally failed in his reason and motivation for destroying the World through the flood if the giants survived, since Gods intention was to wipe out these creatures which were the result of Fallen Angels mixing with women which resulted in these giants existing in the first place. Also greentwiga, you have an immediate problem of credibility with true believers around here since the only people buying into your theology are atheists like the obvious child here. Also you say the word used to describe the world/Earth in Genesis 6 is cosmos? Gen 6:4 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore {children} to them. Those were the mighty men who {were} of old, men of renown. Wrong again, and here is evidence from the Lexicon. How about you stop just making claims and start supporting your theological assertions with respected theological sources which support what you say? Blue Letter Bible - Lexicon For a real comparison, here is the usage of the word Earth in Genesis 1:1 click on #776 to get the meaning of the word used and you will see that it is the same word used in Genesis 6. Blue Letter Bible - Book of Beginnings - Genesis 1 (NASB - New American Standard Bible) So rather than use diversionary tactics which attempt to build an argument that is once again based on misinformation and lies, why not honestly respond with actual supportable theological evidence for once?

However the findings of science are not democratically decided. Science is not a democracy. No I am not kidding. You pick a bad example. Human behaviour. That would be the science of psychology (my field for the last 15 years or so). History does not use the scientific method as far as I'm aware but it's not my field so I could be wrong. That some people believe in things with no evidence is hardly out of the ordinary. People frequently engage in 'magical thinking' confusing correlation for causation. If the discussion is science and one member of the discussion does not have the required level of expertise to have a meaningful debate, there can be no debate. Knowledge of subjects outside the sphere of the debate at had is irrelevant to the debate. If one of my patients knows more about engineering than I do, what difference does that make to the treatment my training dictates is appropriate? I still value the patient as an individual but his knowledge in this case is irrelevant. Just as religion is irrelevant to science. Science keeps in improving it's accuracy at describing and predicting the way the universe works. The various theologies that religious people have becomes getting less useful at doing this as time progresses. People will always believe in the supernatural (magical thinking again) but this does not make it an accurate reflection of reality (correlation is not causation). Stenger and Dawkins only really point out that there is no evidence for the supernatural (although The God Delusion did read like a speech from an evangelical pulpit).

What does the evolution account do to the Genesis accounts introduction of sin into the world by way of A&Es fall from grace, and Mans need for reconciliation to God because they disobeyed God, and ate of the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? Don't you agree that if evolution is true then there is no need for God or the need for Mans redemption as outlined in the bible? The whole bible is about mans need for reconciliation to God due to our initial rebellion by disobeying His very clear warning that the day that we ate of that tree we would surely die through A&E. And because of that, the need for Jesus plan for salvation became a spiritual necessity. Can't you see that according to evolution, none of this is necessary? [/QUOTE] First, I accept each and every word in the original was inspired by God (not necessarily the translations) Then I went back to look at the original passage. It says, ""There was evening and there was morning, a second day."" This pattern is repeated almost unchanged over six days. Then I looked to see what it means. It could be six literal days. In Genesis 2:4, it says, ""This is the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the heavens and earth. 5:1 and 10:1 are two other passages that use the same formula and cover all the generations mentioned. Frequently, the next statement about generations goes back in time from where the previous one ended and starts another group, such as Gen 11:10 where it even repeats part of the genealogy of Shem. The first one, started in Gen 2:4 ends (time wise) with the three sons of Lamech. All this, according to Gen 2:4 is in one day. The six days of Genesis 1 are said to be one day and the seven generations of Cain are also part of the one day. It could be that the days of Genesis 1 are not 24 hour days. Thus, it does nothing to the account of Genesis 2-4. Adam and Eve committed Evil (Look up the meaning in Hebrew), and in the same day, died. They lived many more years, so could this mean they died spiritually? Yes. Now they needed the reconciliation. When you understand the Hebrew word for Evil, you see that even if evolution is right, Rom 5 shows that through one man, sin entered the world and death spread to all men, because all sinned. It states how Adam was given a law and broke it. Death spread to all men, even over people who had not sinned in the likeness of Adam. They had sinned a different way. I agree, the whole Bible is about man's need to be reconciled to God. I fail to see how evolution negates that in any way.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","07:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","62"
"06-14-2009","12338",5,"Larni","357435","The scientific method cannot prove anything. That's part of the philosophy of science. We always have the chance that new evidence will come along to falsify the current paradigm. Biology (just like any scientific discipline) is always re assessing it's self against new evidence. Quite. The uses that scientific discoveries are put to can only be decided by the people. However the findings of science are not democratically decided. Science is not a democracy. No I am not kidding. You pick a bad example. Human behaviour. That would be the science of psychology (my field for the last 15 years or so). History does not use the scientific method as far as I'm aware but it's not my field so I could be wrong. That some people believe in things with no evidence is hardly out of the ordinary. People frequently engage in 'magical thinking' confusing correlation for causation. If the discussion is science and one member of the discussion does not have the required level of expertise to have a meaningful debate, there can be no debate. Knowledge of subjects outside the sphere of the debate at had is irrelevant to the debate. If one of my patients knows more about engineering than I do, what difference does that make to the treatment my training dictates is appropriate? I still value the patient as an individual but his knowledge in this case is irrelevant. Just as religion is irrelevant to science. Originally posted by marc9000] What were doing here is discussing the APPLICATION of a subject, not necessarily the nuts and bolts of the subject itself. There is a big difference. A detailed knowledge of a subject isnt necessary to form an opinon on how far an application of that subject should go in politics. Science keeps in improving it's accuracy at describing and predicting the way the universe works. The various theologies that religious people have becomes getting less useful at doing this as time progresses. People will always believe in the supernatural (magical thinking again) but this does not make it an accurate reflection of reality (correlation is not causation). Stenger and Dawkins only really point out that there is no evidence for the supernatural (although The God Delusion did read like a speech from an evangelical pulpit). The fact is that ID is not science. It is creationism. Young people should be taught what science is and what it is not. ID is not science.","marc9000","357511","In a perfect world, yes. But theres common sense evidence that shows Darwinism is elevated above that. In 1959, George Gaylord Simpson said No other single human production has had so great an impact on science or on learning and thought in general as The Origin of Species. Ernst Mayr said that Darwins work led to perhaps the most fundamental of all intellectual revolutions in the history of mankind. I realize thats only two men, but its not hard to see throughout the scientific community. That kind of worship of Darwin is throughout Kenneth Millers book Finding Darwins God, which I read, and is also throughout the rantings of people like Dawkins, who I try to avoid reading, (but sometimes watch him speak if Im trying to accomplish a personal medical task, like purging my stomach of its contents) Imperfect humans, even those with impressive educations, take Darwinism far beyond paradigm status. Its a worship that is no easier to re assess than any religion. Findings are results of searches. Not everything will be found, and not everything will be searched for. Science cant do everything possible that is scientific, decisions have to be made concerning choices of what to study, and applications.The applications/searches shouldnt be controlled by those who get paid for the searching, it should be controlled by those who pay for the searching. Well, it really wasn't my example, you used the words ""predictions"" and ""reality"", as if scientific mastery over them was all-encompasing, which it clearly isn't. Theres magical thinking in Darwins elevated status too. The idolization of him continues to grow since his death. It's been established that Jesus Christ is the most written about person who has ever walked on earth. If Darwin isn't yet in second place, I'm sure he will be some day. Lets try this again; You quoted what I said all around the above three sentences, yet left those sentences out. Either you didnt think they were important at all, or they were too troublesome for you. Im not trying to pin you down on why you left them out, but I have to restate them because they are important to what I believe, and as you have probably guessed, my belief is that the Dover court decision was the wrong one. Its easy to see that Im not alone, not only because of the interest the Dover case generated, but because theres enough logic in my (and millions of others) viewpoint that there is a chance that a future political event/court decision will overturn that Dover decision. ID's status as science, independent of everything else concerned , isn't the only issue. ID can be a form of competition, to expose other forms of non-science. And I've heard it all before - science shouldn't be a place for competitive games. In a perfect would, that would be true. In a world where a minority, (atheists) largely rule it, it is true. Like selection without a selector, or information without an informer? Is the definition of magic, something that humans cant figure out? I know what the claims are, Ive discussed them with others here many times before. They say ID is not science because anything that deals with the supernatural has limits on what can be studied, that science can only study naturalism. Ive said that abiogenesis shouldnt be studied by the public scientific establishment because it can be a [public/ government established/ government sanctioned] attempt to disprove the supernatural. If religion should be kept out of science, then attempts to disprove religion should also be kept out of science. Ive been told thats just too bad for religion, that abiogenesis is 100% naturalism, therefore its science. So thats where we are, we have a constitution that says we cant publicly establish religion, but we have, to some degree, a public establishment of atheism. Young people need to know it. They need to know that its un-American for the majority who believes in an intelligent designer to have tax money taken from them so atheists can waste it looking for godless origins of life that theyre never going to find, and call it science.

This is complete gibberish. It makes no sense at all, nor is it consistent with any theological explanation of Gods timing in the creation account. You'll have to do better than this if you're going to suggest that God didn't create the world in 6 literal days.

What's your attitude regarding the teaching of evolution in public schools? A: ""I'm a Christian, and I believe in parents being able to provide children with religious instruction without interference from the state. But I also believe our schools are there to teach worldly knowledge and science. I believe in evolution, and I believe there's a difference between science and faith. That doesn't make faith any less important than science. It just means they're two different things.

ToE is an incredibly well supported theory. Just like Gravitational and Germ theory. We no longer believe disease created by 'bad humours', do we? At one time this is what people believed (as a result of magical thinking [which I use in its formal sense]). Now we don't because of a solid and very well supported theory (Germ Theory). Once some people believed Earth was created by supernatural means. Can you see the parallel? I see your point. However, if something is viewed as tremendously important (again I point out Germ Theory) it is because it most likely is. Anyone with the ability can wade through the reams and reams of research and draw ones own conclusions about any subject. If one disagree ones is able to perform research to explore the reasons for that disagreement. The fact is that challenging ToE on scientific grounds is as impossible as challenging Germ Theory on scientific grounds. That's why all the challenges are religious or (in the case of the Wedge brigade) politico-religious. Either way one cuts it, it is biblical literalists who push this argument. The fact that some people may or may not take ToE beyond that which it is, is no reason to compare lack of belief in the supernatural with holding a belief in the supernatural. Lack of belief is not the opposite of belief, just as darkness is not the opposite if light. As much as it sometimes pains me, I concur that the areas for the searches should be determined by the people. But I don't agree that those with the means to pay should dictate the direction of the searches. As I said before, this choice is the choice of the people, not a privileged, rich minority. As I said, science does what science does. Sometimes the wider population does not have a correct picture of what science can do and what it can't. But I do confess to pouncing on the psychology reference (human behaviour is often trumpeted as a limit of science-it's not). I'm using magical thinking in its formal usage, here. Point taken. As I said: by the people (not just the rich). But this simply goes back to the issue that many people do not have the training to make an informed choice. Every single person with OCD believes the way to control their anxiety is to perform some ritualised task. Every. Single. One. This is an example of magical thinking. What is and is not is not a democracy. Experts are far more likely to be right than non experts. I don't how ID can do anything other than encourage biologist to knock down IC (over and over again). But is this not a waste of money? ID basically plays God of the Gaps and keeps losing ground. IC has never been upheld. What a waste of time and money. I'm sorry, I was using magical thinking in it's formal sense. With out digressing too much. The 'selector' in this case is the environment and if you are calling DNA Shannon information you are dead wrong. There is no part of the supernatural that science measure. Full stop. It is not research to disprove the supernatural. It is an attempt to establish as best as we can the facts around abiogenesis. If you don't want this to be studied you can use your political power to influence your government to cut funding. I support your right to do that (even if I believe it will cause your country to lag behind the others in terms of scientific prowess). Science is not a crusade against religion. The fact that science affects the likelihood of someone holding faith based beliefs is a side effect that is not even a guaranteed: my father in law is a physicist and is Christian.

As long as the Theory of Evolution (ToE) sticks to what is says, it doesn't say a thing about Atheism or religion. Some people use it and go beyond it to say there is no God, but it does not say that. Years ago, people said Galileo's sun centered solar system attacked the Bible and oppressed scientists. The only thing that Galileo's theory attacked was a certain interpretation. The only thing that ToE attacks is a certain interpretation. There was a dramatic change possibly 70,000 years ago. Whether the complex sudden changes were that a group of statistically unlikely changes happened together, or that a God caused them to happen, science can't say. All science can say is that suddenly there were these beings that science calls fully modern Humans. As for the rest of time, Christians know that miracles are not common. Most of the time, it operates according to the laws God establishes. (eg ps 104:5 compared to what scientists say about the moon keeping the earth from tottering forever and ever. One act, and after that, the laws keep it going.) Therefore, the ToE could be true and Gen 1 could refer to specific points in time when God stepped in, and that Sin entered the world through Adam and that Jesus then had to die. Though Atheists try to use the ToE to prove there is no God, most scientists will say they have not proven that. Though IDers are welcome to try to prove their point scientifically, there is nothing solid yet. I as a Christian am much more willing to accept their studies than skeptical scientists, and I have seen nothing that I would use, yet.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","04:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","66"

(I believe its the Christian God) If science claims it can explain everything we experience by naturalistic means (re-arrangement) then science goes beyond its bounds, and into philosophy. And I believe that studying the possibility of abiogenesis from billions of years ago on scientific grounds is just as impossible. Equally, its atheists who push abiogenesis. (and some theistic evolutionists) I guess the theistic evolutionists dont think God is intelligent. Talkorigins, and many other scientific websites, devote plenty of energy to downgrade creationism and religion. Are they taking the ToE beyond that which it is when they do that? Could you explain that? If lack of belief is not the opposite of belief, are you saying that something else is the opposite of belief? Or are you saying that there is no opposite of belief? What is the opposite of light if its not darkness? No no no, you misunderstand, Im not saying those with monetary influence should have a greater influence in what is studied at all, Im saying anyone who contributes in any way to the public till should have a say in what is searched, not because of any in-depth knowledge they may have of the searches, but because of their conclusions concerning the goals/uses of the results of the searches. Often, it is the scientific community that is a privileged and rich minority. But they have the most correct picture of the public usefulness of a search. According to Wikipedia; ""The sufferer feels compelled to voluntarily perform irrational, time-consuming behaviors to diminish the anxiety."" What makes you use the word ritualised over irrational, time consuming? The word ritualised can tend to lean toward religion, and I think it has a possibility of being unfair, in a field such as yours. When it comes to feeling compelled to perform irrational, time consuming behaviors.I THINK I MIGHT HAVE THAT NOW!!!!!!! HELP ME HELP ME!!!!!!!! Its a worldview difference I think the ones who are losing ground are the Darwinists. Ever since the enthusiastic writings of numerous followers of Darwin, (Huxley, Spencer, others) the origin of the first, simplest form of life didnt seem of much concern to them, or Darwin for that matter. They had no idea of its complexity, and didnt know that finding it would be so elusive, if not impossible. I was referring to purpose , and specified information . Just because evolutionists don't like the terms, it shouldn't mean we have to automatically rule them out. If it cant measure it, it cant challenge it . The scientific community ""roundly criticizing Behe over Stenger lays the serious problem bare. If science doesnt want to measure with ID, it shouldnt have such a keen desire to challenge religion with atheism. Its what abiogenesis is. Scientific prowess, or atheistic prowess? We seem to be doing just fine in that department according to statistics - the U.S. and the world. The big bucks seem to be in atheism far more than science. Its largely the same over here. Thats what I love about good ol worldwide 4forums, we dont let too much politeness get in the way here. Its simple - religion cant be publicly established, and cant have its free exercise publicly prohibited. Different people have different ideas of when attacks on it in public education actually publicly prohibit it. With the vast majority of biologists being atheists, largely controlling every aspect of biological application and education, were supposed to believe that everything suddenly snaps into 50/50 neutrality in publicly funded science education classrooms. Common sense and actual events tell me its not going very well. Teacher's rant on Christians draws court rebuke For every child who goes to all the trouble to record his teachers rant against religion, how many go unrecorded? Thousands? Millions? There is a difference between having a staunch belief in something, vs having an open mind about exploring its possibilities. Those who vehemently oppose both are who I demonize. No, but Id question his honesty. When he says that doesnt make faith any less important than science, what consideration is he talking about? Public policy? Personal action? If its personal action, thats something that is often altered by public policy. Theyre not going to be given equal consideration concerning public policy. As Phillip Johnson said, there will be a ruling realm, and a subordinate realm.

Atheism, although not a religion, isn't taught. Biology is not a form of atheism. Yes, it would. But atheism isn't taught in science class. Further, only dimwits think that the Constitution requires an ""alternative philosophy"" to modern science to balance it. That has been rejected by every court that has considered the issue. The mythology of creationism is religion with no foundation in reality. Who is Victor Stenger and why should the mention of his name in science class be important? I know who Dawkins is, but you'll have to offer more than your hysterical fear of the mention of his name is actually justified by the mention of his name. What science classes - when and where and by whom. Moreover, in what context were their names mentioned. I'll bet that Ken Miller's name has been mentioned more times than either of yours put together, and yet Ken Miller is a christian. Why should the mention of his name cause distress for scientists? Actually, common sense should tell you not to invent such idiotic scenarios and attribute them to me. As far as I am aware, no such rants have ever taken place. In my experience, there are far more rants by creationists, who even do their ranting at school board meetings. Besides, what you characterize as a rant by a teacher against religion is probably just a teacher trying to explain that the superstition of religious mythology has no place in a science classroom. Justice should be done when students who cause disturbances when they find that scientific facts and theories disagree with their particular mythological superstitions. The teacher should be allowed to permanently eject them from the class. How do you know that? What RECENTLY DISCOVERED complexities are you babbling about? I do know that the ID creationist movement began about 18 years ago and the proponents have made promises of scientific research programs. I also know that there have been none - nothing published. No discoveries recently or ever about simple forms of life establishing a religion. Are you smoking something? Can I get some? Actually, the Constitution is talking about any establishment of religion by the government. If the government were to support the teaching of ID creationism in science classes, that would violate the Establishment Clause. However, on the other hand, you are actually free to adopt any mythological superstition as your religion that you wish. You are free to practice that superstition as you see fit without interference from the government. But you are not permitted to impose your mythology on everyone through our public schools just because you fail to understand what science is and how it works, and in fact don't want to learn. By the same token, I may not teach my religion as a matter of science. That's not a problem for me. Science isn't my religion and I have never presented religious matters in science classes. Of course it isn't. ID creationism is religion. Are you not aware of the court cases that have found it to be so? As a result, the presentation of ID creationism, because it is religion, cannot be presented in public schools as science. That would be unconstitutional. On the other hand, science is not religion and is actually the proper subject for presentation in science classes. Why is that concept so hard for you to grasp? Again, what are you talking about? I certainly hope that it isn't the bacterial flagellum, since that is neither recent nor baffling. Of course, the origin of life is not a question of evolutionary theory. It may be a question of a field of biology called abiogenesis. But, recent discoveries have allowed the manufacture of synthetic life forms. Some of these were imitations of real organisms that were assembled a nucleotide at a time, others were inventions of man that do not exist in nature. But they live! (Well, except for the artificial viruses. They are mostly defined as being outside of living organisms.) In fact, there are no recent discoveries by ID creationists that point out complexities that were previously unknown by real scientists. On the other hand, there have been recent discoveries that have been published in scientific literature that document the creation in the lab of artificial viruses and bacteria. But ID creationists haven't published any new methods of studying life. What is even worse, even if it were true, there is no such thing as an atheist life style. You've actually gone off the deep end here. The courts have said that religion may not be presented as science in public school science classes. The courts have said that creationism, creation science, and ID creationism are religious in nature and therefore may not be presented in public schools. On the other hand, the scientific theories of evolution have been found to be evidence based science and non-religious in nature. What discoveries? Again you babble about nonsense. Please tell us in which scientific journal these scientific discoveries have been published. Science doesn't seek truth (and neither does any religion). Science seeks explanations for observed facts that have been verified. When a scientific explanation if found to be in conflict with reality, the science is rejected or adjusted. When religious truth is found to be in conflict with reality, reality is rejected. Your superstitious mythology is always true no matter how idiotic it becomes. Actually, science is a process of offering and testing naturalistic explanations for naturalistic processes. If an explanation fails a test, it is rejected. That is why spiritualism, super-naturalism, and mythology have not been allowed to be taught as science in public schools. They are mostly not subject to test. They are based on belief in mythology and magic. Any time that someone has actually offered an hypothesis of superstitions mythology that has been able to testing, the hypothesis has failed the test. Of course, there are many christian schools that teach the above in lieu of science. I know. And that is puzzling since it is you who has characterized science at opposing or fighting against your superstitious mythology. It has always been my position that ""science"" doesn't actually give a rat's tootie about what your mythology asserts. As opposed to the biased and imperfect religious community? As a scientist, my bias is in favor of empirical evidence. Show me evidence the the earth is only 6,000 years old. Show me evidence that women are made from man. Show me evidence of a great FLUD and ""kinds"" of living organisms. Show me evidence that 8 people could load and care for millions of species of living organisms on that little wooden box for a year. Or, as an alternative, show me evidence that 36 species of cat, in three genera, could have evolved from a single pair of the cat kind in a few hundred years, along with the several genera and many known species of extinct cat. Follow that up with the species of canid (dog) - even more numerous than cats. In other words, show me any bit of evidence that your superstitious mythology has the slightest possibility of being true. Please stop with the whining about your Constitutional rights unless you understand your rights and my rights, and unless you can actually present real evidence. Well, at least you admit your silly paranoia. That's a step. On the other hand, the only reason that any scientist has come to care about ID creationism is because of efforts by creationists to introduce it as science in public school classrooms. If it were not for the religious zealots who pretend that because they are prohibited from imposing their religion on all public school students, their constitutional rights are being violated. The logic seems to be that because the Constitution prohibits Congress, and by incorporation under the 14th Amendment, all bodies of government from making laws regarding an establishment of religion, this somehow means that spiritualism and the mythology of bronze age, nomadic herdsmen must be taught as science, because to prohibit the teaching of such superstition would be making a law about an establishment of religion. Sadly, creationists have little understanding of the Constitution. They seem to continue to maintain their historical position of opposition to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The major opposition to the ratification of both documents was from christian churches.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","01:55 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","86"

Now I realize that you will take this evidence and squirm in 3 different directions as you insist you are right. But that wont change the fact that you are as wrong as only you are capable of being. Animism: Greeks, Romans, Santeria, Voodoo, American Indians, Mayas, Witches, Ancestors, Hindus... The ""Primitive Religions"" were born in the five Continents, more than 3,000 years ago, mostly in the form of ""Animism"", because they believed that everything has a ""soul"", an ""anima"" in Latin, a ""spirit""... including animals, plants, rocks, mountains, rivers, stars... each ""anima"" is powerful, spiritual, that can help or hurt them, including the souls of the dead, the ""ancestors"". For thousands of years they deified animals, stars, idols of any kind... and practiced Spiritism, witchcraft, divination, astrology... and they used magic, spells, enchantments, superstitions, prayers, amulets, talismans, charms... often with the worship of an Absolute, or the Great One... Today Animism is represented, among others, by the Mormons, Hinduism and the New Age. They proclaim that every human is God, and their practices will help each one to realize it. The Bible destroys this way of thinking in the first verse of he Bible: 1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. (Gen.1:1). There is only one God, everything else in the heavens or earth are ""creatures of God"". The sun and the moon are ""creatures of God"", and the rocks and animals and oceans, and all the mountains and stars, and each man and woman is also a ""creature of God"", is not God. But they usually did not care much about a Creator God, only about the ""spirits"" that can help or hurt them... and what they sometimes called ""gods"", are ""demons""... or simply a ""lie""... and this is why the Bible condemns them with very strong words: abominations to God, stone them to death, the fire shall burn them (Deut.18, Lev.20, Isa.47). - 10There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch. 11Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. 12For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD: and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee. (Deut.18:10-12) - 27 "" 'A man or woman who is a medium or spiritist among you must be put to death. You are to stone them; their blood will be on their own heads.' "" (Lev. 20:7). - 12Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail. 13Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee. 14Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it. (Is.47:12-13) God, for the Animist, is not a person... as for the Hindu, god is the Energy, the Force, the Power, the Universal Mind, the Absolute, the Unknown, the Divine Being... is not a ""he"" but an ""it""... it is not somebody but something... but something powerful able to get wonderful things for you using Magic... and worshiping it!... yes, worshiping the Force or the Energy... Since god is not a person, there are no revelations from a non-person... you never find in Animism or Wicca or Hinduism, God said... Yahweh calls... The gods never existed, they are the product of novels or the imagination... they are myths, legends... but they never existed and they do not exist today. The big problem is that ""Today"" an estimated 40% of the world's population is animistic (Van Rheenen), including all kinds of occultism, often in syncretism with Christianity, Islam, Buddhism... The Animism is attractive because infuses the sacred into the real life, and mainly, because offers people a way to cope with one's everyday needs and problems: Healing of an illness, to be successful in a business, or in love, or to find a job, or to restore a soured relationship, to find a mate, to gain guidance for the future... The animist views the ""formal religions"" as being relevant with respect to ""ultimate"" issues, but irrelevant when it comes to addressing the ""immediate"" issues of everyday life... which is totally wrong!, because Christianity, Islam, and all ""formal religions"" deal with issues of every day's life... but this is the reason why a Christian or a Jew go to the witch or consult the Zodiac... They go to church on Saturday or Sunday to take care of their soul, and they go to the witch or astrologer on Monday to take care of their business or illness... absolutely wrong!... Come to Jesus... Believe in him!... is the solution of all the problems in this life, and on top of the glorious life on earth, he offers you eternal life of joy in Heaven. The World View of Animism: Pantheism is the first logical consequence of Animism: All the world is divine: A mountain is god, a rock, an animal... you are god!... though you can't make stars not even atoms, but you are god!... a planet, and even a cockroach is god!... they are the ""idols"" often mentioned in the Bible. Polytheism is the next obvious consequence: There are thousands of gods... the concept of 333 million deities is believed to emphasize the fundamental doctrine of Animism, Hinduism, Wicca... The first verse of the Bible contradicts these views: In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth... so, in the Bible, there is one God, a person, and everything else in the world are creatures of God... God created and is the soul and life and is inside everything, but everything is not God... there is only one God, Creator. Of course, for Animists or Hindus, the aim of this life is to stop the relentless and frightful reincarnation, and become nothingness, not-a-person, but the drop of water in the ocean of the Absolute... for a Christian, an eternal life of joy is waiting, and not like a drop of water, but as a person, recognizable by God and by every neighbor... a person!, an individual!, eternally!, as God is an eternal Person!... eternally in Hell or in Heaven!... Religion and Cults - Animism So you see, those who worship idols and such are the practitioners of animism. Judaism and evangelical christianity condemn such practices as abominations before God. And that is because the God of the Old and New Testament also condemns such practices throughout His word. So you have once again blatantly and ignorantly misrepresented what the bible and God Himself stands for and represents to us as His Truths. So in short order I have easily proven that according to what animism is, it plays no actual part in the scriptural perspective of how, why and who Man is according to our relationship with the living God.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","07:33 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","88"
