That's why they vote for imbeciles like Reid, Pelosi, and Obama, who are trying to turn America into a far left gestapo police state, where they tell you what to eat, what to drive, what to do, etc., etc. Left to them, there will be no more democracy. But you wolf it down like the far left loon that you are.","snakespit","459366","The thing you don't seem to be getting, dimwit, is that democracy is ""rule by the people"", not ""rule by the people so long as those people are people who agree with me"". The core concept that you don't seem to understand is that democracy is about everyone having a voice, not everyone getting their own way, and certainly not you getting your own way all the time. Personally, I think democracy left the US long ago, and was replaced by lobbyists, special interest groups, and corporate influence. No, they vote for these people because they have the right to, that is something the founders of America ensured that we would have (well...at least white men, but we have made a lot of progress since then). Or who you can marry, or what drugs you may put in your body, or...errrr...sorry, wrong party. I was thinking of the republicans there.

Not the most impressive credentials for the task of nullifying a 2500 year old tradition. His timing though, was good, and he caught the perfect storm of the simultaneous decay in Judaism and in the Roman Empire. Politics taints spirituality, in the Jewish world, and the worlds of Judaism's progeny: Christianity and Islam. I prayed for you this morning, EZ, that you may find peace with the facts of life, and the fact that Rush Limbaugh is not the ""Messiah"" of The American Way. ""Until when, O G-d, will the wicked exult? They freely speak lies, and they glorify themselves, the doers of iniquity. Your nation, Hashem, they crush, and they afflict Your heritage. The widow and the stranger they slay, and the orphans they murder.... Understand, you boors among the people,and you fools, when will you gain wisdom? He who implants the ear, will He not hear?

[Jesus] But there is a long tradition of argument that Paul was an epileptic; I first read about it in Paul Johnson's ""The History of Christianity."" The German Epilepsy Museum discusses it here: Paul, epilepsy. Famous people who suffered from epilepsy. Saint Paul. . This is from the Jewish Encyclopedia: There is throughout Paul's writings an irrational or pathological element which could not but repel the disciples of the Rabbis. Possibly his pessimistic mood was the result of his physical condition; for he suffered from an illness which affected both body and mind. He speaks of it as ""a thorn in the flesh,"" and as a heavy stroke by ""a messenger of Satan"" (II Cor. xii. 7), which often caused him to realize his utter helplessness, and made him an object of pity and horror (Gal. iv. 13). It was, as Krenkel (""Beitrge zur Aufhellung der Geschichte und Briefe des Apostels Paulus,"" 1890, pp. 47-125) has convincingly shown, epilepsy, called by the Greeks ""the holy disease,"" which frequently put him into a state of ecstasy, a frame of mind that may have greatly impressed some of his Gentile hearers, but could not but frighten away and estrange from him the Jew, whose God is above all the God of reason (comp. II Cor. v. 13; x. 10; xi. 1, 16; xii. 6). The conception of a new faith, half pagan and half Jewish, such as Paul preached, and susceptibility to its influences, were altogether foreign to the nature of Jewish life and thought. For Judaism, religion is the hallowing of this life by the fulfilment of its manifold duties (see Judaism): Paul shrank from life as the domain of Satan and all his hosts of evil; he longed for redemption by the deadening of all desires for life, and strove for another world which he saw in his ecstatic visions. The following description of Paul is preserved in ""Acta Pauli et Thecl,"" an apocryphal book which has been proved to be older and in some respects of greater historic value than the canonical Acts of the Apostles (see Conybeare, ""Apollonius' Apology and Acts, and Other Monuments of Early Christianity,"" pp. 49-88, London, 1894): ""A man of moderate stature, with crisp [scanty] hair, crooked legs, blue eyes, large knit brows, and long nose, at times looking like a man, at times like an angel, Paul came forward and preached to the men of Iconium: 'Blessed are they that keep themselves chaste [unmarried]; for they shall be called the temple of God. Blessed are they that mortify their bodies and souls; for unto them speaketh God. Blessed are they that despise the world; for they shall be pleasing to God. Blessed be the souls and bodies of virgins; for they shall receive the reward of their chastity.'"" It was by such preaching that ""he ensnared the souls of young men and maidens, enjoining them to remain single ""(Conybeare, l.c. pp. 62, 63, 67; comp. ib. pp. 24-25; Gal. iii. 38; I Cor. vii. 34-36; Matt. xix. 12; Clement of Rome, Epistle ii. 12). Endquote. That's where the traditions of celibacy and self torment came from, traditions that are the opposite of Judaic ideas about life. ""And you should be joyous."" [Deut 16:15] ""Be fruitful, and multiply."" [Gen 1:28] Of course you'll dismiss these sources with a sneer, because you know better, and because Rush Limbaugh didn't say it. The statistics are inflated by people who just mindlessly say ""Protestant"" so they don't feel guilty. Fire breathing, wingnut evangelicals are in the minority, thank God.

Hell, you're just throwing dung against the wall to see what might stick. As for Paul's ""pessimistic"" mood we find the following in Scripture: ""I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances."" - Philippians 4:11 As for the ""Thorn"" in his flesh there's just as much speculation that that might have been a lust for women, or problems with his eyes from the Road to Damascus experience with Jesus. Or any other such thing. You've got nothing, only conjecture. You certainly have no professional analysis from anyone qualified in the first century to give one. Nice try, though.
