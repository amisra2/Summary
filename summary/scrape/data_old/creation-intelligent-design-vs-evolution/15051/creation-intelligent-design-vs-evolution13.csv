Really pathetic, Jingle Bells. You have nothing but childish ""I know you are but what am I?"" 4th grader responses. We've shown that the 4 Gospels were written 100 years after the events they assert, and were selected from over 150 other similar accounts that were circulating, in 325 AD. We've seen that Paul, the inventor of the religion you claim to ""have"" was an epileptic misanthropic pessimist, ""sour grapes"" ex-Jew who spun Christianity from threads of Judaism, Mithraism, and Isis worship into a whole new cult that took root in the decaying compost of the Roman Empire. So, back to topic - there are no ""Evolutionists"" like there are ""Christians,"" or ""Snake Handlers,"" or ""Dittoheads."" People who are honest, and don't deny science and obvious factual evidence, may indeed acknowledge that life evolves, and that humans evolved from the lower life forms, but they are not "" Evolutionists. "" That clarified [though of course you will ignore it], the goal of people who respect the truth, and authentic experience over cult indoctrination, [who the OP called ""Evolutionists""] is to expose the lies, and reveal the truth. With that goal, then, the truthteller approach to ""religion"" depends on what religion you are talking about. Buddhism for example, has no quarrel with the fact of evolution, so there are no lies to expose. Christianity, on the other hand, actively seeks to assert lies as if they were fact, and suppress the truth in every way possible. Therefore, rational people, who seek the truth, will have a conflict with Christianity by definition. It's the Christians [or pretend-Christian political trolls like yourself] that create the friction. If y'all would jest go back in the trailer and shut up, it'd be better for everybody. . .","goal-evolutionists","01:21 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","186"

Which is a bald-faced lie. Scholars Date the Gospels and New Testament Dating the New Testament More bs. Let's take Mithra(ism) as your example: Dr. Edwin Yamauchi dismisses this (Mithra) hypothesis in stating ""Those who seek to adduce Mithra as a prototype of the risen Christ ignore the late date for the expansion of Mithraism to the west (cf. M. J. Vermaseren, Mithras, The Secret God, 1963, p. 76)."" Norman Geisler states, ""We do know that Mithraism, like its mystery competitors, had a basic myth. Mithra was supposedly born when he emerged from a rock; he was carrying a knife and torch and wearing a phrygian cap. He battled first with the sun and then the primeval bull, which then became the ground of life for the human race."" In comparison, Geisler points out that ""the foundation stones of Christianity are patently taken from the Old Testament, Judaism generally, and the life of a historical figure named Jesus."" Did Christianity Steal from Mithraism? Did Christianity Steal From Mithraism? - Come Reason Ministries ""Exaggerations and oversimplifications abound in this kind of literature. One encounters overblown claims about alleged likenesses between baptism and the Lord's Supper and similar ""sacraments"" in certain mystery cults. Attempts to find analogies between the resurrection of Christ and the alleged 'resurrections' of the mystery deities involve massive amounts of oversimplification and inattention to detail."" - Ronald Nash (Christian Research Journal, Winter 1994, p.8) Considering the lies of yours I just exposed, it's very obvious you are not an honest broker of the truth. Once again, it was YOUR LIES THAT WERE JUST EXPOSED. Recommend you go wash out your diaper, numb skull. You don't know the truth from a hammer. You're busted!

"07-22-2012","15051",13,"Freedom","459461","Man must have food to eat, he can buy food with money; but that does not mean stealing is moral or immoral. Taxation is not simply the cost of living in a civilized society, it is the immoral extortion of money for the purpose of paying for things like roads, libraries, police forces, and militaries. I benefit from plenty of things paid for with tax payer money, just not most of them. Why is that? If you want some which are particular to you how about abortion in which a child who is harming no one is targeted for extermination? Can you prove releasing CO2 harms anyone? A flat rate of zero is perfect equality.","snakespit","459694","So presuming that by saying you ""benefit from plenty of things paid for with tax payer money"", I guess it would be fair to say that you use roads, expect the police to show up if you need them, expect someone to answer 911 if you call, find it an obligation of the government to provide for our national defense, use the US Postal Service, etc etc. My question is, if you consider taxation immoral, then what does that make you being that you benefit from those government backed items payed for with tax payer money? If you want to live somewhere where you don't have to pay taxes to a government, I suggest finding a little hut in the rainforest of Brasil or the African bush. Hypocrite might not be the most accurate word. Perhaps we could say you lack the courage of your convictions. First off, how do you know that the embryo or fetus (a child is a fetus that has been born) is harming no one? What is you definition of harm, and does everyone view harm the same? I seem to remember that we had been discussing CO2, until I posted some data that you asked me to post, and then nothing but crickets for the last 12 days. You are welcome now to personally pay a rate of zero if you decide to. The rest of us will even pay your room and board. Those of us with a sense of reality are willing to part with some of our money to ensure that we don't have to swim across rivers when the bridges start falling.","goal-evolutionists","04:00 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","188"

If you want to live somewhere where you get to steal from people I suggest you commit suicide because I will not accept it. What courage do I lack? What would you do? They don't typically, and they never do intentionally. A fetus is a child. physical injury or mental damage If it is a subjective concept it is useless in morality or law... (or pretty much anything else) I remember we weren't discussing it harming people, try another excuse. Despite your factitious comment, I am not free to. ""The rest of us"", how easily you take on the voice of society. Those who believe as I do are few, but far more than just me. This is also a badly disguised appeal to force fallacy. You are huh?
