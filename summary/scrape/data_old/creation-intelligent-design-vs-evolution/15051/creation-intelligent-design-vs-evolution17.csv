A magical being with the ability to do magic things. That's my perception. Like I said, the remark was a bad joke so why hop on it with the feigned horror at my ignorance?","gansao","464853","Why should me pointing out ignorance be a ' hostile tone'? I am on the evolutionist side of the argument, that does not mean that I need to misrepresent the other side. God has never be proclaimed to be a wizard by any of the great religions( you may know one but I dont). Calling god a ' wizard' is as ignorant in regard of religion as saying that the big bang singularity was something made out of nothing. Its presumptious and displays ignorance of science....even if it is ones ' perception'. I did not ' hop ' on it , neither did I feigned horror at your ignorance..but I did point out your ignorance. Surely someone extoling science should embrace the scientific method not the hyperbole and presumptions that the religious folk are accused of.","goal-evolutionists","05:36 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","241"

I don't understand your implication that it deserves a measure of reverence. Of course I can relate to the feelings religious people report, spiritual feelings and the awesome mysteries of the universe. So, yes, wizard is a trivial term. Maybe wizard is insulting to some people and I apologise to those people. I'll learn as I go on this forum I'm sure.","goal-evolutionists","05:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","242"

"10-21-2012","15051",17,"Freedom","464824","If you narrow the parameters for an unlikely event you are merely changing the distribution of unlikelihood not it's sum. For instance if I said finding a statue of liberty on the surface of an alien planet was unlikely, and you said it is inevitable because there was a statue of liberty building rock formation right next to it; you merely shifted the improbability to a statue of liberty building rock formation. The overall odds did not get better. Similarly assuming that conditions were right for abiogensis does not reduce the unlikeness of abiogensis because it's specificity also makes conditions that cause it extremely unlikely. Furthermore you are at risk for going far beyond the evidence, nothing even close to abiogensis has been observed under any conditions no matter how specific. Even the experiments which have observed the formation of amino acids and nucleotides have been limited only by what those conducting them found possible for a pre-biotic earth, not on any real evidence for what pre-biotic environment looked like. If religious people believe exactly as I do could I not reference the religious?","Accipiter","464875","Even you are smart enough to know that posting links to tacky religious web sites will just get you laughed at.","goal-evolutionists","11:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","244"

"10-22-2012","15051",17,"Freedom","464947","The question is why don't I use references like you think they should be used. Your problem is insufficient education in basic epistemology. Simply piling up people who parrot what you may cut it for your college term papers but it does not constitute truth. As steeve likes to point out logic gets you from A to B and as databed loves to point out without point A (evidence) you can't get anywhere. What they both fail to see is the big picture. To arrive at truth one needs true premises and good logic. Two people can have the exact same premises and still disagree provided at least one's logic is faulty. It's also possible to disagree because of disagreement on premises. Here's the problem most premises are themselves the conclusions of other arguments with other premises. The pattern repeats again and again until at a certain point very deep in the tree there is no more logic, the premises come from observations and axioms. Where are references appropriate? When observations are being challenged, the references serve to establish the validity of these first premises. This is essentially raw data, eye witness reports, etc.... People asserting the same thing is not appropriate, even if they back it up with arguments; because the debate is about the arguments. Referencing someone elses argument is like voting present, if you think it's good repeat it in your own words so your opponent knows that you understand it at least enough to do that. In the rare event that first premises are challenged, I have posted references; I recently posted a link to geo-radiative data from NOAA. Most of the time none of my premises are even challenged, in fact most of the time my logic is not challenged either. My conclusions are ridiculed, dismissed, and little more. Evolution is an excellent example by the way, I have been accused of denying evidence but no one can find any evidence I deny. There isn't any, but that does not mean we agree; I have a problem with the analysis of the evidence, and that is a problem with logic. So the answer is, I don't post references because I know better . Didn't you just admit twice that this isn't true? Can you explain to me why I have been accused (multiple times and recently) on this forum of blindly believing what I am told (by Ayn Rand for instance) while at the same time you say no one else in the world believes the things I do? Either I don't listen to or agree with anyone or I am dangerously gullible, I can't be both. I'm sure you do. There has got to be someone out there","Accipiter","464957","I have seen your logic and remember how you used it to re write the laws of physics. That in it self should make you stop and wounder whether or not you are doing it right. Assuming that it is not logic at fault then it must be your implementation of it which is flawed.","goal-evolutionists","10:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","254"
