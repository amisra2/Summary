I believe in and support Evolution as the explanation for the advancement of Life and hope that the scientists of the world will continue to compile enough evidence to prove to the rest of the world that there is no creator and that we all evolved . As far as religion, well religion has trampled on the rights of others since it's inception so what comes around goes around is my view. I don't have a problem with religious people if they choose to believe in fairy tales, but when religious people force their doctrine on society and into Government I do have a problem with it. Religion In my Opinion should be eradicated from the planet. It's Dangerous, Promotes Bigotry and hate, Teaches Outright Lies, and the list goes on. So I guess in answer of your question I would say for me it's a resounding YES...I would like to Rid the world of religion.","goal-evolutionists","01:04 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","2"

I would think the evolutionist's 'goal' is to learn as much as he can about the process and teach it to others. It doesn't effect a religious person's rights today any more than the model of earth going around the sun did in Galileo's day.","goal-evolutionists","03:18 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","4"

Accepting the evolutionary process as the most complete and accurate rational explanation of the evidence before us need not be contradictory to religious belief. Such beliefs are irrelevant.","goal-evolutionists","05:51 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","5"

At this stage I am trying to reconcile my belief in evolution and in a creator. I personally don't see anything mutually exclusive about believing in the existence of a God and the theory of evolution. I've always taken the view of why can't evolution be the process of how God populated the earth? However, lately I have been asking more questions of both theories. Eg.: How could we have all come from two people, Adam and Eve? Besides being able to observe natural selection within species, do we have any conclusive examples that show one species ""evolving"" into another? Personally I don't want religion to go away. I'm just looking for answers.","goal-evolutionists","11:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","12"

I've always wondered why religion has taught the story of Adam and Eve as being the Original Parents of Humanity, when it plainly states in the Book of Genesis that Man and Woman were created BEFORE Adam and Eve. There are two separate Creation stories in Genesis .chapter 1 and then in chapter 2.. One says God created man, then in 2 he creates Adam and Eve... Clearly this is where Most people have problems with religion. The Bible can't even get it right so how is one to believe anything it says.","goal-evolutionists","11:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","13"

For example, domestic sheep were created by hybridisation, and no longer produce viable offspring with Ovis orientalis, one species from which they are descended.","Accipiter","424612","Speciation - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia What kind of scientist are you?","goal-evolutionists","11:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","14"
