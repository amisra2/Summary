In the days when people believed that a mile could not be run in 4 minutes or less, did the person that set out to break that record have a motive in threathening the former belief? Anything that is an accepted belief can be ""threatened"" by facts. The issue is not the facts, nor is it the person pursuing the discovery of these facts. The issue is the person that is trying to hold on to the old false belief. There is no motive in the person pursuing the truth except to find the truth. All other side-effects are incidental. If the religious community must now feel ""threatened"" by the discovery of the truth, then so be it. But to question the motives of those seeking the truth, now that's just plain disengenous.","Databed","452846","Well, I was just getting at the fact that proving religious beliefs wrong is fun, not that it is the sole motivating factor in the pursuit of discovery. However, for some it is motivating. I don't think you can blanket the scientific community in such purity as to say the only motive is discovery. In fact, I would say that 90% percent of scientific discovery is motivated by financial gain. Maybe not in the realm of theoretical physics or evolution, but certainly in biology, pharmacology, technology, geology, etc.","goal-evolutionists","08:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","91"
"04-20-2012","15051",7,"unkerpaulie","452890","Not once in the definition of science is monetary gain even a factor. In fact, exactly the opposite is true. If scientists set out to support a preconcieved notion or conclusion about a drug, method, device or idea, then that's the opposite of the scientific method. The scientific method works because of the explicit absence of foregone conclusions. Conclusions can only be arrived at AFTER testing, in a controlled setting, with duplicable results. Any deviance to this is not science.","Freedom","452899","Not quite, a preconceived notion or conclusion is known as a hypothesis. Reality will not alter itself if the hypothesis is wrong so scientist do not have to worry about bias unless they skip experiments all together. Scientist can be paid to test specific things, in fact that is probably all they will get paid for because hoping they will stumble across useful knowledge is not a very good investment.","goal-evolutionists","12:09 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","93"
"04-20-2012","15051",7,"unkerpaulie","452890","Then how can we classify these groups as part of the scientific community? Or are we so screwed up that we just look for people in white lab coats and beakers and call them scientists, regardless of whether they are really scientists or not? Because if a ""scientist"" is motivated by financial gain and not by discovery of the truth, then that person isn't a scientist at all. Not once in the definition of science is monetary gain even a factor. In fact, exactly the opposite is true. If scientists set out to support a preconcieved notion or conclusion about a drug, method, device or idea, then that's the opposite of the scientific method.

Any deviance to this is not science.","Databed","452958","And, not once in the definition of science is there any mention of motive. Its not necessary because it doesn't matter what is driving you towards discovery, only that you use the right method. Science is the road to discovery and with discovery come many other prizes. You can argue that it isn't pure science but you can't say its not true science.","goal-evolutionists","03:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","94"

If he arrives at a particular conclusion, the one he wanted due to its potential for financial gain, and his science is real, well good for him. If he lies in order to reach his conclusion, then he loses his credibility because someone is going to prove him wrong.

"04-21-2012","15051",7,"Freedom","452995","It can never fail to be both. Preconceived is a relational attribute which obviously refers to confirmation. If a hypothesis is confirmed it is a theory not a hypothesis (look up the prefix hypo it's greek). A conclusion is a statement which is supported by others in an argument. The scientific process is merely the life-cycle of an argument in relation to experiment, the hypothesis is an asserted conclusion about how something works, or what something is. Testing it is setting up syllogisms in the form of ""If Else"" to generate experiments which would support that conclusion. So by what magic would it occur that if I went back in time and tipped Newton, or Gauss or any of the others for their brilliance would their work cease being scientific?","unkerpaulie","453032","A hypothesis is a statement that attempts to explain an observed phenomenon. The scientific method is a way to test the statment and determine whether that statement actually explains the phenomenon. If the statement has been found, through the scientific method, to reliably explain the phenomenon, it is no longer a hypothesis, and is now a conclusion. A statement cannot be a hypothesis and conclusion at the same time. Eh?","goal-evolutionists","01:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","100"

There are countless statements that are accepted as true, touted as scientific, or published by someone labeled as a scientists, that are false and have no shred of scientific support, yet are accepted by the public as such. The fact that money is a factor is precisely the reason why such a thing can exist. The scientific findings only appeal to people who actually understand science. The acceptance of the statement depends on the how much is spent for the media to promote it. Financial motivation corrupts science, in fact, any ""science"" that starts with the goal of arriving at a particular conclusion, whether money is the motivation or not, is not science.","goal-evolutionists","01:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","101"
"04-22-2012","15051",7,"unkerpaulie","453033","...any ""science"" that starts with the goal of arriving at a particular conclusion, whether money is the motivation or not, is not science.","Databed","453114","I agree with you aside from this statement. Most science does in fact start with a particular goal which is usually outlined in a hypothesis. For example: I have a certain by-product that I really want to make some money from since I am otherwise paying disposal fees. I notice this sludge hardens like brick out in the sun so I decide I would absolutely love it if this stuff made a durable, waterproof coating for commercial roofs. I slap it on and wait for the first rain and it softens and runs down the gutters. That didn't work. Hypothesis: This stuff will make a good roofing material Experiment: Put it on the roof and see Conclusion: This stuff sucks and I can't make money off of it like this So I decide to add plasticizer (or something). I try it again. It works! I leave it on for a whole 5 years. Still works! I market it. Someone is interested and buys it since I can provide it for so cheap. I have discovered a new product, motivated by money, saves others money and my science is completely sound. Wow!","goal-evolutionists","09:38 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","102"

Wow!","unkerpaulie","453115","The financial motivation didn't cause you to come to your conclusion, your financial motivation caused you to persevere with your original vision. Scientific conclusions can never be ""motivated"" by anything other than facts. Persistence is a quality that can very strongly associated with financial gain, and for a scientist, persistence is a valuable trait. However, the financial motivation cannot make a hypothesis true, regardless of how much money is at stake.","goal-evolutionists","10:40 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","103"
"04-23-2012","15051",7,"Freedom","453183","The scientific method is not a test it's a process involving tests. A conclusion is a conclusion before and after it's truth value is established. Of course it can or else it would be fundamentally untestable which the original definition of hypothesis does not allow. How would my tip affect the validity of their work? You switched herrings here, you have made statements about what the scientist are motivated by not 'scientific conclusions' themselves. No one sane would ever think that money would alter reality. This is actually a fascinating look at the intellectual corruption that exists in science community and how the public perceives it. There is no authority in science and so it cannot be corrupted. Scientist can be corrupted, but they cannot corrupt science in turn; all they can do is lie to those whom they know have neither the time nor expertise to reproduce their results. In pure capitalism there is nothing to gain from false conclusions but bankruptcy. Not only would a scientist for hire be obligated by his own integrity to follow the process correctly but he would never be paid for anything else. Those who think they can put a lab coat on someone and use him as an authority for commercialization walk the border of fraud to say the least and are taking advantage of trust that should not exist in the first place.","unkerpaulie","453203","A statement proposing the explanation of a phenomenon can either be a hypothesis (untested and unverified) or a conclusion (tested and verified). Since a statement cannot be verified and unveirfied at the same time, it cannot be a hypothesis and a conclusion at the same time. The same statement that started as the hypothesis can end up being the conclusion, but at that time it is no longer a hypothesis. People purporting to be scientists present conclusions beased on incomplete testing and by not following the scientific method all the time. In a captialist system, especially in america, what is accepted as backed by science has more to do with what the media promotes as true than what has been actually verified by the scientific method. Regardless of how much another scientists refutes the claim based on real science, it is the acceptance by the public that allow multi-million dollar corporations to commit fraud and get away with it. And because they can control what the media says through money, they can financially benefit through the manipulation of the public to accept their claims.","goal-evolutionists","07:56 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","105"
