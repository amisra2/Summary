At this stage I am trying to reconcile my belief in evolution and in a creator. I personally don't see anything mutually exclusive about believing in the existence of a God and the theory of evolution. I've always taken the view of why can't evolution be the process of how God populated the earth? However, lately I have been asking more questions of both theories. Eg.: How could we have all come from two people, Adam and Eve? Besides being able to observe natural selection within species, do we have any conclusive examples that show one species ""evolving"" into another? Personally I don't want religion to go away. I'm just looking for answers.","trebor","424646","If you look at the story of Genesis from a Hebrew language perspective, you can see it is an allegory, not history. Adam is the generic term for 'Man Kind', and Eve means life. The word dust 'Edom' is related to the word 'red' and also the word 'blood'. If you see trace the puns, you can see that 'God made man kind out of blood'... It is merely referring to the concept that runs through the ancient Hebrews attitude the 'blood is life' and 'man is alive'. Religion doesn't go away, but the literal reading of Genesis does.","goal-evolutionists","10:52 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","16"

"02-23-2011","15051",2,"gansao","424460","Im afraid the argument between evolutionists and creationists has been won by the evolutionists. The evidence is so compelling as to be irrefutable, unless you believe the science behind it is the devil trying to fool us...some do.","marc9000","424686","Within universities, within the halls of the scientific community, yes. In the real world, not at all. And they have good reason to. The denial that evolutionists-atheists are in about what they are trying to do is laughable, and makes any open minded person wonder what else they are being dishonest about.","goal-evolutionists","08:41 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","19"

Sam Harris? William Provine?","Accipiter","424690","Each of them is only one man, there is no organized effort to attack religion.

Otherwise all those know-nothing know-it-alls in the 'real world' would be teaching children a right load of old bollocks in schools.

I dont think that its the ' evolutionists' that are in denial Marc. The only way that the Bible explains how the world was created is if scientific evidence is a direct lie purposely fed to us by the Devil ...who reigns over the world and worldly things....truth according to Jehovahs witnesses( or something like it)","goal-evolutionists","03:34 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","23"
"02-24-2011","15051",2,"marc9000","424765","Phillip Johnson, author of the Wedge Document, is only one man. It was stolen by two mail room boys and published on the net, it wasnt intended to be a public document. Yet what that one man said is constantly used to discredit all of Intelligent Design. Only one of the many glaring double standards routinely practiced by todays atheist scientific community.","Accipiter","424770","Intelligent design would be under attack even if it had nothing to do with religion, it's a worthless hypothesis, it can't be used to explain anything. Kind of a stretch trying to weave the intelligent design thing into the debate, are you really having that much trouble trying to support your argument?","goal-evolutionists","10:55 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","25"
"02-25-2011","15051",2,"marc9000","424765","For those who consider Ward Churchills hatred of America to be a reasoned conclusion, I suppose it would be a good thing. (He was enthusiastically invited to speak at dozens of universities after his anti American outburst.) Or the conclusion that all men were endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights is due to be replaced, by, 'there are no unalienable rights, only those granted by elite atheists/evolutionists'. If enough scientists wish it, if enough of them say it, human imperfection has its ways of making speculation fact, when it really isnt.","Larni","424788","What has that got to do with people in universities being more intelligent than those outside of university? I've never heard of this Churchills fellow or his activism for indigenous rights so I've no idea why he is relevent to my point.

"02-25-2011","15051",2,"marc9000","424765","Likewise, studies for signs of intelligence in nature arent intended to destroy anything factual that real science has put forward. Also unfortunately, they are playgrounds for political ideologies that are far removed from those of the majority of the general public that makes their existence possible. Its the world of free markets in the U.S., the worldviews of taxpaying citizens. To Mr. Weinbergs chagrin, many of them still go to church. They still believe in unalienable rights not being subjected to dismissal by the atheist scientific community.","Bennedict","424804","are you able to support either of those statements, or are they just conspiracy assertions? if you had any evidence, you would be able to study intelligence in nature, but im afraid you dont, so you cant. if you wish to partake in doing independent research to find intelligence in nature, be prepared to find nothing empirically, which will be the reason you will be ignored by the scientific community just like dozens of others before you have done, in search of a creator/designer. the subject has now become laughable to us, seeing absolute desperation, turning up with nothing. Originally Posted by gansao What exactly is the 'real world'? aw, nuts. so that means me, gansao and the other bros from the UK, a couple dudes from Australia, that one dude from France, and a few others dont live in the real world. we live in a crazy fantasy world that doesnt revolve around some invisible man who talks to us telepathically and tells us what we're not allowed to do. the problem with Behe or Dembski claiming to use ID as a religious tool - they would lose their jobs and be blacklisted instantly, just like Johnson was with the wedge document. and i even think my ol' pal Freedom would frown upon that. Johnson created ID with the plan to destroy the evolution-accepted science world, and others followed suit, like Behe and Dembski. if a document by Sir Darwin was found illustrating how ToE was a tool to bring down religion, i would disassociate with him and that ideal right away. his theory would still be correct, based on the amount of evidence we have to support it, but evolution isnt a tool to bring down religion. ID was meant to be a tool to bring down evolution; whether it's changed since then or not is irrelevant. what is relevant is that there is no evidence to support anything other than a natural origin to modern biological entities by means of evolutionary theory, and thus, any challenges must have massive substantial emperical evidence, with an absolutely mindblowing theory to assist. ID is a thorn in the side of science, which is easily plucked out. not quite what we would expect from something which claims to be able to bring down evolution and replace it with religious sympathies.","goal-evolutionists","01:41 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","30"
