You wouldn't know the truth if it bit you on your nose. As for ""Hearsay..."" But just for fun, would the Rules of Evidence exclude statements within the Bible as hearsay? The answer is no. One class of statements excluded from the hearsay are statements contained in an ancient document. Fed.R.Ev. 803(16) provides this exception for Statements contained in ancient documents. ""The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule . . . Statements in a document in existence twenty years or more the authenticity of which is established."" Rule 901(8) sets out the method for authenticating ancient documents. ""Evidence that a document or data compilation, in any form (A) is in such condition as to create no suspicion concerning its authenticity, (B) was in a place where it, if authentic, would, likely be, and (C) has been in existence twenty years or more at the time it is offered."" Carrying the absurd one step further, lets anachronize and subject the Bible authors to the hearsay rules to see if they'd be competent to testify to the things they recorded. The fact is that many statements recorded in the Bible would be admissible under any one of several hearsay exceptions. Let's take a look at some oft-challenged elements of the Gospels and see how they would fare under the rules pertaining to hearsay. Jesus' genealogies Matthew 1, Luke 3: Admissible? Yes. Rule 803(13) ""The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule . . .Statements of fact concerning personal or family history contained in. . . genealogies, charts . . .or the like."" Miracles; Statement of the Blind Man in Mark 8:24 ""I see men, as trees walking."" Admissible? Yes. Rule 803(3) """"The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule . . . Statement of the declarant's then existing . . . physical condition. . . "" Statement of the disciples after Jesus calms the storm in Matthew 8:26, 27 ""But the men marvelled, saying, what manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him! Admissible? Yes. Rule 803(2) ""The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule . . . A statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition."" Statement Identifying Jesus after a Resurrection Appearance John 21:5-7 Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus. He called out to them, ""Friends, haven't you any fish?"" ""No,"" they answered. He said, ""Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some."" When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish. Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, ""It is the Lord!"" As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, ""It is the Lord,"" he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water. Admissible? Yes. Rule 803(1) ""The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule. . . A statement describing or explaining an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving the event or condition, or immediately thereafter."" Skeptic Richard Packham, also an attorney dismisses all resurrection accounts except Paul's as objectionable hearsay. Under the Federal Rules, this statement is admissible as a present sense impression, although in all fairness to Packham, this exception is not as widely accepted as the rest. Thus, as we can see, many of the most controversial parts of the NT are admissible under exceptions to the hearsay rule.

Yet you arrogantly claim to have all the answers. Instead of thumping that Bible, you should study it.","Easyrider","459567","You really are brain dead to think Jesus Christ is in the same category as Santa Claus. (from a previous post) First of all, Jesus is presented as an historical figure by reputable people in both secular and sacred historical writings. Santa Claus is simply presented as a fictional character. Second, Jesus is presented as a real person who claimed to be divine and who performed miracles. These accounts are attested to by reputable witnesses and have been transmitted to us reliably; the New Testament documents are 99.5% textually pure. Santa Claus is intentionally, and knowingly, presented as a fictional character who lives at the North Pole. Third, the intention of the gospel writers was to convey the physical reality of Jesus to responsible adults, whereas the accounts of Santa are intended to entertain the wild imaginations of children. This is why the vast majority of healthy, mentally competent adults do not believe in a real person known as Santa who can travel through air being pulled by several flying reindeer, who can carry in his sled enough presents for all the good children in the entire world, and who can descend and ascend through chimneys even though he is quite overweight. Fourth, the writings concerning Jesus exhibit an historical, cultural, religious, and political context with verifiable names, events, and places being an integral part of the record of that context and reality. Santa Claus stories do not contain any such integral contextualization, except to state that there is a north pole and that there are cities and countries where Santa visits at night. Fifth, the facts are that parents buy, wrap, and deliver presents to children, and we know of no documented occurrences where Santa Claus has been caught breaking and entering, tripping home alarm systems, caught on film, vanishing up a chimney, and riding a sleigh through the air pulled by flying reindeer. This latter point is worth commenting on, since we additionally have no evidence at all that reindeer can fly. This further adds to the irrationality of the Santa Claus story. Additionally, if a large sleigh (sufficient to carry millions of toys) approached the Washington D.C. area (surely there are at least some good children there), we would expect to hear of military fighter jets being scrambled to intercept the intruder. No records of this have yet surfaced. Sixth, given that the gospel accounts were written by individuals who knew Jesus personally (or were under the guidance of those who knew Him), that the gospels are historically accurate, superbly transmitted to us through the copying method, we can then assume at the very least that Jesus was an actual historical person. But, we have no hard evidence to establish the validity of Santa Claus. We have found no reindeer tracks on the roofs of millions of snow-covered homes on Christmas Eve. There are no video accounts of Santa roaming throughout peoples' homes. We know of no flying reindeer, and no one has yet established how Santa can live at the North Pole for hundreds of years without being detected -- particularly in this technologically advanced culture. Add to that the lack of Santa Disciples going about the world, risking their lives, being ridiculed by religious and political adversaries, writing inspirational text, performing miracles, etc., and you really don't have much evidence at all that Santa exists, except in the minds of children. Finally, it really comes down to whether or not either one can be reasonably supported to exist. Very few people deny the historic reality of Jesus, and though millions of children affirm the existence of Santa, we know well that the minds of children are not capable of differentiating between fantasy and reality -- particularly when the parents they are trusting tell them Santa is real. For an atheist to reject Jesus' existence based on arguments found against Santa Claus demonstrates the inability for the atheist to distinguish between historical verifiable documents and known constructed childrens' stories. Jesus was an actual historical figure. Santa, of course, is not. But then we know you don't know your rear end from a hammer, so there you are!","goal-evolutionists","05:23 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","177"
