You can neither expand your knowledge nor correct others because you are disgusted by open debate. If debating something you don't agree with makes you as ""bad"" as those you disagree with; I have to ask who do you debate? People you agree with? Perhaps this explains why you never seem to debate Gansao just asked ""So whos the dumbass that debates religion and believes its bunkum?"" He named you but he's wrong, you don't debate religion you ridicule it. In this you are consistent, by your own delusional choice you manage to be just as intellectually useful as easyrider telling people they are going to the pit.","Accipiter","465064","You're in their club but you don't want to acknowledge that you are one of them?

During hunting season. Anyway Bigfoot believers don't believe on the strength of anectdotal evidence. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of anecdotal reports every year which are filed away for want of physical evidence. There are however hundreds of footprint casts which have not been explained away, ie showing toe movement or dermal ridges on the skin. Plus you have the grand daddy of bigfoot evidence which just turned 45 last weekend and that is the Patterson Gimlin footage. Then there is the unidentifiable hair samples, unidentified sound recordings and a growing amount of video evidence. Now, a lot of the video evidence is blurry at best and badly faked at worst but even if one is real then there's your proof.","goal-evolutionists","11:29 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","281"
