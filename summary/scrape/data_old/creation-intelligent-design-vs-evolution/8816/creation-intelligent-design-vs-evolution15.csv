"05-01-2007","8816",15,"Archangel","261003","For correction and further clarification, you have completely misrepresented what this verse means. Here it is in context with the verses that come before and after it. Mar 3:26 (Jesus speaking) ""And if Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end. Mar 3:27 ""No one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. And then he will plunder his house. Mar 3:28 ""Assuredly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they may utter; Mar 3:29 ""but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation""-- The bolded is the passage you posted to imply that Christians can lose their salvation. The passage actually is about blaspheming the Holy Spirit and how that is an unforgivable sin, which a believer would never do. Now ask yourself this ! Are those people who have right here on this thread and forum, blasphemed the Holy Spirit by mocking and insulting me as an ignorant fool for claiming and insisting that God Himself indwells me by the power of His Holy Spirit ?","Zardoz","261123","Address Luke and Matthew also, they omit that part and are about the same instance. I'd says the passages are about how demonic possession can come about...after all, that's what the Christ is doing, casting out a demon. What I'd have you do is disregard non-Christians whom never knew the Holy Spirit and focus on yourself and your possible sins, the sins that bind. Spiritual Pride could be possible. http://www.inchristalone.org/SpiritualPride.htm Of course, this is the Internet and it's difficult to discern the meanings of another in course written form but self inspection could be warranted if many state you appear to have issues with humility.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","06:56 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","213"
"05-01-2007","8816",15,"charlie horse","261120","@ Arch - Interesting that 'proper context' is your version. You've really lost the plot, Arch. And obfuscating a Biblical passage does you no credit. Yes, surrounding verses can supply a context, but not always necessary. Let me enlighten you. I'm sure you can recall 2 Tim. 3:16 - All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness. WHY? ... that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work. Clearly you should be able to see that more than one piece of learning can be had from a particular Scripture. If you want to learn about certain problems within the congregation at Corinth, you can view surrounding verses. If you want to learn about the qualities expected of a Christian, you can look at 2 Cor. 5:20 and see that Paul and other evangelisers considered themselves ambassadors for Christ. Now link that to 2 Tim. 3:16 and you may begin to see what qualities are expected of a true Christian. Christ overturning the tables of the money changers was a display of righteous anger. So remind us again who displayed this anger. That's right. Christ. Your's isn't righteousness indignation, your's is self-righteous anger. Prov. 21:23 - He that is keeping his mouth and his tongue is keeping his soul from distresses. Eph.4:29 Let a rotten saying not proceed out of YOUR mouth, but whatever saying is good for building up as the need may be, that it may impart what is favorable to the hearers. 31 Let all malicious bitterness and anger and wrath and screaming and abusive speech be taken away from YOU along with all badness. Romans 12:17 Return evil for evil to no one. Provide fine things in the sight of all men. 18 If possible, as far as it depends upon YOU, be peaceable with all men. James 3:13 Who is wise and understanding among YOU? Let him show out of his fine conduct his works with a mildness that belongs to wisdom. Why, Arch? Col. 1:10 in order to walk worthily of Jehovah to the end of fully pleasing [him] as YOU go on bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the accurate knowledge of God, You're not a Christian, Arch. None of the above Scriptures apply to you. You just enjoy stirring up contention. And what sort of Christian has the temerity, pretentiousness and self-righteous arrogance to call themselves Archangel ? By what stretch of the imagination can you equate yourself to Christ? If you want to debate, then debate. But you need to regain the plot you lost a long time ago.","Archangel","261124","Ok, now these verses are much better and in context to the message you're trying to send. As a Christian we are to gently use the Word to draw people to the truth. And if you and I met and spoke of spiritual things that is how I am at all times. But charlie, this is a debate board so bone up. And I responded directly to you condescendingly correcting me as I shared the spiritual principle that the World was destroyed by Water once but will be destroyed by Fire the next time. You attempted to say that wasn't true when it is totally true. I produced the passage in second Peter and you have continued to rip passages out of context and try to say things with them they never intended to say. Sorry if hearing that bothers you. But you have been doing with Gods word exactly what the great deceiver did in the Garden and when he tried to tempt Jesus in the Wilderness. And what he does everyday to the average person, and that is to use the Word to draw people away from God rather than use it to draw people toward His truth. You may not like the tone of my posts but you can't deny that I'm defending God and His Word against rabid anti christian sentiments as promoted by you and others like child and sp whom I have on ignore now. So don't judge me on this cyber World as you would in the real World because this isn't who I am, nor is this forum the real World. And I marvel at how judgmental and condemning of me you are while totally giving the secular attackers who twist what the bible really say's a total pass for their crude and irresponsible statements. Why the hypocrisy and double standards if elevating the quality of debate is your goal charlie ? Why judge just the Christian and hold us to a higher standard when on the other hand you spend all your time disproving our beliefs ? So maybe you should practice what another verse say's and get the log out of your own eye before you worry about the twig in mine.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","07:17 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","214"

And do you know me well enough to attribute this sin to me ? a lying tongue, I have never lied to you. But you would have to actually know the truth in order to judge that. and hands that shed innocent blood, I am also innocent of this as I am a nonviolent man, and have been so since childhood. a heart that devises wicked plans, What is wicked about leading people to eternal salvation with a loving God ? Only the seed of satan would consider such a person evil. feet that make haste to run to evil, And you know me well enough to accuse me of this ? May I ask how and where we met ? And what evil I was rushing to participate in ? a false witness who breathes out lies, Again, a false witness is one who attempts to mislead and misdirect others. I have done no such thing here or anywhere else. and a man who sows discord among brothers. define brothers and you'll see that those here whom I offend are not now and most likely never will be my brothers. You notice it doesn't say that God despises one who calls a snake, a snake.
