Any true believer knows that with GOD all things are possible and since GOD did it science will not bail you out nor serve as evidence to the contrary. The bible says it happened - how dare you question that basiotion of truth and veracity?","Archangel","266084","EXACTLY, finally you get it.

And if its true that God created us with free will which even the Angels don't have, then how would we know we were free to reject Him if evil did not exist as an opposing option for humanity ? This is why the bible points out that we are in a Spiritual Battle and uses so many military comparisons to our lives as children of God. Life can simply be defined as a battle between Good and Evil, and Jesus said that you are either for me or against me. There is no in between, no sideline so to speak. If on thinks they can go through life in neutral, they are in for a rude awakening. So consider this. We are the only creatures in Gods creation with free will. And our struggle with the sinful nature is the battle field upon which we must choose and determine which NATURE/WILL we will follow. And the temptations and struggles with the sins of this World are the price we must pay to determine which nature we will follow, which will determine our eternal destination, which for those who choose the higher nature will be above the Angels in Eternity. Those who choose the lower nature will suffer with them in the hell that was created for Fallen Angels, not Man. But the people who end up there will have consciously chosen seperation from God by mocking and rejecting Him in life just as you do constantly in so many posts. You have every right and freedom to reject Him, just understand that it is you rejecting Him and not the other way around when you find eternal seperation from Him is your reality. Eph 1:4 just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love, This verse plainly say's that God chose us who will follow Him through Christ before the foundation of the World. Which means He knew us before He created us or the World we live in. 1Pe 1:20 He indeed was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you This verse say's plainly that God foreordained Messiah/the Christ, before the foundation of the World, which means He always understood our struggle with sin would force a choice by us to choose Good or Evil while in this body of flesh. And Jesus was the answer to the sin nature who would defeat death and give eternal life to all who believed in Him. As for causing Adam and Eve's Fall from Grace. He didn't cause them to eat the forbidden fruit of the knowledge of Good and Evil that cost humanity our innocence. He plainly warned them that on the day that they ate of its fruit they would SURELY die. They understood clearly the price for disobeying that one warning in the garden. And His reason was to protect them from the pollution of a sinful nature which we fully understand the downside of possessing as their descendants. As to the Great Flood, it is clearly your personal judgment as a person with a sinful nature that the flood was a sinful act. If satan himself were being interviewed, he, no doubt, would say the same thing. But that doesn't make it a true statement at all, only your opinion. The bible say's that Fallen Angels/sons of God as they were referred to, mated with human women creating a so called super race of humans which infected and corrupted humanity so that it had to be destroyed and purified. This was the reason for the Flood; to save humanity, not to destroy it. If God wanted to destroy you and me, He would have wiped out all life, not just the infected and corrupted life on Earth. But of course from your limited and Worldly perspective you would also have a shallow and limited perspective of Gods reasoning and actual true agenda which motivated His actions. Gen 6:2 that the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves of all whom they chose. Gen 6:4 There were giants on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men and they bore [children] to them. Those [were] the mighty men who [were] of old, men of renown. His only other option was to destroy all of humanity all together but that would have meant satan would have succeeded in destroying Man who was made in Gods image which has been his goal since our creation. He promised that he would never serve man which got him bannished as heavens #1 Archangel. On a side note, the fact that a race of Giants was produced from this activity means that God didn't destroy them imediately at all. He allowed this to existe for a period of time which no one knows the amount of time of. But I personally believe this explains the ancient, yet unexplained ruins of great Cities found by Archeologists and under the Oceans that we have no historical records of. They are pre flood civilizations that no descendants existed any longer to speak of. You can be sure that Evolutionists have no explanations for the existence of the unknown, yet rediscovered ruins of such Civilizations.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","10:30 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","234"

That's as true of bacteria as it is of people.
