"09-19-2007","8816",22,"Gup20","284578","I guess they don't believe God is a liar. Well again, this is not what the Bible claims of itself. 2Ti 3:16 All scripture [is] given by inspiration of God, and [is] profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: 17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. In fact, Jesus himself quotes Genesis as though it were literal history (cf. Genesis 2:24 and Matthew 19:4, 5). Additionally, Jesus himself said that he was subject to the Old Testament: Matthew 5:17 Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. The ""law and the prophets"" are a common reference for ""scripture"" or the Old Testament. Either the Bible is what it claims to be, or it is not. If it is not what it claims to be, then how can we possibly trust that Jesus was who he claimed to be? The two concepts are directly tied together.","peteratwar","284586","Nothing you have said changes the idea that the Bible was written by humans. God may have been the inspiration. But they wrote the best they could for the understanding of their fellows. I have no belief in the Bible as being precisely and exactly correct in all its details. If you do so believe then of course you can have fun with all your pretty little logic. If you believe as I do then your logic fails because it can only work if the Bible is literally true in all its details","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","11:14 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","317"

The link is by a creationist who claims to be a historian in geology. He's got a Phd in geology from a University in the UK. In fact, Lyell, one of the first 'geologists' was a layer and debater (not trained in science at all). He even made claims that it was his goal to discredit the Bible. One could hardly call his work objective, or his faith christian.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","11:20 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","318"
"09-19-2007","8816",22,"Gup20","284582","The creationist models have the sea floor lowering over time, while mountainous regions lift, yes. There are deep crevaces in the middle of the pacific ocean. IF the earth were to rip open and enough water the cover the whole earth came out, there would be a void where the water came from.

What you mean is that answersingenesis would make it up as they went along: ""Buffon was a deist or secret atheist, as were Lamarck and Hutton. Laplace was an open atheist.

In fact, part of the jewish religion and tradition was the role of a scribe - to copy the scriptures in absolute precision from generation to generation. It is actually documented that the Bible is the most well preserved (closest to it's original) document in history. However, as I said before - most ardent creationists will return to the original Hebrew or Greek for important interpretations. Did you look at an entire model? I would encourage you to go here: http://www.globalflood.org/ You can see a complete flood model done by a Phd scientist who is a creationist. Are there any sources (footnotes) referenced for their claims? Perhaps you could followup and take a look at their sources.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","11:43 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","322"

"09-19-2007","8816",22,"sinjin","284593","Care to provide support for this claim? Lyell revealed his animosity toward the Bible and his devious plan to undermine its teachings in private correspondence. He confided in an 11 August 1829 letter to his friend and fellow old-earth geologist, Roderick Murchison, just months before the publication of Lyells first volume of Principles of Geology (1830): I trust I shall make my sketch of the progress of geology popular. Old [Rev. John] Fleming is frightened and thinks the age will not stand my anti-Mosaical conclusions and at least that the subject will for a time become unpopular and awkward for the clergy, but I am not afraid. I shall out with the whole but in as conciliatory a manner as possible (Quoted in Brooke, 1979, p. 45, bracketed words added). And to George P. Scrope (fellow uniformitarian geologist and Member of Parliament), Lyell wrote on 14 June 1830: I am sure you may get into Q.R. [Quarterly Review] what will free the science [of geology] from Moses, for if treated seriously, the [church] party are quite prepared for it. A bishop, Buckland ascertained (we suppose [Bishop] Sumner), gave Ure a dressing in the British Critic and Theological Review. They see at last the mischief and scandal brought on them by Mosaic systems. Probably there was a beginningit is a metaphysical question, worthy of a theologianprobably there will be an end. Species, as you say, have begun and endedbut the analogy is faint and distant. Perhaps it is an analogy, but all I say is, there are, as Hutton said, no signs of a beginning, no prospect of an end. All I ask is, that at any given period of the past, dont stop inquiry when puzzled by refuge to a beginning, which is all one with another state of nature, as it appears to me. But there is no harm in your attacking me, provided you point out that it is the proof I deny, not the probability of a beginning. I was afraid to point the moral, as much as you can do in the Q.R. about Moses. Perhaps I should have been tenderer about the Koran. Dont meddle much with that, if at all. If we dont irritate, which I fear that we may (though mere history), we shall carry all with us. If you dont triumph over them, but compliment the liberality and candour of the present age, the bishops and enlightened saints will join us in despising both the ancient and modern physico-theologians. It is just the time to strike, so rejoice that, sinner as you are, the Q.R. is open to you. P.S. I conceived the idea five or six years ago [1824-25], that if ever the Mosaic geology could be set down without giving offence, it would be in an historical sketch, and you must abstract mine, in order to have as little to say as possible yourself. Let them feel it, and point the moral (Lyell, 1881, I:268-271, bracketed words added).","Gup20","284599","http://www.answersingenesis.org/crea.../i2/quotes.asp http://www.answersingenesis.org/arti...rth-time-scale From the 2nd link above:","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","12:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","324"
"09-19-2007","8816",22,"Count Otto","284577","That is genius! But surely not serious... ""Where did all the [flood] water go?"" Apparently it's still here in the sea! ""Flood models"" . I like it. This does rather sound like ""My First Big Book of Rocks"" though. Remember that it was the geologists who first came up with the problem of explaining why the world appeared to be so old - these men were staunch Christians and Bible believers. Any creationist who said that to me would get laughed out of town. What kind of catastrophe is this where the Himalayas get thrown skyward but animals are deposited in neat little rows? Not a Brontosaurus out of place...","ShadowPikachu","284600","Yeah ""flood models"". They give me a real laugh (especially being a Geologist myself). Most every one I've seen tend to in some way violate physics, or fail to take into account (probably deliberately) the fact that the volcanism they attribute to the flood period ends up giving off enough heat to boil the oceans. Or fail to take into account that their rapid plate movement (to move the continents around in the 40 days, etc. - I'm thinking Baumgardners ""model"" in this case) would leave Noah with first, tsunamis that make the Boxing Day 2004 one look like a simple regular wave on the beach, and have week-long mag 10 earthquakes, all right before the heat/energy produced by the processes turn the earth into an incandescent ball of plasma.

At their worst they are down right hilariously inane, at their best they're unfortunately misguided. This Baumgardner fellow actually has his name attached to some fairly mainstream and reputable scientific publications early in his career. However, it's rather conspicous that none of his ""creationism"" work is able to withstand the scientific scrutiny required for publication in such journals. How does a man who obviously has some credentials and understanding stray so far from the path? The power of faith should not be underestimated.

"09-19-2007","8816",22,"Gup20","284582","I guess a creationist might ask how many empiricle evolutionists were present at the formation of the universe to observe it, or how many observed the first forms of life, or how many eyewitnesses there were to observe the first stages of evolution. A creationist might wonder how any empiracle process can be based on such little observation. A creationist might point out the number of ""missing links"", and wonder how something that is missing and unobserved can be considered empiracle. To the creationist, the evolutionary worldview looks like the mythos, and their creationist view is supported not only by their interpretation of the evidence, but by eyewitness testimony (the Bible claiming to be the Word of God). The creationist models have the sea floor lowering over time, while mountainous regions lift, yes. There are deep crevaces in the middle of the pacific ocean. IF the earth were to rip open and enough water the cover the whole earth came out, there would be a void where the water came from.

History leaves its mark in geology and biology. Scientists read and interpret it. All Creationist do is read their bibles, which will teach them nothing about history. A scientist might wonder how Creationists have the cheek to pontificate about science when they know so little biology, geology or even plain physics. A scientist might point out how many mistakes there are in the bible if it is read literally. A scientist would conclude a Creationist can't tell logos from mythos and keeps mixing them up to preserve a discredited literalist interpretation of their bible. Where were the so-called eyewitnesses who saw all this creatin' goin' on? Creationist ""models"" are pure fiction with no science to back them up. They exist solely to explain away the vast errors found in literal interpretations of the bible.

"09-20-2007","8816",22,"None","None","None","chemist99a","284666","Well there is the flat earth model. The earth was a flat surface in the old days with almost no bumps and it had a rim around the edge and it was very dry. To flood the entire surface GOD merely had to add the water now found in the oceans. To reverse the flood the earth was converted to a sphere and given lumps and bumps thus producing new dry land. The mystery is not the flood itself but rather the dry land afterwards and how the topology worked out.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","04:19 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","330"
