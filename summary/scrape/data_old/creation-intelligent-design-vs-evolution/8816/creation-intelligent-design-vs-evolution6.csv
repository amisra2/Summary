It merely states in a very conspiracy like way what beliefs are suppose to be correct. Placed next to the Gov't did 911, and Elvis is still alive, it would fit in quite nicely. Rational people however, require something that has evidence, testing and empirical data. I suggest you learn what that is for a change. What I mocked was a conspiracy website. Not evidence. Unless you want to argue that websites similar that argue that Kennedy was shot by a magical bullet are indeed factual, I see little point here. Stand up comedy. I would ask you to provide a argument for why creationism is true but that's quite futile now isn't it?","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","01:03 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","80"

Something that cannot die does not live. Therefore God cannot be living. Logic is new to you isn't it? Furthermore just because one rejects literal genesis does not mean they are atheists (contrary to what Marc9000 would prefer to believe over what is actually true). Evolution gels easily with a myraid of religions and religious beliefs. Just because it doesn't deal with your fascist views on origin doesn't make it a conspiracy. So buddhism, shinto, moderate & liberal judaism/christanity/islam, diesm, most of the ancient religions, and a whole host of other religion don't count as a part of spirtuality? You're pretty arrogant you know? Furthermore acceptance of literal genesis will be the death of the nation. To accept literal genesis would be to stop practicing science as a whole. To reject evolution one has to reject chemistry, biology, physics and geology. Four basic sciences that the world is run upon, the last being primarily important as it particularly deals with finding hydrocarbons. Funny you say that. Europe is essentially going godless and look at them. They're doing pretty well on the whole aside from some pretty bad socialistic problems. Us on the otherhand have problems up the ying yang.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","02:56 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","85"

Typical. Could you explain what the left actually is instead of throwing around a category you appear to have no understanding of? Your site has no credible references. It has no empirical data. How is that any different then a site saying the US gov't is in cahoots with aliens? I see you completely ignored my post. btw are you going to continue to ignore how the flood is a impossibility?","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","02:11 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","86"

Where does the article indicate that this water ever came to the surface? And if it did, why did it and how and why is it back below the earth. Science is more than just making claims about unrelated hypotheses. You should be laughed at (rightfully) for making such claims without offering any mechanism that brought the water to the surface, dispersed the heat, and returned it to the mantle. Just because you want to believe it doesn't mean it isn't silly. As has been pointed out, the water, if it came to the surface, would have been superheated and flashed to steam immediately. There is also the fact that the condensation of water in the atmosphere into rain would also have released enough heat to boil the ocean. In order to flood the earth would above the mountains would have required more than 4 times the water now present on earth. If you try to claim that the mountains were just low hills that arose after the flood, then you run into even more heat problems, since mountains are either tectonic (which causes heat) or volcanic (the result of the heat from tectonics). Then you have to find a solution to the problem of the various biota that had to migrate across oceans - if you wish to claim that the continents were all together and them moved at super speeds, then you again run into heat problems. It makes one wonder how you can fall for this stuff as science without even bothering to learn reality.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","07:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","90"
