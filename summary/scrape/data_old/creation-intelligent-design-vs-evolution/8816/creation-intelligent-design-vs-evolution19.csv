Some of the books of the Old Testament were 35 foot long one piece scrolls that scribes would copy verbatim. If they messed up even one jot or diddle with only 3 paragraphs left to complete the whole scroll, they destroyed it and started over with a fresh scroll.

If they messed up even one jot or diddle with only 3 paragraphs left to complete the whole scroll, they destroyed it and started over with a fresh scroll. Of course if what they were copying was flawed in the first place..... Presonally I think the Chinese probably did a better job since they did not hide their work away in caves in jars without keeping a permanent record of where their stuff was store. And of course scrolls make it difficult to make copies. Leaves as in a book work much better - less waste you know.

This was proven when the Dead Sea Scrolls were found with the next oldest copy of Isaiah being found almost completely intact.

Decades and decades ago, I went to a small Presbyterian Girls college. We had to take Bible studies. What we learned, then, was modern Biblical scholarship. We learned that there were 4 primary writers of the Torah: The first is the Yahwist, who is the oldest writer. For him, Yahweh is a very anthropomorphic being who walks around on earth with Abraham and Adam and others. Writings from this very early period are not clearly monotheist. Yahweh is the God of the Jews, but there are other gods, that Jews are forbidden to worship. The Yahwist wrote the second creation story in the Bible: The Adam and Eve Myth. The second is the Elohist, who wrote much later. For him, G*d is not so anthropomorphic, much more ethereal. You will find the Yahwist and the Elohist woven throughout Genesis and Exodus. The third is the Priestly Writer. He is later than both the Yahwist and the Elohist. He is generally concerned with writings about Temple practice, but he wrote the creation story you find in the first verses of Genesis: In the beginning . . . . In this version of creation, Man and Woman are created simultaneously in the Image of God. In the vision of this writer, G*d is neither male nor female a much more sophisticated vision of the Divine. The fourth writer is the Deuteronomist, who, well, wrote the Book of Deuteronomy. Anyway, I have recently become interested in Jewish thought, and one of the best books I have read is Jonathan Kirschs The Woman who Laughed At God. He verifies what I learned years ago, and provides much more detail. I would suggest that you read him. But there is nothing in it that suggests that it records actual events.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","09:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","280"

The priestly writer was very effective in this regard. However that metaphorical figurative view is not to be take literally nor is it accurate in many aspects since discovered and elucidated. It matters not how accurately the tales were copied they remain tales.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","12:07 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","281"

The view according to which God and the world are one. The name pantheist was introduced by John Toland (1670-1722) in his ""Socinianism truly Stated"" (1705), while pantheism was first used by his opponent Fay in ""Defensio Religionis"" (1709). Toland published his ""Pantheisticon"" in 1732. The doctrine itself goes back to the early Indian philosophy; it appears during the course of history in a great variety of forms, and it enters into or draws support from so many other systems that, as Professor Flint says (""Antitheistic Theories"", 334), ""there is probably no pure pantheism"". Taken in the strictest sense, i.e. as identifying God and the world, Pantheism is simply Atheism. In any of its forms it involves Monism, but the latter is not necessarily pantheistic. Emanationism may easily take on a pantheistic meaning and as pointed out in the Encyclical ""Pascendi dominici gregis"", the same is true of the modern doctrine of immanence. ==============================","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","12:13 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","282"

I do not believe that Pantheists necessarily postulate ""vitality"" as being part of Nature. Certainly biologists do not and need not. Nature is of a piece it flows from the least complex systems to the most complex smoothly and without actual thresholds. Life is just part of the package and all the essentials to produce life are found at the lowest levels of organization. Its all in the interactions which are inherent all the way down.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","12:17 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","283"

Remember that before the printing press, Bibles were passed down from generation to generation, and all of them were virtually different. It doesn't matter that the Hebrews took good care of their historical records, all it takes is a simple mistranslation, and all of a sudden the messiah is born from a virgin and not a damsel (they are after all the same word in Hebrew, an easy mistake for Latin translators).","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","11:46 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","284"
"06-08-2007","8816",19,"None","None","None","Unriggable","267499","As for a global flood, such a spectacle is unfeasable. For starters there is simply not enough water on the planet to cover the surface: Even if the ice caps melted, about 20% of the planet's surface would still be land covered. Okay let's assume that water magically appeared and disappeared within forty days. How does this explain the millions of giant natural structures, such as mountains and caves? We've all been to the beach when we were kids, and we've all made sand castles with walls that we thought would repel the incoming tide. But within half an hour, the sand is completely level with the surrounding beach, the original structure gone. Same goes for a flood. How does a structure such as, say, uluru, or roraima? The point is, a flood of such porportions is just impossible. Remember who wrote Genesis: the Jews. They lived in Levant - an area near the place where asian - african - arabian tectonic plates collide with eachother. All this activity could lead to tsunamis of massive sizes - any survivor would have thought that the world had undergone the same cataclysmic fate. All it takes is a scholar to record the history, and we don't know how much later one came about - until then, the story circulated by word of mouth. This leaves plenty of room for error (a funny example is the story of how much weight George Clooney gained to play his role in Syriana - I was told it was 50 pounds or so, and when the topic came about a few weeks later I didn't really remember how much it was so I said 55 - I later checked online only to see it was thirty pounds, what a letdown). By the way, don't forget a similar story - Atlantis. Some people have become so obsessed by its mystery that they forgot who wrote the original text - Plato. Locations of Atlantis range from the Caribbean to Borneo, but who wrote the original idea? A Greek philosopher. We have to limit the areas to what he knew - the Old World knew nothing about Indonesia. Similarly, the Jews didn't know much of the surrounding areas, they could easily have assumed it was also under large amounts of water.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","12:08 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","285"
