But such claims always give a good laugh, especially since modern creationism arose in the 20th century. Aside from my quibbles about your initial remarks and claim of proof of science, you seem quite knowledgeable. Do you have a background in science?","obvious_child","230558","Well, there is some evidence if you see the flood as a regional rather then global event. True. What has interested me is what would have occured in Marcion and managed to take control of Christanity. No genesis in the bible would have produced a very different outcome no? Nope. Last science class I took was highschool physics, but I did get a 5 on the AP biology test. My college gave me enough credits so I don't have to take any science. It's great.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","02:17 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","16"

While I actually prefer the more technical approaches like heat liberation due to condensation, has anyone done any calculations that follow from the sudden introduction (or alternatively, removal) of however many billions of kilograms of water that show the change in gravitational pull on the planet in relation to the sun, which would surely break down the stable orbit?","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","12:56 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","19"

D = mass / volume. so we've got 1 = x / 700,000,000 anything divided by itself is one. so that means for every cc (cubic centimeter or millimeter), water weighs one gram. 700,000,000 cubic miles. I convert it to cubic feet, which is 3.696E12. convert to cubic centimeters, and you've got 1.04659065004E17. or 104,659,065,004,000,000. 104.5 quadrillion cm^3. just replace cm^3 with grams, yuo've got your wieght. it's 1.04659065004E14, or 104,659,065,004,000 trillion kilograms. 104.6 trillion kilograms < 6 heptillion (?) kilograms. the earth's wieght is 57,329,004,418, or 57 billion, times heavier.","obvious_child","230665","It won't. I already asked a similar question based upon mass. The mass of the water is negligable compared to the mass of the planet.

(Can I assume that the 7E8mi is correct?) 1mi =~1.609km 1mi =~(1.609km) =~4.166km (4.16818183km according to wikipedia ) 7.0E8mi 4.168km/mi = 2917727281km =~2.9E9km 1km = 10000dm 1km = (10000dm) = 1E12dm 2.9E9km 1E12dm/km =~2.9E21dm 1dm = 1L 1L H2O =~ 1kg 2.9E21dm H2O 1kg/dm = 2.9E21kg M[E] = ~6.0E24kg, so the mass of the water would increase the mass of the planet by ~1/2000. This may indeed be negligible, but it's late and I have more need for sleep than for continuing the calculations at this time. However, 2000 is no 57 billion.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","03:24 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","21"

(nevermind genesis is a pirated belief)","Another opinion","230753","Surprisingly, in my Google search to find that site, I also ran across a religious site - http://www.answersingenesis.org/Home...k/global10.asp - that claimed that many Christians believe in a local flood, as opposed to a global flood. That site was arguing against those Christians on Biblical grounds. All this means is that it is the more far-right Christians that believe in a Global flood. The more moderate ones, that also trust many results of Science, accept that the flood may well have been local. As for myself, I view the Bible - particularly the Old Testament - mainly as a memoir of an ancient, simple, but religious people who interpreted many of the events around them through a religious lens. If there was any sprititual truth behind any of those events, that truth would be very hard to parse out since so much of it seems to be a simple people's attachment of natural phenomena to spiritual forces. Obviously, then, I do not take the Bible literally. However, there are various useful morality tales in the Bible which make it worth selectively reading. One thing I would add, though, is that, as a people's memoir, the Bible can be interesting as a source of information about the ancient world. Werner Keller wrote a book ""The Bible as History"" that tries to connect various historical / archeological evidence with various events in the Bible - from a secular approach. Many of the Bible stories do turn out to have some level of historical truth behind them - at least where the events are concerned, not their spiritual interpretations. There is no evidence for any spiritual aspect. That is left to faith.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","05:35 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","25"

There is a claim that the pharoh's first born son was killed in the plague, hinting that he was a child at the time. However he has been found and exhumed, revealing a man who died in his 30's. Then there's the small matter that Exodus claims the Egyptian army was destroyed.... Without the Hittite Empire noticing? Would the US have noticed if the Red Army suddenly ceased to be during the 80's? Then they get to Jericho, according to the text this was a bustling metropolis, according to the archaeology it was an abandoned ruin.

Secondly although Jericho is in ruins the evidence is that it was rebuilt and destroyed on many occasions. Note also the Israelites only eventually reached Jericho. Thirdly even if not mentioned in the hieroglyphs found (SO FAR) that is not evidence enough to say the Israelites were not there. Fourthly the idea that an entire army took off after the Israelites with the Hittites around seems far fetched. So what happened ? Probably a rather insignificant (to the Egyptians) group of Israelites took off without permission for Canaan/Israel/Palestine. A small company of the Egyptian army probably went after them and never found them. Result when Exodus came to be written was a great propaganda boost for the Israelites. 'We fled from the might of the Pharaoh who pursued us with all his force and the Lord God saved us' . Well doesn't take too much to see how a small kernel of truth can get embellished. Finally there is the great difficulty of creating accurate matches in the timelines. Often we only get best estimates: 'Year 10 of the reign of Pharaoh XXX was around 500BC (or was it 600 BC or may be 300 BC)' Yes I agree that the Israelites probably originally came from the East and North. The flight from Egypt was a return.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","08:57 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","30"
