"09-19-2007","8816",21,"obvious_child","230139","It looks like the science based people here need some help. So I'm going to hit back. 1) A global flood, if it did occur, would have left fossils of every species in every strata as it laid down sediment. We should find all over the world, the same species in the same strata. No where on Earth do you find fossils of dinosaurs, mastodons, Precambrian shellfish and primates in the same strata. The flood was thought to have been extremely violent; churning up huge volumes of water this would have mixed the carcasses of species into one homogenous layer, advanced creatures with less advanced all whirling around in the cacophony of death together. While heavier species would have sunk faster, we should see more or less homogenous strata all over the Earth. This occurs nowhere on the planet. 2) The global flood should have left homogenous sediment layers across the world, similar to the Iridium layer that the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs left on the Earth. No such layer of sediment exists for that time period. 3) The necessary water to cover the Earth would have been astronomical. The oceans cover roughly 2/3rds of the Earth. That is sea level, to cover the highest point, Everest (29,028 feet feet above sea level), would require JUST to raise sea level, 756,821,205 Cubic miles of water. There's simply isn't that much water on Earth to allow such a flood. Some argue that the mountains werent that tall yet. That makes no sense whatsoever given the rates of tectonic plate drift. Plates move at 1 inch a year. Thats 500 feet over 6,000 years. Everest is by far taller then that. Some argue that plates moved faster. To create Everest in 6,000 years would mean plates would have to move almost five feet every year in the same direction. While plate movements are related to the Earths core heat, the necessary heat to have that much movement would mean the Earths core would have to be hundreds of times hotter. Thats way more then the surface of the Sun. 4) The global flood says that the world was covered by water. The problem with that is such an infusion of water would have created brine. As the water receded and evaporated, huge amounts of salt would have remained on the land. 5) Some say that the water came from underground, a mile to be percise. The problem with that is the water would be superheated. Releasing 756,821,205 cubic miles of superheated water would have boiled everything to death almost instantly. The flood never happened and by proxy creation as well. That however, does not invalidate Christanity as many Christians view the bible as a moral and value oriented book, not a accurate history book.","Gup20","284529","Many modern creationists would argue that the strata is a deposition order, and the fossil order is a burial order. They might say that specific places on earth where volcanoes and tectonic action were likely to occur had similar climates and therefore similar biological systems. Gen 7:17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth. 18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. 19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that [were] under the whole heaven, were covered. 20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. Gen 7:24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days. It seems to indicate that it took 40 days for the whole earth to flood. Creationists would interpret this to mean that the water levels increased for 40 days until all the earth was covered. That means there would have been opportunity for some animals (perhaps those with more stamina -- such as mamals) to find higher ground for about a month's time. The bigger, slower animals (such as dinosaurs) would not have been able to keep up. The Bible says ""the fountains of the great deep"" were broken up and water came out of the earth. Creationists would probably say that the order of sediment layers represents the order of catestrophic deposit. For example, when Mt. St. Helen blew in the 80's it laid down layers that looked very much like ""yearly"" strata layers... but thousands of them in just hours. Creationists would predict finding different layering based on the different types of catestrophic forces in that area. Was there volcanic activity in that area? Was there tectonic activity in that area? Was there earthquakes, how fast did that area flood... these would all have varying effects on the sedimentation process. Additionally, creationists would argue that water run off from the continents would have also played a significant role in sedimentation (ie Grand Canyon). [/quote] Mt Everest - at its very tip - has marine fossils. Why? Well simply put, it wasn't always there. Creationist models show a much more level earth. They would argue the oceans were not as deep, and the mountains were not as high. They would argue that there isn't a place on earth you can go and NOT find marine fossils, suggesting that at some point every place on earth was covered with water. It doesn't prove that they were all covered at once, however. Creationists use an illustration. Lets say you are bending a metal bar. It's very difficult and the place where the bend occurs builds heat. However, once you reach a certain point, it becomes incredibly easy to bend, very little force is needed as long as it keeps moving. The friction is exponentially decreased. Heat remains constant, no longer building. However, if you slow down too much, your piece of metal will loose it's heat and begin to harden. Creationists would also argue that you are using a common fallacy called ""uniformitarianism"". That is to say you are taking a measured value and extrapolating it back into the past. The problem with this is there is no way to tell that the rate has remained constant throuout time. For example, if we take a look at the earth's magnetic field, we see that it is shrinking at a regular rate each year. However, if we simply extrapolated that backwards at the same rate, the field would have been too powerful for life to exist just 15,000 years ago. The same goes with the Moon's orbit. It is gettting farther and farther away from the earth at a measurable rate. If we assumed (as the uniformitarian does) that the rate never changed, the moon would be touching the earth less than 50,000 years ago. Creationists use this argument effectively against millions of years of strata deposition. Creationists would argue that for this to be measured and calculated, one would have to know how much salt was in the oceans when they were created. Perhaps they were created without any salt in them. Perhaps the salinity of the oceans is a result of the solution that would have occured at a cataclysmic global flood. Creationists would argue that rain has a super-cooling effect. Additionally, any solution has a higher boiling point than water alone. What would be the cooling effect of a rain storm over the entire surface of the earth for 40 days and 40 nights? As a matter of fact, many ice age models begin with the flooding of an area. 6) Finally, flood geology requires the compaction of 4.5 billion years of comet, asteroid and meteor strikes into a single year. The problem with that is the energy from such impacts would have to be compacted as well, and we all know that the energy is converted into heat. [/quote] You have a lot of calculations there, and the creationist would ask what assumptions you are making. For example, are you assuming - as the uniformitarian does - that the rate of compaction has always been the same as what is seen today? Are you making any assumptions as to how much material was here to start with? Are you making assumptions about the material itself? Who observed all this material falling to the earth? I would disagree with you. I would say that if any part of the Bible were untrue, that would discredit the whole. You see the Bible claims to be the infalible Word of God. If it's claims about itself are wrong, how can we trust that it's claims regarding morality carry any weight?

I suppose the ardent creationist may still believe this. However my personal opinion is that the story of the flood relates to a deep racial memeory or memories when there were great upheavals and vast areas were flooded and others weren't. Look to the North Sea for instance. Look at the deserts in central Saudi Arabia where you can still pick up sea-shells.

If the flood were a local flood, as some say, then God is a liar. There have been many local floods througout history. If God is a liar, then the Bible is not the word of God and cannot be trusted.

As a matter of historical record, most agree that Jesus was on the earth about 2000 years ago (perhaps 2007 years ago?), hence approximately 6000 years. Two points here; first, that is not what the Bible claims itself to be. It claims itself to be the infallible Word of God. Secondly, the truth is unaffected by popular opinion. With new evidence, or better interpretation of existing evidence comes a change in the popular perception of the truth. Each of us has an opinion on the truth based on our worldview. That worldview effects how we process or interpret the evidence we see. Consider: creationists and evolutionists have the same rocks, the same fossils, the same ""evidence"". Both interpret that evidence differently to support their presuppositions in light of their understanding of the world in which they live -- basically filtered through the lens of their worldview. For the creationist, the Bible is their list of presuppositions. For the evolutionist, materialism, naturalism, and uniformitarianism are the underlying presuppositions.

A creationist might point out the number of ""missing links"", and wonder how something that is missing and unobserved can be considered empiracle. To the creationist, the evolutionary worldview looks like the mythos, and their creationist view is supported not only by their interpretation of the evidence, but by eyewitness testimony (the Bible claiming to be the Word of God). The creationist models have the sea floor lowering over time, while mountainous regions lift, yes. There are deep crevaces in the middle of the pacific ocean. IF the earth were to rip open and enough water the cover the whole earth came out, there would be a void where the water came from.
