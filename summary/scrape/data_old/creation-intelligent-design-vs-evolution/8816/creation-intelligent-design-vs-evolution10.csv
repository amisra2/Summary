Syracusia [Ships of the World: An Historical Encyclopedia] Ships of the World: An Historical Encyclopedia ^ | prior to 2006 | Houghton Mifflin Posted on 01/28/2006 8:46:55 PM PST by SunkenCiv One of the most complete descriptions of a ship from antiquity is that described by the Greek writer Athenaeus. Writing in the second century ce, but basing his account on more contemporary descriptions (now lost), he described a huge grain ship built by Hieron II, king of Syracuse from 269 to 215 bce. Lionel Casson considers this to be the largest ship built in antiquity... There were cabins for 142 first-class passengers on the second deck in addition to accommodations for steerage, the lower deck being reserved for cargo and the upper deck for soldiers, said to number 400. The first-class passengers could use a library, a gymnasium, promenades lined with flower beds, a chapel dedicated to Aphrodite, a reading room, and a bath. Twenty horses could be carried in separate stalls, and there was ample provision for fresh water and a saltwater fish tank for the cook's use. The ship was also heavily armed, being defended by marines stationed in eight deck towers who could fight the ship from the bronze tops of the three masts or from a raised fighting deck. The latter was fitted with a catapult of Archimedes' design capable of hurling an 18-foot dart or 180-pound stone 600 feet. The number of crew is not specified, but the account says that ""although the bilge was extraordinarily deep, it was bailed by only one man using a screw pump, one of Archimedes' inventions.""

TOPICS: History; Science; Travel KEYWORDS: godsgravesglyphs The Roman emperor Caligula had a number of 200 ton columns moved from Egyptian quarries to Rome, by ship, suggesting ships larger than this! Lionel Casson notes that the large grain haulers running wheat from the Nile Valley to Rome were also very popular methods of transport for travellers. Here's another tidbit that speaks to pauls ship wreck that is documented in the book of Acts. This just goes to confirming the accuracy of the bible. Finding one of these giant grain haulers would add a great deal of knowledge of ancient shipbuilding. Examining the Evidence for the Shipwreck on the Munxar Reef Associates for Biblical Research Mr. Cornukes investigations on the island of Malta led to the conclusion that the shipwreck occurred on the eastern end of the island of Malta, rather than the traditional site at St. Pauls Bay on the northern side of the island. His view is that the Alexandrian grain ship containing the Apostle Paul and his traveling companion, Luke, was shipwrecked on the Munxar Reef near St. Thomas Bay on the eastern side of the island. Mr. Cornuke claims that he located local spear fishermen and divers who told him about six anchor stocks that were located near or on the Munxar Reef. Mr. Cornuke has suggested that these six anchor stocks came from the shipwreck of Paul (Acts 27:29,40). Four of the anchor stocks were found at fifteen fathoms, or ninety feet of water (Acts 27:28), these would have been the ones the crew threw over first. The other two were found at a shallower depth and he thinks these were the anchors the sailors were pretending to put out from the prow (Acts 27:30). He identifies the ""place where two seas meet"" (Acts 27:41) as the Munxar Reef and the ""bay with the beach"" as St. Thomas Bay (Acts 27:39). He concluded that neither the sea captain, nor his crew, would have recognized the eastern shoreline of the Maltese coast.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","08:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","136"

You might be interested in educating yourself further by reading THAT BOAT DON'T FLOAT . Notice the the ships under discussion in that article were 329 ft. and 325 ft. in length. Along with the other 8 wooden keel & hull ships built around this time, they all leaked badly. They were all lost in rough seas. None were ever used as ocean crossing transports. Most were used as coastal haulers. The Great Republic foundered less than 640 miles from the North American coast when she was almost to Bermuda. Indeed, it is. It's called engineering; in this case nautical engineering (or naval architecture). It has a lot to do with understanding the limits of the materials with which one is working. Wood is just too flexible to serve as either keel or hull of ships of around 300 ft. or more. Certainly. The Syracusia probably wasn't the largest ship from antiquity. I don't know why everyone always ignores the Chinese who had an advanced civilization and a written language long before the alleged flood of Noah. They build huge ships that actually rivaled the ark in size. But they were not constructed according to the plan for the ark in the Bible. They were built from several smaller, water tight modules that were then lashed together. Thus, they could snake and hog without springing the hull. And of course, the Egyptians also build ships much larger than the Syracusia. They did it by building a series of hulls that were then fastened together with struts that formed several trimarans. On top of this was laid a huge platform that accommodated gardens and temples, etc. As for the Syracusia, she was undoubtedly impressive for the age in which she was built, but not all that impressive against the Chinese, Egyptian, or American offerings. The Syracusia was about 180 ft. long and has no relevance to the argument that a 450 ft. wooden vessel that exceeds by 50% the structural limits of wood could have survived a 40 day storm and a year at sea. Nice try. Your other ships aren't that large either. Why do you think that ""large grain haulers"" were as large as the ark? As for your tidbit about Paul, who cares? How does that show that Genesis is not pure mythology? I suspect that Paul embellished a bit to boot, just as every evangelist from then to now has done. And you accept it all without a single critical question.

He might try to use the examples of wooden ships that you showed (China and Egypt), but that can be dealt with easily (due to them being completely different than the ark). He also knows he can't claim that the Ark was built in the same way, because that would shatter his literal-Bible interperation that he so clings to.

This does nothing to destroy any claim - this ship is over half as small as the ark is claimed to be, and even here you can see all of the leaking problems. So, apparently, you have to twist the Bible, and add to it (wasn't there a few verses about that being a big no-no?), to maintain your ridiculous views. I'm really not suprised - hint: the bible shouldn't be taken literally, nor seriously - those who do end up twisting and adding to it to maintain their beliefs (not to mention outright lying). I didn't think you would make any apologies - you don't seem to be one that accepts reality. Noah's Ark is accepted by literalists to have been around 450 feet long.
