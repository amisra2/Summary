So your side can have the last word for all I care.","pandion","259058","Actually, when you leave, we'll be the last ones laughing. As for going back and forth with us, it consisted of you posting your belief in frauds and hoaxes, us pointing out your errors, you not admitting that you had made a mistake. Apparently you still think that the laws of aerodynamics claim that a bumblebee can't fly or you are not enough of a man and christian to admit your mistake. I guess that's the last word about you.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","07:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","122"

Certainly, creationists display more hubris than humility. I think that the problem is that they are quite sure that they know the absolute truth, even though that truth is based on the mythology of bronze age nomads. As an accident of history, they don't claim truth for Nordic mythology, or even Roman or Greek mythology. Instead, we have thousands of religions, each one claiming absolute truth, all derived from the proto-indo-iranian diety, Mitra. And since they know TROOTH (based on a book of mythology), anything that conflicts with that is either a lie, or ""it musta been a miracle."" Thus, the multiple problems of heat presented by the flood mythology are cast off as the power of GAWD. The humility of such christians isn't directed outward, towards rational discourse and the possibility that they may be wrong. It is an inward thing, in that they believe that they are not worthy of salvation but their god has selected them to be saved. That is certainly true for many. Several cults of christianity rely on literal interpretation of the Bible by each individual. GAWD guides them to the TROOTH without any knowledge of the history or mythology upon which the Bible is based. However, none of them actually follow the Bible in every detail. Has any christian ever stoned to death anyone who wore a garment that was a nylon-polyester blend? How many christians have brought their to be stoned for disrespect? They pick and choose what parts of the Bible they believe. Sadly, the believe the mythology and reject reality.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","12:47 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","125"

Your own superiority will condemn you. And that isn't me condemning you for I don't have that power or desire. But you are condemning yourself every time you mock God. You both show how lost you are by taking my warnings as ignorance based on mythology when it is your beliefs that are based on lies and shallow assumptions that science will answer the questions of our creation and the journey that got us to this place and time. So mock and scoff. Insult and belittle my beliefs. You aren't the first and you wont be the last.

Just by what you have posted here, I don't think anyone would want to believe what you do if it makes them that gullible. ""Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking non-sense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn. The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of the faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men. If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods on facts which they themselves have learnt from experience and the light of reason?"" -- St. Augustine By the way, Pandion, I'd be careful with that irony meter I recommended to you - mine came really close to burning out while reading this latest post from Archaicangel, so you might eventually need an even more powerful one.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","02:06 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","127"

How nice. At least you admit that we are superior. Now the question is how that is going to condemn us. No. It's you. Even though you claim you don't have the power you always end your posts by condemning someone. Apparently you don't really take the teachings of Christ seriously. You miss the point. We aren't mocking God. We are mocking you and your petty little god. The one that spouts about Ica stones and non-flying bumblebees. The one that can't admit mistakes. In fact, I don't recall one fact that you have gotten right. More ignorance. I haven't even considered creation or any journey to anywhere. I do know about the mythology that you take as fact. It is sad that any sort of baloney that supports your mythology you also consider as fact, even if it is quite clear that it is baloney. What is even worse, when your errors are pointed out to you, you think that your god is being attacked. Will do! The problem is that you start from your silly beliefs and then adjust reality to fit. Anything that disagrees with what you already believe, based on no evidence (just a book of mythology), you reject with your standard line of ""lies and deceit."" Never once have you made an effort to actually learn. Who hates you? What's with you christians of weak faith that you have to constantly pretend that you are being persecuted? Your words are silly and ignorant. Your words make you look silly and ignorant.

Someone will discover it, it just won't be us. And religion does nothing of empirical to back its claims up. Anyone remember Papal Infallibility? ""I am right because I am the Pope and I say I'm infallible!"" Meanwhile science argues that this theory is correct based upon a large set of evidence and experiments all showing that the theory is true.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","02:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","131"

(maybe that's the point?)

Even though Archy didn't seem to have the honesty or knowledge to attempt any sort of a reply, other creationists are aware and admit the problem. See An Evening with Rate I found this part to be interesting. ""I asked why no recognized experts on radiometric dating were invited to participate in the conference, given that none of the speakers had any training or experience in experimental geochronology. He was candid enough to admit that they would have liked to included one on the team, but there are no youngearth geochronologists in the world. He also agreed that the mechanism for accelerating radioactivity by nearly a billion-fold during a single year (the flood year) was a major problem for the group that in the end will probably only be resolved by invoking a cosmic-scale event or miracle. He further conceded that at this point they have no physical evidence for this miracle. Apparently, dissipation of the heat produced during the event is, in the end, going to require yet an additional miracle."" So it is as I suggested. The creationist answer is ""it musta been a miracle.""","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","07:51 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","135"
