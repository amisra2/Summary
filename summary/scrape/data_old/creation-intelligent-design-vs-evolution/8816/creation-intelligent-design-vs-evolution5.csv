"10-27-2006","8816",5,"Another opinion","232273","Reading over this thread, I stumbled upon this side-note of yours about Genesis being a pirated belief. Could you elaborate? I would be quite curious about any cultural origins of the Genesis story. Thanks.","obvious_child","236901","Sorry, didn't notice that post. Anyways, Genesis as told in literal form follows the exact same steps of creation and of the flood as Enuma Elish and Gilgamesh. It's a accepted fact that Enuma Elish was ripped off from Gilgamesh. Given that all of the stories have the exact same steps, on the same timeline in the same region would seem to indicate that they are related, if not copies of each other. Gilgamesh's flood story differs in that it is polytheistic and that the Gods flooded the Earth because man was too loud, not evil.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","06:58 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","62"

Looking up Enuma Elish, I don't see nearly as close a correspondence. I am mostly looking at the link: http://www.meta-religion.com/World_R...h_creation.htm and Wikipedia. Anyway, the parallel between the two stories mostly seems to be in the ordering of the stages of creation - six stages followed by rest. Though certain stages and certain orders would have to exist for any creation myth that subdivided creation in to sections, the fact that it was six and not five or ten or three stages does suggest some cultural communication. Such a connection is especially easy to believe since I understand that Abraham started off in Mesopotamia where he and his people certainly would have had access to these stories. I have always found it fascinating to discover the origins of beliefs and customs and to try to understand the context in which certain customs and beliefs arose. Where Christianity is concerned, the range of early Christian beliefs is amazing - far, far wider than exists today. So much of Christian belief has been shaped by the history and politics of ancient times. It is a fascinating puzzle to try to unravel.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","02:09 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","63"
"10-30-2006","8816",5,"None","None","None","obvious_child","237416","Follow the steps on Enuma Elisha. http://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/enuma.htm The Gods are the days through generations plus the creation of the Earth follows Gilgamesh. The Enuma Elish story was found on tablets and parchament dated back to the time when the Israelities where in Palestian before Genesis was found. And Gilagmesh was found in the areas that Enuma Elish arouse from. Basically the story went south through the ages. Not like Christanity isn't opposed to belief theft... Christmas was a Pagan holiday (Jesus was born sometime around june/july) that was celebrated for centuries before Christanity came along. The whole tree thing in a Barbarian tradition. Putting things on the tree is Roman. Mistletoe came from the pagan worship of fertility of a Bull's testicles. Gifts depends who you ask, either came from the pagan tribes in Russia or the Greeks. The most important day in Christanity is based on Pagan traditions.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","07:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","64"

Those 2 are far more important theologically speaking. I agree that December had a pagan festival for centuries and the early Christians hijacked it as Christ's birthdate even though no-one knows exactly when he was born. They clearly understood that people like a festival so they made use of it for something whose actual date was unknown.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","06:48 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","69"
