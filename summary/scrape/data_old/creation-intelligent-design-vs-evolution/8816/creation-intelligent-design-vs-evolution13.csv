"04-30-2007","8816",13,"Archangel","260889","And remember I said that it is you who will determine your fate. I'm not condemning you in any way and neither will God. But all who reject Him in this life will condemn themselves to separation from Him in the next. That is a spiritual law just as gravity is a physical law. Whether or not one accepts it is irrelevant.","obvious_child","260906","Apparently you don't understand the concept of Grace. But few Christians do. Quite sad how far they have fallen from their religion. I'd like to see you respond to the why God needed to flood if it could do anything. But you have a obvious history of running away so I won't hold my breath.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","02:07 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","181"

I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all life be cut off by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth."" And God said, ""This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come: I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth. Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life. Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth."" So God said to Noah, ""This is the sign of the covenant I have established between me and all life on the earth."" In general, Arch is correct in the literal interpretation of the bible concerning the flood and destruction and rainbow promise thingy. As to issues arising from an allegorical look at this would have us question the need for a 'convenant' question need for useless prophacies, future convenants (including the new one the Christ brought) and even questioning the need for a Christ to save humanity from this sin concept.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","08:09 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","183"

Peter and Revelation talk about destruction (of the world of mankind) by fire i.e. the second death (from which there is no resurrection.) Ergo, according to Arch's ignoratio elenchi , the rainbow meant subsequent destruction of the Earth by fire. We'll put it down to semantics. If the Flood account is allegorical, then Christians are wholly deluded in believing it actually happened (Satan transforming himself into an angel of light doesn't happen to Christians, apparently). If the Flood is of such monumental fact as they keenly assert, why doesn't their argument hold water? (Pun intended).","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","08:51 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","185"

Noah and his family were still direct descendants of Adam so they possessed the Adamic nature if you will, as do all who were descended from them. Sin still reigned within the soul of humanity and we still possessed the spirit of rebellion that comes with the sin nature. Where as the Old Testament Hebrew custom of sacrificing an unblemished lamb to temporarily cover sins was practiced, God sent the perfect Lamb of God whose sacrifice was an acceptable sacrifice once and for all time to all who receive Him. He was the man Christ Jesus. So without Christ there is no salvation unless one can live a perfectly sinless, righteous life according to Gods standards of Holiness and perfection which no human has been able to satisfy yet. Salvation is a free gift though as there is nothing we can do to earn it.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","09:09 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","186"

You don't understand the timing, or at least the accepted Theological interpretations of the end times at all because you're excluding much of what will take place. Re-read my post above as it explains it in as simple terms as I could explain it. And if it isn't, who is deluded then ? Those who receive Christ and possess the indwelling of the Holy Spirit of God CANNOT be possessed by the devil. You reveal your lack of understanding by not knowing that. How depressing must it be to have allegedly spent years in a bible College and learned nothing ?","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","09:25 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","188"
"04-30-2007","8816",13,"charlie horse","260943","And look what it's done to you. That's what I used to think. They only agree because you want them to. It's easy to rationalise using alleged perspective, but there's a plethora of contradictions and anomalies available for perusal on the 'net. Simply because you said the rainbow meant destruction by fire (which it didn't). In my previous post I've put it down to semantics. Agreed that it's nothing further from the truth. But I didn't say that. Look at the punctuation. As for the rest of your interpretation of Revelation, I have no problem in essentially agreeing with you to a large extent in that is what the Bible is saying. The slight problem is the veracity of the claims...","Archangel","260946","It isn't my job or intent to try to make you believe as I do charlie. In the end we all travel this journey of life alone so believe what you will and good luck with that. I also find it interesting that your avatar represents the bleached white skull of a dead bull. Could that be some prophetic irony ?","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","09:28 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","189"

I revelled in it. The real learning comes when you stand outside the box and look in, and analyse dispassionately. No one wants to die if they've got their marbles and health. In those circumstances, very few want to choose when and how to die. I want to live forever. There's a lot to learn. Learning would never cease. A lot of people want that. But not to the point of self-delusion. The real world is here and now. At least you've got a sense of humour. But I find it infinitely more tasteful than the tortured body of a man hanging from the murder weapon.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","10:35 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","190"
"04-30-2007","8816",13,"Archangel","260889","You make an interesting point moose. From the perspective of one who is spiritually dead anyway. ... Of course this is all foolishness to you and because you are deaf and blind to the Spiritual World that surrounds you I can't prove what I know to you.","thelmoose","260967","Well, at least you are being open-minded about this.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","11:01 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","191"

How about auto and health insurance in case of an accident or illness, do you prepare for that future possibility ? Then why isn't preparing for our eternal future just as important as spiritual beings ? And more importantly, how is preparing for that time denying or avoiding ""the real world in the here and now"" ? You make no sense for one who claims to have studied the truth. I haven't noticed any avatars on this site of Jesus hanging on the Cross. Can you point it out please ? Mine represents the ""Lion of Judah"" who as you can plainly see is very much alive and well, and beautiful too.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","11:02 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","192"

"04-30-2007","8816",13,"charlie horse","260974","It makes no sense to you, Arch, because you think you have found The Truth . Nothing outside of that will influence you. The Truth is a prison for the mind. Yes, I studied The Truth for years. As ultimately there wasn't a shred of evidence for it, apart from wishful thinking, getting out was supreme sense. Did I infer that? I see crucifixes adorning necks every day. Look at me; I'm a Christian . Or else it's a hypocritical sham. Every day I see roadside crucifixes - sometimes up to 4m high - and shrines. The reference wasn't directed at you, Arch, but the Christian in general and their use of sick imagery.","Archangel","260977","I don't think I know the truth charlie, I know it. The Holy Spirit of God which indwells me assures me of my eternal standing as His child. You are perfect evidence of the difference between studying The Truth and Knowing It. Had you truly possessed the Holy Spirit and knew the Lord, you wouldn't be rejecting Him as foolishness now. Yes you did infer it since my original statement was referring to avatars and had nothing to do with Crosses in general. You should have been more clear about generic crosses you see in your everyday travels. Also, it's worth pointing out that the Cross isn't a symbol of death as you see it but is a symbol of resurrection and eternal life. I'm really starting to doubt you ever went to any type of Bible College as you have no understanding about what is even believed.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","11:45 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","195"
