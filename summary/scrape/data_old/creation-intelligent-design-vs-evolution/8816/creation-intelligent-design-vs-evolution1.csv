So I'm going to hit back. 1) A global flood, if it did occur, would have left fossils of every species in every strata as it laid down sediment. We should find all over the world, the same species in the same strata. No where on Earth do you find fossils of dinosaurs, mastodons, Precambrian shellfish and primates in the same strata. The flood was thought to have been extremely violent; churning up huge volumes of water this would have mixed the carcasses of species into one homogenous layer, advanced creatures with less advanced all whirling around in the cacophony of death together. While heavier species would have sunk faster, we should see more or less homogenous strata all over the Earth. This occurs nowhere on the planet. 2) The global flood should have left homogenous sediment layers across the world, similar to the Iridium layer that the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs left on the Earth. No such layer of sediment exists for that time period. 3) The necessary water to cover the Earth would have been astronomical. The oceans cover roughly 2/3rds of the Earth. That is sea level, to cover the highest point, Everest (29,028 feet feet above sea level), would require JUST to raise sea level, 756,821,205 Cubic miles of water. The fundemental problem is that the Oceans, seas and bays make up 96.5% of total water on the Earth and they only have 321,000,000 cubic miles. That leaves a huge amount of water that would need to come from somewhere. http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/DanielChen.shtml There's simply isn't that much water on Earth to allow such a flood. Some argue that the mountains werent that tall yet. That makes no sense whatsoever given the rates of tectonic plate drift. Plates move at 1 inch a year. Thats 500 feet over 6,000 years. Everest is by far taller then that. Some argue that plates moved faster. To create Everest in 6,000 years would mean plates would have to move almost five feet every year in the same direction. While plate movements are related to the Earths core heat, the necessary heat to have that much movement would mean the Earths core would have to be hundreds of times hotter. Thats way more then the surface of the Sun. 4) The global flood says that the world was covered by water. The problem with that is such an infusion of water would have created brine. As the water receded and evaporated, huge amounts of salt would have remained on the land. Very few plants can grow on salted Earth, and those who can are not agricultural crops. Virtually every creature in the oceans has a low tolerance for salinity change. A slight change can result in massive dieoffs. That would mean, as the salinity rapidly changed, that many creatures, if not virtually all would have died from osmosis. That means Noah would have had to keep two of every species of oceanic creatures onboard the ship. Given the measurements, the boat cannot hold two of every whale and shark. Even worse, as most of the oxygen comes from algea and seaweed, the change in salinity and pressure would have killed off the producers of oxygen. Life simply couldn't exist after a flood of such proportions. While some modern species can survive in salinity conditions very different then their norm, most cannot survive for extended periods of time, such as 40 days. Furthermore, their prey sources often cannot survive that long as well. Even more alarming is that if the alga managed to survive, the death of billions of life on Earth would have resulted in decay which results in nutrients which would have resulted in alga explosions like no other, removing oxygen from the oceans, suffocating every living thing left. 5) Some say that the water came from underground, a mile to be percise. The problem with that is the water would be superheated. Releasing 756,821,205 cubic miles of superheated water would have boiled everything to death almost instantly. The oceans would have also boiled away, killing all marine life, fresh water lakes would have done the same. The mantle of the Earth is 100 Celsius. Therefore the steam would be roughly that hot. Thats 212 degrees Fahrenheit. 756,821,205 cubic miles of 212 degree Fahrenheit water in a world that is typically no hotter then 80 degrees average would be instant death to everything. 6) Finally, flood geology requires the compaction of 4.5 billion years of comet, asteroid and meteor strikes into a single year. The problem with that is the energy from such impacts would have to be compacted as well, and we all know that the energy is converted into heat. 3 x 107 kg x 4.5 x 109 years worth of meteorite flux =1.35 x 1017 kg of meteoritic material fell during the flood year. The energy imparted by this amount of material is equal to: 1/2 M V2, where M is the mass of the extraterrestrial material, and V is the velocity at which it falls to the Earth (equal to the escape velocity, or 11200 m/s). This gives: 1/2 (1.35 x 1017 kg) * (11200 m/s)2 = 8.5 x 1024 Joules. So the Earth's atmosphere would have had to accomodate 8 x 1024 J of energy from this falling meteorite matter. We can do a quick calculation to determine the amount of heating this would cause: Energy = Matmo * Cp *(T), where Matmo is the mass of the atmosphere (5 x 1018 kg), Cp is the pressure constant for air (about 716 J/kg * K for N2), and T is the temperature change of the atmosphere. Solve for T: T = Energy/ (Matmo * Cp) = 8 x 1024 J / ((5 x 1018 kg) *716 J /kg * K) = 2,400 K. So the temperature change of the Earth's atmosphere would be about a 2,40 K increase in a single year. That's over 3860 Fahrenheit. The flood never happened and by proxy creation as well. That however, does not invalidate Christanity as many Christians view the bible as a moral and value oriented book, not a accurate history book.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","03:38 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","1"

The King Kong argument? If the Med had been flooded there would be a lot of evidence. There is none. The closest thing is a supposed flooding of the Black Sea at the end of the last glaciation, which hasn't gone away. We can go through a lot of the old testament this way, Archaeology directly contradicts the account untill David and Soloman. That means no Exodus, People have been over the Egyptian heiroglyphs since they were decoded looking for the accounts of that episode. They aren't there. What's more if you look at the archaeology of Isreal the Isrealites weren't monotheists. There were polytheistic temples untill they return from Babylon (which is where the Epic of Gilgamesh came from) and the temples are violently destroyed. This would apear to be the beginning of monotheism and it is a pattern we've seen repeated across Europe. The adoption of monotheism is never peaceful.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","06:15 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","3"

I'm just so thankful that you have come along to help me. How could I ever argue against creationist nonsense without you? Thank you so much! Exactly correct. In fact, not many creationists claim that the entire geologic column was produced by the flood. However, none of them can point out, at any location, the bottom of the flood deposit, or the top of the flood deposit. These should be evident. I see I jumped the gun. That was well stated. I've done this calculation several times. I even saved it for some years. I guess I threw it away. At any rate, your calculations are quite conservative. As I recall, it would require about 4 times the total water on earth to cover the mountains, and my calculations were on the conservative side. So the question still is, where did the water come from and where did it go. OK. That's probably correct. I did the calculations in cubic kilometers. True. But even worse, even if there were some unknown mechanism to cause such movement, it would generate heat. The heat generated by the creation of the mountains of the world would be more than enough to reduce the entire surface to molten lava. Add to that the fact that the condensation of the ""vapor canopy"" would release enough heat to boil all of the water on earth. The flood did not last 40 days - it rained for 40 days. The flood lasted for a bit over a year. However, I think that you need to rethink your algae bloom scenario. Above you state that algae are the oxygen producers, and now you state that they remove the oxygen. Make up our mind. But thank god that you have come to rescue us from these wise, intelligent, educated, and lucid creationists. Ah. More heat. Just what creationists need. Yet more heat. However, creationists deny that there are any sign of meteor or comet impact. That is one of the Hovendites favorite arguments. If the earth is old, then why aren't there craters like on the moon? The craters on the moon were caused, of course, by the battle between Satan and St. Michael (really! so said John Morris of the ICR). OK. However, in another thread you talked about ""proof"" of science. Talking about ""proof"" and science in the same sentence is pretty much a creationist thing. When one asks for or claims proof of a scientific theory, it is a pretty good sign that we are dealing with a scientific illiterate. Science does not prove, it explains.

I have yet to meet a creationists who used a honest argument, granetd many are ignorant but many are massive frauds who betray and abandon the teachings of Jesus. I guess the more you talk about him and the related issues the less you have to act like him eh? They are conservative for a single reason. The Earth's land is not the same altitudes. Some places are extremely high, some lower then sea level. There's no way I could figure it out correctly. However, sealevel is uniform and it makes up 70% of the surface area anyways. Simply proving that if if the oceans necessary requirements are ridiculous is enough. The extra 30% is just a extra kick in the ribs, unnecessary. It was magic water! not the alchohol kind and God snapped his fingers and it all happened!, pardon me while I laugh so loudly the creationists in the 1400s can hear me Well, then I'd have to convert everest to kilometers. I live in the US. Metric is alien. haahh. True, not to mention the energy released from that much water falling, which apparently comes out to something like 6 inchs a minute for 40 days and night straight. 6 inches a MINUTE! Sick, and that's apply the total earth's surface, so it's really more as my calcs have excluded the earth's land surface that would need to be covered by water. The flood did not last 40 days - it rained for 40 days. The flood lasted for a bit over a year. Gotcha. Well, they actually do both. Remember algae produces energy through photosynthesis but like all other plants, consumes oxygen as well. My point is such a massive growth would remove huge amounts of oxygen initially killing everything. Sure they would eventually replace it as algae died off, but it wouldn't matter then. Are you serious? How do they explain away the iridium layers in addition to the fossils that no longer appear once such layers appear in the geological record? And aren't they forgetting that the moon has no atmosphere or life to degrade the impact craters and cover them with plants and etc? But you need proof to back up a explantion.

In science, our acceptance is always tentative - which is not to say in doubt. It's just that in order to prove a scientific hypothesis it would be necessary to examine every case in every place in every time that the hypothesis might apply. We can't do that, so we can't ""prove"" an hypothesis correct. Of course, an hypothesis is just a guess, based on experience and/or intuition. From that hypothesis we make a prediction of an observation that must necessarily be true if the hypothesis is correct. We then devise a test or experiment to test the prediction. If we observe the predicted phenomena, then we have supported the hypothesis. With enough severe testing our hypothesis may become a theory. However, at least in principle, there may exist conditions somewhere under which our theory will not hold. It has happened before. Take Newton's theory of gravitation. They held under all possible cases for 200 years or so. By your judgement, Newton's theory was proven. However, Einstein found conditions under which Newton's theories were wrong. So Newtonian gravitation was amended to take relativity into consideration. Then again the theories of gravitation were amended to account for quantum mechanics. Newtonian physics became a special case in the larger theory. Se what I mean? Theories are explanations that have been supported to the extent that it would be foolish not to grant them provisional acceptance.

Perhaps I should have used evidence rather then proof no? The fundemental problem with explaning that to creationists is that they immediately interpret it as science can't back anything because the basis of it is tentative rather then rationally realize what normal people do: that science is improves based upon new evidence. Then they go into the bull**** claims about how their specific religion's dogma hasn't changed (falsely of course) and the circle starts all over again, it is ultimately futile gesture. Still I think you got hung over my interchangable use of proof and evidence. There is always something new to learn.","pandion","230549","That would have been better. In fact, it is even more telling as a criticism of creationism that there is no evidence, much less ""proof."" That's true too. But such claims always give a good laugh, especially since modern creationism arose in the 20th century. As long as you understand that them my point is moot. Maybe it is because I have struggled in teaching the concept to students that I react to ""science has been proved"" statements. I certainly jump all over creationists who ask for proof of scientific theories. They don't understand that it is theoretical that the earth orbits the sun, that hydrogen fusion is the source of the energy from the sun, that gravity (always called a law by creationists) is only a good guess (hypothesis) at this point as far as science knows. Some of the oldest, most strongly supported and stringently tested theories in science are evolutionary theories.
