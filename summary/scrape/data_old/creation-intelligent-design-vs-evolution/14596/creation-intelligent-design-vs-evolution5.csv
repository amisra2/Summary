As he just said on another thread, he's an Objectivist, i.e., a disciple of Ayn Rand's philosophy. I grant you, the argumentative styles are similar!

"12-11-2010","14596",5,"Freedom","418889","A conversation whose only practical purpose is peer support to ignore my arguments. With the mob, the individual no longer feels the need to substantiate claims, echos of barbaric past where might made right. [Matthew:] Objectivism is something of a cult. Ah the logic professor, evidenced by the fact that he will let a statement's implications speak for themselves instead of committing the fallacy himself. [Matthew:] Objectivism is something of a cult. [Matthew:] I am perfectly willing to acknowledge that all these ""failures of vision"" may be my fault alone. But truthfully, I really don't think so. I don't think you're being clear, even though I know that you think so, and I know you're trying hard to be as clear as possible for me. ...You are willing to acknowledge that not understanding my arguments may be a 'failure of vision' and may be your fault. [Matthew:] I am perfectly willing to acknowledge that all these ""failures of vision"" may be my fault alone. But truthfully, I really don't think so. I don't think you're being clear, even though I know that you think so, and I know you're trying hard to be as clear as possible for me. I will continue to claim that my arguments on IC have never been defeated for there is no reason to think otherwise. After writing what you have written could you expect anyone to honestly believe that given the chance your little collective would not throw me off a college campus?","Matthew","418895","Because those arguments have been refuted, yet you don't see it. It's no different than the claim you make about the rest of us, that you have defeated all of our views, but we don't see it. Who's saying we're right because we've got the numbers on our side? I think -- and I imagine the rest will agree -- that our arguments and yours wrong, quite independently of whoever accepts them or doesn't. What's the fallacy? Its a statement, and a I stand by it. Objectivism displays numerous features of cults, right down to the excommunication of heretics, as perpetrated by Rand herself. Yup, it may be. But-- to repeat -- ""truthfully, I really don't think so."" See, I think that I won our debate, long ago, which is why I didn't feel any need to keep beating a dead horse. It all boiled down to semantics, as I saw it: evolution can ""produce"" (to use an incredibly vague term) the features of a species, via the combined action of mutation and natural selection. I continue to think that the case you're making boils down to semantics: are we (or the public) confusing ""evolution"" and ""mutation?"" are we talking about individuals first gaining new features, or about later generations of an entire population gaining new features relative to earlier generations? Etc, etc. As I saw it, it's not that your argument gets defeated: it's that the entire problem you're arguing about just dissolves once subjected to scrutiny. And... ...you are of course entitled to disagree. But that doesn't mean I have to say that your disagreement is well-founded. Who would throw you off a college campus, and why? Objectivism is a philosophy, albeit not a well-informed one. It's failings are a topic for another thread, but I assure you, those mistakes are a more than sufficient reason to explain why there are almost no representatives of Objectivism in philosophy departments. (For a single example of the sorts of gross errors I'm talking about, look at Leonard Peikoff's essay on ""The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy."" Then look at W.V.O. Quine's essay ""Two Dogmas of Empiricism"" on the same about two decades earlier, and examine the history of that essay's influence. Then ask yourself, could anyone familiar with even just the recent history of the field, make the kinds of claims that Peikoff makes? The answer is clear: no. But I digress.) Similarly, Intelligent Design is a biological view, but not one that the overwhelming majority of biologists believe is supported by empirical evidence or sound argument. And that is why it gains no traction in biology departments. Do such exclusions represent some form of conspiracy? of mob rule or collective thinking? Unless one wants an anything-goes, completely relativistic approach, I daresay not. So you might not get into a philosophy or biology department. But if you wanted to hold these views, and they had no bearing on whatever your chosen field happens to be -- not philosophy or biology, I'm quite willing to guess -- why would that be a problem?","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","10:07 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","68"

I don't recall entering into any debate with you on this subject, I merely pointed you to the fact that there are Practical Applications that can prove Evolution over creation.

I may post something relevant to an argument that I catch the drift of from quotes cited in the posts of those I don't have on Ignore, but to elevate that to me having debated that person (and then, as he apparently imagines, slinking off in ""defeat"") is the height of arrogance and self-delusion.

"12-11-2010","14596",5,"Freedom","418907","Well I didn't ask for 'prove over creation' just practical applications. Could you name some practical applications of evolution?","Xcaliber","418908","Post #52 You asked for Practical Applications, I posted several. You never said elaborate, explain or otherwise, simply Post some Practical Applications. Then you stated in another post that I had "" Debated"" you .. I ask again how is this a debate. You asked , And I realize the question was not aimed at me, but I was reading this topic and when I saw the post it sounded like you thought it was impossible to apply evolution to every day life, so I made it a point to show you that you were perhaps wrong. I didn't write the article I only posted a few excerpts from it. I have read the topic and it doesn't seem like anyone surrendering to you on the subject, but more like they got tired of repeating the same answers that you refuse to believe or acknowledge. If I was a mediator over this debate I would not call you the victor, looks more like a dead subject to me.

"12-11-2010","14596",5,"Freedom","418907","That was kind of my point. I was saying you were using peer to peer agreement to validate your withdrawals despite the fact that you believe I am wrong.

Well Ok, but I don't really consider any of the things posted to be applications of irrational evolution. If you were merely directing me to the article, thank you. I don't remember doing that. Yes, that is exactly what I was thinking; I don't even believe it's useful for learning biology. Hehe, they may surely be quiting because they are tried of repeating themselves, but I assure you I am tired of that as well. Find any answer which you believe I refused to believe or acknowledge and I will justify either my ignorance or find the answer.
