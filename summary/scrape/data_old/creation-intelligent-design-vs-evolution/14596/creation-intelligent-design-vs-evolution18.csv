Ripskar - that is ultimately the case, however freedom is claiming that IC has always been a stand alone argument with no connection to ID. as much as i hate sounding like an IDer, the argument of IC is used to support ID. it fails, as the argument itself fails, but ID supporters still use it.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","05:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","256"

They got that right.","Xcaliber","419602","First of all why not call them what they are.. ID'ers = Creationists. Anything a Creationist finds that can defeat evolution he/she will claim that it supports their belief. You say that IC defeats Evolution and that they got that right, So that means if Evolution is not possible then Creation is the only other explanation for life. Which in turn means that If IC can defeat Evolution then it MUST support Intelligent design. Intelligent Design= Creation, you can't really believe there is any difference. So if you believe in your own mind that IC defeats Evolution, as you imply in the above quote, then IC does in fact support ID.. which is Really just another way to say Creation. So are you a creationist or an Evolutionist? you can spin it however you like but you can only be one or the other, there is no in between.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","08:13 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","258"

The choice between two wrongs should not be made.","Xcaliber","419608","You are Wrong, Intelligent Design implies a creator, whether that be some alien being or a supernatural invisible man it implies a Creator. Creationists came up with the term intelligent design in an attempt to introduce creation into the realm of science so they could in effect teach ""Creation"" in schools. You can make your claim until you're blue but it doesn't change reality. I don't have to. When discussing the subject of Life and how it exists we are left with two options. We either evolved as evolutionists believe or we were created by some higher being. Play your little word games if you want, it doesn't change this fact either. You're either a Creationist or an Evolutionist, there is no in between. So you are saying that both Evolution and Creation are wrong? I would love to hear your explanation of Life without involving either a creator or Evolution.. And before you go trying to use IC as a stand alone explanation for life don't bother. Anyone with half a brain knows that IC is not a stand alone explanation. you're just being ridiculous and twisting words to fit your position, but the facts are obvious.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","10:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","260"

ID'ers DO believe that if evolution is proven false then it means that ID is true, but they are wrong. If evolution was somehow proven wrong, that still wouldn't make ID or creationism true. That's the false dichotomy. It is assuming there are only 2 options when that is not the case. I understand what everyone is saying, that every ID proponent uses IC, and that IC was created for ID, and they are inherently linked... but that doesn't change the fact that IC can not support ID. Period. It is a logical fallacy to state otherwise. That is Freedom's whole point, as pointless and unimportant as that point is. This whole thread has turned into a XXXXXXX contest where nobody is willing to give any ground and go on for pages over a pretty dumb argument. If Freedom says he supports IC but not ID, that's that. You have to take him at his word. It doesn't matter if he's the only one ever who holds that view. You aren't going to get him to say he's a creationist (and I doubt he will every give away his beliefs because he doesn't want to be lumped into a group and have that stigma attached to him... even if he already has it). I honestly think this whole argument would be over if Bennedict/Xcaliber would admit that IC can't logically support ID and Freedom would just admit that IC is a position created for ID by ID'ers (even if he doesn't support ID personally).","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","10:49 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","261"
"12-22-2010","14596",18,"Freedom","419612","A new name was established because the existence of those who reject reason was harming the case of those who didn't. I too do not see any justification for the difference based solely on the words. Create and design are roughly equivalent. I am simply using the words as they are used. Creationists are trying to fit science with the bible and throwing out what facts that cannot compact. IDrs are investigating the possibility that evidence for a designer exists. It is hardly a wonder that such differentiation is so blurred since both evolutionist and creationist work hard to bring back IDrs to the creation camp. (the creationist to regain thinkers who might be taken seriously and the evolutionist to continue using creationist against IDrs.) Yes, evolution because it is incapable of explaining what it claims to explain (not that there is insufficient evidence if it was capable), and creation(id) for the inverse reason, it would be capable of explanation but there is no evidence. I don't have one. You enter a debate without the slightest clue what you are talking about. What gives you the insane idea that IC is even a proposed explanation for life? It is not an explanation it is not a theory. For the last time IC is an analysis and an argument. It analyses evolution. I never claimed IC wasn't created for ID, bennedict and xcaliber have claimed that IC can support ID though.","Xcaliber","419619","a new name was established to attempt to qualify creation as Science, because upon trying to use the legal system to establish Creation in science classes failed at every attempt. Investigating the possibility by attempting to prove Evolution is not Science, the premise that a creator is involved simply makes them CREATIONISTS, with a different name. There's more than one name that Creationists are using these days. Ok tell me then, what is the difference between Creation and intelligent Design? Is there not a CREATOR involved in both?.. I believe there are a lot of Evolution Scientists who would disagree.. I didn't think you would. I never claimed to be a Scientist. And YOU gave me the impression that you though IC can stand alone. No, IC attempts to discredit Evolution, big difference from analyzing . The discussion concerns Creation vs. Evolution. For the Purpose of THIS conversation from Behe's as well as others Standpoint, IC can/and Has been used to support Intelligent Design. Speaking outside the realm of this Discussion and stepping into the real world I will agree that IC cannot support ID.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","01:05 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","263"

"12-22-2010","14596",18,"None","None","None","Databed","419639","I think Freedom has a point. IC by itself does not necessarily lead one to ID. The problem is that IC is by itself very weak. It doesn't hold much water unless you have a bunch of creationists holding their fingers over the holes to keep it from all spewing out as the real scientists are shooting BB guns. Therefore, the only reason a person would support IC is to guard their creationism from attack. The only reason IC is still around is ID. IC is totally dependent on ID for its very existence. I think more than anything ID supports IC and not the other way around.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","08:56 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","266"
"12-22-2010","14596",18,"Freedom","419645","Excellent, then you may now rescind your statements about what I must be.","Xcaliber","419656","Don't think so. You have stated you don't support Evolution. You have stated you are not a Creationist. That leaves only a few choices, and since you haven't really established exactly where you stand or what you call yourself I'm assuming that you fall under one of the other "" Creation"" Categories. If you are attempting to say that any of the other names used do not fall under Creationist you are sadly mistaken. If you believe in any way, shape, or form that the explanation for life involves a Creator, whether it be Alien or Supernatural then YOU ARE A CREATIONIST. So Until you clue everyone in on exactly what you think you are I will not rescind my statement and will continue to place you with Creationists ...","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","12:19 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","268"
