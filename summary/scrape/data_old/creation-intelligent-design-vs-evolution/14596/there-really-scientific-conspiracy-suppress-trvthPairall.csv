IC is an argument used by ID advocates to support the claims made by ID. so, we can conclude that IC is a pseudo-scientific creationist argument, if thats what you want me to say, but all this is ridiculous. if you dont want me to call you a creationist, substantiate your claim that IC has nothing to do with ID. so far, you have not.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","04:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","145"

In case you forgot, 'this all' started when it was claimed that I must be a creationist because espouse IC. 'this all' is about whether or not that is the case. The only way that could be the case is if IC forced via logic any who accept it to the conclusion of creationism. Which means the crucial premise that will decide 'all this' is whether or not one can support ID with IC. and my claim was that it cannot be. lol","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","05:00 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","119"
"02-02-2011",2,"14596","318","Xcaliber","423615","Science and religion cannot Coexist in the same realm. If a person accepts that Evolution is real then by default they must object to a Creator. Evolution is based on scientific studies that have proven over and over how Human life as well as every living thing evolved over hundreds of millions of years. Most religious people I have ever known rely on the fact that Science cannot prove the non existance of GOD. But on the other side of that Religion cannot produce evidence that God does exist. There is Not one single shred of Scientific Evidence to support the fact of a GOD.. in my opinion this lack of Evidence over the period of millions of years is enough to believe that GOD does not exist. Religions are now coming out in "" support"" of Evolution. But they are still attempting to include a Creator as the Base of the existance of Life. Saying"" God created the First Cell and then Evolution took over "" is still adhering to the belief that GOD created us. This also goes against the Dogma of many religions. I believe it's all just another ploy by religious organizations to attempt to get GOD included in school study. If they can somehow Connect their "" GOD"" to evolution and make it stick then we can go back to teaching our school children Fairy Tales and Myths. All a Person need do is use a tiny bit of rational thought mixed with a dash of logic and they will pretty much figure out on their own that GOD is imaginary . No, Science and Religion will never Coexist, it's one or the other and in this day and age it looks like Science is winning the battle.","Bennedict","423632","thats where i partially disagree with you, Xcal. there are plenty of good evolutionists, evolutionists who teach evolution, who fight against creationism, who do research, who help the theory along... who also believe in a God. is this hypocritical? i think so, on the religious side. but i really cannot complain, these people are excellent scientists and evolutionists - among the best we have. their contributions to science far outweigh their mere hypocricy of a religious belief. ""do science and religion co-exist?"" yes, rarely and with a very unstable relationship. i think the question should be ""should science and religion co-exist?"" i dont think so. religion should stay out of science's hair and let it do it's job... science's job, on the other hand is to discover mysteries, religion which of course is a mystery. so i think religion should not interfere with science, and science should be allowed to do it's job, which does mean exploring topics which were ""already explained"" by religion - sometimes turning up a contrary conclusion. that's a good thing that that happens, and i think the few theistic scientists would agree.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","05:35 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","221"

I understand where you're coming from, I just don't see it that way. Like you said, the purpose of science is to explain mysteries. Evolution is one of those mysteries and there are religious Scientists who have done great work in the field. But for me the real mystery is the Origin of Life. As long as religion stands in the way I personally don't believe we will ever really know, we may not either way. A religious person may now believe in evolution , and they may even speak out against Creationism, but they still believe there is an imaginary being in the sky watching over us as we move through life. Many of those same "" Scientists "" when asked where they came from will still say "" GOD ""... So they are not really scientists in my opinion. And then there is the faction that have jumped on board with Evolution so they can mix with the reality of the world. I think that they honestly believe this will help them one day push ""God"" back into our schools.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","08:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","212"
