"12-15-2010","14596",9,"Freedom","419086","You are moving the goal posts, that one cannot support ID with IC i.e. they have no logical connection is all I have claimed. Irreducible complexity (IC) is a pseudoscientific argument by proponents of intelligent design that certain biological systems are too complex to have evolved from simpler, or ""less complete"" predecessors, through natural selection acting upon a series of advantageous naturally-occurring, chance mutations.The argument is central to intelligent design, and is rejected by the scientific community, which overwhelmingly regards intelligent design as pseudoscience.[3] Irreducible complexity is one of two main arguments intended to support intelligent design, the other being specified complexity. Biochemistry professor Michael Behe, the originator of the term irreducible complexity, defines an irreducibly complex system as one composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning"". These examples are said to demonstrate that modern biological forms could not have evolved naturally. Evolutionary biologists have shown that such systems can in fact evolve, and Behe's examples are considered to constitute an argument from ignorance. In the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial, Behe gave testimony on the subject of irreducible complexity. The court found that ""Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large.Nonetheless, irreducible complexity continues to be cited as an important argument by creationists, particularly intelligent design proponents.","Xcaliber","419101","Good Grief you can't be serious. Bennedict has pretty much raped and destroyed any argument you have presented and yet you still insist that you are right... That is laughable to say the least.. With one stroke of the keyboard I found this... Irreducible complexity - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Now I have admitted I am by no means a scientist, But even me, with my scientifically uneducated brain can deduce from this statement the original intention of the creation of the IC theory. You refuse to admit that you are a creationist, that's your right. However, when you claim to support The theory of IC, which is in FACT the engine that drives the theory of ID Which falls under the Creationism Umbrella then I have to wonder as I'm sure others to at the extent of your sanity. Back on Topic... Theistic evolution,Intelligent Design,Progressive creationism,Gap creationism, Young Earth creationism all fall under the umbrella of Creationism. If one supports either one of these categories their base belief is that we were CREATED by a supernatural intelligent life form. These people are what we Humans know as ""Creationists"" Science and more specifically the Theory Of Evolution refutes the Idea that we were created by a supernatural imaginary deity in the sky in any way, shape , or form. So.. Creationists cannot Prove a single one of their Theories through the use of SCIENCE. In order to do so you would have to be able to build a Model and test your theories to either prove or dispute said theory. Science can, has, and still does support the Theory of Evolution through many such models. Now before you go telling me to post some of those Models as proof I'll tell you now, I am not a scientist so if you want proof you'll have to just take my word for it, or Google something. as to the topic of this post, If there is any Conspiracy between Creationists and Evolutionists it is coming from the side of Creation. I would think that in most cases anyone who believes in the Creation Myth would most likely be of a religious Nature, more Specifically a Christian. Their own Bible is unsure on the Matter of Creation as you can find in the First and Second Book of Genesis. The only "" Evidence "" that a Creationist has to "" Prove"" Creation is the Holy Book that Christians Cherish above all. Since Darwin and his Theory the Christian Religion has launched a conspiracy to Dis-prove or de-bunk Darwin's Theory. They are so adamant in their believe they go to great lengths to try and prove evolution is not real, Like breaking up their Creationist views into specific categories like the ones above, so as to confuse the general population as to who believes what. Your Posts in this thread , Whether you admit it or not, Categorize you as a "" Creationist. You can sit on the fence all you want and use IC or ID or whatever to ""Claim"" you are not but just like every other post you have made you are wrong. So in closing I will say Yes, there is a Conspiracy. A conspiracy by Creationists such as yourself to devalue the Theory of Evolution in hope of saving your imaginary God from becoming Extinct.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","12:05 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","127"
"12-15-2010","14596",9,"None","None","None","Stonewall","419109","It seems to me that this debate is pointless. Bennedict is correct on what he is arguing, which is that IC is used to support ID, and that the two are connected (in the sense that every famous ID advocate claims IC is true, and every famous IC advocate is also an ID advocate). They say that since something could not have evolved, it must have been created. Freedom isn't really arguing against that. I don't know that he hasn't changed his argument in the past, but in his recent posts he is simply saying that disproving evolution doesn't prove that it was intelligently designed. Both of you are right. ID proponents do claim IC to support their theory (and because of this publicity, IC and ID are linked to each other), but it is a false dichotomy and therefore not actually evidence for ID, just evidence against evolution (even though IC has been 'busted' many times, so it is not evidence at all).","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","12:42 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","128"

Well Of the 20 or so sites and web pages I visited I found not 1 to support your position concerning IC. I did find tons of stuff like this though... Irreducible Complexity Demystified Behe's argument that IC cannot evolve is central to ID , so it deserves our attention. His method is to divide evolution into what he calls 'direct', which he defines in a special way, and 'indirect' (everything else). He finds that direct evolution of IC is logically impossible, and indirect evolution of IC is too improbable. The argument against 'direct' evolution of IC is contained in this long sentence right after the definition: lmao.. give up dude, you have lost this round .","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","01:31 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","135"
