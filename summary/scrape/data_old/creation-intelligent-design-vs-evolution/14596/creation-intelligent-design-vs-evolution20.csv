"12-23-2010","14596",20,"Freedom","419765","It is not.","Xcaliber","419781","In the 1920's Here in the United States we had Some Christian Fundamentalist Movements that insisted on a literalist interpretation of the ""Genesis Creation Narrative"" and likewise opposed the Idea of Human Evolution. These groups succeeded in getting the teaching of Evolution banned in the United States public Schools. In the Mid 1960's a group calling themselves"" Young Earth Creationists"" began promoting the teaching of what they called "" Scientific Creationism"" using Flood Geology in public school science classes to support a purely literal reading of the Genesis account. Now here is where it gets Dicey.. In the Case of Daniel vs. Waters (1975) the Judge ruled that teaching creationism in public schools contravened the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and the content of public schools teachings was subsequently stripped of overt biblical references and renamed "" Creation Science"" .. Then in the case of Edwards vs. Aguillard (1987) the court ruled that creation science similarly contravened the Constitution and all references to "" Creation"" in school textbooks were changed to refer to "" Intelligent Design . These Creationists then took the term"" Intelligent Design"" and once again re-named themselves. They began claiming Intelligent Design to be a "" New"" Scientific Theory and began again an attempt to introduce "" Creation"" into our schools by masking it under Intelligent Design. another case.. The case of Kitzmiller vs. Dover ( 2005) the Court Ruled that Intelligent Design is NOT science, and contravenes the constitutional restriction on teaching religion in Public School Classes. I believe by now you get the Idea... Now to the reply to your post... I originally called you a creationist, which you seem to take offense to. You have stated that you do not support Evolution.. Yet you are not a Creationist... You have asked me to rescind my statement where I called you a Creationist. I have replied that I Will Not.. You can continue to change the term or whatever you wish, but a black kettle is black, a blue sky is blue , and a Creationist no matter what you want to call it is a Creationist. Currently the debate in this specific Topic is Creationism vs. Evolution. If you do not support one then by default you support the other. Call yourself God, it doesn't matter because at the end of the day if your position is that along the line somewhere there is a Creator involved then you are a Creationist. I simply stated that YOU should not be ashamed to call yourself a Creationists. There is no hidden meaning in my statement. There is no Sarcasm, or Ill feelings meant by my statement. Be who you are. And why worry over me calling you a Creationist?.. I'm just one Person among many who formed my opinion based on the evidence presented in this thread. You have not given anyone reason to believe you are not a Creationist?.. I hope that is clear enough now. Most of this information was found at Wiki.. the definition was from the Dictionary I have...","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","01:47 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","288"

It is perfectly obvious that you nor anyone else can or has supported such an assertion and therefore there must be an ulterior motive; I am sure that motive is to escape the responsibility of meeting my arguments with logic. So annoyance or frustration is a better description of my emotions about hearing such accusations.... again. So it is, despite that I am arguing reason vs evolution. The very claim you just made is why I don't want to go to a forum with a predefined debater castes. So you did not mean ONE should not be ashamed to be a creationist, if you say yes why am I special? If you say: no you did mean it; the only conclusion that can be drawn is that you find nothing shameful in creationism. If I didn't worry about the truth I would never sign up to places like this. Rofl, really should just shutup it is clear that reason will not sway you but I keep getting kicks out of this sad delusion of yours. So let's just read into this section of your post. I have not given anyone reason to believe I am not a creationist.... You know what Xcaliber, I think you are a druid; clearly if this isn't the truth you will argue for however long it takes to prove to everyone that you aren't right? Furthermore, since you haven't given any evidence that you are a druid I think you must be ashamed of being a druid. You shouldn't hide things like this, be proud of what you believe. Returning to sanity now I have given you one perfect reason to believe I am not a creationist. I have said I am not. I hope so too.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","02:11 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","289"

By the way. there is no reasonable argument against Evolution because it would assume a Creator... Unless you have a New theory about Life and how it happened?... Clearly you don't and you are just trying to do what other CREATIONISTS have done for years .","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","02:29 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","290"
