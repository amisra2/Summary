I hear religious people all the time say they know God is real because "" they can see the results in their Lives"".. They will not admit that it's possible and highly probable that they would see the exact same result without God or "" Faith"" in their lives. I'll give you an example... Suppose a religious person goes to start his car in the morning and it won't start. As he pumps the gas and gets ready to try again he says a little prayer, and suddenly his car starts. A religious person will immediately give GOD credit for starting his car. All those little mundane prayers like this example are credited to an invisible being that doesn't exist. You see NFL football players pointing to the sky and thanking GOD after scoring a touch down. It's because of this kind of thing that Religion has Given People the Misconception that GOD is affecting their lives. All this unnecessary grand standing for the sake of a GOD that only exists in mans imaginations. Personally I don't care if YOU or anyone else chooses to believe. I am not attacking anyone in particular I despise religion for what it is and what it does to the human mind. When I had major back surgery 8 years ago I didn't give GOD credit for saving my legs, nor my Life. I gave credit to the Doctors, where Credit should have gone. In my opinion human kind will never progress into the future as long as we allow religion to guide our thoughts. Man is perfectly capable of thinking for himself, he has survived on his own without GOD long before religion reared it's ugly head into this world, and In my opinion we will when the world wakes up and realizes that God is Imaginary. If you choose to believe that is YOUR choice, but when religious people try to bend the will of others that's where I will always take a stand.","Bennedict","423711","correct.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","03:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","331"

They never stop to think how many of those who died were doing exactly the same thing. Or even how many of their fellow survivors were doing no such thing.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","06:19 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","333"
