"12-18-2010","14596",13,"MrWriteLA","419359","C'mon, Freedom. I've had you on ""ignore"" for months, but I get the gist of it. It's obvious that here you've been reduced to nothing but a source of condescendinging amusement. Am I right, or am I right? The horse you're flogging is beyond dead, it's friggin decayed. Hey, it's the nature of the beast, forums like this. Look at Easyrider, who's become the religious joke everyone--quite rightly, too--heaps scorn upon . You bucking for his spot... the religious loon every one takes potshots at? Didn't think so. If you really, sincerely, truly believe what you've been posting here, go to a moderated site like EvC Forum or Evolution Fairytale Forum , and show us all up by engaging THEM in a ""formal"" debate."" They'll be more than happy to oblige you. And after you've displayed your mettle with the big boys, you can come back here with a plethora of triumphant links under your arm and make us eat our atheistic, rational humanistic words, whereby we'll all bow down to the superiority of your fallacious, irrational ""arguments.""","Bennedict","419386","wow. beautifully put, and so true. evolution fairytale forum??? im intrigued. anyone want to come with me to carpet bomb them with evolution rationality?

Characterizing themselves as presenting an ""honest"" or ""open"" debate -- even just a real ""debate"" -- is as dis honest as could be.

At first glance it looked like something equivalent to EvC, but I have to admit I hadn't really checked it out.

Does that mean myself, and/or Easyrider have ""dispatched"" them? I know, atheists leave because they just get tired of it all, but religious people always leave because they've been defeated.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","07:36 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","192"
