ID is NOT creationism. complete change of heart. one question: have you ever been wrong? of course you have, but do you recognize this?","Freedom","420029","You have not I have read above. My posts are equally lengthy as most are short depending on the need. You may have noticed that most of my posts are merely responding to finger paint reinventions of previously identified fallacies, I am not going to write speeches for everyone. lol, what change of heart? I asked for your definition not mine. Yes to both. Here's a question, when should one decide that one is wrong?","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","01:29 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","301"

"01-08-2011","14596",21,"Larni","411589","I have heard and read of secularists and scientists and Satanists conspiring to use science to undermine the validity of biblical creation. We see on the net multiple examples of protests that ID should be recognised as a real science and how people who espouse ID sympathies get blackballed and the like. Is this really happening?","kowalskil","421613","Most people are neither professional scientists nor professional theologians. Some of them believe only in what theologians say, while others belive only in what scietists say. Some accept the authority of both and some are indifferent to both. Peaceful coexistence, between science and faith, is threaten by those who attack deism pretending to be scientists, and by those who atack science pretending to be theologians. It is also threatened by politicians who exploit peoples beliefs (to promote wars and revolutions). Many scientists and many theologians believe that peaceful coexistence between these two fields is possible, at least in principle. Methods of validation in these field are very different (authority of holy books versus reproducible results from experiments and observations). Methodology of validation used by theologians does not apply to material world and methodology used by scientists does not apply to spiritual world. That is what should be recognized by all. Mutual respect is possible and desirable. That is what I think.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","05:37 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","307"

Mutual respect is possible and desirable. That is what I think.","Freedom","421951","That's me What is not recognized is that both attain validity from primary philosophical beliefs, it is not the methodologies or in general the assertions of science or religion that establish the dichotomy between them but the premises on which those methods are based. The epistemology of religion and science are respectively faith and reason . Reason is the standard by which all science is conducted and by which a method is valued for it's objective relation to reality . A fully qualified yet concise definition of science would be similar to: the active or passive production of facts about the natural world through reason. Faith is the standard by which all religion exists and by which an idea can be accepted on the ' virtue ' that it lacks objective proof . I have had ample exposure to various religions and the best answer (best being totally relative to the other absurd ones) to 'why doesn't god reveal himself' is 'if he did then everyone would believe in him and without faith they wouldn't be tempted to lose it'. There is a basic epistemological dichotomy between faith and reason because reason makes no room for other modes of knowledge. If it is not a rational conclusion it is a irrational conclusion. Therefore any means of gaining knowledge is to use a common phrase 'either for reason or against it', and one need hardly ask if faith is rational when the very fact that it need not be rational is always the first and key bulwark of defense in mystical apologetics. Reason doesn't just exclude faith, imagination, emotional need translated to self delusion; anything that is not explicitly rational is doomed to be irrational. If and only if something can be supported by sound or cogent argument can it be rational, therefore all that is supported by sound or cogent argument is rational AND anything that is not is irrational. Faith is not rational. Anyone who takes some things on faith but requires evidence for others is in a state of philosophical contradiction. He/She is necessarily creating and modifying their standard of knowledge on the fly most likely based on personal and social emotional needs; and that is the best case scenario, some depraved souls take everything on faith and simply accept scientific knowledge and religious knowledge as various flavours of the same box of chocolates.... packaged under the name of 'lots of people believe this so it must be true'. ""Methodology of validation used by theologians does not apply to material world and methodology used by scientists does not apply to spiritual world"" I, however; certainly recognize this. Methodology of validation used by theologians does not apply to material world - which would include our material existance, which would include our lives and are beliefs. Tacking material onto phrases is a pathetic trick, it merely means 'not spiritual' which is to mean 'real'. methodology used by scientists does not apply to spiritual world - nor to star trek world or star wars world. Sometime in your life you may meet a fellow who makes you want to say 'you know that's just a movie right?'. Do you ever feel like saying 'you know that's just a book right?' Neither respectable nor desirable; look around you, do you see an endless parade of wars and disputes in our history? I will tell you what is causing them, and it's not what most think; it's too much compromise not too little. Disagreements can be swept under the carpet over a joke and some beer but they don't go away. People who have your attitude, the attitude that peace lies in the middle ground proceed entirely on the vain hope that none of these out of sight out of mind contradictions between people are ever serious enough to effect lives. All civilization has been a history of a unifying set of ideas being applied to a group via culture and law. It is not a coincidence that this has been the only case where men work together peacefully, they must agree with each other on morality or there will be war and morality requires reason .","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","12:31 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","308"

"01-11-2011","14596",21,"None","None","None","Bennedict","422047","i agree. religion and science cannot live harmoniously. religion requires faith and nothing more, science requires extensive evidence. the two are opposites. a person of faith has a hard time with science because in order to understand science, they need to be skeptical about everything that does not have evidence, and even skeptical about things that DO have evidence... and thats hard when your own spiritual lifestyle requires that you ignore all evidence and believe just because you can - or you should. some people have been able to do it, but it is rare. thats why the majority of science students or scientists are atheists. if someone believes that evidence is not required to believe something, they must not be scientifically literate, unfortunately. if someone believes that evidence IS required, they must not take a very strong religious path. in my opinion, the two should remain separate. in the world according to Bennedict, religion would not exist because people would turn to science above all other things. in real world, the religious will remain religious, and the scientific will remain intelligent... i mean scientific.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","02:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","310"

Religion and science have gotten along fine, it is people that are the problem. I can have my faith and accept science, they are not mutually exclusive. As an example we all agree that it took million of years, as we know them, to make this universe. That means that it took time, where did time come from? I think God caused it, you don't. It is not important for me to be right but it seems that the science only faction HAVE to say I am wrong yet they can't prove it.

Do you mean that without the irrationality or emotional disruption some people introduce there would be no evidence that religion and science contradict? You have your faith, do you have the ability to condemn faith in others? In the absence of evidence I shall guess, the guess shall be based on tradition, many 'wise' people making the guess along with me, and most importantly my desire for a specific type of answer. I will feel just fine about it because science does not contradict me here; how can it when there is no evidence on the matter one way or another? This is the naked nature of the thought which must exist in those who see no contradiction between reason and faith. Not important for whom? Most religions prescribe serious consequences for ignoring the spiritual aspect in life which they claim to guide. If that is so it would be important to them, and unless they are being terribly 'selfish' it would be important for other people to believe as well. History tells us that Christianity, Islam, and buddhism all find it very important to convert others. Not the least of which if you are explaining the universe with God, how can you call the most cosmic truth about the universe unimportant? Reason tells us that a lack of evidence is not evidence, an objectivist for instance would tell you that you are wrong because you can't prove it.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","10:45 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","314"
