But it was fun while it lasted.","trebor","419462","HA HA HA HA. What a laugh, there are a number of people you accused of being atheist over there that aren't. They just know science, and you don't. Just because you can't keep on topic, and ignore admin requests to stay on topic doesn't mean that it's 'controlled'. You are full of it, and people can go over to to see the how well you 'argue'. In the mean time, enjoy your vacation from there from your cool off period for not following the rules.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","08:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","196"

It is far more likely I think that anyone who opposes evolution is simply called ignorant for no other reason.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","08:21 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","197"

I would say in his defense that much of it was on topic, or at least seemed to be intended as such. To say that he was ""making no effort to address the topic"" seems to me to be unduly harsh.","marc9000","419467","Yes, yes, Haha, what a laugh. Except for my last 3 silly posts (I was disappointed I didn't get a permanent ban) I was spot on topic and you know it . One of the most sarcastic, militant atheists there even had to separate himself from the stupidity, when he posted this; (Dr Adequate / Intelligent Design forum / Does ID follow the scientific method thread / post #270) The forum director said he'd ""see me on Christmas day"". Why would I ever go back? Anything I say will be deemed off topic, and I'd be suspended again. That place is a joke. Posters here should appreciate the neutrality and low moderation of the 4forums administration.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","09:20 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","199"

Frankly, IMO, you are nuts.. and your posts show a certain .. lack of understanding.

"12-20-2010","14596",14,"Freedom","419476","So it must have been a council of admins if one person is insignificant?","Accipiter","419482","the point is that he continued to post off topic posts after the first off topic post was censored. It's got nothing to do with how many people agree or disagree it's that after the first incidence he immediately did it three more times, and NOBODY took issue with those posts and whether or not they were off topic.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","02:16 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","205"

"12-20-2010","14596",14,"Freedom","419476","So this thread for instance contains about 40 posts generally in opposition to my statements on the relationship between IC and ID. None of them make a single valid point against my position, but what good would cutting all that out do?","Xcaliber","419487","No, most of them completely XXXX away your position, you just refuse to admit it and continue to assert that you are correct.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","10:06 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","207"

In the event of something like what happened to marc occurs you people immediately begin conspiracy theory thinking to attempt to shift blame instead of acknowledging responsibility. Very typical of the faith based thinking crowd.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","10:44 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","208"
"12-20-2010","14596",14,"Freedom","419492","Yea you said that already, you just can't back it up with a simple thing like a quote from me and a quote from anyone that provides any sound||cogent contradictory reasoning to my quote. The strategy of trying to get banned? It sounds to me like he despaired of further debate after one of his on topic posts was removed. So his attempt to confuse the issue was not just leaving after he realized he was being censored for no appropriate reason? I see, so his insidious plan to get banned confused the issue by convincing everyone that there was a conspiracy to silence him?","Accipiter","419495","Man you couldn't get it if your life depended on it, no wounder your so screwed up.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","12:49 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","210"
