Sorry, the truth is the truth no matter how you try to spin it. How about now that you have been thoroughly whipped on the IC vs. ID matter let's move on to a new question?. Do you have anything else you would like to know?...","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","09:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","152"

"12-16-2010","14596",11,"Freedom","419266","My count is zero. I ask again, can one support ID with IC?","Xcaliber","419279","What you ask cannot be answered by a simple yes or no. If you believe in the Premise of IC as Behe Does then Yes, you can theoretically support ID with IC. If you have a brain and believe as many real Scientists do that IC is completely bogus then the answer to your question would be no. As far as some Creationists are concerned IC is the driving force behind ID, Like you've been told a hundred times . The Bottom line is this... No matter what Process you choose to believe , Irreducible Complexity , Intelligent Design, or otherwise at the base of it all is the Premise that a Creator was involved . Changing a few words or coming up with new ignorant Theories to Avoid being classed in the same group as Creationists is totally absurd. Here, this might give you some closure on this subject, it's getting boring. Intelligent Design?

All questions with 'can' ultimately have yes no null answers because 'can' refers to possibility which is a boolean value. Then as I said to bennedict, assume that the premise of IC is correct and try to support ID. If I am correct you will fail. That too is incorrect, I did not ask whether the premise was sound simply whether it supported something. It was a question of validity not soundness, if it were it would be phrased 'does IC support ID?'.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","12:02 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","157"

At this point, I'd advise Xcaliber, bennett, Matthew, and the other rational Arthurs here to similarly roll their eyes, gallop off with Patsy, and ignore the delusional Black Knight.","Xcaliber","419308","lmao.. more uncanny than you know...

""The Black Knight"" someone in a debate who gets their arguments chopped to bits and still claims to be the victor. you can bet all your money that Freedom is the undeniable champion of ""Black Knighting"" in every debate. so, it is my pleasure to give Freedom the ""Black Knight"" award as well as a cheque for $1 CAD to any charity of Freedom's choice (probably the discovery institute).","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","01:27 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","161"
