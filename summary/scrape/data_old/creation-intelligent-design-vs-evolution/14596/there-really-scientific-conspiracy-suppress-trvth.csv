I'm not sure what you mean by a ""secularist."" Do you mean one who denies religion, one who denies the scientific value of religion, one who is not religious, or one who does not use religion in his work because it is irrelevant? You don't explain why a scientist would even want to undermine the validity of biblical creation. Scientists propose and test explanations for observed natural phenomena. How is that anti-biblical? Do you think that scientists should declare that some observations and tested conclusions must be wrong because they are in conflict with your literal reading of a book of mythology? Of course, satanists are on the same level as creationists. They believe in mythology and folklore as TRUTH. The ""poor me"" syndrome. If anyone could actually show why ID creationism should be regarded as science, then it would be. The fact is, creation science and ID creationism start from the conclusions and then reject any scientific finding that does not fit the theology. Present some evidence of a mythical designer and he/she/it wouldn't be mythology any more. As for the blackballing of creation scientists or ID creationists, it just isn't true. There is a plethora of examples of the publication of legitimate scientific papers by creation scientists and ID creationists. But all of those papers report science that is testable. None of them propose invisible beings as explanations for real events. The fact is that papers that propose creationism and ID creationism aren't science. They don't ever propose any new science and are easily debunked. For those reasons they are generally rejected for publication by legitimate scientific journals. Creation science and ID creationism have also been rejected as science by courts. Nope. You're just paranoid. You think that just because you believe in your mythology, it must be true.

The guy was clear it was not all the spells and demons and such because they were fiction. This issue the teacher had was that it simply did not mention Yahweh at all. You have to remeber that some hard line xians see their god as such a big thing in their apprehension of reality that it is often (but not always) very difficult for them to imagine somebody apprehending reality without the concept of a god. They see a god shaped hole in that persons life that the non religious has no conception of. Anything that takes the place of that percieved god shape hole is by definition anti god. That's why to study evoultion you must totally and without question hate god and want nothing to do with it (not my position, you understand; simply the position of the hard line theist).

Evolution is a process, not an origin. I will agree that I don't have enough information to prove abiogenesis, but science does more that just prove things. It is a process of understanding and study. Same goes for the origin of the universe. Science does not try to reconcile a preconceived notion like religion does and it is not a process put in place in order to undermine religion. My point earlier was that when I prove a religious thinker wrong, I take satisfaction in it just like a would a fellow scientist who disagreed with me. We both strive for explanations. Religious thinkers think they are being picked on because their strain of thought is not even considered by a scientific thinker. This is because their style of thinking is illogical because it works from effect to cause.

"12-05-2010","14596",3,"None","None","None","Tusa","418559","Science has been elevated as the sole authority to explain the workings of the world and to decide what should and should not be taken seriously. Science determines what should be believed, what is superstitious, and what is nonsense. In a sense, science has become the self-proclaimed judge of everything. From this vaunted position, science has imposed its will on everything, and spread its tentacles into politics, religion, education, culture, medicine, law, and practically every other field. Under the rule of science, anything that is supernatural or metaphysical is often scoffed at or outright scorned. The scientific rulers have encouraged sceptics to belittle various phenomena, such as: UFO sightings, alien encounters, religious experiences, spirit communications, ghosts, astral beings, apparitions, inter-dimensional beings, reincarnation, past lives, continuation of consciousness, entity possessions, clairvoyance, clairaudience, prophecy, general psychic abilities, and anything else that does not fit neatly into scientific dogma. The elevation of science has been so effective that people are very fearful of its ridicule, scorn and rejection. Sceptics are confidently bolstered; they are proud that they alone can judge what is ridiculous and nonsense and what is true and acceptable. Sceptics are so self-assured in their positions as the judges of everything that they outwardly display an air of arrogance and contempt. Almost everything has to be subjected to the Scientific Inquisition, which is not so unlike the Spanish Inquisitions knowledge and wisdom are their victims, too often suppressed and censored by the ignorant and the arrogant. In extreme cases, the sceptics proclaim that science is never wrong! Those who study science have not always been referred to as scientists. Until the 1830s, the discipline was known as natural philosophy, and individuals who studied it called themselves natural philosophers. The change in nomenclature allowed scientists to disassociate themselves from theoretical philosophers. Science presents its cases as if they were all based upon hard, empirical evidence. This is misleading. If every scientific theory were called a philosophical concept, everyone would be on guard as to its reliability and accuracy. Whilst scientists have gathered genuine data on some subjects, and conducted experiments to determine properties and laws of physics and other disciplines, they have also extrapolated, surmised, opined, and outright guessed in many other instances to develop various scientific theories about the composition of the universe and where humans stand in relation to everything in it. The theories are presented repeatedly, and with such ardent fervour, that everyone forgets they have little or no empirical basis. Even the inconsistent theories are presented as facts. For instance, modern cosmology, which began in the 1920s, postulates the theory that the universe is expanding. From this hypothesis, cosmologists have theorised that the universe began with a big bang, a convulsive explosion. An alternative view is the steady-state theory, which asserts that the universe has no origin, but is expanding based on the continual formation of new matter. The theories are contradictory. One takes the position of convulsive evolution, while the other emphasises gradual growth and development. Scientists of today will use the premises of these contradictory theories to mix and match their particular guesses at how the universe operates. For example, Darwinian evolutionary theory requires vast time-lines to be feasible. Therefore, the Darwinian view requires that the Earth be very old and to have gradually developed. On the other hand, another scientific theory about the extinction of the dinosaurs is that a catastrophic event wiped them out. This goes to show that the accepted scientific theories are not always based on consistent premises. It is often the case in science that the convenient theory becomes the accepted theory. History has shown how many huge mistakes natural philosophers have made. The flat-Earth theory was believed for millennia, as was the theory that the Earth was the centre of the universe and everything revolved around it. Copernicus disproved the likelihood that the Earth was the centre of the universe, instead offering the alternative view that it is a subservient satellite of the sun in our solar system. Even today, most people are unaware that what Copernicus presented is a theory. As more and more evidence emerges, it becomes more and more likely that Copernicus was correct. With regard to the two main theories of the origin of the universe, they are rudimentary hypotheses that should not even be elevated to the level of theories. Yet, the big bang is presented as though it is an absolute fact; Darwin's theory of evolution is dealt with in the same manner. Many people want to accept the scientific explanation of the universe because they disbelieve the religious philosophy and dogma regarding Creation. A typical religious creation account is found in the Torah, which is part of the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. That account of creation was subjected to tremendous rigour by religious scholars and natural philosophers. It was accepted by many who went through this rigorous study that the Earth was approximately 6,000 years old. The rigour employed was referred to by many as one of the most rigorous endeavours of the pre-Renaissance era. Proponents of the 6,000 year-old Earth included Elijah, Augustine of Hippo, Bede, Thomas Aquinas and Martin Luther, among others. Even the esteemed natural philosopher, Isaac Newton, concluded that the religious scholars were essentially correct; the Earth is about 6,000 years old. Much of the 6,000 year-old Earth belief can be blamed on the King James Version of the Bible, which included annotations in the margins to put all the dates together for people to apply rigour in testing biblical dates for creation. Some extreme religious philosophers, who echoed the marginal annotations in the King James Version of the Bible, claimed that Creation occurred on Sunday at noon, on the 23rd of October, 4004 B.C. Science prides itself on employing rigour, which means that science has tested many of its theories over and over. The problem is that the rigour can be based on flawed premises, be flawed methodologically, or both. There was immense rigour applied to the geocentric model of the Earth, and it was fully accepted by religious and natural philosophers until Copernicus refuted it. Now, the same type of rigour is applied to the theory that the sun is the centre of the solar system. If, in the future, someone were to unequivocally refute the Copernican theory, all of the rigour in proving it would have to be abandoned. Such is the state of scientific discoveries that people would accept the new theory and laugh at the old. Science has presented us with the theory that carbon emissions are significant contributors to global warming. It has presented us with many scientific evaluations of the data to prove this position, and the scientific consensus is that carbon emissions must be reduced to check global warming. The raw data on which scientists have based this conclusion is not readily available; it is secreted in the United Kingdom. Some scientists have been proven to have intentionally corrupted the data base, and others have been shown to have intentionally manipulated the data to support the carbon emissions theory. Instead of scientists being aghast at the fraud, many have rallied around the theory, and asserted that the science behind the theory is good and credible because such immense rigour has been applied to the theory that it must be correct. Therefore, they argue, there is scientific proof that carbon emissions are significantly responsible for global warming and that it is critical to put a price on carbon and to pass an ETS. The geocentric model and the Creation account had equal rigour applied to them. For now, both theories are hopelessly wrong. A Scot named James Hutton devised a theory that everything on Earth is very old, and that the planet has been gradually shaped by erosion and occasionally rearranged by convulsive events. His analysis has provided the basis for dating everything on the Earth, including the planet itself. People now confidently parrot that the Earth is four billion years old, that certain dinosaurs walked the planet so many million years ago, and humans evolved into homo-sapiens so many tens of thousands of years ago, and so on. The believers claim that these dates are based upon scientific postulates, and that the results have been subjected to rigour, therefore they are correct. The hypothesis of plate tectonics describing the formation of continents has been subjected to such scientific rigour that the theory of continental drift is readily accepted and parroted by many. The hypothesis of a molten-core Earth is equally accepted, whilst the sceptical judges have scoffed at the theory of the hollow Earth. Doctors and psychiatrists who believe in metaphysical concepts and experiences should not be threatened by their respective licensing boards. Neither should lawyers or politicians be disadvantaged by acknowledging alien encounters. Psychics and those sensitive to metaphysical things should not be deemed mentally disturbed just because they can sense or see things that others do not. Although science has improved many aspects of living by providing technology in many fields, its unsubstantiated theories should be treated much like religious beliefs. There is no absolute proof or disproof of them, or they would be facts, not theories. People should not be subjected to ridicule for their beliefs just because their beliefs do not fit scientifically prescribed scrutiny.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","09:52 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","43"

I continue to think that the case you're making boils down to semantics: are we (or the public) confusing ""evolution"" and ""mutation?"" are we talking about individuals first gaining new features, or about later generations of an entire population gaining new features relative to earlier generations? Etc, etc. As I saw it, it's not that your argument gets defeated: it's that the entire problem you're arguing about just dissolves once subjected to scrutiny. And... ...you are of course entitled to disagree. But that doesn't mean I have to say that your disagreement is well-founded. Who would throw you off a college campus, and why? Objectivism is a philosophy, albeit not a well-informed one. It's failings are a topic for another thread, but I assure you, those mistakes are a more than sufficient reason to explain why there are almost no representatives of Objectivism in philosophy departments. (For a single example of the sorts of gross errors I'm talking about, look at Leonard Peikoff's essay on ""The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy."" Then look at W.V.O. Quine's essay ""Two Dogmas of Empiricism"" on the same about two decades earlier, and examine the history of that essay's influence. Then ask yourself, could anyone familiar with even just the recent history of the field, make the kinds of claims that Peikoff makes? The answer is clear: no. But I digress.) Similarly, Intelligent Design is a biological view, but not one that the overwhelming majority of biologists believe is supported by empirical evidence or sound argument. And that is why it gains no traction in biology departments. Do such exclusions represent some form of conspiracy? of mob rule or collective thinking? Unless one wants an anything-goes, completely relativistic approach, I daresay not. So you might not get into a philosophy or biology department. But if you wanted to hold these views, and they had no bearing on whatever your chosen field happens to be -- not philosophy or biology, I'm quite willing to guess -- why would that be a problem?","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","10:07 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","68"

First let me categorize them. Young Earth creationism Humans Directly created by God. Plants/animals directly created by God. Macroevolution does not occur. Earth less than 10,000 years old. Reshaped by global flood. Universe Less than 10,000 years old. Belongs to the category 'God created life and this creation is it's explaination'. Gap creationism Humans Directly created by God. Plants/animals Directly created by God. Macroevolution does not occur. Earth scientifically accepted age. Reshaped by global flood. Universe scientifically accepted age. Belongs to the category 'God created life and this creation is it's explaination'. Progressive creationism Humans directly created by God (based on primate anatomy). Plans/animals direct creation + evolution. No single common ancestor. Earth scientifically accepted age. No global flood. Universe scientifically accepted age. Belongs to the category 'God created life and this creation is it's explaination'. Intelligent Design Proponents hold various beliefs. e.g. Behe accepts evolution from primates Divine intervention at some point in the past, as evidenced by what intelligent-design creationists call ""irreducible complexity"" Some adherents claim the existence of Earth is the result of divine intervention - Scientifically accepted age Belongs to the category 'God created life and this creation is it's explaination' albeit indirectly. Theistic evolution Humans evolved from primates. Evolution from single common ancestor. Earth scientifically accepted age. No global flood. Universe scientifically accepted age. Belongs to the category 'God created life and this creation is it's explaination' (the theistic part being that god designed the universe such that evolution of us had to happen). Given that every definition of creationism falls into that category I declare the key tenet of creationism is the belief that life is explained by God creating it. Since creationism can be said to be the belief that life is explained by god creating it, it as a whole falls under the category of 'explanations for life'. Since databed claims in this paragraph that 'Freedom has been very careful not to assert any explanation for life and its complexity', that universal must include the explaination of 'god created it'. Therefore this states at least ""Freedom has been very careful not to assert that life is explained by God creating it"". Since that belief is necessary and sufficient condition to be defined as a creationist the statement ""Freedom has never asserted (supported in the sense of argument) creationism"" can be deduced. The 'leap' from ""Obviously Freedom is some form of a creationist, but he will not admit this."" to ""He is obviously a creationist"" is one of simple rearranging.","Ripskar","419065","In its broadest sense Creationist simply means believing that a deity created the universe.

"12-15-2010","14596",9,"Freedom","419086","You are moving the goal posts, that one cannot support ID with IC i.e. they have no logical connection is all I have claimed. Irreducible complexity (IC) is a pseudoscientific argument by proponents of intelligent design that certain biological systems are too complex to have evolved from simpler, or ""less complete"" predecessors, through natural selection acting upon a series of advantageous naturally-occurring, chance mutations.The argument is central to intelligent design, and is rejected by the scientific community, which overwhelmingly regards intelligent design as pseudoscience.[3] Irreducible complexity is one of two main arguments intended to support intelligent design, the other being specified complexity. Biochemistry professor Michael Behe, the originator of the term irreducible complexity, defines an irreducibly complex system as one composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning"". These examples are said to demonstrate that modern biological forms could not have evolved naturally. Evolutionary biologists have shown that such systems can in fact evolve, and Behe's examples are considered to constitute an argument from ignorance. In the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial, Behe gave testimony on the subject of irreducible complexity. The court found that ""Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large.Nonetheless, irreducible complexity continues to be cited as an important argument by creationists, particularly intelligent design proponents.","Xcaliber","419101","Good Grief you can't be serious. Bennedict has pretty much raped and destroyed any argument you have presented and yet you still insist that you are right... That is laughable to say the least.. With one stroke of the keyboard I found this... Irreducible complexity - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Now I have admitted I am by no means a scientist, But even me, with my scientifically uneducated brain can deduce from this statement the original intention of the creation of the IC theory. You refuse to admit that you are a creationist, that's your right. However, when you claim to support The theory of IC, which is in FACT the engine that drives the theory of ID Which falls under the Creationism Umbrella then I have to wonder as I'm sure others to at the extent of your sanity. Back on Topic... Theistic evolution,Intelligent Design,Progressive creationism,Gap creationism, Young Earth creationism all fall under the umbrella of Creationism. If one supports either one of these categories their base belief is that we were CREATED by a supernatural intelligent life form. These people are what we Humans know as ""Creationists"" Science and more specifically the Theory Of Evolution refutes the Idea that we were created by a supernatural imaginary deity in the sky in any way, shape , or form. So.. Creationists cannot Prove a single one of their Theories through the use of SCIENCE. In order to do so you would have to be able to build a Model and test your theories to either prove or dispute said theory. Science can, has, and still does support the Theory of Evolution through many such models. Now before you go telling me to post some of those Models as proof I'll tell you now, I am not a scientist so if you want proof you'll have to just take my word for it, or Google something. as to the topic of this post, If there is any Conspiracy between Creationists and Evolutionists it is coming from the side of Creation. I would think that in most cases anyone who believes in the Creation Myth would most likely be of a religious Nature, more Specifically a Christian. Their own Bible is unsure on the Matter of Creation as you can find in the First and Second Book of Genesis. The only "" Evidence "" that a Creationist has to "" Prove"" Creation is the Holy Book that Christians Cherish above all. Since Darwin and his Theory the Christian Religion has launched a conspiracy to Dis-prove or de-bunk Darwin's Theory. They are so adamant in their believe they go to great lengths to try and prove evolution is not real, Like breaking up their Creationist views into specific categories like the ones above, so as to confuse the general population as to who believes what. Your Posts in this thread , Whether you admit it or not, Categorize you as a "" Creationist. You can sit on the fence all you want and use IC or ID or whatever to ""Claim"" you are not but just like every other post you have made you are wrong.

In science there is even a whimsical term for a machine or structure or process that does something, but the actual mechanism by which it accomplishes its task is unknown: it is called a 'black box.' In Darwin's time all of biology was a black box: not only the cell, or the eye, or digestion, or immunity, but every biological structure and function because, ultimately, no one could explain how biological processes occurred. In concluding, it is important to realize that we are not inferring design from what we do not know, but from what we do know. We are not inferring design to account for a black box, but to account for an open box. A man from a primitive culture who sees an automobile might guess that it was powered by the wind or by an antelope hidden under the car, but when he opens up the hood and sees the engine he immediately realizes that it was designed. In the same way biochemistry has opened up the cell to examine what makes it run and we see that it, too, was designed.","Ripskar","419153","ID proponents try to and fail.

Shall we have another thread called 'is there a conspiracy to cover up freedoms beliefs?' Come one, wheres the quotes? Your sanity is at stake here! Premise - /You do not believe evolution explains life Conclusion - //You believe life was designed is an invalid argument, any logician can tell you that. If they do not their bias is to thick to ever be circumvented by argument. I will state it again if you wish. kk The argument is several pages! wow, I would still need to see it before I could ever agree it is sound though. Incorrectly, simply asserting a false hood does not make it true. I have issue with that statement but for the sake of argument I grant it, so put that in an argument to contradict any of my statements. The burden of proof is on he who claims that something exists, you and bennedict have claimed that an argument exists and is valid which uses IC as a premise and concludes ID. I have already identified the only such argument I could think of as a fallacy, I did not need to identify that argument to 'win' but I did for the sake of clarity. The video I posted confirmed that the argument I had in mind was a fallacy, it is not my failure if what I guessed bennedict was talking about was not what he was thinking. It was up to him to state what he was talking about. That which cannot be explained? Do I need to accept 'that' on faith? Like I said before IC is not a theory.

These groups succeeded in getting the teaching of Evolution banned in the United States public Schools. In the Mid 1960's a group calling themselves"" Young Earth Creationists"" began promoting the teaching of what they called "" Scientific Creationism"" using Flood Geology in public school science classes to support a purely literal reading of the Genesis account. Now here is where it gets Dicey.. In the Case of Daniel vs. Waters (1975) the Judge ruled that teaching creationism in public schools contravened the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and the content of public schools teachings was subsequently stripped of overt biblical references and renamed "" Creation Science"" .. Then in the case of Edwards vs. Aguillard (1987) the court ruled that creation science similarly contravened the Constitution and all references to "" Creation"" in school textbooks were changed to refer to "" Intelligent Design . These Creationists then took the term"" Intelligent Design"" and once again re-named themselves. They began claiming Intelligent Design to be a "" New"" Scientific Theory and began again an attempt to introduce "" Creation"" into our schools by masking it under Intelligent Design. another case.. The case of Kitzmiller vs. Dover ( 2005) the Court Ruled that Intelligent Design is NOT science, and contravenes the constitutional restriction on teaching religion in Public School Classes.

That is what I think.","Freedom","421951","That's me What is not recognized is that both attain validity from primary philosophical beliefs, it is not the methodologies or in general the assertions of science or religion that establish the dichotomy between them but the premises on which those methods are based. The epistemology of religion and science are respectively faith and reason . Reason is the standard by which all science is conducted and by which a method is valued for it's objective relation to reality . A fully qualified yet concise definition of science would be similar to: the active or passive production of facts about the natural world through reason. Faith is the standard by which all religion exists and by which an idea can be accepted on the ' virtue ' that it lacks objective proof . I have had ample exposure to various religions and the best answer (best being totally relative to the other absurd ones) to 'why doesn't god reveal himself' is 'if he did then everyone would believe in him and without faith they wouldn't be tempted to lose it'. There is a basic epistemological dichotomy between faith and reason because reason makes no room for other modes of knowledge. If it is not a rational conclusion it is a irrational conclusion. Therefore any means of gaining knowledge is to use a common phrase 'either for reason or against it', and one need hardly ask if faith is rational when the very fact that it need not be rational is always the first and key bulwark of defense in mystical apologetics. Reason doesn't just exclude faith, imagination, emotional need translated to self delusion; anything that is not explicitly rational is doomed to be irrational. If and only if something can be supported by sound or cogent argument can it be rational, therefore all that is supported by sound or cogent argument is rational AND anything that is not is irrational. Faith is not rational. Anyone who takes some things on faith but requires evidence for others is in a state of philosophical contradiction. He/She is necessarily creating and modifying their standard of knowledge on the fly most likely based on personal and social emotional needs; and that is the best case scenario, some depraved souls take everything on faith and simply accept scientific knowledge and religious knowledge as various flavours of the same box of chocolates.... packaged under the name of 'lots of people believe this so it must be true'. ""Methodology of validation used by theologians does not apply to material world and methodology used by scientists does not apply to spiritual world"" I, however; certainly recognize this. Methodology of validation used by theologians does not apply to material world - which would include our material existance, which would include our lives and are beliefs. Tacking material onto phrases is a pathetic trick, it merely means 'not spiritual' which is to mean 'real'. methodology used by scientists does not apply to spiritual world - nor to star trek world or star wars world.

Neither respectable nor desirable; look around you, do you see an endless parade of wars and disputes in our history? I will tell you what is causing them, and it's not what most think; it's too much compromise not too little. Disagreements can be swept under the carpet over a joke and some beer but they don't go away. People who have your attitude, the attitude that peace lies in the middle ground proceed entirely on the vain hope that none of these out of sight out of mind contradictions between people are ever serious enough to effect lives.

I will feel just fine about it because science does not contradict me here; how can it when there is no evidence on the matter one way or another? This is the naked nature of the thought which must exist in those who see no contradiction between reason and faith. Not important for whom? Most religions prescribe serious consequences for ignoring the spiritual aspect in life which they claim to guide. If that is so it would be important to them, and unless they are being terribly 'selfish' it would be important for other people to believe as well. History tells us that Christianity, Islam, and buddhism all find it very important to convert others.

"02-02-2011","14596",22,"None","None","None","Another opinion","423614","As others have noted, scientific thought is based on verifiable evidence. Religious thought has its base in faith - i.e. belief not necessarily based on evidence but on a type of trust. However, I disagree that the two are mutually exclusive. The only type of religious faith that fatally clashes with Science is the type that automatically excludes scientific evidence if it contradicts dogma. Though many religions along with their followers are absolute in their dogma, I would say that the majority are not. Though it is rare for a religion to be completely flexible in adapting to new scientific discoveries, I would say that most have enough flexibility that, once scientific discoveries are certain enough and pass some test of time, they adapt a fair amount of their doctrine to match. Take some examples: Lightning, earthquakes, and other so called ""acts of God"" were actually thought once to be purely acts of God. The great majority of people and religions now accept scientific explanations. The earth was once thought to be at the physical center of the universe. Now, nearly everyone accepts that it is not. Pope John Paul II had written a papal communication that accepted that the human body might have been influenced by evolution, though he claimed divine sources for the soul - ""If the human body take its origin from pre-existent living matter, the spiritual soul is immediately created by God "" from CATHOLIC LIBRARY: Truth Cannot Contradict Truth (1996) . So, though religious institutions are very slow to respond to scientific evidence, most do make an effort. The rise of the evangelical religions and other fundamentalist religions trouble me since they seem far more dogmatic than do even long established religions such as the Roman Catholic church. I am hopeful that this is just a phase that portions of the population are going through. Time will tell... On another point, even when the religious establishment holds a particular dogma, that does not mean that all of their followers agree with all of the religion's dogma. A majority of Catholics, for example, use contraception despite the Church's condemnation of it. Increasingly, people pick and choose what to believe in their religion. There is a comfort and confidence of purpose that many people gain in participating in organized religion. That does not make them slaves to its dogma. I, myself, oscillate between being a pure agnostic and being a very loosely believing Christian. There are times when I do like to believe in a personal God - especially in challenging times - and let myself indulge that belief. That does not mean that I have to believe that God created the earth, etc. I am certainly one that picks and chooses my beliefs. I simply stay away from any beliefs that are disproven by science. It is important to remind ourselves that lack of evidence against a belief is not proof against the belief. There are some places where Scientific evidence can disprove a belief - ex. in details of how the earth or humanity came to exist - but there are also many areas of belief that science has far more trouble presenting evidence that counters a belief. This may well be a religion of the ""gaps"". So be it. There are still wide gaps in science in which religion can fit.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","12:14 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","316"

I would dispute that assumption. Though the great majority of religions hold fairly specific beliefs in a creation, there is nothing in the definition of religion that requires this to be the case. My guess as to the reason for religion stressing a role in creation is that many would find it difficult to have such great respect for a god who did not play a role in creation. Also, there were religions, such as that followed by many of the founders - i.e. deism - that held that God was like a ""watchmaker"" that set up the apparatus of existence and let it run on its own from there. The modern day equivalent would say that God instigated the big bang. Though there is no evidence against this, I agree that there is no evidence for it and I personally do not hold a view of any role of God or any other force in a supernatural creation. Nevertheless, without any clear evidence of what might have started a Big Bang, the gaps in science once again allow for supernatural belief in this narrow area to be unchallenged with direct evidence. Again, lack of evidence supporting something is not proof that it does not exist. Science cannot prove a negative.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","07:37 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","319"

First, if you are claiming to make an absolute statement about all religions, then you have to include the possibility of religions that do not hold beliefs in supernatural creation and your arguments cannot rest purely on disputing those beliefs. If, instead, you are simply talking about majority religious belief in the US, then I would agree with your points but, again, that cannot be used to extrapolate to an absolute statement on religion. Secondly, scientists constantly hold views that are either unsupported by evidence or tenuously supported by evidence. This often happens in the first stages of formulation of a hypothesis. The difference is in the degree of certainty. Good scientists will not feel a high degree of certainty in a hypothesis that has little or no evidence. Those who are strongly religious often feel a strong certainty in their beliefs and I would agree that there is some irrationality in that approach. However, I would say that very many, probably most, religious people do not have absolute certainty in their beliefs - largely because the beliefs remain unproven.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","08:18 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","327"
