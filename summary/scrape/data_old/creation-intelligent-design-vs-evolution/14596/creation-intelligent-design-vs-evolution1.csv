I'm not sure what you mean by a ""secularist."" Do you mean one who denies religion, one who denies the scientific value of religion, one who is not religious, or one who does not use religion in his work because it is irrelevant? You don't explain why a scientist would even want to undermine the validity of biblical creation. Scientists propose and test explanations for observed natural phenomena. How is that anti-biblical? Do you think that scientists should declare that some observations and tested conclusions must be wrong because they are in conflict with your literal reading of a book of mythology? Of course, satanists are on the same level as creationists. They believe in mythology and folklore as TRUTH. The ""poor me"" syndrome. If anyone could actually show why ID creationism should be regarded as science, then it would be. The fact is, creation science and ID creationism start from the conclusions and then reject any scientific finding that does not fit the theology. Present some evidence of a mythical designer and he/she/it wouldn't be mythology any more. As for the blackballing of creation scientists or ID creationists, it just isn't true. There is a plethora of examples of the publication of legitimate scientific papers by creation scientists and ID creationists. But all of those papers report science that is testable. None of them propose invisible beings as explanations for real events. The fact is that papers that propose creationism and ID creationism aren't science. They don't ever propose any new science and are easily debunked. For those reasons they are generally rejected for publication by legitimate scientific journals. Creation science and ID creationism have also been rejected as science by courts. Nope. You're just paranoid. You think that just because you believe in your mythology, it must be true. Apparently, you haven't bothered to educate yourself about reality.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","01:32 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","4"

I do believe scientists are sincere in their search for knowledge, but there is so much in the effort of finding things just to try to deny God. Yes, there are many people thrown out of their positions or denied tenure if they teach I.D.(.) I encourage you to watch the movie ""Expelled"" that Ben Stein made, even if it is only to see the people who have been fired for their beliefs.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","04:19 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","8"

How can a search for knowledge be an effort to deny your petty god? What would be the purpose of searching for knowledge that denies your petty god? Ben Stein lied to you. Those people in Stein's movie weren't fired because of their beliefs. They were fired because they refused to do the job that they were hired to do, or they were incompetent. Take for example, William Dembski, who was let go by Baylor University (a Baptist affiliated university) because he didn't do what he was hired to do. I notice that you don't support your assertion with examples.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","12:35 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","9"

I remeber being told that I should not play Dungeons and Dragons in the 80s because simply did not mention Yahweh. The guy was clear it was not all the spells and demons and such because they were fiction. This issue the teacher had was that it simply did not mention Yahweh at all. You have to remeber that some hard line xians see their god as such a big thing in their apprehension of reality that it is often (but not always) very difficult for them to imagine somebody apprehending reality without the concept of a god. They see a god shaped hole in that persons life that the non religious has no conception of. Anything that takes the place of that percieved god shape hole is by definition anti god. That's why to study evoultion you must totally and without question hate god and want nothing to do with it (not my position, you understand; simply the position of the hard line theist). I concur, the film was rightly panned and Ben Stein is douche of the first water for taking the fundy shilling.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","04:56 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","10"

(Thanks for proving my point Data). I know what you mean, my parents told me Harry Potter was evil because of the witchcraft, then my dad saw one of the movies and loved it so much we own all of them and we read all the books. But as Data has shown, there are those who use ""science"" so they can deny God. Most of the science that does this is unbased while most other facets of science show His glory even without mentioning Him. They were hired to teach a class, not to teach evolution.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","03:03 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","12"
