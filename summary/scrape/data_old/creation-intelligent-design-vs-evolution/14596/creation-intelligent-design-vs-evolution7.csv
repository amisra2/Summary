He has avoided making any statements other than the ones he makes to say evolution can't be happening. Obviously Freedom is some form of a creationist, but he will not admit this. This would to some extent undermine his assertion that evolution is wrong. He has admitted to being a Christian. I don't think anyone really knows what Freedom's opinions are other than ""evolution is wrong."" What makes this worse is that Freedom constantly flip flops on the subtle details making his argument dynamic and very hard to keep track of.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","08:55 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","91"

The ID movement predates Behes book by a decade at least. Furthermore you cannot support ID with IC. . lol Blurting an assertion along with several other assertions does not support the first bennedict. I understood you the first time. ROFL, you realize those two paragraphs are contradictory to each other right? 1. He has never supported any creationism 2. He is obviously a creationist You basically admitted that the standard by which you identify creationist is 'those who deny evolution'. BTW I never choose Christianity, if ever being a christian is a measure of a creationist then Darwin was one. Than how can anyone know that I am a creationist? Find and example. You are probably having trouble using words precisely and have mistake two similar statements for two identical statements.","Databed","419003","You just reworded my statements to make them contradictory. Anyone can go back and read what I wrote and then how you represented what I wrote. I said nothing contradictory. As far as flip flopping, you have done this. You used to accept the workings of evolution as a mechanism to improvement in a genome. Now you don't allow it to account for advancement, depending on how you are defining advancement in some given day. Originally, species were not decended from a common ancestor, now they are (though evolution is not adequate to explain this). There are several instances where you change your stance on small issues to make them fit into your logic. And you did say at one point you were a Christian or at least used to be.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","03:35 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","93"

"12-13-2010","14596",7,"None","None","None","Ripskar","419010","Comparison of major creationist views Young Earth creationism Humans Directly created by God. Plants/animals directly created by God. Macroevolution does not occur. Earth less than 10,000 years old. Reshaped by global flood. Universe Less than 10,000 years old. Gap creationism Humans Directly created by God. Plants/animals Directly created by God. Macroevolution does not occur. Earth scientifically accepted age. Reshaped by global flood. Universe scientifically accepted age. Progressive creationism Humans directly created by God (based on primate anatomy). Plans/animals direct creation + evolution. No single common ancestor. Earth scientifically accepted age. No global flood. Universe scientifically accepted age. Intelligent Design Proponents hold various beliefs. e.g. Behe accepts evolution from primates Divine intervention at some point in the past, as evidenced by what intelligent-design creationists call ""irreducible complexity"" Some adherents claim the existence of Earth is the result of divine intervention - Scientifically accepted age Theistic evolution Humans evolved from primates. Evolution from single common ancestor. Earth scientifically accepted age. No global flood. Universe scientifically accepted age. The terms are already defined, you simply have to look them up. What is meant by Macroevolution seems a bit wishy-washy, last time we did this properly the creationist accepted that one species can and has evolved into another but that this was microevolution as they hadn't evolved from one ""biblical type"" to another ""biblical type"" which seems to be somewhere around the Genus or Family level.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","05:09 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","95"

Darwin's name is used by ID advocates as an attack on evolution, never to support their own ""theory"". you have to think a bit harder before answering and throwing up strawmen. like i said, IC is used by ID advocates, and to satisfy your endless crave for absolute straight answers without the need for implications that seeminly anyone apart from you can catch up on, ID advocates use IC to support their idea. you cant escape what's true. ID advocates use IC as their main argument in support of their ""theory"". observe any ID advocate and youll hear ""____ is so complex, it couldnt have evolved through a gradual process."" i cant believe im having to catch you up on this... despite the fact that Behe is an advocate of intelligent design... and he came up with IC to support ID. well done, freedie. you seem flustered, freedom. are you flustered?","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","05:16 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","96"
"12-13-2010","14596",7,"Bennedict","419031","oooooooooohhhhhh i get it. IC is not a tool for ID because YOU dont accept that it is. YOU dont use IC to support ID, so we can all conclude that IC has no association with ID. no. IC was founded by Behe to be used in support of ID - one simpleton who pretends to be knowledgable on scientific topics who doesnt relate the two in his pitiful arguments has percisely no effect on the definition, usage or relationship with any other idea that IC has. if you wish to use IC as a stand-alone argument, thats fine. it's still wrong, but in doing so, its also incorrect to say this: also, it should be noted that in traditional fartingle fashion (R.I.P.), freedom will not accept defeat, or accept that he was wrong. this is the go-to attitude when it comes to ID. another note, if it is true that IC is now a stand-alone argument isnt it interesting how suddenly the IC advocates dissociate themselves with the now defunct ""cdesign proponentsists""? this is another attempt at an ID and thus creationism ""wedge"" into the scientific community and thus a ""wedge"" to get christianity taught in science classrooms to eliminate the threat of evolution destroying the future religious intentions of students, and to promote their religious beliefs and get as many people to join their church as possible. two birds with one stone, or rather two super eagle/pterodactyl hybrids with one grain of sand. its not going to work - AGAIN!","Freedom","419034","Arguing IC is irrelevant to ID because it is, attempt to identify the connection if you do not believe me. It is logically irrelevant, that is why you should conclude that the only association between IC and ID is improper. It is correct to say that. I would say the same about evolutionist. It was always stand alone. What are you talking about?

"12-13-2010","14596",7,"Bennedict","419036","i will relate the two, as Behe and other ID proponents have done - a complex biological system cannot be produced via random mutation/natural selection - it had to have been formed all at once. the key is that these systems cannot have been produced by random mutation - that is how evolution works. if random mutation didnt give rise to advancements, a designer must have created it with the function in mind. this is mirrored by your very arguments. something cannot be selected for until the system is fully functioning. how did the system get fully functioning? at the Dover trail, Behe was asked if he could produce evidence of the designer, or a signature of the designer. you know what he produced? you guessed it! IC. youre still saying that IC has nothing to do with ID!? check out the ID website for the discovery institute. look who's book is featured second: CSC - Center for Science and Culture - Books WOW look at that! its Behe's ""Darwin's Black Box"" where he first coined the term ""irreducibly complex"". check out the review for the book on that site: wow! arent we learning so much? connection between IC and ID are outlined right there for you by the founder of the IC movement, and ID thinktank Disco-Insti senior fellow Michael Behe!! IC never had an association with ID? what a joke. are you still able to honestly say that IC has never had a connection to ID? if so, then show me.","Freedom","419038","I challenge you to make that argument. You cannot use a single negative premise to conclude anything was designed, it is the implied premise that I object to and that you will state if you meet this challenge. I say if a system cannot be produced by random mutation and natural selection it cannot be produced by random mutation and natural selection; nothing more for I have no arguments for anything more. I don't know, but since we all accept that unexplained phenomenon are miracles from God I suppose I must just be biased against religion Did not the judge of this trial conclude that there is no dichotomy. Yes, IC has no logical connection to ID. Religion has no logical connection to science, shall I assault you with links to people who believe science is a religion or that religion helps science? You keep changing words, association has a different meaning than logical connection. I was never talking about what people thought IC could do for them, I was always talking about what IC was and could do. It has never had a logical connection to ID. Shall I be on the lookout for negative evidence to prove a lack of connection?","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","10:37 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","102"
