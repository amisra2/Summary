You won't post evidence to support your position because there is none.. You are just being foolish , I'm done trying to make sense out of your nonsense..

"12-20-2010","14596",16,"Freedom","419519","That would be an appeal to people. By what justification do you maintain that constraint. And? I asked you and I only ask that you defend your own position. That you do not care is why you are making a fool of yourself.","Bennedict","419525","a testimony from the ID boffins would support my claim. they are the ones that will make the IC argument and tie it all together with ID, the idea that these IC systems were designed. and they all make this same argument. ive already mentioned why i will not input my own position - i have none. i am a strict evolutionist, you might as well ask me which passages in the Qur'an i like the best. thank you for the strawman. you said that IC is subject to evolution - that is irrelevant. ID proponents speak of IC systems as being products of a designer, as opposed to random mutation; that's where their argument is.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","08:34 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","227"

You haven't posted anything to support this claim, Nothing I can find at least. Why don't you admit you really have no Idea what you're talking about, Hell I'm not a Scientist And I'll admit that, but I can read and see for myself that your position is completely unfounded.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","10:42 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","230"

Ripskar posted the definition of IC here , and you linked to an article with the definition of IC just before that. By irreducibly complex I mean a single system composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning. (Darwin's Black Box [1996], p. 39) ID mentioned? nope in fact evolution is not mentioned either, that comes later when integrating selection pressures over possible pathways. In the case of both the analysis and the argument IC speaks of selection pressures mutations, genetic changes, populations, biological systems, and processes. It does not talk of designers or anything close to it. What is so is simply so, I am sorry you don't realize that it's your duty since you are the one claiming you can go from the above definition to ID. If Michael Behe was here arguing in your stead I would set him to the same standard. because I have an idea what I'm talking about and my position is well founded. At the risk of sounding like bennedict I have read Behe's books and he knows exactly what he's saying at every point. Most of his book speaks about IC, what does that mean? That is an attack on evolution as an explanation. Then he, and I quote; 'steps over the line', to start with ID. His justification for concluding ID is short and concise. He cycles through all proposed natural origins for biological systems besides the standard evolutionary one which he just spent several hundred pages attacking, concluding quickly at each one that they are no better equipped to explain life than evolution was. He then states the dichotomy (being convinced his list is complete) which given that premise is now valid. 'if biological systems were not formed naturally they were formed unnaturally i.e. ID'. You are free to agree with him on the completeness of his list but you are not free to confuse the issue. He debunked evolution and concludes ID from that. It is not IC that supposedly supports ID in this case but a lack of evolution. A lack of evolution has always been the primary premise of IDrs and creationist. I tell you that simply put he cannot establish a dichotomy thus, i.e. by any finite list. The video I posted agrees with me that one cannot support a theory with the failure of another. That is being victimized by ignorance just as surely as blaming it directly on God is. The sun is hot and bright like fire, so either it's a fireplace or a candle. For most of our history no better alternative could be given and someone might think he could cycle through a list of alternative sources of fire humans have seen thus far and conclude that indeed it must be a candle (for a fireplace would have bricks and sparks sometimes). It is you and the other evolutionist who have acted in accord with you who have displayed that they do not know what they are talking about by readily accepting a known fallacy for the sake of more easily identifying 'the enemy'.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","11:24 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","231"

Who is confusing Matters?.... If Behe was the ONLY one using this same "" Theory"" your position might hold water, but YOU are the one disagreeing with practically every ID'er and yet you still have not stated why you think they are wrong. And for your Information I have found literally hundreds of Sites concerning the use of IC. and so far Every single one claims that IC does in fact support ID. IC has nothing to do with Evolution,That is established. It doesn't really matter though because like has been said, ID, IC, whatever you choose to believe it all leads back to a Creator being involved.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","12:16 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","232"

He can't; When I say he knows exactly what he's saying I mean he spells it out and never pretends to use IC to support ID in his book at least. Any sane person knows you can't say 'oh look complex must of been designed' much less 'since A didn't produce it B must have' without further premises. Behe is sane and attempts to acquire the required third premise (the dichotomy), he fails but he at least knows it is there. From what I have seen from you and bennedict.. You don't. My position has absolutely nothing to do with the quantity of people agreeing with me. Why do you think that modifying that variable will affect it? How many times will it take? Statement => a false dichotomy is false. Well double thumbs up for you, how many will it take? I am so excited by this break through I'll go ahead and prepare the argument for you, just fill in the blank. ____ websites claim that IC does in fact support ID, therefore IC does in fact support ID. Not by anyone I have met. For the sake of argument let's assume that without evolution we are all doomed to resort to mysticism, can the consequences of a belief validate or invalidate it?","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","12:40 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","233"
"12-21-2010","14596",16,"marc9000","419452","That's all EvC is. Heavy athiest moderation, with careful control of how many religious people post there. I turned out to be one too many for them. But it was fun while it lasted.","Larni","419551","As a native of EvC I can say without fear of contradiction that there is no 'careful control' of religious people. In fact creos are given more latitude than others to de-unencouragize them in staying. Some of the mods were preferentially chosen for their creo position: AdminPD and AdminSlev, for example. The high turn over at EvC of creos is because of the forum rules that require evidence or reasoned argument and a strict science fora (as opposed to the non science fora). Marc9000 left because his ideas got no traction or got suspended for not following the (easy to read) rules.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","12:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","234"
