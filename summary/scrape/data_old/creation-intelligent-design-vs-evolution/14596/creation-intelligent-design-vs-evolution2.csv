If there is ever a solid non-hypothosis expalnation for a natural start of the universe or evolution, then I will believe it.","Databed","411840","A natural start of evolution is not encompassed in the science of evolution. Evolution is a process, not an origin. I will agree that I don't have enough information to prove abiogenesis, but science does more that just prove things. It is a process of understanding and study. Same goes for the origin of the universe. Science does not try to reconcile a preconceived notion like religion does and it is not a process put in place in order to undermine religion. My point earlier was that when I prove a religious thinker wrong, I take satisfaction in it just like a would a fellow scientist who disagreed with me. We both strive for explanations. Religious thinkers think they are being picked on because their strain of thought is not even considered by a scientific thinker. This is because their style of thinking is illogical because it works from effect to cause. This is not satisfying to someone who has no preconceived, early childhood ingrained notions of the way things are.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","04:59 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","16"
"09-08-2010","14596",2,"fartingle","411817","This is the kind of person I was talking about. (Thanks for proving my point Data). But as Data has shown, there are those who use ""science"" so they can deny God. Most of the science that does this is unbased (Did you mean to say unbiased?) while most other facets of science show His glory even without mentioning Him. They were hired to teach a class, not to teach evolution.","pandion","411845","Apparently you didn't notice that he didn't say that he was searching for ways to deny your god. He said that he took pleasure when the results debunked the wholly babble and creationism. Again, that's not what he said. Personally, when I was doing science there never was any intent to deny your petty god. However, it was always funny when creationists squealed at the results of science. What a load of nonsense. So science can show the glory of a mythical being without mentioning him, and it can also debunk the existence of that mythical being, also without mentioning him. You're so logical. And they were fired for not teaching that class. I personally know of an English teacher who taught creationism in his English classes. He was let go. Of course, only an XXXXX would try to teach that the earth is only 6,000 years old in a earth science class. It takes intentional ignorance to deny evolution.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","06:00 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","17"

I am from Arizona. I am comfortable in 110 degrees while running. Yet over 90 degrees is a heat warning in many parts of the world and people start dying of heat stroke... If it could not do that to begin with and it had to wait to evolve it, it would have died. Instead it adapted because it was already able to survive on citrus before being put on it. Otherwise you could say that people that are put inside an active volcano will evolve to resist such temperatures.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","04:56 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","28"

Some of the bacteria was able to survive while others perished and that ability was passed on to further generations some of those generations had by random changes in their dna an even better ability to adapt( mainly by using the depleting oxygen more efficiently not living in citric acid) The cells evolved the ability to utilize citric acid as an energy source not resist a concentration solution of it. Killing an animal instantly stops its evolution.

Thank god that scientific theories are not just mere speculation. Ever hear of the theory of gravity? I know. You're going to display your profound ignorance of scientific topics by telling us that ""gravity is a law."" Wrong again. Newton formulated the first theory of gravity that was based on a consistant observation. The observation is the law and the theory explains why. Same with evolution. The theories are explanations of observations of evolution. On the other hand, there are no observations or explanations of ""creation."" Just immaginings based on the mythology of nomadic, bronze age herdsmen. Then, by saying ""unbased"" you actually meant to talk gibberish. In fact, the theories of evolution are based on observations of changes the genetic makeup of populations of living things. You display yet more ignorance of what science is and how it works. Of course, there isn't even a hint of evidence of creationism. It's pretty silly to fall back on magic for anything that you don't understand. To believe in young earth creationism means that one must deny physics, geology, astrophysics, astronomy, biology - in fact, all of science but elementry chemistry. Wow! Talk about ignorance.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","10:09 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","30"
