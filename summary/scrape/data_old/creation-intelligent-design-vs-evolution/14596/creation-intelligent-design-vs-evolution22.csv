"02-02-2011","14596",22,"None","None","None","Another opinion","423614","As others have noted, scientific thought is based on verifiable evidence. Religious thought has its base in faith - i.e. belief not necessarily based on evidence but on a type of trust. However, I disagree that the two are mutually exclusive. The only type of religious faith that fatally clashes with Science is the type that automatically excludes scientific evidence if it contradicts dogma. Though many religions along with their followers are absolute in their dogma, I would say that the majority are not. Though it is rare for a religion to be completely flexible in adapting to new scientific discoveries, I would say that most have enough flexibility that, once scientific discoveries are certain enough and pass some test of time, they adapt a fair amount of their doctrine to match. Take some examples: Lightning, earthquakes, and other so called ""acts of God"" were actually thought once to be purely acts of God. The great majority of people and religions now accept scientific explanations. The earth was once thought to be at the physical center of the universe. Now, nearly everyone accepts that it is not. Pope John Paul II had written a papal communication that accepted that the human body might have been influenced by evolution, though he claimed divine sources for the soul - ""If the human body take its origin from pre-existent living matter, the spiritual soul is immediately created by God "" from CATHOLIC LIBRARY: Truth Cannot Contradict Truth (1996) . So, though religious institutions are very slow to respond to scientific evidence, most do make an effort. The rise of the evangelical religions and other fundamentalist religions trouble me since they seem far more dogmatic than do even long established religions such as the Roman Catholic church. I am hopeful that this is just a phase that portions of the population are going through. Time will tell... On another point, even when the religious establishment holds a particular dogma, that does not mean that all of their followers agree with all of the religion's dogma. A majority of Catholics, for example, use contraception despite the Church's condemnation of it. Increasingly, people pick and choose what to believe in their religion. There is a comfort and confidence of purpose that many people gain in participating in organized religion. That does not make them slaves to its dogma. I, myself, oscillate between being a pure agnostic and being a very loosely believing Christian. There are times when I do like to believe in a personal God - especially in challenging times - and let myself indulge that belief. That does not mean that I have to believe that God created the earth, etc. I am certainly one that picks and chooses my beliefs. I simply stay away from any beliefs that are disproven by science. It is important to remind ourselves that lack of evidence against a belief is not proof against the belief. There are some places where Scientific evidence can disprove a belief - ex. in details of how the earth or humanity came to exist - but there are also many areas of belief that science has far more trouble presenting evidence that counters a belief. This may well be a religion of the ""gaps"". So be it. There are still wide gaps in science in which religion can fit.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","12:14 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","316"

If a person accepts that Evolution is real then by default they must object to a Creator. Evolution is based on scientific studies that have proven over and over how Human life as well as every living thing evolved over hundreds of millions of years. Most religious people I have ever known rely on the fact that Science cannot prove the non existance of GOD. But on the other side of that Religion cannot produce evidence that God does exist. There is Not one single shred of Scientific Evidence to support the fact of a GOD.. in my opinion this lack of Evidence over the period of millions of years is enough to believe that GOD does not exist. Religions are now coming out in "" support"" of Evolution. But they are still attempting to include a Creator as the Base of the existance of Life. Saying"" God created the First Cell and then Evolution took over "" is still adhering to the belief that GOD created us. This also goes against the Dogma of many religions. I believe it's all just another ploy by religious organizations to attempt to get GOD included in school study.

""do science and religion co-exist?"" yes, rarely and with a very unstable relationship. i think the question should be ""should science and religion co-exist?"" i dont think so. religion should stay out of science's hair and let it do it's job... science's job, on the other hand is to discover mysteries, religion which of course is a mystery. so i think religion should not interfere with science, and science should be allowed to do it's job, which does mean exploring topics which were ""already explained"" by religion - sometimes turning up a contrary conclusion. that's a good thing that that happens, and i think the few theistic scientists would agree.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","05:35 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","318"

I would dispute that assumption. Though the great majority of religions hold fairly specific beliefs in a creation, there is nothing in the definition of religion that requires this to be the case. My guess as to the reason for religion stressing a role in creation is that many would find it difficult to have such great respect for a god who did not play a role in creation. Also, there were religions, such as that followed by many of the founders - i.e. deism - that held that God was like a ""watchmaker"" that set up the apparatus of existence and let it run on its own from there. The modern day equivalent would say that God instigated the big bang. Though there is no evidence against this, I agree that there is no evidence for it and I personally do not hold a view of any role of God or any other force in a supernatural creation. Nevertheless, without any clear evidence of what might have started a Big Bang, the gaps in science once again allow for supernatural belief in this narrow area to be unchallenged with direct evidence. Again, lack of evidence supporting something is not proof that it does not exist. Science cannot prove a negative.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","07:37 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","319"

I understand where you're coming from, I just don't see it that way. Like you said, the purpose of science is to explain mysteries. Evolution is one of those mysteries and there are religious Scientists who have done great work in the field. But for me the real mystery is the Origin of Life. As long as religion stands in the way I personally don't believe we will ever really know, we may not either way. A religious person may now believe in evolution , and they may even speak out against Creationism, but they still believe there is an imaginary being in the sky watching over us as we move through life. Many of those same "" Scientists "" when asked where they came from will still say "" GOD ""... So they are not really scientists in my opinion. And then there is the faction that have jumped on board with Evolution so they can mix with the reality of the world. I think that they honestly believe this will help them one day push ""God"" back into our schools.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","08:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","320"

First, if you are claiming to make an absolute statement about all religions, then you have to include the possibility of religions that do not hold beliefs in supernatural creation and your arguments cannot rest purely on disputing those beliefs. If, instead, you are simply talking about majority religious belief in the US, then I would agree with your points but, again, that cannot be used to extrapolate to an absolute statement on religion. Secondly, scientists constantly hold views that are either unsupported by evidence or tenuously supported by evidence. This often happens in the first stages of formulation of a hypothesis. The difference is in the degree of certainty. Good scientists will not feel a high degree of certainty in a hypothesis that has little or no evidence. Those who are strongly religious often feel a strong certainty in their beliefs and I would agree that there is some irrationality in that approach. However, I would say that very many, probably most, religious people do not have absolute certainty in their beliefs - largely because the beliefs remain unproven.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","08:18 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","327"

I hear religious people all the time say they know God is real because "" they can see the results in their Lives"".. They will not admit that it's possible and highly probable that they would see the exact same result without God or "" Faith"" in their lives. I'll give you an example... Suppose a religious person goes to start his car in the morning and it won't start. As he pumps the gas and gets ready to try again he says a little prayer, and suddenly his car starts. A religious person will immediately give GOD credit for starting his car. All those little mundane prayers like this example are credited to an invisible being that doesn't exist. You see NFL football players pointing to the sky and thanking GOD after scoring a touch down. It's because of this kind of thing that Religion has Given People the Misconception that GOD is affecting their lives. All this unnecessary grand standing for the sake of a GOD that only exists in mans imaginations. Personally I don't care if YOU or anyone else chooses to believe. I am not attacking anyone in particular I despise religion for what it is and what it does to the human mind. When I had major back surgery 8 years ago I didn't give GOD credit for saving my legs, nor my Life. I gave credit to the Doctors, where Credit should have gone. In my opinion human kind will never progress into the future as long as we allow religion to guide our thoughts. Man is perfectly capable of thinking for himself, he has survived on his own without GOD long before religion reared it's ugly head into this world, and In my opinion we will when the world wakes up and realizes that God is Imaginary. If you choose to believe that is YOUR choice, but when religious people try to bend the will of others that's where I will always take a stand.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","12:56 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","330"
