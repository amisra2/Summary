Archangel also observes: Barbarian is now on Archangels ignore list. But just to correct 1 point. Here is the evolutionary tree of life. Tree of Life Gallery - Evolution Now look at the top of the mammal branch.","Penfold","337916","Cool! The top of the mammal branch is third highest, below birds and plants.

Those homeschooler project teams know their stuff on that schoolkid site.","Archangel","337930","First of all penfold, you know I didn't post the evolutionary chart for the truth of it, because I don't accept the evolutionists beliefs that all species are equal. And neither do you if I could get you to be honest about the issue. The reason barbarian is a waste of time debating is because he can't debate the issues honestly. I posted the evolutionary tree of life in response to his claims above and he responds by posting a genetic chart, and thinks he has refuted me when he has just changed the subject again. Now if plants, birds, fish and all lower mammals are equal to humans then how do we justify the consumption of birds, vegetables, fish and meat as we do? We are mass murderers on a monumental scale if we aren't just following our rightful authority as God intended. But evolutionists don't concern themselves with those real life contradictions between what evo believes and what exists in the real world. So you can marvel over a kiddie sites evolutionary tree but I'm not impressed as its nothing but propaganda to make kids feel guilty for being human. And based on barbarians intellect, why would I have posted anything more advanced?","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","11:42 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","17"
"12-25-2008","12141",2,"None","None","None","Smallax","337936","Another point that has recently occured to me was, that when the evolutionary mindset prevails, there seems to be a lot of focus on mutations. What a researcher should do is learn all that he can about the real deal, as it is, then consider the deviations later. Right now no one has the authority to say what is new or previous encoded dna, because we have not identified what the dna code is really doing yet. Instead of new discoveries , we get references to 101 mutations but 1 of those coding losses protects arteries. [here's your rapid evolution in the gamete cells -101 losses of code] How about if we had a rational look and understanding of what the code is actually doing and put away the 'agenda' of evolution through mutation? or ID? or any environmental agenda? We should be learning those genes by nicknames, by now, as good friends and have a good idea of his purpose is, in life. How about it. can we begin to document the genome in some realistic fashion?","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","07:37 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","19"

Destroys your googled factoids in debate with superior knowledge and logic. This is precisely backward.Your misunderstanding of Evolution is coloured by your filtering it through your peculiar worldview. Evolution is based on direct observation of nature within the real world, and is adaptable to accommodate new information. Your beliefs are narrowly defined dogmas within a supernaturalistic framework which requires that any new information fit the allocated box, or be rejected. I marvel only that you unconsciously underlined your level of understanding by betraying your source. Happy Saturnalia.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","08:01 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","20"

Or when you state that the ""tree of life"" shows man at the top, then post a diagram of a ""tree of life"" with man below birds and plants?

Beside, I was posting that chart to show that man was at the top of the mammal line, not as a comparison to the others. But of course you guys would completely ignore that aspect of the point I was making. Also, how can you accuse me of not understanding the difference between monkeys and chimps when chimps weren't even being discussed. For example, the rhesus macaque monkey's genome reveals that humans and the macaques share about 93 percent of their DNA. (Genetic similarities differ with different monkeys)These are not insignificant similarities with the Rhesus though, yet you will boldly claim our lineage from chimps based on only 5% more genetic similarities, when it is our differences which define us as human, not our similarities. That is proven by the human and mice, and every other species which share many genetic similarities with us, yet are as vastly different from us as a common mouse is. So to answer your question directly, I don't expect you to take me seriously no matter what I say, just as I will never take you and your cohorts seriously based on the wild imaginings you claim are scientifically based conclusions. You all just prove you have no clue about what true science is as you follow this pseudo science of evolution like the religion it is for you.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","04:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","26"

What is even more incredible is that evolutionists interpret these similarities as evidence of evolution rather than all life being created by a single God who formed all life from the same original material.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","09:39 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","29"
"12-26-2008","12141",2,"None","None","None","Matthew","337972","A couple quick thoughts on something you said. Smallax: ""Actually belief system is a system that contructs [sic] the way you look at anything. I have an idea and I then reference what I believe to determine whether the idea is true or false or insignificant etc."" This is a deeply flawed epistemology. In order to determine the truth or falsity of an idea, it is simply not sufficient to compare it to other ideas. Because one could construct any number of internally consistent belief systems that are, despite that internal consistency, completely false. A person suffering from hallucinatory delusions might believe that he is, say, Napoleon. Every single experience he has, no matter how seemingly anomolous (modern technology, the modern map of Europe), can be fit into his delusional framework. Or a paranoid schizophrenic might believe that a dog he passes on his mail route is God daily ordering him to kill people. Again, his experiences can be integrated into a coherent whole without much difficulty (if someone kicks the divine dog, that person is obviously an infidel disobedient to His commands). While both individuals in question may subjectively believe that their views make sense, they have no objective purchase on reality. In each case, their worldviews are internally consistent, but also consistently false. I realize that we have no access to reality that is not constrained by subjective perspective. For that matter, we have no access to reality that is not constrained by socially mediated beliefs either. But when we seek truth -- about nature or God or anything else -- we are trying transcend those constraints. I'm with Aristotle on this one (as have been the overwhelming majority of Christian theologians, incidentally): An idea is true when the way that it says the world is, is the way the world is; an idea is false when the way that it says the world is, is not the way the world is. I realize that probably seems totally obvious. But note that it is exactly what your comment on evaluating ideas with reference to belief systems denies . Your view seems to be a brand of social constructionism or post-modernism. Which is fine-and-dandy as a corrective to those who think that we do, somehow, have unfettered access to truth (and to judge from the posts I'm seeing here, Archangel is more guilty of this than anyone else on the board). But which is not fine-and-dandy as an epistemological ideal. Just my two cents. I urge you to consider epistemological problems, namely how we ever come to know anything at all, much more deeply.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","09:54 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","30"
