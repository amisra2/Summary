"12-28-2008","12141",6,"Matthew","338083","I suspect those weren't descriptions of each article's contents. They were his allegations of the respective mistakes each article makes. So, for example, the article about the dessicated seal carcas claims and/or attempts to show that the carcas is 4600 years old. It does not claim or show that any seal carcas allegedly 4600 years old was really just 30. That's my suspicion, anyway.","tester","338136","I'd like to make a clarification here: these are not HIS allegations. He has simply copied the (demonstrably untrue) allegations of someone else. I'm fairly confident that he has never seen, let alone read, the papers in question. He doesn't even have the decency to attribute the actual source of the allegations; he seems to think that copying the citations from his source is sufficient. I'd like to add, Matthew, that I've really enjoyed reading your comments (i.e., I'm not making this clarification to criticize the thoughtful points you've made).","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","07:06 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","76"

They are as valid as your claims which are derived from the different dating systems you rely on to make your claims regarding the age of the Earth and life on it. But let me point out the irrationality of your reasoning with one of the points Pandion made in his attempt to refute me. I posted this: Radiometric dating of fossil skull 1470 show that the various methods do not give accurate measurements of ages. The first tests gave an age of 221 million years. The second, 2.4 million years. Subsequent tests gave ages which ranged from 290,000 to 19.5 million years. Palaeomagnetic determinations gave an age of 3 million years. All these readings give a 762 fold error in the age calculations. Given that only errors less than 10% (0.1 fold) are acceptable in scientific calculations, these readings show that radiometric assessment should never ever be used. John Reader, ""Missing Links"", BCA/Collins: London, 1981 p:206-209 And he rightly points out that: But fossils aren't directly dated. It's the rock around them which is dated. But according to you all, the Earth is over 4 billion years old. If you buried any animal five hundred years ago in direct contact with the Earth, and excavated it today, if its bones survived that time in direct contact with the earth at all, and you tested the earth around it, do you actually think it would reflect a buried age of 500 years? How could it when the Earth it is buried in was so much older on the day the body was deposited? The question is, how do you rely on results which claim ages for fossils based on the age of its surrounding rock which we all know is much older than the bones found in it? Even if your dating methods were absolutely accurate, how can you derive the age of the bones from it? Now I realize that I will once again be accused of just not getting it or understanding the process, and that science attempts to answer this question, but I find the answer seriously wanting. And one more thing. The quote from my post shows that multiple tests were done on the same fossil evidence and every result was different. Of course that fact was ignored as he focussed on the implication that they tested the fossil itself rather than using the standardized methodology which the process requires. Here's my evidence: 1470 Skull And Radiometric Dating Many people think radioactive dating gives a foolproof method of finding a rock's age. Richard Leakey's experience with skull 1470 shows otherwise. The fossil skull known as 1470 was found by Richard Leakey in 1972 in Kenya. It has proved a difficult skull to date. When Leakey made his find, he believed the skull was about 2.6 million years old. So he sent samples of the rock in which 1470 was found to Cam- bridge, England, for dating.1 Tests on these first samples gave an average age not of 2.6 million years, but of an incredible 221 million years!2 This was more than 218 million years too great! The scientists who did the dating decided the rock they had tested must have been contami- nated. So Leakey sent more samples. From these the scientists chose crystals that seemed fresher than others, and they came up with an age of 2.4 million years. (They later adjusted this to 2.6 million years, plus or minus 260,000 years, which agreed well with Leakey's belief before dating tests even began.) But dating work on the rock did not stop there.3 More samples were taken. More tests were done. Results this time ranged from 290,000 years up to 19.5 million years! Trying to bring some sense to the results, paleomagnetic determinations were begun.4 Leakey's 1470 fossil was then given an age of three million years. But this date drew opposition from palaeontologists who said it conflicted with the age of animal fossils from the region. Then Dr. Garniss Curtiss, from the University of California at Berkeley, said his potassium/argon tests dated the rock at 1.8 million years. Is radioactive dating reliable? Ask Richard Leakey. He was given dates ranging from 290,000 years to 221 million years for his 1470 skull, using the supposedly reliable potassium/argon method. (Based on information in Missing Links, by John Reader, BCA/Collins, London, 1981, pp. 206-209.) http://www.cai.org/files/theme-sheets/en/c/sc0028au.pdf As everyone can now see, Pandions attack on me accusing my source of testing the bone rather than the surrounding rock with his diatribe which explained the obvious, in opposition to no incorrect claims made by my original link has been shown to be completely erroneous. This also clarifies that multiple samples from the same rock was tested multiple times, and each time producing different results which should finally shut penfold and pandion up as they crawl back into their holes of self denial.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","10:26 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","77"

No, they see flaws because there are flaws, the experiments were simply not conducted right. Since evolution doesn't really deal with radiometric dating, I don't think any scientist dealing with evolution is going to say anything about it. Why? Because it is a fundamental of science, if it's not peer reviewed, and thus not subjected to further testing, how can it be accepted as true? Should we just accept anything someone says is science, without taking a further look? I did, and I highly doubt you showed that. Since it is, ofcourse, not the case. Here's basically how it works. When someone writes a research paper, that paper is then submitted to the ""peer review process"". This means that literally anyone can take the paper, conduct tests to see if it's conclusions hold, and if this is not the case, they will point this out, and earn themselves kudos in the worldwide science community. It'll be even more impressive if a non-scientist does this.
