Ah, the old empirical/mathemtatical split! ... 2. But even supposing that you're not -- i.e., supposing that I can indeed ""only believe"" all these things -- this wouldn't imply that all ""mere beliefs"" are equally plausible. Grant that I can only believe that the earth is billions of years old. I would retort that, by the same token, you can only believe that it's a few thousand years old. The question then becomes, which belief is more likely to be accurate? I think that the billions of years option is right, because it's consistent with observations and with ideas corroborated by those observations. The thousands of years idea is not. ... . And also in a way that, more ironically still, continues to strike me as an ""all beliefs are equal"" post-modern mess that makes knowledge of any kind utterly impossible.","Smallax","338100","We can know that everything tends toward disorder when left to its own devices, UNTIL we observe something tend toward order all on its own. Knowing that is different than 2+2=4. I agree. All beliefs being equal is not what I was getting at. The idea that the universe is billions of years old has nothing to do with science. I have heard of NO science that would indicate to me that the earth is millions of years old. Only 'theories' not evidence. Then some real bizarre notions that have no purpose other than make excuses for the theory. It was during the time, of millions of years, that everything 'tended toward ORDER' when left to its own devices. Perfectly formed layers laid down year after year without erosion marks all over the planet for millions of years. I can 'know' that that is unlikely. Petrified trees running though hundreds of feet of layers can help me to 'know' that all of those layers were laid down at once. So I can 'know' that the fallacies of the geologic column don't point to millions of years. I can 'know' that people choose to believe it and I can know that it is NOT because of the 'evidence' of the geologic column itself. These levels of 'knowing' anything - are not all equal.

"12-28-2008","12141",5,"Archangel","338010","Hi Lomu, welcome to the forum, I think. Here are 5 problems I have with Carbon dating. The question is, if a process is reliable, why must a target date be submitted with a sample before testing? Why isn't blind testing done if the process is consistent and reliable? 1. Carbon dating depends upon atmospheric carbon. This is not always consistent, and is partly related to sunspot cycles. 2. Carbon dating tries to get verified via dendrochronology which results in a circular reasoning problem as I pointed out above. 3. Carbon dating can give so many different results for even one sample that a target date is required to be submitted by most labs. 4. Compared to historical dates, carbon dating is systematically too young from about 100 BC back to about 2600 BC 5. There are known examples of wild discrepancies in carbon dating because of environmental circumstances. Carbon absorption from the environment varies significantly. Those are a fast five reasons. There are others but plenty of material is on the web. And every dating method has its own problems. Here's an explanation of why all dating methods have their own unique problems.

Any basic astronomy textbook could present you with the evidence, as could uncountable other sources. Then again I hate to be blunt, but you haven't been listening very hard. There's plenty out there. Here a basic earth sciences textbook would help. (And some of them include discussions of earth's place in the universe, so you might be able to address the first issue, too, if you pick your textbook wisely.) Actually, there's a readable and enjoyable discussion of these issues, and of much else besides, in Bill Bryson's Short History of Everything . (I think that's the title; I just looked on my shelf and for some reason can't find it.) Bryson is not a scientist himself, the book is written with a lay audience in mind, and he insistently keeps asking ""How do they know that?"" I highly recommend it. This seems to be the typical misunderstanding of the word ""theory"" in a scientific context. It doesn't mean speculation. Nor does it mean hypothesis. In fact, the currently accepted hypotheses about the age of the universe and of the earth are very well corroborated by scads of evidence. Look for it. Let me again recommend Bryson. Sorry, but yet again, this is just wrong. There's evidence behind these ""bizarre notions."" If you are unwilling to look for it, fine. I don't think that's terribly wise, but I can't make you do anything you don't want to. Just don't pretend the evidence isn't there. Huh? How does any of that follow? Seriously, I'm not trying to be rude, but that is just awful reasoning, with huge leaps of logic. Is this some sort of weird Henry Morris, Genesis flood thingy?

"12-28-2008","12141",5,"Archangel","338075","I'm not going to stoop to your level guys, because I realize you must insult my intelligence... In 1968 scientists dated the rocks of a Hawaiian volcano called Hualalai, using Potassium/Argon radiometric techniques. They knew that the volcano had erupted in 1800 and that the rocks were around 170 years old, but the ages they determined ranged from 160 million to 3 billion. This method of dating rocks obviously produces erroneous ages, and should not be used to factually age the earth and its geology. Journal of Geophysical Research, Vol. 73, No. 14, 1968 p:4601-4607 Different radioactive dating methods used on volcanic rock samples from Reunion Island (Indian Ocean) gave conflicting results that varied from 100,000 to 4.4 billion years. Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, Vol. 35, 1971 p:261-288 & Vol. 36, 1972 p:1167 A living water snail taken from an artesian spring in Nevada was given an assessed age of 27,000 years. Science, Vol. 224, April 6, 1984 p:58-61 Shell from living clams was 'dated' thousands of years old. Science, Vol. 141, August 16, 1963 p:634 Dried seal carcasses less than 30 years old were 'dated' as 4,600 years old. Antarctic Journal of the United States, Vol. 6, October, 1971 p:210+ A freshly killed seal was assessed at 1,300 old. Antarctic Journal of the United States, Vol. 6, October, 1971 p:210+ Radiometric dating of fossil skull 1470 show that the various methods do not give accurate measurements of ages. The first tests gave an age of 221 million years. The second, 2.4 million years. Subsequent tests gave ages which ranged from 290,000 to 19.5 million years. Palaeomagnetic determinations gave an age of 3 million years. All these readings give a 762 fold error in the age calculations. Given that only errors less than 10% (0.1 fold) are acceptable in scientific calculations, these readings show that radiometric assessment should never ever be used.

Generally, one enters into a discussion on this board in an effort to educate someone. That is fruitless in this case. So far, correcting errors of fact by Archy has only resulted in comments like the above. Thus, my responses are to the board in the hope that at least someone will learn or find some resources for learning. It would be nice if Archy would correctly cited research papers. This is a case of an intentional lie by Henry Morris that has been repeated by similar liars and dupes for years. Hawaiian lava is relatively cool and it includes pieces of unmelted rock. These are known as xenoliths. The scientists in question didn't date the lava but the xenoliths. Their purpose was to show that xenoliths could not be used to date lava flows. Only creationists are dumb enough to believe that the scientists were claiming that the dates were reliable. Absolute hogwash. The dating methods used in the two papers (incorrectly) cited was K/Ar dating. Lava flows from the oldest island dated to 2 m.y., 1.2-1.0 m.y., 0.55-0.43 m.y., and 0.35-0.07 m.y. The dates from the youngest island revealed continuous activity from about 0.36 m.y. Some investigation was done concerning U/Pb domains but no extraneous dates were found. The varying dates were caused by dating distinct flows. Any difference in dates was not because of ""conflicting results"", but from the dating of separate periods of activity. Only creationists think that all lava from a 2 m.y. old volcano should have the same date. No it wasn't. That's just the creationists misrepresentation of the facts. The source of the carbon in the snail shells was the water of the spring, which ran through very old rock and thus had dissolved HCO3 from very old biogenic sources. In other words, the source of the carbon in the snail shells was not the atmosphere. Same reason as the one above. The source of the carbon was not the atmosphere but very old biogenic carbon. I wonder what the primary source of carbon was for these seals. Seems to be a problem with marine animals, doesn't it? Could it be that their sourced of carbon might be the marine diet that gets carbon from dissolved carbon from HCO3? But fossils aren't directly dated. They can't be. What method of dating was used on KNM ER 1470? Let's just skip the rest of the post. It's just an intentional effort to deceive with half truths and outright lies. Instead, I recommend that anyone interested refer to Tim Thompson's page on Radiometric dating, or that he read G.
