The question is, if a process is reliable, why must a target date be submitted with a sample before testing? Why isn't blind testing done if the process is consistent and reliable? 1. Carbon dating depends upon atmospheric carbon. This is not always consistent, and is partly related to sunspot cycles. 2. Carbon dating tries to get verified via dendrochronology which results in a circular reasoning problem as I pointed out above. 3. Carbon dating can give so many different results for even one sample that a target date is required to be submitted by most labs. 4. Compared to historical dates, carbon dating is systematically too young from about 100 BC back to about 2600 BC 5. There are known examples of wild discrepancies in carbon dating because of environmental circumstances. Carbon absorption from the environment varies significantly. Those are a fast five reasons.

"12-26-2008","12141",4,"None","None","None","Matthew","338014","Archangel: ""Although your point accurately fits the false faith evolutionists have in this pseudo, man made science, it fails miserably when applied to believers in Christ."" Not to all believers in Christ. I have met many Christians who regard belief on the basis of faith as quite distinct from knowledge. And I've read more than a few as well. Archangel: ""You see Matthew, I do have first hand personal knowledge and experience regarding Gods interaction with human beings by way of His direct involvement in my life through supernatural intervention by way of His Holy Spirit which indwells all believers, and me personally."" And if you were content to treat that personal knowledge as something that were truly personal -- as somthing that indeed could not by its very nature be communicated to others without completely changing its meaning and significance -- well, then I don't think we'd be having this discussion. I happen to be an ardent admirer of Kierkegaard, who I think was the most insightful religious thinker of the last two centuries, bar none. ""Christianity is subjectivity"" -- now that is something for any and every believer to mull over, for a long time. ----- Archangel: ""It's true that I wasn't there during either the Creation event, or when Genesis was written. Just as you weren't there when the Earth was created or life began from your perspective."" At least we agree on something ! Archangel: ""The difference between us is that my faith in my Gods word is trustworthy, faithful and well placed because He is truly God."" I have absolutely no doubt that you are convinced of this. But I'm not convinced that your religious beliefs are even remotely correct, and it's going to take a lot more than sincerity to convince me. I want some reasons, and non-circular reasons at that. Archangel: ""But your faith"" -- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait just a minute. What do you know about "" my faith?"" Isn't it just a tad presumptuous of you to says what I believe? Okay.Back to the point. Archangel: ""But your faith is in the shallow observations of men who have completely misinterpreted the available evidence which can just more easily fit my scenario than yours."" Please be specific about the misinterpretations. Because there is a lot of evidence out there. Archangel: ""In other words Matthew, it takes more faith to believe as you do than it does for me to believe as I do..."" I disagree, because I think you're confusing ""inference"" with ""faith."" But even granting your point, if you take faith to be a good thing, then the above cannot serve as a criticism of my beliefs. Be consistent. Archangel: ""...since I personally know my God is alive and well and is not a liar."" Again, if you explored and acknowledged the constraints of that qualifier ""personally,"" I'm not sure we'd have much to argue about. Archangel: ""Therefore, even though I never personally observed what He say's about the 6 day creation event, I know He is trustworthy in His word and deed."" -sigh- Which now means that you are not going to require direct observation as a criterion of knowledge. So what we need to argue about is what reasonable criteria other than direct observation there are. And I don't think that appeals to the infallibility of literal interpretations of religious texts are reasonable. They are not literally true, as can be ascertained by the time you get through chapter 2 of Genesis. And no text is infallible, especially not just for the reason that it says so. Archangel: ""Can you say the same about the men who's science you follow? I think not."" To the contrary, I think so in the case of science. And I think so, because all science does is start with the ways that we know anything at all -- including something as simple as ""I am a human being, sitting in front of a computer"" -- and refine them so that we can know a lot more than what's right in front of us at any given time. If scientists were half as misguided as you seem to think they are about things that they cannot observe directly, then you and I wouldn't be able to have this discussion, because computers and the internet wouldn't work. ----- Archangel: ""The stick in the water which bends is a perfect example of the inconsistency and false results which evolutionists come to in every aspect of how they misinterpret the observations they claim is evidence for evolution."" Specifics please. This is just an empty declaration. It certainly doesn't address the point I made with the stick in the water example, which is that even direct observations can be misleading. ----- Archangel: ""Follow these debates for a while and you will see your evolutionist cohorts making all kinds of absolute statements of fact until I XXXX holes in them..."" All due respect, but I've been lurking for a couple weeks getting my bearings before finally now posting and entering the fray. I've looked at a lot of threads. I have yet to see you blowing holes in anything. I'm sure you disagree. But what of that? I think they've won the day, and you don't realize it. Perhaps you don't want to realize it. Archangel: ""...then they will claim science is based on ever changing input which clarifies the end result."" It is! Science is never final. If there's a better explanation of biological diversity than evolution out there, sooner or later, someone will find it, and sooner or later, it will supplant evolution. At present, neither Intelligent Design nor any other brand of creationism are anywhere close to that. Fallibilism is a big difference between science and religion -- or at least between science and fundamentalist religion. ----- Archangel: ""But in real science, there are absolute laws of physics which dictate consistent and reliable outcome."" Not true, on a number of points. First, I think it incorrect to equate ""physics"" with ""real science."" Not that physics is a false science, mind you! But just because it's useful to study fundamental forces and particles in a given way, doesn't make that way the touchstone for studying more complex systems. This was a major failing of the philosophy of science in the late 19th and early 20th century: it kept taking physics as the model for everything, and not everything is so simple. Second, there is a great deal of question about what the ""laws"" of physics are. Whether they have any causal efficacy and can therefore ""dictate"" outcomes is a very controversial idea. These days, many philosophers and scientists would say that physical laws are just formulae that we human beings construct and use to understand nature. They in no way constrain nature itself, they merely enable our knowledge of it. Finally, laws of nature allow predictions about future observations, but those predictions are rarely 100% accurate. Which makes sense, because the observations from which they were derived weren't unanimous either. There are always little discrepancies here and there. (Or do you imagine that when Newton formulated the law of gravitation, all his observations fit it perfectly? Come on!) Even if they are causal -- which is, as noted, very much in question -- laws of nature are very far from ""dicating"" what happens. Archangel: ""But not in evo. That is as fluid as an ever changing fairy tale which must constantly adjust to answer for newly discovered evidence which conflicts with and contradicts prior assumptions."" What, specifically, is the problem here? On the basis of new evidence, old assumptions are questioned. Why is that bad? ----- Archangel: ""They [scientists] call 5,000 or 10,000 year old fossils are 200 and 300 million years old, and older."" Please. If they have evidence that a fossil is only five or ten thousand years old, they call it five or ten thousand years old. If they have evidence that it's two or three hundred million years old, they call it two or three hundred million years old. Archangel: ""They have taken the same object and tested it 5 times with the same machine and come up with 5 different ages for it."" And when that happens, they try to figure out which age is right. They also try to figure out why some of the results were wrong. Again, perhaps some specifics would help here. Archangel: ""They can't accurately allow for different rates of decay since they don't know the objects age before testing it. So the whole process is based on circular reasoning at its most basic level."" What does ""different rates of decay"" mean? And how's it circular? A given radioactive isotope of carbon, say, has a particular decay rate. This rate can be ascertained independently of any fossils in which it might appear. I suppose it might vary with certain conditions, but those can also be ascertained independently of any particular fossil. And disparate conditions within a particular fossil can be accounted for. So where's the problem? ----- Archangel: ""What I marvel at is allegedly intelligent, minds of analytical scientists can't see these obvious contradictions in their methodology."" Spoken like Wonko the Sane: it's everyone else who's wrong, not you. Sorry, but that's the way I think of most creationists, and you are providing a wonderful case in point. ----- Archangel: ""This requires spiritual discernment. Something the natural man could never relate to."" And here, I think, is the root of our disagreement. You are claiming privileged access to a mode of knowledge that isn't available to others. Nothing could be further from how science operates. If you want to claim such a power that the great unwashed don't posses, fine. But for pity's sake, don't be surprised when they disagree with you, and don't waste your time trying to convince them to do otherwise. Seriously, I often wonder why creationists participate in these exchanges at all. Who are you trying to convince? Because on your very own view, you can't be trying to convince the natural man! Who, then? Who, indeed.... ----- Archangel: ""Every other belief system on Earth apart from Christ is a cult designed specifically to satisfy mans innate desire to worship God whild simultaneously leading men away from the living God. We are in a spiritual battle, but the natural man is clueless to the reality of this struggle between good and evil."" And this sort of transparently self-serving exclusivism is exactly the problem with religious conservatism. Archangel: ""This is why the bible say's that ""'f we grope out into the darkness, God will find us' and ""'f we seek the truth, the truth will set us free'. It's also why each man must seek God personally and not rely on the word of others before committing to a so called religious commitment."" But it's a rather strange version of ""everyone has to do it for themselves"" that then demands everyone to find the same ""it"" at the end of the search! Archangel: ""This might shock you but I hate religion. It is a man made concept which has led astray and corrupted countess people throughout history, many of the most powerful and most corrupted religious leaders in history have been popes who claimed to speak for God but never even knew Him personally."" And I couldn't agree more! I just think that creationism is a prime example of a concept that corrupts. Archangel: ""So Christianity isn't a religion my friend, it's a relationship with a living God who created us in His image, with free will for willing fellowship with Him as His children who have the choice, but choose to be with Him."" Maybe so, but what does that relationship have to do with literalism in the interpretation of the Biblical creation story? I regard creationism as textual idolatry , pure and simple.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","07:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","47"

"12-27-2008","12141",4,"None","None","None","Matthew","338047","It is interesting to me that after you have repeatedly -- and indignantly -- complained that all these horrible evolutionists just won't take you seriously, you have responded to less than half of what I wrote to you. If you want your opponents to take you seriously, return the favor by not wasting their time. In the interests of being pro-active about not wasting too much time myself, here are some thoughts about a few sentences from your reply. You: ""If the Genesis account is false then the whole bible is a mythical story with no real relevance to humanities fall from grace and eventual redemption through Jesus sacrifice on the Cross."" If Genesis is literally false, that does not prevent the Bible (in whole or in part) from expressing profound truths about humanity's relationship to God, our place in the universe, human nature, or the foundations of morality. The idea that one must regard religious stories as literally true in order to find them at all spiritually meaningful is simply false. You: ""If you really understood the consistency of the bible, you would understand this."" I actually understand the consistency of the Bible quite well, thanks. If you can literalize yet reconcile the two separate accounts of the order of creation in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2, by all means, do so. The citations from Paul certainly don't accomplish this. You: ""So this is the process by which we were created and fell from grace through Adam, and by which we were reunited to God through Christ. It is a spiritual reconnection, which goes beyond the understanding of the natural man. Which is why the natural man is blind to the reality of the supernatural world which exists all around them."" And if the natural man is so blind, and you cannot hope to convince him, then I repeat: just whom are you trying to convince? In the immortal words of philosopher Martin Blank: ""Who do you wanna hit, man? It isn't me."" You: ""So if Genesis is a lie, allegory or myth, and Man evolved from lower life forms, then the nature of sin is bogus, as is our fall from grace and subsequent need for reconciliation to God. That means that their was no need for Jesus to come and die for our sins, then the gospel of salvation is an unnecessary fraud. So if evolution is correct, no matter how pseudo christians attempt to marry the two belief systems, if Christ did not rise from the dead, the gospel is useless and our faith is in vain as Paul put it so eloquently."" Why? I mean, look, leave aside the fact that just about nothing is as subjective as interpreting the Bible, and that many would thus no doubt take issue with your interpretation. How would evolution's truth and Genesis' (literal) falsity make sin ""bogus"" or salvation a ""fraud?"" Are we not still sinners in need of salvation? Please explain.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","01:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","54"

And I also know that we will never agree as you will always remain in denial regarding the problems with your so called science. So here are examples of where uniformitarian dating systems of various types, and the errors they produce, with sources. Of course as a standard practice, neither evolutionists nor radiometric testers publish their erroneous or faulty results so they are hard to come by. In 1968 scientists dated the rocks of a Hawaiian volcano called Hualalai, using Potassium/Argon radiometric techniques. They knew that the volcano had erupted in 1800 and that the rocks were around 170 years old, but the ages they determined ranged from 160 million to 3 billion. This method of dating rocks obviously produces erroneous ages, and should not be used to factually age the earth and its geology. Journal of Geophysical Research, Vol. 73, No. 14, 1968 p:4601-4607 Different radioactive dating methods used on volcanic rock samples from Reunion Island (Indian Ocean) gave conflicting results that varied from 100,000 to 4.4 billion years. Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, Vol. 35, 1971 p:261-288 & Vol. 36, 1972 p:1167 A living water snail taken from an artesian spring in Nevada was given an assessed age of 27,000 years. Science, Vol. 224, April 6, 1984 p:58-61 Shell from living clams was 'dated' thousands of years old. Science, Vol. 141, August 16, 1963 p:634 Dried seal carcasses less than 30 years old were 'dated' as 4,600 years old. Antarctic Journal of the United States, Vol. 6, October, 1971 p:210+ A freshly killed seal was assessed at 1,300 old. Antarctic Journal of the United States, Vol. 6, October, 1971 p:210+ 15,000 year difference appeared in the assessment of samples from a single sample block of peat. New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics, Vol. 21, No. 4, 1978 p:463-466 Radiometric dating of fossil skull 1470 show that the various methods do not give accurate measurements of ages. The first tests gave an age of 221 million years. The second, 2.4 million years. Subsequent tests gave ages which ranged from 290,000 to 19.5 million years. Palaeomagnetic determinations gave an age of 3 million years. All these readings give a 762 fold error in the age calculations. Given that only errors less than 10% (0.1 fold) are acceptable in scientific calculations, these readings show that radiometric assessment should never ever be used. John Reader, ""Missing Links"", BCA/Collins: London, 1981 p:206-209 PICK ANY THEORY YOU LIKE Most dating methods are based on the uniformitarian method. This method measures rates of change and estimates age. There are over 80 ways of dating the earth and these ages range from 400 years total to over 100 billion. Such a wide variety of possibilities makes it impossible to tell for certain the age of the earth using that method. You can just pick and choose the date that fits your theories. This is not scientific at all. Its guessing. For the last 150 years, the age of the Earth according to evolutionists has been doubling at roughly a rate of once every 15 years. In fact, since 1900 this age has multiplied by a factor of 100! But, over 50 of the 80 methods show that the earth, solar system, and universe are young than 1 million years old. This makes evolution impossible. Heres one example with volcanoes. Volcanoes eject almost a cubic mile of material into the atmosphere each year. At this rapid rate, about 10 times the entire volume of the earths sedimentary rock should be produced in 4.6 billion years. Actually, only about 25% of the earths sediments are of volcanic origin, and much greater volcanic activity existed in the past. No means have been proposed which can remove or transform all these volcanic sediments. Earths sediments, therefore, appear to be much younger than 4.6 billion years old. In addition, fuming volcanoes are known to produce around 500 gm of gold per day in the fluids coming out of them. This is the equivalent of 18 tonnes of gold per century from just one volcano. New Scientist, November 5, 1994 p:6 (we should gave quite an incredible amount of gold...MUCH more than we do from billions of years ages...another proof of a young earth) DATES THAT DONT MATCH THE THEORY ARE DISCARDED A. Hayatsu (Department of Geophysics, University of Western Ontario, Canada), ""K-Ar isochron age of the North Mountain Basalt, Nova Scotia"",-Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, vol. 16, 1979,-""In conventional interpretation of K-Ar (potassium/argon dating method) age data, it is common to discard ages which are substantially too high or too low compared with the rest of the group or with other available data such as the geological time scale. The discrepancies between the rejected and the accepted are arbitrarily-attributed to excess or loss of argon."" In other words the potassium/argon (K/Ar) method doesn't support the uranium/lead (U/Pb) method. Richard L. Mauger, Ph.D. (Associate Professor of Geology, East Carolina University, USA), Contributions to Geology, University of Wyoming, vol. 15 (1), 1977, p. 37.-""In general, dates in the 'correct ball park' are assumed to be correct and are published, but those in disagreement with other data are seldom published nor are discrepancies fully explained."" Carbon Dating: The Technique Carbon Dating is a controversial dating technique. The method is based on the rate of decay of the radioactive carbon isotope, Carbon-14, which is formed in the upper atmosphere through the effect of cosmic ray neutrons upon Nitrogen-14. The Carbon-14 is rapidly oxidized and enters the earth's organic life through photosynthesis (plants) and the food chain (animals). Carbon-14 also enters the earth's oceans in an atmospheric exchange and as dissolved carbonate. Plants and animals, which utilize carbon in organic functions and food chains, absorb Carbon-14 during their lifetimes. The assumption is that the earth-bound carbon exists in equilibrium with the Carbon-14 in the atmosphere, which means that the number of Carbon-14 atoms and non-radioactive carbon atoms stays approximately the same over time. As soon as a plant or animal dies, it ceases its carbon intake. Thereafter, there is no replenishment of radioactive Carbon-14, only decay. In 1949, a team of scientists led by Willard Libby of the University of Chicago discovered that this decay occurs at a constant rate. They found that after 5,568 years, half the Carbon-14 in a dead sample will decay, and after another 5,568 years, half of that remaining Carbon-14 will decay, and so on. Thus, the ""half-life"" for Carbon-14 was measured by Libby and his team at 5,568?0 years. After ten half-lives, there is a miniscule amount of radioactive carbon left in a sample, which means that the limit of the Carbon Dating method is reached at between 50,000 and 60,000 years. Carbon Dating: The Controversy Carbon dating is controversial in that it shares some of the fundamental assumptions inherent to all Radiometric Dating techniques. In order for Carbon Dating to have any value, Carbon-14, produced in our outer atmosphere as Nitrogen-14 and changed into radioactive Carbon-14 by cosmic-ray bombardment, must be at equilibrium in our atmosphere. That is, the production rate must be equal to the decay rate. Based on the mathematics inherent in Libby's research, it takes approximately 30,000 years of Carbon-14 build up from a zero concentration level to reach this state of equilibrium. Recent studies indicate that Carbon-14 has not yet reached equilibrium in our atmosphere, thus indicating that the atmosphere is not yet 30,000 years old. Carbon Dating: The Use Of Dendrochronology Carbon Dating advocates have turned to Dendrochronology (tree ring dating) to help solve the ""equilibrium"" dilemma. They claim that Dendrochronology allows them to determine past concentration levels of Carbon-14 in the atmosphere, by measuring the Carbon-14 to Carbon-12 ratios in tree rings. The problem is that no trees have been shown to exceed 4,500 years in age. The Methuselah Tree in Southern California has been called the oldest living tree, and it has been dated at approximately 4,500 years. Carbon Dating advocates use tree rings from dead trees thought to overlap the Methuselah Tree to mathematically determine ages exceeding 4,500 years. They determine whether a dead tree's age overlaps the Methuselah Tree's age by ring patterns, and then they assume that the dead trees are older through a comparison of ring patterns, carbon ratios, etc. There seems to be an illogical methodology here. To complicate matters, tree ring patterns are typically inconsistent. Even living trees can show dissimilar patterns caused by differing soil nutrients, direction of prevailing sunlight, fire history, distance to water sources, etc. Carbon Dating: What Do The Experts Think? Carbon Dating can best be summed-up with the following statement by T. Save-Sodebergh and I.U. Olsson (Institute of Egyptology and Institute of Physics, respectively, University of Uppsala, Sweden) in their publication, C-14 Dating and Egyptian Chronology in Radiocarbon: ""If a C-14 date supports our theories, we put it in the main text. If it does not entirely contradict them, we put it in a footnote. And if it is completely 'out of date' we just drop it."" This illustrates the fact that accepted carbon dates are not necessarily accurate dates -- they are merely selected dates. ""It should be no surprise, then, that fully half of the dates are rejected. The wonder is, surely, that the remaining half come to be accepted"" (Robert E. Lee, ""Radiocarbon, Ages in Error,"" Anthropological Journal of Canada, Vol. 19, No.3, 1981, pp.9, 29).
