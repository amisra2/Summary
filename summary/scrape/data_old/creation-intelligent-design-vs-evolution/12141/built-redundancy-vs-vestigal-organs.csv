Whether it is so-called, vestigal organs, or what is happening in the cells. That is why communication is so tense. Creation of life advocates, recognize that built in redundancy is useful for any single organism so that it may easily adapt to many different and varied environments. Evolutionism on the other hand uses all of our current technology in microbiology to sort out 'real dna' from 'junk dna'. They assume that as evolution progressed - lots of elements of life are no longer useful. What this means is: that we will never figure out the intricate workings of the genome, no matter how much we learn about it. That is because we refuse to connect all the dots. When you began on a false premise you arrive at a false conclusion.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","09:32 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","1"
"12-23-2008","12141",1,"The Barbarian","337793","Could you rephrase that in English? There is a lot of that. Many mutations are recessive and a population over time accumulates a lot of genetic variation that can become useful if the environment changes. The founder population of lizards, for example, could have had at most, 20 alleles for any gene locus, since each lizard can only have 2. The new ones evolved by mutation. Sometimes, we can even observe that happening, or trace the mutation back to a known ancestor. Would you like to learn about it? . You're a little confused about that. It's all real DNA. Some of it just doesn't code for anything. But some parts of non-coding DNA (which you call ""junk"") has other functions besides coding for proteins. . That happens, too. For example, our gene for vitamin C is broken and no longer works. . In my lifetime, we've made huge strides, but there's a lot more to learn.. It's remarkable then, how much progress we've made. You may or may not approve of the theory, but it works very well at learning more about biology.","Smallax","337820","I'd be happy to. The concept that I was trying to move forward was: the idea that - when we see a cecal valve develop, for example, we assume that it is newly engineered data to react to the new environment. Big question mark! My point is that - the lizard was designed to survive in a neighborhood where eating leaves, was its best chance of survival. So that if a cecal valve became necessary the lizard was ready to go. Having the built-in redundancy makes this possible without missing a beat. Yes. I would. [As long as I can exercise 'critical thinking', along the way w/out personal attacks.] I never considered dna to be junk. I was using that term, [junk dna] from what I had read in various 'scientific' literature. I recognize that any dna is real dna, because it is exists. I have heard it said that it is the most complex molecule in the universe. So far be it from me to call it 'junk'. That's an interesting subject, I had not heard of that b4. Did our bodies once produce Vitamin C?. Agreed. That is why a sensible interpretation, of new data, is so important! That, my friend, is where the wisdom of interpretation - makes sense of the data. For exa.: I really have no idea what the Federal GAO has for data, but, The wisdom of giving 850 Billion to a few bankers rather than the people who actually fuel the engine of this economy - eludes me. We have a large and powerful machine, but who is driving? Very important IMHO.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","05:43 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","3"

""Ready to go"", in the sense that living things are equipped with a means of making small errors which are used by natural selection to make new structures. ... The new ones evolved by mutation. Sometimes, we can even observe that happening, or trace the mutation back to a known ancestor. Would you like to learn about it? .. We thought it would take roughly a million years for bacteria to evolve enzymes capable of digesting nylon (because the compound is so different than any they were able to digest) but it took less than a century. . Barbarian observes: It's remarkable then, how much progress we've made. You may or may not approve of the theory, but it works very well at learning more about biology. And, as you may have noticed, we've been very successful at interpreting the data. We've learned to do a lot of things as a result. One of the most important reasons scientists accept the theory is that it works.","Smallax","337880","So you really do believe that organisms ""are equipped with a means of making small errors that allow natural selection"" turn a reptile to a bird and a monkey into a man? To be ""equipped"" means there is a design feature. You are betraying your belief system. The errors can only be arbitrary and random and the organism is not equipped to function in any predetermined fashion. In the following example that you provided: What is the context of the word 'truncated'? The way I read it - it is talking about a truncated string of code or something. What was truncated? ... *more than 100 LPL gene mutations have been identified, the majority of which cause loss of enzymatic function. In contrast to this, the naturally occurring LPLS447X variant is associated with increased lipolytic function and an anti-atherogenic lipid profile and can therefore be regarded as a gain-of-function mutation. This notion combined with the facts that 20% of the general population carries this prematurely truncated LPL...* Were they able to show a previously non-existing code that mutated on a gene somewhere and created this new enzyme activity? It sounds to me that this ""new"" enzymatic activity came from non-coding dna switching on a gene to produce it. That is what one would expect to find. ...*Two new enzyme activities, 6-aminohexanoate cyclic dimer hydrolase and 6-aminohexanoate dimer hydrolase, were detected in the adapted strains.*... What is the ""Scientific Method"" of evolutionary research in contrast to the ""Scientific Method"" of Creation research? And why is your method superior?","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","09:52 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","5"
"12-24-2008","12141",1,"Barbarian","None","The evidence shows that reptiles did give rise to birds, but nothing shows monkeys became humans. Monkeys are far to evolved in their own way to give rise to us.","Archangel","337884","Got any evidence that this is a fact? How can monkeys be far too evolved to give rise to man, when #1, they share so much common DNA and #2, they are listed as a lower life form than we are? And #3, we were once allegedly tree dwellers exactly like modern monkeys still are? Nothing in their social construct reflects them being too evolved in any way. In fact it is said that prior to us becoming land dwellers, we lived in trees just as monkeys still do. So please clarify what you mean by saying that monkeys are too evolved for us to have evolved from them as it makes no sense. It seems to me, if you were being consistent, you would say that monkeys are on the same evolutionary track as Man, except that they are still in the tree bound stage of evolution. What makes no sense though is how man jumped so far ahead of these other primates which have never evolved past the level of lower life forms to evolve critical thought, the ability to reason, complex communication or sophisticated creativity even though they have existed side by side with Man, the most sophisticated environmental pressure imaginable as we have dominated every lower species for allegedly hundreds of thousands of years by now. It makes no sense that our very presence wouldn't have been a catalyst for promoting their evolution toward higher and more sophisticated reasoning and creativity. Yet it hasn't had any impact on their need to evolve at all.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","10:45 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","7"

There is no scientific method in creationism. Religion cannot use the scientific method.","Smallax","337890","Actually belief system is a system that contructs the way you look at anything. I have an idea and I then reference what I believe to determine whether the idea is true or false or insignificant etc. If I believe that - in one observed experiment there were 100+ destructive mutations while producing a percieved benefit from 1 mutation is progress; then I need to defend that belief system with rational logic or something else. Especially if that 1 mutation with the percieved benefit was the result of losing information. To me life goes on like that [generation after generation] losing information and facing destruction of genetic material would mean. Decline to extinction. Not new and wonderful living things.

LPL is the designation for a gene that encodes Lipoprotein Lipase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes lipids in lipoproteins. The actual gene encodes a protein of 475 amino acids that becomes a mature protein of 448 amino acids after cleavage of a signal peptide. One study was able to identify 3 common SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in the coding region of the gene, 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in European populations. The third SNP converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long. Thus, the enzyme has been truncated. The resulting enzyme, LPL S447X, is functional. In fact, it results in lower incidence of vascular disease and lower blood pressure. Other truncations result in non-functional enzymes.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","01:44 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","11"

I posted the evolutionary tree of life in response to his claims above and he responds by posting a genetic chart, and thinks he has refuted me when he has just changed the subject again. Now if plants, birds, fish and all lower mammals are equal to humans then how do we justify the consumption of birds, vegetables, fish and meat as we do? We are mass murderers on a monumental scale if we aren't just following our rightful authority as God intended. But evolutionists don't concern themselves with those real life contradictions between what evo believes and what exists in the real world.

What a researcher should do is learn all that he can about the real deal, as it is, then consider the deviations later. Right now no one has the authority to say what is new or previous encoded dna, because we have not identified what the dna code is really doing yet. Instead of new discoveries , we get references to 101 mutations but 1 of those coding losses protects arteries. [here's your rapid evolution in the gamete cells -101 losses of code] How about if we had a rational look and understanding of what the code is actually doing and put away the 'agenda' of evolution through mutation? or ID? or any environmental agenda?

Beside, I was posting that chart to show that man was at the top of the mammal line, not as a comparison to the others. But of course you guys would completely ignore that aspect of the point I was making. Also, how can you accuse me of not understanding the difference between monkeys and chimps when chimps weren't even being discussed. For example, the rhesus macaque monkey's genome reveals that humans and the macaques share about 93 percent of their DNA. (Genetic similarities differ with different monkeys)These are not insignificant similarities with the Rhesus though, yet you will boldly claim our lineage from chimps based on only 5% more genetic similarities, when it is our differences which define us as human, not our similarities. That is proven by the human and mice, and every other species which share many genetic similarities with us, yet are as vastly different from us as a common mouse is. So to answer your question directly, I don't expect you to take me seriously no matter what I say, just as I will never take you and your cohorts seriously based on the wild imaginings you claim are scientifically based conclusions.

Smallax: ""Actually belief system is a system that contructs [sic] the way you look at anything. I have an idea and I then reference what I believe to determine whether the idea is true or false or insignificant etc."" This is a deeply flawed epistemology. In order to determine the truth or falsity of an idea, it is simply not sufficient to compare it to other ideas. Because one could construct any number of internally consistent belief systems that are, despite that internal consistency, completely false. A person suffering from hallucinatory delusions might believe that he is, say, Napoleon. Every single experience he has, no matter how seemingly anomolous (modern technology, the modern map of Europe), can be fit into his delusional framework. Or a paranoid schizophrenic might believe that a dog he passes on his mail route is God daily ordering him to kill people. Again, his experiences can be integrated into a coherent whole without much difficulty (if someone kicks the divine dog, that person is obviously an infidel disobedient to His commands). While both individuals in question may subjectively believe that their views make sense, they have no objective purchase on reality. In each case, their worldviews are internally consistent, but also consistently false. I realize that we have no access to reality that is not constrained by subjective perspective. For that matter, we have no access to reality that is not constrained by socially mediated beliefs either. But when we seek truth -- about nature or God or anything else -- we are trying transcend those constraints. I'm with Aristotle on this one (as have been the overwhelming majority of Christian theologians, incidentally): An idea is true when the way that it says the world is, is the way the world is; an idea is false when the way that it says the world is, is not the way the world is. I realize that probably seems totally obvious. But note that it is exactly what your comment on evaluating ideas with reference to belief systems denies . Your view seems to be a brand of social constructionism or post-modernism. Which is fine-and-dandy as a corrective to those who think that we do, somehow, have unfettered access to truth (and to judge from the posts I'm seeing here, Archangel is more guilty of this than anyone else on the board).

Ah, the old empirical/mathemtatical split! But with this simple sentence, you have opened many more cans of worms than you realize. Some questions: 1. Does this ""only believe"" restriction apply to all empirical claims? Let's use ages for examples, since that was what you applied it to. Can I ""know"" that Jerusalem was founded several thousand years ago, or can I ""only believe"" it? Can I know that the United States is more than two hundred years old, or can I only believe it? Can I know that my father was born in 1948, or can I only believe it? I mean, heck, I wasn't around for any of those things. So how could I claim to know them? I think you're being a bit overly restrictive about what constitutes ""knowledge."" 2. But even supposing that you're not -- i.e., supposing that I can indeed ""only believe"" all these things -- this wouldn't imply that all ""mere beliefs"" are equally plausible. Grant that I can only believe that the earth is billions of years old. I would retort that, by the same token, you can only believe that it's a few thousand years old. The question then becomes, which belief is more likely to be accurate? I think that the billions of years option is right, because it's consistent with observations and with ideas corroborated by those observations. The thousands of years idea is not. Science is just an extension of perfectly ordinary ideas concerning how to draw inferences from empirical evidence that we all use every day. We make such inferences all the time, and even if we grant that they don't yield ""knowledge"" (which I think, as already noted, is too restrictive, but which I am willing to grant for the sake of argument), they allows us to figure out which beliefs are more accurate than other beliefs. The upshot of which is that, even if I grant your distinction, it doesn't solve the problem of whether we should believe the earth to be billions or only thousands of years old. 3. But why should we even grant the distinction in favor of mathematics being knowledge as opposed to mere belief? I mean, a lot of modern mathematics has shown what happens when you dump the basic axioms of classical mathematics. Non-Euclidean geomotry, for example, can dispense with the parallel postulate, yet still come up with useful ideas that have practical applications (ever taken a transoceanic flight?). So I'm inclined not to make a radical split between math and everything else. To sum up: I do think that you're being way to restrictive about the definition of ""knowledge."" And in a way that, ironically, even your own belief system couldn't possibly meet. And also in a way that, more ironically still, continues to strike me as an ""all beliefs are equal"" post-modern mess that makes knowledge of any kind utterly impossible.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","12:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","37"

I know of no evolutionist who has denied that humans are at the top of the food chain. We impact the entire planet in a way that no other species does. Clearly. And this has brought about some things that are undeniably good for ourselves, and even for many other organisms (e.g. domesticated plants and pets and cohabitors). It has also brought about some things that are undeniably bad for other organisms, and for ourselves as well, unfortunately. This ""all life is equal"" thing is very strange to me. I'm really not sure what you're getting at with this as a criticism. Consider monkeys and humans. If the current evolutionary view is correct, our lineage split from that of the old world monkeys about 25 million years, and from that of the new world monkeys about 15 million years before that. Over that whole span of 40 million years, the new world monkeys, old world monkeys, and apes and humans have all been evolving to deal with their different stituations. And they've all succeeded up to now. So in purely temporal terms, we've all been at it ""equally"" long. And in some highly abstract sense, I suppose we've all succeeded ""equally"" well at adapting to our diverse environments (though that's something of an apples and oranges comparison). Squirrel monkeys in the trees of the Amazon and humans across the world continue to survive and reproduce, as their parents before them and their children after. Squirrel monkeys don't have big brains, but they don't need them to do what they do. We don't have grooming claws, but we don't need them to do what we do. Why any of this should be taken as implying ""equality"" for animals, such that we should never eat them, or think that their well-being matters just as much as ours, is not at all clear. There might be reasons why we shouldn't eat animals, or why we should give them at least some moral consideration, but those have nothing to do with evolution. I mean, for pete's sake, look at Peter Singer's Animal Liberation . The opening chapter is ""All Animals are Equal."" Seems to play right into your hand, right? But seriously, look at what he says: His argument invokes capacities for pleasure and pain, not evolution at all; he doesn't think that equal consideration means equal treatment; and he explicitly casts the argument in evaluative, normative terms and not descriptive, factual terms. The argument is about ought, not is. So I can't figure out where this ""equality"" schtick is coming from. There's no good biological reason to regard humans as ""higher"" than animals. There may be good reasons to regard them that way from religious or philosophical or moral or political perspectives. Or maybe not, of course. But then we're having a different argument, that has nothing to do with evolution or biology or science. Archangel: ""My similarities to my family is evidence of a familial relationship. To suggest that it is evidence that I evolved through lower primates, and prior to that, from biological organisms is an example of that purely subjective feeling you are accusing me of in the quote below."" First, I did not suggest that your similarities to your family were evidence of your evolution from primates and earlier organisms. I suggested that your greater genetic similarities to your family than to me is evidence that you are more closely related to your family than you are to me. Second, this greater similarity is indeed indicative of a familial relationship! But this genealogical conclusion applies to all familial relationships: you relative to your family, humans generally relative to other primates, primates generally relative to other mammals, mammals relative to other vertebrates, and so on and so on. Archangel: ""This [my charge of 'argument from incredulity'] is just a tactic to avoid actually responding to the point I was making by focussing on minutia rather than the substance of my argument."" Not so. I addressed your claims quite substantively, and then pointed out that in any event, incredulity is irrelevant. What is illegitimate about that? It's just pointing out a perceived flaw in the reasoning. If you think you didn't commit the mistake, fine. But don't throw a fit about it. Explain to me why you weren't invoking your own incredulity as a reason why the reader ought to likewise find evolution unbelievable. Maybe I'm wrong. But I don't think so. And in general, I try to avoid saying things like ""I find x incredible"" or ""It's beyond me that anyone believes x."" (I probably slip up now and then, but I try.) Because it doesn't matter whether I find something unbelievable. If other people find the idea more credible than I, they won't be left incredulous by my statement of exasperation. They'll just think that I'm wrong, and probably a bit closed-minded. By the way, is it okay if I point out something about your interaction with Barbarian? He only keeps saying ""Barbarian observes"" to account for the fact that the quote function tends to omit things. He's distinguishing between (1)what he originally wrote and to which you responded, and (2) what he's now writing in response to your response.

You see Matthew, I do have first hand personal knowledge and experience regarding Gods interaction with human beings by way of His direct involvement in my life through supernatural intervention by way of His Holy Spirit which indwells all believers, and me personally. It's true that I wasn't there during either the Creation event, or when Genesis was written. Just as you weren't there when the Earth was created or life began from your perspective. The difference between us is that my faith in my Gods word is trustworthy, faithful and well placed because He is truly God. But your faith is in the shallow observations of men who have completely misinterpreted the available evidence which can just more easily fit my scenario than yours. In other words Matthew, it takes more faith to believe as you do than it does for me to believe as I do since I personally know my God is alive and well and is not a liar. Therefore, even though I never personally observed what He say's about the 6 day creation event, I know He is trustworthy in His word and deed. Can you say the same about the men who's science you follow? I think not. The stick in the water which bends is a perfect example of the inconsistency and false results which evolutionists come to in every aspect of how they misinterpret the observations they claim is evidence for evolution. Follow these debates for a while and you will see your evolutionist cohorts making all kinds of absolute statements of fact until I XXXX holes in them, then they will claim science is based on ever changing input which clarifies the end result. But in real science, there are absolute laws of physics which dictate consistent and reliable outcome. But not in evo. That is as fluid as an ever changing fairy tale which must constantly adjust to answer for newly discovered evidence which conflicts with and contradicts prior assumptions. Sure they do in a way. They call 5,000 or 10,000 year old fossils are 200 and 300 million years old, and older. They have taken the same object and tested it 5 times with the same machine and come up with 5 different ages for it. They can't accurately allow for different rates of decay since they don't know the objects age before testing it. So the whole process is based on circular reasoning at its most basic level.

Carbon dating depends upon atmospheric carbon. This is not always consistent, and is partly related to sunspot cycles. 2. Carbon dating tries to get verified via dendrochronology which results in a circular reasoning problem as I pointed out above. 3. Carbon dating can give so many different results for even one sample that a target date is required to be submitted by most labs. 4. Compared to historical dates, carbon dating is systematically too young from about 100 BC back to about 2600 BC 5. There are known examples of wild discrepancies in carbon dating because of environmental circumstances. Carbon absorption from the environment varies significantly. Those are a fast five reasons.

Not to all believers in Christ. I have met many Christians who regard belief on the basis of faith as quite distinct from knowledge. And I've read more than a few as well. Archangel: ""You see Matthew, I do have first hand personal knowledge and experience regarding Gods interaction with human beings by way of His direct involvement in my life through supernatural intervention by way of His Holy Spirit which indwells all believers, and me personally."" And if you were content to treat that personal knowledge as something that were truly personal -- as somthing that indeed could not by its very nature be communicated to others without completely changing its meaning and significance -- well, then I don't think we'd be having this discussion. I happen to be an ardent admirer of Kierkegaard, who I think was the most insightful religious thinker of the last two centuries, bar none. ""Christianity is subjectivity"" -- now that is something for any and every believer to mull over, for a long time. ----- Archangel: ""It's true that I wasn't there during either the Creation event, or when Genesis was written. Just as you weren't there when the Earth was created or life began from your perspective."" At least we agree on something ! Archangel: ""The difference between us is that my faith in my Gods word is trustworthy, faithful and well placed because He is truly God."" I have absolutely no doubt that you are convinced of this. But I'm not convinced that your religious beliefs are even remotely correct, and it's going to take a lot more than sincerity to convince me. I want some reasons, and non-circular reasons at that. Archangel: ""But your faith"" -- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait just a minute. What do you know about "" my faith?"" Isn't it just a tad presumptuous of you to says what I believe? Okay.Back to the point. Archangel: ""But your faith is in the shallow observations of men who have completely misinterpreted the available evidence which can just more easily fit my scenario than yours."" Please be specific about the misinterpretations. Because there is a lot of evidence out there. Archangel: ""In other words Matthew, it takes more faith to believe as you do than it does for me to believe as I do..."" I disagree, because I think you're confusing ""inference"" with ""faith."" But even granting your point, if you take faith to be a good thing, then the above cannot serve as a criticism of my beliefs. Be consistent. Archangel: ""...since I personally know my God is alive and well and is not a liar."" Again, if you explored and acknowledged the constraints of that qualifier ""personally,"" I'm not sure we'd have much to argue about. Archangel: ""Therefore, even though I never personally observed what He say's about the 6 day creation event, I know He is trustworthy in His word and deed."" -sigh- Which now means that you are not going to require direct observation as a criterion of knowledge. So what we need to argue about is what reasonable criteria other than direct observation there are. And I don't think that appeals to the infallibility of literal interpretations of religious texts are reasonable. They are not literally true, as can be ascertained by the time you get through chapter 2 of Genesis. And no text is infallible, especially not just for the reason that it says so. Archangel: ""Can you say the same about the men who's science you follow? I think not."" To the contrary, I think so in the case of science. And I think so, because all science does is start with the ways that we know anything at all -- including something as simple as ""I am a human being, sitting in front of a computer"" -- and refine them so that we can know a lot more than what's right in front of us at any given time. If scientists were half as misguided as you seem to think they are about things that they cannot observe directly, then you and I wouldn't be able to have this discussion, because computers and the internet wouldn't work. ----- Archangel: ""The stick in the water which bends is a perfect example of the inconsistency and false results which evolutionists come to in every aspect of how they misinterpret the observations they claim is evidence for evolution."" Specifics please. This is just an empty declaration. It certainly doesn't address the point I made with the stick in the water example, which is that even direct observations can be misleading. ----- Archangel: ""Follow these debates for a while and you will see your evolutionist cohorts making all kinds of absolute statements of fact until I XXXX holes in them..."" All due respect, but I've been lurking for a couple weeks getting my bearings before finally now posting and entering the fray. I've looked at a lot of threads. I have yet to see you blowing holes in anything. I'm sure you disagree. But what of that? I think they've won the day, and you don't realize it. Perhaps you don't want to realize it. Archangel: ""...then they will claim science is based on ever changing input which clarifies the end result."" It is! Science is never final. If there's a better explanation of biological diversity than evolution out there, sooner or later, someone will find it, and sooner or later, it will supplant evolution. At present, neither Intelligent Design nor any other brand of creationism are anywhere close to that. Fallibilism is a big difference between science and religion -- or at least between science and fundamentalist religion. ----- Archangel: ""But in real science, there are absolute laws of physics which dictate consistent and reliable outcome."" Not true, on a number of points. First, I think it incorrect to equate ""physics"" with ""real science."" Not that physics is a false science, mind you! But just because it's useful to study fundamental forces and particles in a given way, doesn't make that way the touchstone for studying more complex systems. This was a major failing of the philosophy of science in the late 19th and early 20th century: it kept taking physics as the model for everything, and not everything is so simple. Second, there is a great deal of question about what the ""laws"" of physics are. Whether they have any causal efficacy and can therefore ""dictate"" outcomes is a very controversial idea. These days, many philosophers and scientists would say that physical laws are just formulae that we human beings construct and use to understand nature. They in no way constrain nature itself, they merely enable our knowledge of it. Finally, laws of nature allow predictions about future observations, but those predictions are rarely 100% accurate. Which makes sense, because the observations from which they were derived weren't unanimous either. There are always little discrepancies here and there. (Or do you imagine that when Newton formulated the law of gravitation, all his observations fit it perfectly? Come on!) Even if they are causal -- which is, as noted, very much in question -- laws of nature are very far from ""dicating"" what happens. Archangel: ""But not in evo. That is as fluid as an ever changing fairy tale which must constantly adjust to answer for newly discovered evidence which conflicts with and contradicts prior assumptions."" What, specifically, is the problem here? On the basis of new evidence, old assumptions are questioned. Why is that bad? ----- Archangel: ""They [scientists] call 5,000 or 10,000 year old fossils are 200 and 300 million years old, and older."" Please. If they have evidence that a fossil is only five or ten thousand years old, they call it five or ten thousand years old. If they have evidence that it's two or three hundred million years old, they call it two or three hundred million years old. Archangel: ""They have taken the same object and tested it 5 times with the same machine and come up with 5 different ages for it."" And when that happens, they try to figure out which age is right. They also try to figure out why some of the results were wrong. Again, perhaps some specifics would help here. Archangel: ""They can't accurately allow for different rates of decay since they don't know the objects age before testing it. So the whole process is based on circular reasoning at its most basic level."" What does ""different rates of decay"" mean? And how's it circular? A given radioactive isotope of carbon, say, has a particular decay rate. This rate can be ascertained independently of any fossils in which it might appear. I suppose it might vary with certain conditions, but those can also be ascertained independently of any particular fossil. And disparate conditions within a particular fossil can be accounted for. So where's the problem? ----- Archangel: ""What I marvel at is allegedly intelligent, minds of analytical scientists can't see these obvious contradictions in their methodology."" Spoken like Wonko the Sane: it's everyone else who's wrong, not you. Sorry, but that's the way I think of most creationists, and you are providing a wonderful case in point. ----- Archangel: ""This requires spiritual discernment. Something the natural man could never relate to."" And here, I think, is the root of our disagreement. You are claiming privileged access to a mode of knowledge that isn't available to others. Nothing could be further from how science operates. If you want to claim such a power that the great unwashed don't posses, fine. But for pity's sake, don't be surprised when they disagree with you, and don't waste your time trying to convince them to do otherwise. Seriously, I often wonder why creationists participate in these exchanges at all. Who are you trying to convince? Because on your very own view, you can't be trying to convince the natural man! Who, then? Who, indeed.... ----- Archangel: ""Every other belief system on Earth apart from Christ is a cult designed specifically to satisfy mans innate desire to worship God whild simultaneously leading men away from the living God. We are in a spiritual battle, but the natural man is clueless to the reality of this struggle between good and evil."" And this sort of transparently self-serving exclusivism is exactly the problem with religious conservatism. Archangel: ""This is why the bible say's that ""'f we grope out into the darkness, God will find us' and ""'f we seek the truth, the truth will set us free'. It's also why each man must seek God personally and not rely on the word of others before committing to a so called religious commitment."" But it's a rather strange version of ""everyone has to do it for themselves"" that then demands everyone to find the same ""it"" at the end of the search! Archangel: ""This might shock you but I hate religion. It is a man made concept which has led astray and corrupted countess people throughout history, many of the most powerful and most corrupted religious leaders in history have been popes who claimed to speak for God but never even knew Him personally."" And I couldn't agree more! I just think that creationism is a prime example of a concept that corrupts.

If you want your opponents to take you seriously, return the favor by not wasting their time. In the interests of being pro-active about not wasting too much time myself, here are some thoughts about a few sentences from your reply. You: ""If the Genesis account is false then the whole bible is a mythical story with no real relevance to humanities fall from grace and eventual redemption through Jesus sacrifice on the Cross."" If Genesis is literally false, that does not prevent the Bible (in whole or in part) from expressing profound truths about humanity's relationship to God, our place in the universe, human nature, or the foundations of morality. The idea that one must regard religious stories as literally true in order to find them at all spiritually meaningful is simply false. You: ""If you really understood the consistency of the bible, you would understand this."" I actually understand the consistency of the Bible quite well, thanks. If you can literalize yet reconcile the two separate accounts of the order of creation in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2, by all means, do so. The citations from Paul certainly don't accomplish this. You: ""So this is the process by which we were created and fell from grace through Adam, and by which we were reunited to God through Christ. It is a spiritual reconnection, which goes beyond the understanding of the natural man. Which is why the natural man is blind to the reality of the supernatural world which exists all around them."" And if the natural man is so blind, and you cannot hope to convince him, then I repeat: just whom are you trying to convince? In the immortal words of philosopher Martin Blank: ""Who do you wanna hit, man? It isn't me."" You: ""So if Genesis is a lie, allegory or myth, and Man evolved from lower life forms, then the nature of sin is bogus, as is our fall from grace and subsequent need for reconciliation to God. That means that their was no need for Jesus to come and die for our sins, then the gospel of salvation is an unnecessary fraud. So if evolution is correct, no matter how pseudo christians attempt to marry the two belief systems, if Christ did not rise from the dead, the gospel is useless and our faith is in vain as Paul put it so eloquently."" Why? I mean, look, leave aside the fact that just about nothing is as subjective as interpreting the Bible, and that many would thus no doubt take issue with your interpretation. How would evolution's truth and Genesis' (literal) falsity make sin ""bogus"" or salvation a ""fraud?"" Are we not still sinners in need of salvation?

So here are examples of where uniformitarian dating systems of various types, and the errors they produce, with sources. Of course as a standard practice, neither evolutionists nor radiometric testers publish their erroneous or faulty results so they are hard to come by. In 1968 scientists dated the rocks of a Hawaiian volcano called Hualalai, using Potassium/Argon radiometric techniques. They knew that the volcano had erupted in 1800 and that the rocks were around 170 years old, but the ages they determined ranged from 160 million to 3 billion. This method of dating rocks obviously produces erroneous ages, and should not be used to factually age the earth and its geology. Journal of Geophysical Research, Vol. 73, No. 14, 1968 p:4601-4607 Different radioactive dating methods used on volcanic rock samples from Reunion Island (Indian Ocean) gave conflicting results that varied from 100,000 to 4.4 billion years. Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, Vol. 35, 1971 p:261-288 & Vol. 36, 1972 p:1167 A living water snail taken from an artesian spring in Nevada was given an assessed age of 27,000 years. Science, Vol. 224, April 6, 1984 p:58-61 Shell from living clams was 'dated' thousands of years old. Science, Vol. 141, August 16, 1963 p:634 Dried seal carcasses less than 30 years old were 'dated' as 4,600 years old. Antarctic Journal of the United States, Vol. 6, October, 1971 p:210+ A freshly killed seal was assessed at 1,300 old. Antarctic Journal of the United States, Vol. 6, October, 1971 p:210+ 15,000 year difference appeared in the assessment of samples from a single sample block of peat. New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics, Vol. 21, No. 4, 1978 p:463-466 Radiometric dating of fossil skull 1470 show that the various methods do not give accurate measurements of ages. The first tests gave an age of 221 million years. The second, 2.4 million years. Subsequent tests gave ages which ranged from 290,000 to 19.5 million years. Palaeomagnetic determinations gave an age of 3 million years. All these readings give a 762 fold error in the age calculations. Given that only errors less than 10% (0.1 fold) are acceptable in scientific calculations, these readings show that radiometric assessment should never ever be used. John Reader, ""Missing Links"", BCA/Collins: London, 1981 p:206-209 PICK ANY THEORY YOU LIKE Most dating methods are based on the uniformitarian method. This method measures rates of change and estimates age. There are over 80 ways of dating the earth and these ages range from 400 years total to over 100 billion. Such a wide variety of possibilities makes it impossible to tell for certain the age of the earth using that method. You can just pick and choose the date that fits your theories. This is not scientific at all. Its guessing. For the last 150 years, the age of the Earth according to evolutionists has been doubling at roughly a rate of once every 15 years. In fact, since 1900 this age has multiplied by a factor of 100! But, over 50 of the 80 methods show that the earth, solar system, and universe are young than 1 million years old. This makes evolution impossible. Heres one example with volcanoes. Volcanoes eject almost a cubic mile of material into the atmosphere each year. At this rapid rate, about 10 times the entire volume of the earths sedimentary rock should be produced in 4.6 billion years. Actually, only about 25% of the earths sediments are of volcanic origin, and much greater volcanic activity existed in the past. No means have been proposed which can remove or transform all these volcanic sediments. Earths sediments, therefore, appear to be much younger than 4.6 billion years old. In addition, fuming volcanoes are known to produce around 500 gm of gold per day in the fluids coming out of them. This is the equivalent of 18 tonnes of gold per century from just one volcano. New Scientist, November 5, 1994 p:6 (we should gave quite an incredible amount of gold...MUCH more than we do from billions of years ages...another proof of a young earth) DATES THAT DONT MATCH THE THEORY ARE DISCARDED A. Hayatsu (Department of Geophysics, University of Western Ontario, Canada), ""K-Ar isochron age of the North Mountain Basalt, Nova Scotia"",-Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, vol. 16, 1979,-""In conventional interpretation of K-Ar (potassium/argon dating method) age data, it is common to discard ages which are substantially too high or too low compared with the rest of the group or with other available data such as the geological time scale. The discrepancies between the rejected and the accepted are arbitrarily-attributed to excess or loss of argon."" In other words the potassium/argon (K/Ar) method doesn't support the uranium/lead (U/Pb) method. Richard L. Mauger, Ph.D. (Associate Professor of Geology, East Carolina University, USA), Contributions to Geology, University of Wyoming, vol. 15 (1), 1977, p. 37.-""In general, dates in the 'correct ball park' are assumed to be correct and are published, but those in disagreement with other data are seldom published nor are discrepancies fully explained."" Carbon Dating: The Technique Carbon Dating is a controversial dating technique. The method is based on the rate of decay of the radioactive carbon isotope, Carbon-14, which is formed in the upper atmosphere through the effect of cosmic ray neutrons upon Nitrogen-14. The Carbon-14 is rapidly oxidized and enters the earth's organic life through photosynthesis (plants) and the food chain (animals). Carbon-14 also enters the earth's oceans in an atmospheric exchange and as dissolved carbonate. Plants and animals, which utilize carbon in organic functions and food chains, absorb Carbon-14 during their lifetimes. The assumption is that the earth-bound carbon exists in equilibrium with the Carbon-14 in the atmosphere, which means that the number of Carbon-14 atoms and non-radioactive carbon atoms stays approximately the same over time. As soon as a plant or animal dies, it ceases its carbon intake. Thereafter, there is no replenishment of radioactive Carbon-14, only decay. In 1949, a team of scientists led by Willard Libby of the University of Chicago discovered that this decay occurs at a constant rate. They found that after 5,568 years, half the Carbon-14 in a dead sample will decay, and after another 5,568 years, half of that remaining Carbon-14 will decay, and so on. Thus, the ""half-life"" for Carbon-14 was measured by Libby and his team at 5,568?0 years. After ten half-lives, there is a miniscule amount of radioactive carbon left in a sample, which means that the limit of the Carbon Dating method is reached at between 50,000 and 60,000 years. Carbon Dating: The Controversy Carbon dating is controversial in that it shares some of the fundamental assumptions inherent to all Radiometric Dating techniques. In order for Carbon Dating to have any value, Carbon-14, produced in our outer atmosphere as Nitrogen-14 and changed into radioactive Carbon-14 by cosmic-ray bombardment, must be at equilibrium in our atmosphere. That is, the production rate must be equal to the decay rate. Based on the mathematics inherent in Libby's research, it takes approximately 30,000 years of Carbon-14 build up from a zero concentration level to reach this state of equilibrium. Recent studies indicate that Carbon-14 has not yet reached equilibrium in our atmosphere, thus indicating that the atmosphere is not yet 30,000 years old. Carbon Dating: The Use Of Dendrochronology Carbon Dating advocates have turned to Dendrochronology (tree ring dating) to help solve the ""equilibrium"" dilemma. They claim that Dendrochronology allows them to determine past concentration levels of Carbon-14 in the atmosphere, by measuring the Carbon-14 to Carbon-12 ratios in tree rings. The problem is that no trees have been shown to exceed 4,500 years in age. The Methuselah Tree in Southern California has been called the oldest living tree, and it has been dated at approximately 4,500 years. Carbon Dating advocates use tree rings from dead trees thought to overlap the Methuselah Tree to mathematically determine ages exceeding 4,500 years. They determine whether a dead tree's age overlaps the Methuselah Tree's age by ring patterns, and then they assume that the dead trees are older through a comparison of ring patterns, carbon ratios, etc. There seems to be an illogical methodology here. To complicate matters, tree ring patterns are typically inconsistent. Even living trees can show dissimilar patterns caused by differing soil nutrients, direction of prevailing sunlight, fire history, distance to water sources, etc. Carbon Dating: What Do The Experts Think? Carbon Dating can best be summed-up with the following statement by T. Save-Sodebergh and I.U. Olsson (Institute of Egyptology and Institute of Physics, respectively, University of Uppsala, Sweden) in their publication, C-14 Dating and Egyptian Chronology in Radiocarbon: ""If a C-14 date supports our theories, we put it in the main text. If it does not entirely contradict them, we put it in a footnote. And if it is completely 'out of date' we just drop it."" This illustrates the fact that accepted carbon dates are not necessarily accurate dates -- they are merely selected dates. ""It should be no surprise, then, that fully half of the dates are rejected. The wonder is, surely, that the remaining half come to be accepted"" (Robert E. Lee, ""Radiocarbon, Ages in Error,"" Anthropological Journal of Canada, Vol. 19, No.3, 1981, pp.9, 29).

Generally, one enters into a discussion on this board in an effort to educate someone. That is fruitless in this case. So far, correcting errors of fact by Archy has only resulted in comments like the above. Thus, my responses are to the board in the hope that at least someone will learn or find some resources for learning. It would be nice if Archy would correctly cited research papers. This is a case of an intentional lie by Henry Morris that has been repeated by similar liars and dupes for years. Hawaiian lava is relatively cool and it includes pieces of unmelted rock. These are known as xenoliths. The scientists in question didn't date the lava but the xenoliths. Their purpose was to show that xenoliths could not be used to date lava flows. Only creationists are dumb enough to believe that the scientists were claiming that the dates were reliable. Absolute hogwash. The dating methods used in the two papers (incorrectly) cited was K/Ar dating. Lava flows from the oldest island dated to 2 m.y., 1.2-1.0 m.y., 0.55-0.43 m.y., and 0.35-0.07 m.y. The dates from the youngest island revealed continuous activity from about 0.36 m.y. Some investigation was done concerning U/Pb domains but no extraneous dates were found. The varying dates were caused by dating distinct flows. Any difference in dates was not because of ""conflicting results"", but from the dating of separate periods of activity. Only creationists think that all lava from a 2 m.y. old volcano should have the same date. No it wasn't. That's just the creationists misrepresentation of the facts. The source of the carbon in the snail shells was the water of the spring, which ran through very old rock and thus had dissolved HCO3 from very old biogenic sources. In other words, the source of the carbon in the snail shells was not the atmosphere. Same reason as the one above. The source of the carbon was not the atmosphere but very old biogenic carbon. I wonder what the primary source of carbon was for these seals. Seems to be a problem with marine animals, doesn't it? Could it be that their sourced of carbon might be the marine diet that gets carbon from dissolved carbon from HCO3? But fossils aren't directly dated. They can't be. What method of dating was used on KNM ER 1470? Let's just skip the rest of the post. It's just an intentional effort to deceive with half truths and outright lies.

They are as valid as your claims which are derived from the different dating systems you rely on to make your claims regarding the age of the Earth and life on it. But let me point out the irrationality of your reasoning with one of the points Pandion made in his attempt to refute me. I posted this: Radiometric dating of fossil skull 1470 show that the various methods do not give accurate measurements of ages. The first tests gave an age of 221 million years. The second, 2.4 million years. Subsequent tests gave ages which ranged from 290,000 to 19.5 million years. Palaeomagnetic determinations gave an age of 3 million years. All these readings give a 762 fold error in the age calculations. Given that only errors less than 10% (0.1 fold) are acceptable in scientific calculations, these readings show that radiometric assessment should never ever be used. John Reader, ""Missing Links"", BCA/Collins: London, 1981 p:206-209 And he rightly points out that: But fossils aren't directly dated. It's the rock around them which is dated. But according to you all, the Earth is over 4 billion years old. If you buried any animal five hundred years ago in direct contact with the Earth, and excavated it today, if its bones survived that time in direct contact with the earth at all, and you tested the earth around it, do you actually think it would reflect a buried age of 500 years? How could it when the Earth it is buried in was so much older on the day the body was deposited? The question is, how do you rely on results which claim ages for fossils based on the age of its surrounding rock which we all know is much older than the bones found in it? Even if your dating methods were absolutely accurate, how can you derive the age of the bones from it? Now I realize that I will once again be accused of just not getting it or understanding the process, and that science attempts to answer this question, but I find the answer seriously wanting. And one more thing. The quote from my post shows that multiple tests were done on the same fossil evidence and every result was different. Of course that fact was ignored as he focussed on the implication that they tested the fossil itself rather than using the standardized methodology which the process requires. Here's my evidence: 1470 Skull And Radiometric Dating Many people think radioactive dating gives a foolproof method of finding a rock's age. Richard Leakey's experience with skull 1470 shows otherwise. The fossil skull known as 1470 was found by Richard Leakey in 1972 in Kenya. It has proved a difficult skull to date. When Leakey made his find, he believed the skull was about 2.6 million years old. So he sent samples of the rock in which 1470 was found to Cam- bridge, England, for dating.1 Tests on these first samples gave an average age not of 2.6 million years, but of an incredible 221 million years!2 This was more than 218 million years too great! The scientists who did the dating decided the rock they had tested must have been contami- nated. So Leakey sent more samples. From these the scientists chose crystals that seemed fresher than others, and they came up with an age of 2.4 million years. (They later adjusted this to 2.6 million years, plus or minus 260,000 years, which agreed well with Leakey's belief before dating tests even began.) But dating work on the rock did not stop there.3 More samples were taken. More tests were done. Results this time ranged from 290,000 years up to 19.5 million years! Trying to bring some sense to the results, paleomagnetic determinations were begun.4 Leakey's 1470 fossil was then given an age of three million years. But this date drew opposition from palaeontologists who said it conflicted with the age of animal fossils from the region. Then Dr. Garniss Curtiss, from the University of California at Berkeley, said his potassium/argon tests dated the rock at 1.8 million years. Is radioactive dating reliable? Ask Richard Leakey. He was given dates ranging from 290,000 years to 221 million years for his 1470 skull, using the supposedly reliable potassium/argon method.

The scientists at Cambridge didn't date the fossil itself. Most people who have an interest in the topic have at least a basic knowledge of what is being talked about. Thus, when a scientist says that the fossil was dated, anyone who knows at least the basics understands that it was not the fossil that was directly dated. This presents a problem when someone with no understanding of the subject reads that scientists dated a fossil. Later that same ignorant person reads his own cut and paste and finds that it was the rock around the fossil that was dated. That's how he arrived at his assertion that the same specimen was dated by the same machine 5 times and yielded 5 different dates. Notice the failure to support that assertion when asked several times, and then citing a cut and paste that doesn't say anything about the same specimen. Isn't that a remarkable lack of integrity? Not enough self respect to stand up and admit his error. At any rate, the fossil under discussion is KNM ER 1470 , found at Koobi Fora on the east side of Lake Turkana in Kenya in 1972. The fossil itself has never been directly dated because that would be impossible. In fact, the rock in which it was embedded has never been dated. That isn't what the scientists at Cambridge dated. It is sedimentary rock, very soft and weathered at the site. The fossil was weathering out of the soil. As anyone who has even made a slight effort to learn the basics knows, sedimentary rock cannot be dated radiometrically. The reason is that the sediment is obviously composed of particles of much older rock that has weathered, been transported to the site, and then re-lithified. The rocks wouldn't yield any sort of meaningful date in relation to the fossil and when it was buried. Most fossils are buried in sedimentary rock and thus neither the rock nor the fossils are datable. The fossil itself is rock that was formed as the organic material was replaced by minerals over hundreds of thousands of years. Only creationists would believe that scientists try to date such material. So what was dated, you ask? Volcanic material from a single stratum known as the KBS Tuff. The original testing was preliminary, done on two different samples from near the site, some volcanic ash and some feldspar crystals. The method used on each was K-AR, i.e., Potassium/Argon dating. When rocks are hot argon gas is able to escape easily. When the rock cools, argon is trapped. Thus, new volcanic flows contain no argon gas. However, the rocks contain potassium, of which a known percentage is K-40. K-40 is unstable and decays to Ar-40. The K-Ar ratio, when measured establishes the radiometric date of the sample. KNM ER 1470 was found in sedimentary rock below the KBS Tuff and is thus, older than the tuff. So you see, even from the first, there was no dating of the same sample 5 times. But the problem was in the collecting of samples. Several samples from the tuff returned varying dates between 1.9 my and 2.6 my. In fact, samples from the tuff were dated at least 41 times. Studies of the area show that the disparity of dates was caused by three factors: difficulty in identifying the correct tuff horizontally across the area, contamination of the tuff by older volcanic deposits, and ""overprinting"", specific events of heat, pressure, or chemical environment that alter the composition of the exposed minerals (for example, by allowing argon gas to escape). Subsequent work has indicated that the tuff is about 1.8 mya. But the youngest date for the KBS Tuff was around 1.8 my, which means that KNM ER 1470 is around 2 mya. Creationists have to deny this since it does not fit a 6,000 year old earth.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","08:35 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","106"

It got sorted out because they used different methods to date the rocks, which were better suited to the environment. Of course, since a fossil was already exposed, it makes sense that there would be contamination, not to mention the lava rocks too. I've already known that you can't date lava rocks.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","09:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","107"

Creationists like to date mafic inclusions (unmelted rocks from earlier eruptions that have been included in an eruption). That is why the KBS Tuff was thought to be reliable. At the time, the scientists didn't expect contamination. The KBS Tuff isn't lava. It is volcanic ash that was spread much farther than the lava. My brother lived in Billings, MT when Mount St. Helens erupted. Volcanic ash covered everything. But it wasn't lava. But that layer of volcanic ash will be datable by geologists some thousands of years in the future. Except when erosion of superimposed layers exposes the volcanic layer. Then, when another volcanic eruption occurs, the ash falls on previous volcanic ash. It confuses radiometric dating. Such seems to be the case at the Koobi Fora. Really hot lava, when it was extruded, is really good for certain types of radiometric dating. When it comes to relatively cool lava, like in Hawaii, one must be careful to avoid mafic inclusions.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","02:07 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","110"

I found a couple of trees running through 2 distinct coal seams. One was 30' tall another was 12'. The following website refers to the most popular of all - our own petrified forest. If you go to the site, consider figure 6. Google Image Result for http://www.grisda.org/origins/images/24017-12.jpg Petrified wood and trees are found in numerous locations around the world, but the Yellowstone Petrified Forests are unusual because of the many levels stacked one upon another. In 1960 Erling Dorf of Princeton University studied the Amethyst Mountain Fossil Forest and counted 27 levels.8 I have plotted 31 levels on Mount Hornaday on the west side of the Soda Butte Creek Valley (Figure 4). The greatest sequence of superimposed fossil forest levels is located in the Specimen Creek area where 65 or more levels can be counted (Table 1). Other areas with fewer levels are Mt. Norris on the east side of Soda Butte Creek Valley (5 levels), Specimen Ridge flanking the Lamar Valley (15 levels), and Cache Creek (26 levels).9 Multiple levels are also seen at Miller Creek northeast of the Lamar Valley, in Tom Minor Basin (including Ramshorn Peak), and in the Stratified Primitive Area. Scattered trees and petrified wood can be found throughout the northern region of Yellowstone Park and other surrounding areas.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","06:13 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","117"
"12-31-2008","12141",8,"The Barbarian","338367","I'm not aware of an entire tree being fossilized. Usually, it's just a portion of the trunk. It's going on in a reservoir near me, as muck accumulates over trees submerged when a dam produced a lake. In the right conditions, the environment is hypoxic, and not much rotting takes place. If it's not disturbed for a long time, we get petrified trees, usually polystrate, because the process goes on for several periods of time. Say a grove of trees is flooded by some kind of lake-forming event (landlslide say) and then over a number of decades, several floods deposit layers of sediment. Eventually, the land changes, dries, and the muck compacts to rock. Standing polystrate tree fossils result. Not very common, but they do exist.","Smallax","338438","I have heard that explanation b4 and the trouble is that the root balls could not have formed and fossilized at the same level as their neighbors' stems. If a mudslide came into your area and buried the trunk upto 12' you could not expect a root ball to form in the 4-10 foot level above original grade. [That assumes the original trees survived the mudslide and continued to mineralized.]","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","06:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","118"
