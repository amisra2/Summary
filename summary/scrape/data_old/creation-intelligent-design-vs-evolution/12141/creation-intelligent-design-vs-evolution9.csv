If the dunes then settle and harden, the trees were never covered with water or wet earth, and yet they can petrify.","Smallax","338482","I thought that was mummification. Do you have any good sources observing the process and explaining what is actually taking place? Interesting.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","09:46 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","122"
"01-01-2009","12141",9,"The Barbarian","338441","They didn't start the process at the same time. That's why they are polystrate. Sure you could. In fact that can be seen happening. At Mt. St. Helens, many trees near the lake were partially or fully buried. Later, trees grew on the new ground, with root balls higher then trees buried in the first level.","Smallax","338483","The root ball would start at the same level where the top of its neighbor rotted off. The most you could expect for overlap is the depth of the stump from the crown down. Speaking of Mt. St. Helens, what is the status of those trees in Spirit Lake?","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","09:52 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","123"

Give it a few million extra years.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","11:04 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","125"

If I was interested in doing research in a vacuum why would I need a forum? I would hope that this forum serves some useful purpose other than name calling and bashing one another.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","11:19 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","126"
"01-04-2009","12141",9,"The Barbarian","338860","Spirit lake does not now exist there. Many of the trees are deeply buried, some still sticking out of the ash, and others completely covered. As new trees take hold, they grow down into the ash, and overlap with the old trees.","Smallax","338888","It will be fun to see how long it takes those things to fossilize. Seems like that was ideal conditions for the process. Interesting article about sand dune fossilization of those crustaceans. Is there a way to tell the difference, between wet and dry fossilization? Has it ever been done in a lab or observed in another setting? This last line makes me wonder if they were saying these things were fossilized in the sand dune but was under the sea for a while : ""This could be due to a fall in sea level associated with glacial eustasy in the last ice age. (author abst.)"" What do you make of it?","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","07:58 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","129"
