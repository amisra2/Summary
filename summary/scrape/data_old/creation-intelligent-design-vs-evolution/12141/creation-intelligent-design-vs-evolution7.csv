"12-30-2008","12141",7,"Archangel","338149","It's the rock around them which is dated. But according to you all, the Earth is over 4 billion years old. If you buried any animal five hundred years ago in direct contact with the Earth, and excavated it today, if its bones survived that time in direct contact with the earth at all, and you tested the earth around it, do you actually think it would reflect a buried age of 500 years? How could it when the Earth it is buried in was so much older on the day the body was deposited? The question is, how do you rely on results which claim ages for fossils based on the age of its surrounding rock which we all know is much older than the bones found in it? Even if your dating methods were absolutely accurate, how can you derive the age of the bones from it? Now I realize that I will once again be accused of just not getting it or understanding the process, and that science attempts to answer this question, but I find the answer seriously wanting. And one more thing. The quote from my post shows that multiple tests were done on the same fossil evidence and every result was different. Of course that fact was ignored as he focussed on the implication that they tested the fossil itself rather than using the standardized methodology which the process requires. Here's my evidence: As everyone can now see, Pandions attack on me accusing my source of testing the bone rather than the surrounding rock with his diatribe which explained the obvious, in opposition to no incorrect claims made by my original link has been shown to be completely erroneous. This also clarifies that multiple samples from the same rock was tested multiple times, and each time producing different results which should finally shut penfold and pandion up as they crawl back into their holes of self denial.","pandion","338228","But that's not what you said. Now that your error has been pointed out, you seem to have a better, but not correct, grasp of what it said. You actually don't have a clue, do you? You continue to make yourself look foolish when you post such mindless drivel. Are you sure? Do you even know what is being dated? I guess it is preferable to look foolish than to learn what you are talking about. So you are aware that you don't understand what you are talking about? Funny. If you don't understand, how can you justify rejecting the science? Sorry, your quote doesn't say that, so clearly you don't even understand what your own quote is saying. The fossil evidence was never dated simply because fossils could not be directly dated back then. No. Several of us focused on that because that is what you claimed. You said that the same sample was tested 5 times by the same method and came up with 5 different results. That isn't the case. Your incorrect statements are about the dating of the KBS tuff. Of course, what your creationist site doesn't tell you is that the same sample wasn't dated. Several types of sample were obtained and several different methods were used to date them K/Ar and Ar/Ar for two. Of course, you don't know enough to know that you have been lied to and you just buy into it. It's not evidence. It is wrong and clearly you didn't even understand it. No. I didn't attack you. I pointed out that your statement was wrong. No matter how you try to move the goal posts, you claimed that the same fossil had been dated 5 times by the same machine with different results. That never was true and that isn't even what you quote says. You are correct in stating that I pointed out the obvious. But you didn't recognize it as obvious. You were incorrect and lacked the knowledge to know that. Again, not what you said. But never mind, the samples weren't from the same rock anyway. Please have the integrity to educate yourself before you speak.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","12:56 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","92"

He may be the best professional geologist for making complex ideas understandable to the layman.","Matthew","338237","I love the way in the very first ""proposal,"" the RATE team plans to ""increase evidence"" for their hypothesis. Not to test whether their hypothesis is true or not , but to increase the evidence for it. It's very indicative of the fundamental flaw in all forms of creationist thinking: start with a conclusion and try to make the evidence corroborate it, rather than start with a hypothesis and test it. Makes you wonder why the bother, don't it?","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","07:24 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","93"
"12-30-2008","12141",7,"Matthew","338108","I'm sorry to be so blunt, but that's false. Any basic astronomy textbook could present you with the evidence, as could uncountable other sources. ... Huh? How does any of that follow? Seriously, I'm not trying to be rude, but that is just awful reasoning, with huge leaps of logic. Is this some sort of weird Henry Morris, Genesis flood thingy? If you're interested in a more technical but still layman's audience account, check out Richard Fortey's Earth .","Smallax","338242","Sorry to be so long to respond, but have been ill over the Christmas period.

That is where I have come up with the opinion that they are interesting. I have not yet ordered the dvd from the RATE project yet. They have already covered the the 4 'assumptions' of radiometric dating, for many years now, so not sure what they need to address as far as the ""deeper questions about the conflicts..."" Let me know what you are referring to then that will give me something to consider as I study it. Thanks. Of course I am still waiting on the deeper questions about the petrification process.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","08:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","103"
"12-30-2008","12141",7,"The Barbarian","338266","Normally, it has to be buried, in a hypoxic envirionment. Over time, it very slowly decays, but minerals perfuse in and replace the organic material a little at a time. Eventually a mineralized copy of the organism is preserved.","Smallax","338312","Thanks Barbarian, Can this process take place while standing in open air for several thousand years of deposition? In other words, if there is 70 feet of petrified tree, what environment is necessary for that trunk to slowly decay as the minerals perfuse in?","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","08:13 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","104"

So, if a tree falls down in mud, that can happen.
