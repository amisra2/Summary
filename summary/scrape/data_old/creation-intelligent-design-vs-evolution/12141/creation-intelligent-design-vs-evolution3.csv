Actually, there are plenty of evolutionists who recognize that we're at the top of the food chain. They just think that's because of evolution, not divine fiat. Moreover, they don't think that saying that all organisms that presently exist are equally evolved is the same thing as saying that they're all equally valuable . Your posts seem to conflate a lot of different ideas about (1)evolution, both in (a) its 19th-century, oft-ideological man-at-the-pinnacle variety and (b) its contemporary, more effectively value-neutral form, (2) environmental policy concerns, and (3) animal rights concerns. Evolution does not decide the value questions of what we ought to do concerning the environment or animals. Archangel: ""... in favor of judging our standing according to some biological determination which simply confirms that because all life exists on Earth, all life on Earth shares similarities on a genetic level."" And here, I have no idea what you're talking about. Could you explain the relevance of this statement? I don't see what your trying to criticize. Archangel: ""What is even more incredible is that evolutionists interpret these similarities as evidence of evolution rather than all life being created by a single God who formed all life from the same original material."" Is this it? That evolutionists see genetic similarity as evidence of evolutionary relationships rather than creation? Two things. One: You are more genetically similar to your relatives than you are to me. The genetic similarity is indicative of common descent in your lineage. If you don't think so, then you should push for throwing out all genetic tests for paternity or forensics. Two: What you find ""incredible"" is irrelevant.

"12-26-2008","12141",3,"Matthew","337972","A couple quick thoughts on something you said. Smallax: ""Actually belief system is a system that contructs [sic] the way you look at anything. I have an idea and I then reference what I believe to determine whether the idea is true or false or insignificant etc."" This is a deeply flawed epistemology. In order to determine the truth or falsity of an idea, it is simply not sufficient to compare it to other ideas. Because one could construct any number of internally consistent belief systems that are, despite that internal consistency, completely false. A person suffering from hallucinatory delusions might believe that he is, say, Napoleon. Every single experience he has, no matter how seemingly anomolous (modern technology, the modern map of Europe), can be fit into his delusional framework. Or a paranoid schizophrenic might believe that a dog he passes on his mail route is God daily ordering him to kill people. Again, his experiences can be integrated into a coherent whole without much difficulty (if someone kicks the divine dog, that person is obviously an infidel disobedient to His commands). While both individuals in question may subjectively believe that their views make sense, they have no objective purchase on reality. In each case, their worldviews are internally consistent, but also consistently false. I realize that we have no access to reality that is not constrained by subjective perspective. For that matter, we have no access to reality that is not constrained by socially mediated beliefs either. But when we seek truth -- about nature or God or anything else -- we are trying transcend those constraints. I'm with Aristotle on this one (as have been the overwhelming majority of Christian theologians, incidentally): An idea is true when the way that it says the world is, is the way the world is; an idea is false when the way that it says the world is, is not the way the world is. I realize that probably seems totally obvious. But note that it is exactly what your comment on evaluating ideas with reference to belief systems denies . Your view seems to be a brand of social constructionism or post-modernism. Which is fine-and-dandy as a corrective to those who think that we do, somehow, have unfettered access to truth (and to judge from the posts I'm seeing here, Archangel is more guilty of this than anyone else on the board). But which is not fine-and-dandy as an epistemological ideal. Just my two cents. I urge you to consider epistemological problems, namely how we ever come to know anything at all, much more deeply.","Smallax","337976","That was a long way around to explain what I meant, because I didn't see anything that I would disagree with.

Ah, the old empirical/mathemtatical split! But with this simple sentence, you have opened many more cans of worms than you realize. Some questions: 1. Does this ""only believe"" restriction apply to all empirical claims? Let's use ages for examples, since that was what you applied it to. Can I ""know"" that Jerusalem was founded several thousand years ago, or can I ""only believe"" it? Can I know that the United States is more than two hundred years old, or can I only believe it? Can I know that my father was born in 1948, or can I only believe it? I mean, heck, I wasn't around for any of those things. So how could I claim to know them? I think you're being a bit overly restrictive about what constitutes ""knowledge."" 2. But even supposing that you're not -- i.e., supposing that I can indeed ""only believe"" all these things -- this wouldn't imply that all ""mere beliefs"" are equally plausible. Grant that I can only believe that the earth is billions of years old. I would retort that, by the same token, you can only believe that it's a few thousand years old. The question then becomes, which belief is more likely to be accurate? I think that the billions of years option is right, because it's consistent with observations and with ideas corroborated by those observations. The thousands of years idea is not. Science is just an extension of perfectly ordinary ideas concerning how to draw inferences from empirical evidence that we all use every day. We make such inferences all the time, and even if we grant that they don't yield ""knowledge"" (which I think, as already noted, is too restrictive, but which I am willing to grant for the sake of argument), they allows us to figure out which beliefs are more accurate than other beliefs. The upshot of which is that, even if I grant your distinction, it doesn't solve the problem of whether we should believe the earth to be billions or only thousands of years old. 3. But why should we even grant the distinction in favor of mathematics being knowledge as opposed to mere belief? I mean, a lot of modern mathematics has shown what happens when you dump the basic axioms of classical mathematics. Non-Euclidean geomotry, for example, can dispense with the parallel postulate, yet still come up with useful ideas that have practical applications (ever taken a transoceanic flight?). So I'm inclined not to make a radical split between math and everything else. To sum up: I do think that you're being way to restrictive about the definition of ""knowledge."" And in a way that, ironically, even your own belief system couldn't possibly meet. And also in a way that, more ironically still, continues to strike me as an ""all beliefs are equal"" post-modern mess that makes knowledge of any kind utterly impossible.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","12:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","37"

Why do you hold us to a higher, or different standard of deducing what is true than you yourselves require regarding evolution?"" No cop out whatsoever. If you require direct observation for knowledge, then you will very quickly find yourself unable to know much of anything. And it has nothing to do with evolution specifically. It's a general point of epistemology. The reason I brought it up is that I was curious to know how far you would be willing to go with the requirement. I'm going to presume, for example, that you were not present either when God created the world, or when those events were described by the author of Genesis. So since you have no direct observation of them, and you yourself have required direct observation for knowledge, how can you reasonably claim to know how God did it (or even that He did, for that matter), or how accurate the Biblical description is? I am not exercising any double standard here. I'm simply asking you to apply the very standard you yourself requested to your own views.

They have reasons and evidence for why they consider a given fossil to be of a given age. Why are they wrong? Archangel: ""...as the Word of God, His Holy Spirit supernaturally inspired the writers of the bible, so the bible calls itself and is in fact Gods Word, thus, it is the word of God."" But why should I believe the Bible when it says that? If a Muslim made similar claims about the Koran, or a Hindu about the Bhagavad-Gita, why shouldn't I agree with them instead of you? Or if you were conversing with a Muslim or Hindu who thought his holy book of choice were divinely inspired, to what would you appeal to convince them otherwise? Appealing to your own is probably not going to do the trick. Any more than their appeals to their holy texts would convince you to drop your religion and convert to theirs.

I know of no evolutionist who has denied that humans are at the top of the food chain. We impact the entire planet in a way that no other species does. Clearly. And this has brought about some things that are undeniably good for ourselves, and even for many other organisms (e.g. domesticated plants and pets and cohabitors). It has also brought about some things that are undeniably bad for other organisms, and for ourselves as well, unfortunately. This ""all life is equal"" thing is very strange to me. I'm really not sure what you're getting at with this as a criticism. Consider monkeys and humans. If the current evolutionary view is correct, our lineage split from that of the old world monkeys about 25 million years, and from that of the new world monkeys about 15 million years before that. Over that whole span of 40 million years, the new world monkeys, old world monkeys, and apes and humans have all been evolving to deal with their different stituations. And they've all succeeded up to now. So in purely temporal terms, we've all been at it ""equally"" long. And in some highly abstract sense, I suppose we've all succeeded ""equally"" well at adapting to our diverse environments (though that's something of an apples and oranges comparison). Squirrel monkeys in the trees of the Amazon and humans across the world continue to survive and reproduce, as their parents before them and their children after. Squirrel monkeys don't have big brains, but they don't need them to do what they do. We don't have grooming claws, but we don't need them to do what we do. Why any of this should be taken as implying ""equality"" for animals, such that we should never eat them, or think that their well-being matters just as much as ours, is not at all clear. There might be reasons why we shouldn't eat animals, or why we should give them at least some moral consideration, but those have nothing to do with evolution. I mean, for pete's sake, look at Peter Singer's Animal Liberation . The opening chapter is ""All Animals are Equal."" Seems to play right into your hand, right? But seriously, look at what he says: His argument invokes capacities for pleasure and pain, not evolution at all; he doesn't think that equal consideration means equal treatment; and he explicitly casts the argument in evaluative, normative terms and not descriptive, factual terms. The argument is about ought, not is. So I can't figure out where this ""equality"" schtick is coming from. There's no good biological reason to regard humans as ""higher"" than animals. There may be good reasons to regard them that way from religious or philosophical or moral or political perspectives. Or maybe not, of course. But then we're having a different argument, that has nothing to do with evolution or biology or science. Archangel: ""My similarities to my family is evidence of a familial relationship. To suggest that it is evidence that I evolved through lower primates, and prior to that, from biological organisms is an example of that purely subjective feeling you are accusing me of in the quote below."" First, I did not suggest that your similarities to your family were evidence of your evolution from primates and earlier organisms. I suggested that your greater genetic similarities to your family than to me is evidence that you are more closely related to your family than you are to me. Second, this greater similarity is indeed indicative of a familial relationship! But this genealogical conclusion applies to all familial relationships: you relative to your family, humans generally relative to other primates, primates generally relative to other mammals, mammals relative to other vertebrates, and so on and so on. Archangel: ""This [my charge of 'argument from incredulity'] is just a tactic to avoid actually responding to the point I was making by focussing on minutia rather than the substance of my argument."" Not so. I addressed your claims quite substantively, and then pointed out that in any event, incredulity is irrelevant. What is illegitimate about that? It's just pointing out a perceived flaw in the reasoning. If you think you didn't commit the mistake, fine. But don't throw a fit about it. Explain to me why you weren't invoking your own incredulity as a reason why the reader ought to likewise find evolution unbelievable. Maybe I'm wrong. But I don't think so. And in general, I try to avoid saying things like ""I find x incredible"" or ""It's beyond me that anyone believes x."" (I probably slip up now and then, but I try.) Because it doesn't matter whether I find something unbelievable. If other people find the idea more credible than I, they won't be left incredulous by my statement of exasperation. They'll just think that I'm wrong, and probably a bit closed-minded. By the way, is it okay if I point out something about your interaction with Barbarian? He only keeps saying ""Barbarian observes"" to account for the fact that the quote function tends to omit things. He's distinguishing between (1)what he originally wrote and to which you responded, and (2) what he's now writing in response to your response. Putting him on ignore for that seems a trifle... trifling.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","01:33 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","39"

You see Matthew, I do have first hand personal knowledge and experience regarding Gods interaction with human beings by way of His direct involvement in my life through supernatural intervention by way of His Holy Spirit which indwells all believers, and me personally. It's true that I wasn't there during either the Creation event, or when Genesis was written. Just as you weren't there when the Earth was created or life began from your perspective. The difference between us is that my faith in my Gods word is trustworthy, faithful and well placed because He is truly God. But your faith is in the shallow observations of men who have completely misinterpreted the available evidence which can just more easily fit my scenario than yours. In other words Matthew, it takes more faith to believe as you do than it does for me to believe as I do since I personally know my God is alive and well and is not a liar. Therefore, even though I never personally observed what He say's about the 6 day creation event, I know He is trustworthy in His word and deed. Can you say the same about the men who's science you follow? I think not. The stick in the water which bends is a perfect example of the inconsistency and false results which evolutionists come to in every aspect of how they misinterpret the observations they claim is evidence for evolution. Follow these debates for a while and you will see your evolutionist cohorts making all kinds of absolute statements of fact until I XXXX holes in them, then they will claim science is based on ever changing input which clarifies the end result. But in real science, there are absolute laws of physics which dictate consistent and reliable outcome. But not in evo. That is as fluid as an ever changing fairy tale which must constantly adjust to answer for newly discovered evidence which conflicts with and contradicts prior assumptions. Sure they do in a way. They call 5,000 or 10,000 year old fossils are 200 and 300 million years old, and older. They have taken the same object and tested it 5 times with the same machine and come up with 5 different ages for it. They can't accurately allow for different rates of decay since they don't know the objects age before testing it. So the whole process is based on circular reasoning at its most basic level. What I marvel at is allegedly intelligent, minds of analytical scientists can't see these obvious contradictions in their methodology. Archangel: ""...as the Word of God, His Holy Spirit supernaturally inspired the writers of the bible, so the bible calls itself and is in fact Gods Word, thus, it is the word of God.""

Something the natural man could never relate to. Every other belief system on Earth apart from Christ is a cult designed specifically to satisfy mans innate desire to worship God whild simultaneously leading men away from the living God. We are in a spiritual battle, but the natural man is clueless to the reality of this struggle between good and evil. This is why the bible say's that ""if we grope out into the darkness, God will find us"" and ""if we seek the truth, the truth will set us free"". It's also why each man must seek God personally and not rely on the word of others before committing to a so called religious commitment. This might shock you but I hate religion. It is a man made concept which has led astray and corrupted countess people throughout history, many of the most powerful and most corrupted religious leaders in history have been popes who claimed to speak for God but never even knew Him personally. So Christianity isn't a religion my friend, it's a relationship with a living God who created us in His image, with free will for willing fellowship with Him as His children who have the choice, but choose to be with Him.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","03:19 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","40"
