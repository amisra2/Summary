There are many ways of discrediting the person. Call them names. Talk about their lies. Show them to be unworthy. Tell how they are unintelligent, crazy or otherwise undesirable, inferior and not worth listening to, let alone believing. To discredit the topic or argument, indicate how it is patently absurd, proven to be false or that only fools would support it. Now name me one of you guys that doesn't poison the well as a standard practice in debating every single person on this forum that you disagree with?","Matthew","340691","Have I called you names, Archie?

On multiple occasions you have attacked my literalist view of interpreting the bible as being motivated by our personal value system. But what you don't and couldn't know is that prior to being saved I was just like everyone else here who's acting in the flesh rather than the spirit. I have been where you're at, but you haven't seen through my eyes or else you would agree with me on spiritual issues which you currently disagree with and debate against ad infinitum. Just because you're blind to what I see, it doesn't mean that you are any where near being right in what you perceive to be true. You can't even make the connection that when a verse in the New Testament is speaking about the Lord, that it is referring to Jesus Christ, the Messiah. There is no possible way a spirit filled believer could be blind to such an obvious reference to Messiah. Jesus said: Jhn 17:14 I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world. Jhn 17:15 My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one. Jhn 17:16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of it. Jhn 17:17 Sanctify [fn] them by the truth; your word is truth. By questioning the word of God you are questioning Gods truth Matthew. And you and I are from different worlds which is why you can't relate to where I'm coming from spiritually, just as the Lord is not of this world and you can't relate to Him either. If you could, you would clearly see that the Lord is Jesus. He also said this: Mat 10:22 And you will be hated by all for My name's sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved. Mat 10:23 When they persecute you in this city, flee to another. For assuredly, I say to you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes. Mat 10:24 ""A disciple is not above [his] teacher, nor a servant above his master. Mat 10:25 It is enough for a disciple that he be like his teacher, and a servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, [fn] how much more [will they call] those of his household! Mat 10:26 Therefore do not fear them. For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, and hidden that will not be known. See verse 22 Matt? It should haunt you that all of the deniers of God on this forum have no problem at all with your version of Christianity. If you were representing the gospel truth here, they would hate you just as they hate me and the other christians who defend Christ against their lies and perversions of Gods truth. See verses 23 and 24? You should expect to be persecuted for defending Christ, just as He was persecuted by dying for your sins. But your beliefs don't offend the unbelievers here. They don't have any problem at all with your version of christianity because all you do is claim to be a believer as you deny the power there of. And as I said before; I'm not saying this to attack you but to wake you up to the hypocrisy which you represent by promoting spiritual lies as you insist they are truths. You are doing more harm than good from the perspective of Gods truth being nullified in favor of fleshly doctrines and interpretations. Verses 25 and 26 are obvious to me. Can you discern what they are saying?","global-conspiracy-scientists","12:12 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","696"

Some of the revisions are fairly substantial. Just thought you should know.] Archie, it is my contention that everyone's interpretation of the Bible is motivated by contingencies of his personal value system, and by much else besides. This applies to the authors of the Bible themselves, to the founders of Christianity, to you, and even -- it should go without saying, but for clarity's sake, I must mention it -- to me. But I have never said that the fact that it reflects your personal values is why your view (or anyone else's) is false. To do so would clearly be ad hominem. And if that's what you think I've done, then you've misunderstood me. As to my other complaints, however, those still stand. I have never called you a ""pseudo-Christian"" or a ""mental midget."" I have never questioned the sincerity of your beliefs or declared you spiritually dead. I have never presumed to know anything about your personal relationship with God. And I have certainly never placed myself on a ""higher plane of understanding"" than you or any other poster. I am mighty sick and tired of repeatedly receiving such abuse in an ostensibly reasonable discussion. That's great, Archie. I have found some of your personal comments quite moving. But how do they solve any of the issues in this debate? This doesn't even hold up in the Gospels. The first use of ""Lord"" in the New Testament (NIV) is at Matthew 1:20, with its reference to ""an angel of the Lord ."" The term appears throughout the Christmas story, and during neither that passage nor what follows can ""Lord"" be described as an unambiguous reference to the Person of the Son. Compare similar passages in the beginning of Luke. Note, for example, Luke 1:31-33, when the angel visits Mary: Or moving to the stage after Jesus' birth, consider Matthew 22: 34-40, an account of ""the Greatest Commandment"": Compare Mark 12: 28-31 or Luke 10:25-28 for two other accounts, both of which also depict Jesus Himself using the expression ""the Lord your God."" That's just a handful of passages from the Gospels. The letters of Paul are also filled with references to ""the Lord."" Many of these unambiguously refer to Christ, for they say things like ""our Lord Jesus Christ."" But many of them are every bit as ambiguous as the one that occasioned this dispute in the first place, using ""the Lord"" without qualification of any Person. In any event, I believe your contention, that when it appears in the New Testament, the word ""Lord"" must be interpreted as a reference to the Son, is erroneous. Not so. Even if the narratives aren't literally true, they may still reveal the truth. You can keep making this charge, but it will never hold water. When are you going to learn that, since I do not regard the Bible as literal, infallible, or authoritative, that appealing to it is not enough to convince me of anything? In the first place, I do not believe that the criticism here amounts to ""hate."" In the second, I do not think that persecution is a sufficient indicator of rectitude.","global-conspiracy-scientists","08:14 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","657"

It is clearly Jesus, the Son, who will be given the throne of David by ""the Lord God."" So I daresay the author was not saying that the Son would give the throne of David to himself. So I think if my refusal to accept ""Lord"" as an unambiguous reference to Jesus Christ indicates something horrible about my spiritual discernment to you, you are not reading the Bible all that closely. Not so. Even if the words aren't literally true, they may reveal God's truths. So you can keep making this charge, but it will never hold water.

If the Holy Spirit indwelled you, you would know and believe that it's inspired by God at every level of your being. It doesn't matter what your motivation is Matt, the fact is that you are more dedicated to debating every aspect of my interpretation of the bible than you are in correcting the deniers of God and His word. You claim to be a follower of Christ yet you are dividing the house by opposing an alleged brother in Christ rather than defending Christ with Him against those who slander and blaspheme God here. You are a blatant hypocrite in your denials and inconsistencies as a so called believer. Look at subaru's blasphemies? Have you once spoken against him/her? No! in fact once you even referred to his post in a complimentary fashion as you attack my beliefs. But you just don't get it, do you! Sorry if the truth offends you Matt. You are free to either not respond to my posts or to put me on ignore. If you don't spew your shallow fleshly interpretations of the bible as you oppose me, I wont expose them or you for what they/you are. They were attempts to reach YOU with the truth Matt. I'm not here to hurt you or beat you. I'm trying to get you to look inward and to see your spiritual need which can only be satisfied by a personal relationship with the living God. Sure it can, and it does. Because the Son, in His eternal position is the Word of God and Lord of all who spoke creation into existence. So the Angel of the Lord was referring to the same person who was to be born to Mary. He even makes it clearer by attributing her pregnancy to the Holy Spirit. How many Lords could the bible be referring to Matt, under such a circumstance? The problem is that you don't have the Holy Spirit to guide you according to the promise Jesus made to us before He left to prepare a place for us with Him. If you did, this would be a no brainer for you. True, this reference is to Lord God the Father. Again, it's obvious and this time you recognized it accurately. Did I say that every single reference to the Lord in the bible was referring to Jesus? Absolutely NOT. All I said is that your inability to tell when it does is very telling about your spiritual condition. You are attempting to interpret the word with the flesh, and I'm trying to tell you that it isn't possible. Only through the power of the Holy Spirit does Gods word come alive to us. This isn't to say that you can't get where you need to be. I'm only saying that you aren't there yet, spiritually speaking. Again you corrupt what I say. I never said that every reference to the Lord was an unambiguous reference to Jesus. Maybe that's true in your mind, but it isn't true to God. And in the final analysis that is all that matters. When are you going to realize that this statement is all the evidence that's required to prove that you aren't a born again christian/believer in Christ as you falsely claim to be. If the Holy Spirit indwelled you according to the promises of Jesus Christ the Savior, you would never make such a statement. You couldn't make such a statement. This is why my statement is absolutely true that you have more in common with the atheists, the secular humanists and the unbelievers than you have with me. So please stop claiming to be a member of the family of God and a believer who just happens to disagree with a fellow believer Matt. Because we have absolutely nothing at all in common. We are literally from different worlds my friend. And I have no problem relating to you on that level at all. Nor answering your questions. But to lie to these other unbelievers while claiming the authority of a true believer as you deny the power there of is a serious sin which God will not look kindly on. I repeat Jesus prayer to the Father before dying for our sins, on behalf of TRUE believers. Jhn 17:14 I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world. Jhn 17:15 My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one. Jhn 17:16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of it. Jhn 17:17 Sanctify [fn] them by the truth; ""your"" word is truth. If Gods truth was evident in you, this passage would be fulfilled within you. See the bolded Matthew? The word is the bible which Jesus is calling Gods truth. Your statement above means you are calling both Jesus and Father God a liar. Would a true believer be able to do that? The answer is no. By denying the truth of Gods word you deny God Himself. I don't know how many different ways I can clarify this for you. But with each new post you write, you just further prove how lost you are. Sorry, but it's better that you know the truth of your standing rather than waste a lifetime piously denying the truth of your true standing with the living God. Only after accepting that truth can you move on to find the whole truth which only comes by way of the word of God.","global-conspiracy-scientists","08:56 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","1057"

Jhn 3:5 Jesus answered, ""Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.

Jhn 3:9 Nicodemus said to Him, ""How can these things be?"" Jhn 3:10 Jesus answered and said to him, ""Are you the teacher of Israel and do not understand these things?
