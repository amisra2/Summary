"01-20-2009","12202",10,"Matthew","340962","It might have, but it doesn't. As it happens, I was very busy yesterday. And I will be for the foreseeable future as well, so I'm generally going to be participating less here. No, Archie, I really don't. The simple fact is this: You and I are not discussing anything. Per your own view, I can't understand you. And per your own view, you have no need to understand me. The whole exchange has thus reduced to you arrogantly presuming to tell me about my own relationship with God and me uselessly mounting a defense against someone who refuses a priori to accept it. I'm not doing it any longer. Instead, I will spend my now-more-limited time on this forum engaging posters other than yourself. Feel free to interpret this explanation in terms of whatever character flaws of mine you like.","Archangel","340978","The fact is Matthew, that you have self righteously challenged me on every single scriptural principle I have shared since you arrived. But rather than back down from your very incorrect personal opinions regarding my knowledge of Gods word and what it means to have a personal relationship with Him according to the gospel, I challenged you with the word itself which never comes back void. Now since you realize you can't defeat that truth which has corrected every misconception and shallow personal opinion you have offered, you are again, and very consistently attempting to put the blame on me for simply doing what these forums dictate, and that is to debate the issues and prove our positions. But you know that your positions are unsupportable according to the bible you claim to accept on the one hand but oppose in every debate in which you support whatever view opposes the scriptural perspective. And what I find so sad is that you seem blind to the fact that if you're not for God, then you are against Him. You just posted on another thread that even if evolution was proven wrong, that doesn't mean that another natural method for our existence apart from creation isn't how we got here. I find that opinion incredible coming from a believer who say's he has a personal relationship with the God of the Genesis account in the bible. But you can't even see the hypocrisy in your inconsistent position. So claim your status as a victim of this bully christian who is only trying to share Gods truth according to His word with you. But had you not self righteously challenged and erroneously opposed every spiritual truth I have shared since you became a member, I never would have had to support my beliefs with the scriptures itself which you can't oppose. That is why you're walking away from debating me. It isn't because I have arrogantly told you about your relationship with God at all. It's because I have sincerely and honestly shown you that you are kidding yourself to claim you have one. And I've done it with Gods word which is the litmus test for all believers to judge their relationship with Him by. Once again Matt, Jesus said it best, so I will allow Him to summarize my thoughts for you. Luk 6:46 ""Why do you call Me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say? Luk 6:47 ""Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and acts on them, I will show you whom he is like: Luk 6:48 he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock; and when a flood occurred, the torrent burst against that house and could not shake it, because it had been well built. Luk 6:49 ""But the one who has heard and has not acted {accordingly,} is like a man who built a house on the ground without any foundation; and the torrent burst against it and immediately it collapsed, and the ruin of that house was great."" Think of this parable every time you align yourself with atheists, evolutionists and secular humanists as you stand with them against Gods truths which you claim to accept but never defend.","global-conspiracy-scientists","11:44 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","136"

To sum up: Matthew is stupid, blind and generally wrong having only shallow unsupportable personal opinions, whereas Archie must be right because he 'knows' god, knows exactly what each verse of the bible means, and thus cannot possibly be wrong, and should not be questioned on any matter. This as it stands is absolute and irrevocable proof that Archie is completely infallible. However, to paraphrase Captain Edmund Blackadder, there is one tiny flaw in this argument. It is bollocks.","global-conspiracy-scientists","12:43 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","138"
"01-20-2009","12202",10,"Archangel","340990","Good. Because you can't since you know I'm correct.","Matthew","340996","Whatever you say, Archie. Whatever you say.","global-conspiracy-scientists","01:03 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","141"

"01-20-2009","12202",10,"Archangel","341011","Once again Matthew rips a statement out of context in order to distorts what was said so as to make a fallacious point. Notice what smiley said below which I was responding to. Notice how strongly he claimed me to be completely infallible which I denied of course. You are so uninformed regarding the attribute of infallibility that you attribute it to me just for being certain about the issue of salvation according to the Gospel of Christ which I AM absolutely correct about. Either that, or you're dishonestly attempting to claim that I do think myself to be infallible just for confidently defending the single issue of the salvation process. So which is Matt? Are you just ignorant or being dishonest? I mean, every believer knows that only God is infallible and can NEVER be wrong. So I expect such an accusation coming from smiley, but once again you disappoint me since you prefer to promote the lie from an atheist rather than defend the truth I offer you.","smiley","341029","But you don't offer the truth. Your lies on this forum have been catalogued on many occasions for all to see. How you can keep up the pretence that you represent the truth is beyond me.","global-conspiracy-scientists","05:11 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","146"
"01-20-2009","12202",10,"Archangel","341035","Speaking of being truthful, you just quoted my response to your lie that I am infallible, and I refuted that lie so now you come back as inconsistent as ever and talk about being truthful. WE WERE DISCUSSING INFALLIBILITY SMILEY, IS IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO STAY ON POINT? OR WILL YOU JUST GO FROM INSULT TO INSULT ATTEMPTING TO MAKE A HIT ON ME?","smiley","341039","I have not insulted you in the least. I merely speak the truth. You should try it some time.","global-conspiracy-scientists","06:21 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","148"
