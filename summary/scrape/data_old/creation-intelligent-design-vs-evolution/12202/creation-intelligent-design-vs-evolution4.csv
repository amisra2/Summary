You've been doing this for years now, it really does get old. Remember this one of yours; There were two of yours to Archangels one this time, wasn't there? Just about anytime in the past when you've corrected me, there were MORE errors of yours. It's clear to me who the blatant liar is.","pandion","340162","Good for you to recognize a typo. I am aware that Archy's use of ""mad"" was a typo. I guess you aren't aware of that use for the [sic] . But then, you aren't aware of much beyond superstition and magic. However, I do stand by the post that you cited. I have often had to correct your dismal spelling, not to mention your faulty logic and failure to educate yourself about a topic before offering opinions. Yes. Did you have a point? Yet another lie. Your spelling is horrendous, your logic is faulty, and you allow yourself to be duped by simpletons. How bright can you be if you believe that a magical man living in the sky poofed everything into being from nothing last Thursday? I do note that you can't actually respond to the content of my posts. That is understandable, given your level of education, ability to reason, and mental acuity. See the last sentence of the previous paragraph.","global-conspiracy-scientists","11:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","46"

Someone who claims that a magical, invisible, eternal being who magically popped everything that we see, just as we see it, into existance only a few thousand years ago, including all of the evidence to show that she didn't do it, is actually serious? And you actually fall for it?","global-conspiracy-scientists","11:46 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","47"

She called them gills because that is what she was lead to believe, and you adding the word - slits, doesn't change the lie to truth.","global-conspiracy-scientists","06:23 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","48"

"01-14-2009","12202",4,"pandion","340089","Yes. Your posts are typically quite ridiculous and most usually just rants with lots of meaningless quotes from your book of mythology. There have been efforts by creationists to impose their religion into religion classes my whole life. First there were efforts to exclude the teaching of biology from biology classes and to replace it with religious magic. Then there were efforts for ""equal time"" for the idiocy of ""creation science."" More recently, there were the efforts by the Kansas State Board of Education to remove evolution from the curriculum (yet again) and thereby reduce biology to a series of unrelated observations to memorize. And of course, there was the Dover, PA school board that tried to force their religion into biology classes. Most of these have been decided by court cases, wasting public money on court cases the could have been decided with just a little thought in the first place. In all cases, the religion of creationism has been prohibited from science classes. Idiocy does not merit equal time with science. But I didn't say that. I said that creationists are trying to force their religion on everyone. As mentioned above, in the schools. Chief Justice Moore of the Alabama Supreme court placed a huge erection that memorialized religion in the court building. And there have been efforts to establish a national religion. In fact, at the time that the Constitution was written, most states had established, official state religions. We've been listening to so called christians whining about a christian nation ever since. Again you post without thought. It's pretty silly to claim that objections to the imposition of your religion by law are somehow efforts to establish another religion. The lack of your religion is not a religion. Atheism is a religion in the same way that baldness is a hair color. Personally, I could give a rats tootie about establishing any religion. I like the Constitution just the way it is. You are free to practice your religion in any way you want in your home, your church, and even on the streets. As long as you don't obstruct traffic, you are free to stand on street corners and wave your book of mythology over your head and shout at passers by, just as so many of your fellow christians do. I laugh at those almost as much as I laugh at your rants on this board. Again, you put no thought into your post. Your religion didn't make this country great. One of the factors that did contribute to the greatness of this country was the exclusion of religion from the national Constitution and the disestablishment of state religions and the replacement of them with guarantees of religious freedom. I base my opinion on having studied the topic extensively. If you are interested in learning about the Revolutionary and Constitutional periods of History, I can recommend about 20 histories of the time that deal with the topic for you. I own about 15 myself. Attempting to teach your religion as science in schools is an attempt to impose your religion on everyone, even though you don't seem to be able to grasp that. Wrong. There was lots of forcing. By the way, the first case that decided that students could not be forced to recite the Pledge was brought by a christian family. Their particular cult forbade such demonstrations. Even after that, students have still been forced to recite the pledge. To claim otherwise is an admission of ignorance. And somehow you don't see the recitation of prayers of your religion as forcing your religion on students of other faiths? Of course, you wouldn't object to equal time for Muslims, Buddhists, Shintoists, Wiccans and various christian cults (including your own). And how about equal time for atheists to stand and declare what utter nonsense it is to worship magical beings while everyone bows their heads and then answers ""amen""? And that isn't a religious celebration? So your are saying that Chirst was a fake? He wasn't a religious figure? And yes, such displays shouldn't be in the state houses or the courts. If you want to put such silly things in front of your church, feel free. That's what the 1st Amendment says. Worship as you will but you can't use the government to do so. Yet more ranting without thought. Yes, I agree that creationism should not be imposed on students in public schools because it is religion. The school is a department of government and as such is forbidden by the 1st and 14th Amendments from any acts that would support or endorse religion, not to mention that Pledges, prayers, and creationism interferes with the free practice of my religion.","Archangel","340198","Meaningless to you pandion; since you don't have the spiritual insight to recognize the truth from the actual man made mythologies which guide your perverted world view. And why isn't brother Matthew jumping in here to defend the bible against being referred to as meaningless mythology? That's another lie. We have attempted to keep your side from excluding us where we were historically present. Again you lie. They were attempting to keep your side from teaching a theory as if it was a fact. The only XXXXXX are those who so fear creationism you will make every effort to erase it from any and all curriculums. Show me science and I'll embrace it. But your man made fairy tale of evo is the ultimate joke on a dumbed down america, and it only took 40 years to accomplish the secular humanist agenda. Of course in your twisted rationale a STATES judge placing the 10 commandments on the court house steps is equivalent to passing a state sponsored bill forcing all americans to become christians. Do you see why you have no credibility as a rational thinker? But like a typical extremist, you must take one innocent example and attempt to apply it to the whole group? On the other hand, the agenda of the left to erase any mention or recognition of God or a spiritual perspective is being erased on a National scale in every aspect of our Society. From the Federal to the State to the public schools. Speaking of rants; what do you call this irrational tirade? And I have already shown that the Court of appeals has declared atheism a religion. A post you never responded to, I might add. Your ignorance and denial of the fact that the moral foundation this Country was built upon, lies directly in the Judeo-Christian ethic is understandable given your anathema to christianity. But that ignorance in no way proves your point. No it isn't. It's our attempt to preserve the other side of the debate by keeping the spiritual perspective alive in the minds of our youth so they will be free to question our origins other than through the scientific method referred to as evolution which we believe is false and misleading. As much as that disturbs you, if you really endorsed free though, you wouldn't be threatened by that. Even when I was in grammar school in the 60s, I had fellow students who's religions prevented them from either praying or pledging allegiance to the flag, and they were never forced to do it. Once again you remember some isolated event and attempt to condemn the whole because of the few. That is how every extremist must win an argument. By excoriating the larger group because of individual abuses. Either your ignorance or your denial is just mind boggling pandion. Or maybe you're just too young to know the facts. But when we prayed in school, it was called ""silent meditation"" it wasn't a christian prayer at all. I, as a moslem was allegedly praying to allah, as every student prayed to their own God. And atheists could open a book and read if they didn't believe in God. There was no coercion or guilt applied to any aspect of this 30 seconds out of our day. No it isn't a religious celebration at all. It's a public recognition that Christmas is about the birth of Christ rather than a commercialized secular money making event. How terrible it must be for atheists to allow some americans to remember the actual reason for the season in contrast the the commercialized business which Christmas has become. How does a Nativity scene offend someone who believes it's all mythology anyway? I'll bet a dollar to a dime you wouldn't be offended if someone put up a statue of Zeus, yet the baby Jesus in a manger sends you running for the hills in protest. If these practices were ever endorsements of one religion, they never would have been allowed in the first place. So your distortion of what they represent has been refuted as I showed above. Continuing to repeat it just exposes your paranoia.","global-conspiracy-scientists","09:57 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","50"

But my father was born in Damascus Syria and my mom's parents were Lebanese, even though she was born in the USA. But their marriage was arranged according to the islamic customs and we were formal members of my mothers mosque in Michigan which was built with donations from King Ibn Saoud of Saudi Arabia, which is known for their very fundamentalist beliefs and are also believers in and promoters of wahabiism which is the most radical school of thought in islam. As for me at that age, I was a normal american kid who called himself moslem but was no more fervent a follower of it than any ""culturally"" christian kid out there is to christianity. I remember that I never prayed to allah specifically, but to God. And my questions always applied to wanting to know if He existed, never did I just take it for granted that He did exist, or that allah was the one true God. My argument was that there are so many religions with different types of God for all of them. And I understood my own ignorance, and knew that no matter who I asked, they would all defend their religion over all others. So I was most concerned with objectively knowing first if God exists at all, and if so, then which religion is correct according to Him. So that was my prayer in my childlike way, to ask God to reveal Himself to me if He even exists at all. You know the rest of the story so the answer I received goes without saying.","global-conspiracy-scientists","12:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","56"

It would be like trying to convince someone he that ought to like pecan pie, or that Dostoevsky is the greatest of all novelists. If there are specific passages at issue, I'm happy to discuss them. But I don't see any point in global characterizations of the Bible as meaningful or meaningless. What it needs is not a defense, but careful scrutiny and rigorous analysis. In the meantime, Pandion can buy a box full of Bibles and burn it under an inverted cross for all I care.
