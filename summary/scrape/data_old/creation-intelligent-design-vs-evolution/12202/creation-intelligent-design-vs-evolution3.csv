Here are my 2 posts in question. I ask any objective observer to judge them as ridiculous rants...","Matthew","340075","How about by attempting to get religious viewpoints taught in science classes? Or, ironically, by attempting to do the things you start describing two quotes from now? And clearly what you think made this country great is not what Pandion or I think. Look at history. Men like Washington and Madison and Jefferson and Franklin played an undeniable role in ""making this country great"" during the Revolutionary and Constitutional eras. But they were hardly ""traditional"" in their religious or moral thinking (especially Jefferson and Franklin). By legislation requiring them to? Sure. But do you understand the in-classroom pressure that comes from both students and teachers in such situations? Formally led prayer and invocations of God have no place in public schools. But students are free as individuals to pray non-disruptively any time they have the inclination and the time. Because the government should not be promoting such a religious view. That's what churches are for. For the record, it should also not post a sign reading ""God is dead"" on the lawn, either. People have tried to take creationism out of biology classes . And they have tried to ensure that when religious views (and irreligious views) are taught, they are not endorsed but described and explained (e.g. in the class I mentioned earlier). Your point is indeed made. You think that it is the job of the government to promote Christian ideas. I think that's a recipe for disaster, and I don't think one has to be a ""radical Leftist"" to see it that way. Nope. Just dedicated to preventing government from endorsing any ideas that are exclusively Judeo-Christian. Or from endorsing any ideas that belong exclusively to any other religion or religious belief, either. How does preventing government from promoting Christianity amount to wiping it off the face of the Earth? This sort of hyperbole is nothing but a straw man. If I decide they're ridiculous rants, in your view I am ipso facto not objective. Hardly seems a fair fight. But I guess I will say that I do, in fact, regard them as ridiculous rants, anyway.","global-conspiracy-scientists","10:57 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","31"

I'm against prayers in schools, and I'm a righty, so to speak. In fact, I'm against the government endorsing ANY religion. That's what our civilisation was built upon, not upon Theocracies. Oh, and ""christmas"" was NOT historically the birth of Christ, it became that after the church made it that, it was first the Yuletide festivities, and the church adapted them and said they were the celebration of the birth of Jesus. So, historically, they certainly WEREN'T the celebration of the birth of Christ.","global-conspiracy-scientists","12:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","32"
"01-13-2009","12202",3,"Archangel","340073","What is ironic is that first of all, you see my posts as a ridiculous rant. And secondly that you can claim that Christians are seeking the proliferation of our our religion BY FORCE, when all we are doing is opposing your attempts to marginalize all semblance of traditional morality in America. Can you show where we are calling for Christianity being mad [sic] an official State Religion in America as Atheists and secular humanists are attempting to legislate their godless religions in both the Courts and the Congress?

How incredibly disingenuous of you. Here are my 2 posts in question. I ask any objective observer to judge them as ridiculous rants in comparison to the very corrupted and inaccurate rewrite of the historical facts in reality which pandion is spewing above.","pandion","340089","Yes. Your posts are typically quite ridiculous and most usually just rants with lots of meaningless quotes from your book of mythology. There have been efforts by creationists to impose their religion into religion classes my whole life. First there were efforts to exclude the teaching of biology from biology classes and to replace it with religious magic. Then there were efforts for ""equal time"" for the idiocy of ""creation science."" More recently, there were the efforts by the Kansas State Board of Education to remove evolution from the curriculum (yet again) and thereby reduce biology to a series of unrelated observations to memorize. And of course, there was the Dover, PA school board that tried to force their religion into biology classes. Most of these have been decided by court cases, wasting public money on court cases the could have been decided with just a little thought in the first place. In all cases, the religion of creationism has been prohibited from science classes. Idiocy does not merit equal time with science. But I didn't say that. I said that creationists are trying to force their religion on everyone. As mentioned above, in the schools. Chief Justice Moore of the Alabama Supreme court placed a huge erection that memorialized religion in the court building. And there have been efforts to establish a national religion. In fact, at the time that the Constitution was written, most states had established, official state religions. We've been listening to so called christians whining about a christian nation ever since. Again you post without thought. It's pretty silly to claim that objections to the imposition of your religion by law are somehow efforts to establish another religion. The lack of your religion is not a religion. Atheism is a religion in the same way that baldness is a hair color. Personally, I could give a rats tootie about establishing any religion. I like the Constitution just the way it is. You are free to practice your religion in any way you want in your home, your church, and even on the streets. As long as you don't obstruct traffic, you are free to stand on street corners and wave your book of mythology over your head and shout at passers by, just as so many of your fellow christians do. I laugh at those almost as much as I laugh at your rants on this board. Again, you put no thought into your post. Your religion didn't make this country great. One of the factors that did contribute to the greatness of this country was the exclusion of religion from the national Constitution and the disestablishment of state religions and the replacement of them with guarantees of religious freedom. I base my opinion on having studied the topic extensively. If you are interested in learning about the Revolutionary and Constitutional periods of History, I can recommend about 20 histories of the time that deal with the topic for you. I own about 15 myself. Attempting to teach your religion as science in schools is an attempt to impose your religion on everyone, even though you don't seem to be able to grasp that. Wrong. There was lots of forcing. By the way, the first case that decided that students could not be forced to recite the Pledge was brought by a christian family. Their particular cult forbade such demonstrations. Even after that, students have still been forced to recite the pledge. To claim otherwise is an admission of ignorance. And somehow you don't see the recitation of prayers of your religion as forcing your religion on students of other faiths? Of course, you wouldn't object to equal time for Muslims, Buddhists, Shintoists, Wiccans and various christian cults (including your own). And how about equal time for atheists to stand and declare what utter nonsense it is to worship magical beings while everyone bows their heads and then answers ""amen""? And that isn't a religious celebration? So your are saying that Chirst was a fake? He wasn't a religious figure? And yes, such displays shouldn't be in the state houses or the courts. If you want to put such silly things in front of your church, feel free. That's what the 1st Amendment says. Worship as you will but you can't use the government to do so. Yet more ranting without thought. Yes, I agree that creationism should not be imposed on students in public schools because it is religion. The school is a department of government and as such is forbidden by the 1st and 14th Amendments from any acts that would support or endorse religion, not to mention that Pledges, prayers, and creationism interferes with the free practice of my religion. And that wasn't warped? I have no doubt that you could go on with your thoughtless and uneducated rant for pages. I suspect that, even though it started out on a low level, it would go down hill from here. Holy Christ on a crutch! What pucky! I don't care about references to the Judeo-Christian ethic except when they are imposed by my government. Like I said, stand on the corner screaming about your magic man while waving your Bible over your head. I don't care. Do what you want on your own time, in your own home or church. Just don't use my government to impose your religion on others. Please, everyone read his posts and offer an opinion of who is ranting. The offer of book recommendations so that you might actually educate yourself about the traditions of religious freedom in our country still stands. But I suspect you aren't interested in learning.","global-conspiracy-scientists","01:14 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","33"

Moreover, students are not required to accept it: they are required to understand it. If, based on their interpretation of the Bible, they decide not to accept it, no one's going to make them. Ditto. Do you realize that there are Christians who disagree with you on these points? I will grant you that it can't be observed. But then, neither can the ""The U.S.A. became independent in 1776"" doctrine. (Do you disbelieve that the United States declared its independence in 1776?) Such is the nature of the past: since we live now and not then, we can't make observations, we can only draw inferences. I will also grant you that it can't be demonstrated. But then, neither can the ""The U.S.A. became independent in 1776"" doctrine. (Do you disbelieve that the United States declared its independence in 1776?) Such is the nature of any empirical hypothesis: no matter how well corroborated, it still could need to be overturned and revised on the basis of new evidence, even if it never does need to be. I will not, however, grant you that it can't be proved. By all the epistemic standards accepted in sound scientific practice, evolution is good science. We have every bit the same reason to believe it as we do the age of the country. It's only the particular pieces of evidence (and thus the particular inference to be drawn) that differ. Not so. Students remain free to adopt whatever non-scientific or extra-scientific or supra-scientific epistemic standards they like. They just aren't allowed to confuse them with the scientific standards. Stunted religion occurs when one literalizes narratives that conflict with empirical evidence. What's your point? Gill slits , more accurately. They never have functional gills, and they lose the slits. No, gill slits . Really! If you don't understand what Haeckel got wrong and what he didn't, that's not our fault. Biology has indeed moved far beyond him. But he wasn't wrong about everything. Perhaps you should look at some photographs of embryos. Doesn't follow. Yet another piece of faulty logic on your part. Ever hear of the ""Is-Ought Distinction"" and the ""Naturalistic Fallacy?""","global-conspiracy-scientists","04:35 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","39"

Should we teach them the childish myth about how the earth is only 6000 years old? That story is based on the mythology of some bronze age nomadic herdsmen. That would be forcing your religion into a classroom as science. The fact that the universe and the earth are very old have been verified by several different means. Actually, it doesn't address the Bible. If you don't understand the science, then don't blame it on science. Moreover, Adam is a religious myth that has no place being taught in science. If you want to ""believe"" such mythology, that is up to you. But you can't teach it to my children as science. Actually, that's not true. The great age of the earth and the universe has been established to a degree that it would be foolish for a reasonable and educated person to disagree. It isn't a belief. Of course, you can believe anything you want. That is your right. You can believe that a magic man made everything from nothing only a few years ago, or even last Tuesday, if you want. You just can't teach it as science to my children in a public school. How is that meaningful? We were talking about science, I thought. The age of the earth or universe and biological evolution have nothing to do with secular humanism. That's pure nonsense. Either you are making that up or you are a dupe of someone much smarter and more dishonest than you. Secular humanism isn't taught, as far as I know. Except maybe in a course on comparative religion, which is the only place where your religion should be taught in a public school. Then all of the mythology of all religions can be compared and recognized for the primitive superstition that it is. But there is a rational explanation. Just because you lack the ability to understand doesn't make it stunted science. Would you prefer that we offer magic as an explanation? Now you're not telling the truth. You didn't just hear that. You read that on some silly creationist site. They duped you again. Why would this girl tell him that. Either she doesn't understand what she is talking about or he doesn't. It's just plain silly. No. Not gills. Only fools who haven't been paying attention make such claims. Mammal embryos never have gills. The do have what are called ""gill slits"". But they really should be called gill folds or gill arches. All vertebrates develop these gill arches that develop into gills in fish and parts of the jaw, ears and circulatory system in higher animals. Go and learn something. It this hysterical screaming necessary? Science isn't religion. That's why science is taught in science classes while your superstitious version of religion is not. Another non-sequitur. What does abortion have to do with DNA? How silly can you be?

That was a footnote comment from Justice Black, and was not ruled on by the supreme court. Indeed , from this case The claim that secular humanism could be considered a religion for legal purposes was examined by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Peloza v. Capistrano School District in 1994. In this case, a science teacher argued that, by requiring him to teach evolution, his school district was forcing him to teach the ""religion"" of secular humanism. The Court responded, ""We reject this claim because neither the Supreme Court, nor this circuit, has ever held that evolutionism or secular humanism are 'religions' for Establishment Clause purposes.""
