"01-17-2009","12202",7,"Archangel","340583","Actually Matthew has never said he has accepted the Lord as his personal Lord and Savior. He doesn't even comprehend the concept of having a personal relationship with God or else he wouldn't refer to Him as an ""IT"". So don't speak for or make any assumptions about Matthews relationship with God unless you have the discernment to tell the truth from a lie. Which you are woefully unable to do. After repeating myself and explaining enough times, I will definitely give up on attempting to get through to you and will walk away. But to suggest that I will disappear because I can't answer your childish questions, is laughable. The problem here is that you refuse to accept my answers so you keep insisting I haven't answered you. So let me repeat my direct and very honest answer to you once again in the hope that you wont ignore it as you insist I didn't answer it at all. I said: You shouldn't. You should go before God directly who will reveal all truth to you individually if you'll just seek HIS TRUTH with an open heart and mind. And I guarantee you that if you experienced such a personal epiphany, you and I would no longer be at philosophical odds.","smiley","340584","I don't place much value in your guarantee. I don't believe that your values are in any way Christian values. I am also sure that if there were a god up there and I came to 'know' him (or her) on a personal level then I would also come to 'know' that your ramblings are way way off the mark. So the question remains, what makes you think that your interpretation of the bible is based solely on 'god's truth' when there are so many other interpretations that are bogus (in your opinion)? And just for the record, I didn't accuse you of not being able to answer the question, just that you avoid doing so . Presumably because by doing so you would reveal the truth about the BS you spout (note that isn't god's truth, but it is the truth nonetheless).

Or perhaps he is just not as presumptuous as you. Good advice. Why don't you follow your own advice Archie? As you are? Remember uncyclopedia.com Archie? How about that prop pterodactyl from that cancelled show Freaky Links that you posted as proof that pterodactyls were alive less than 200 years ago? Of all the people who should be lecturing on the ability to detect BS, you're last on the list. Yes, you have been repeating yourself. No, you've never provided an explanation. The correct term is ""run"" away, but whatever. Yeah, and here we are laughing at you. No, the problem is your logical disconnect has once again ran smack into reality, and you're incapable of reconciling the two. So your only option is avoidance of the subject. And once again: ""Except Matthew has already done this, and his ""truth"" differs from yours. Yet here you are claiming he is the fraud.

Philosophical disagreement with a man implies lack of personal relationship with God.

And what about all the other nut cases out there who have been blessed to receive ""personal epiphanies"" about the meaning of God's Word, and who disagree violently with your interpretations? Ah, but I forget! Your epiphany is true, and their epiphanies are false! And how do you know that? Well, you just know it! Your revelation is so vast and real and convincing that it just has to be true! There is no possibility of doubt!

"01-17-2009","12202",7,"The Barbarian","340496","Hence, we should be very careful in speaking for God. It's all too easy to assume what we want is what God wants.","obvious_child","340633","Unless that God is if your own creation. Then you can speak for it whenever you want. It's pretty clear that Arch isn't a Christian. He worship a book as his God.
