You are right and you know it with 100% certainty, life cannot possibly be any different from how you see it...which make you a supreme allknowing being!!! That is really odd since you dont believe in those things. Maybe its just hubris anyway. I was going to reply to your 1. post but seeing in your 2. that you are completely stuck in a certain mindset i wont make the effort.","gene-dead","03:06 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","31"
"09-13-2007","10372",3,"sinjin","283708","The problem is that you can't demonstrate the existence of the soul to me. Therefore it cannot be said to be ""real"". ""Real"" would mean I could somehow experience the same reality as you and thereby know the truth of your assertion for myself.","martinlb","283721","This is a reasonable argument, as long as you can accept that some see it differently. However you can theoretically experience a similar reality but that would require an extraordinary effort. To live a truly spiritual life today is almost impossible due to the state of western culture and the constant bombardement of sensory pollution we experience.","gene-dead","03:26 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","32"
"09-13-2007","10372",3,"martinlb","283706","true but we dont know everything. Its like we know the car, all its mechanisms and functions, but not the driver and why he is going where he is going. it depends on how you see consciousness, I tend to see it as a particular quality or energy that life tunes in to to variyng degrees. Not as something produced by brain cells as you take for granted. this is just one theory out of many, based on several preconceptions (ie all life can be explained via physicochemical mechanisms, consciousness is produced by the brain) The problem remains: as consciousness just ""emerges"" magically without any known mechanism my view is just as valid. I tend to value personal experience more than scientific theories. Unlike you i dont base my metaphysical beliefs (if i have any, i am more of a total agnostic) on grand theories supported by scant empiri. If there are vital enegies (and from my experience there is) they are most certainly compatible with physics and chemistry, they are just not dicovered yet in the lab. So what?","lesz","283722","It's an automaton. It doesn't need a driver. The biochemical reactions I spoke of drive themselves. Well, when you know how to measure this energy, let us know. So far as biologists are concerned, it's a function of the brain. Again, if you can figure out how to test your theory scientifically, don't keep it to yourself. Consciousness doesn't emerge ""magically"". It emerges out of physics and chemistry. We can't explain how, yet, but i see no need to resort to magic as you do. Yes, well, scientists tend to value verification of hypotheses over personal anecdotes. If something is asserted as a scientific fact, it ought to be reproducible by anyone following the same procedure. Scientists don't base their theories on grand ideas asserted by theists. They require verification and testing. Provide that, and scientists will pay attention. if not, they won't.","gene-dead","03:27 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","33"
"09-13-2007","10372",3,"martinlb","283707","There is a saying in alchemy that you must forge the soul in the crucible of the body. You are born with the seed of a soul, so it doesnt become a concrete presence until you ""cultivate it"". Most philosopher troughout history talks about the soul, I would find it odd if ""soul"" didnt refer to something actual rather than an idea only.","lesz","283723","Yes, well, I guess alchemists said a lot of things without producing anything worth talking about. Alchemy was a bust. As for souls, please bottle me one so i can examine it.","gene-dead","03:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","34"

Of course souls exist. They're just intangible...like freedom, serenity and the dark side of the moon.","gene-dead","03:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","35"

Would that be believing before seeing? The same works for leprchauns. Since I don't believe in the ""spiritual"", I have no idea what you may mean. As far as ""pollution"" I'd say that is in the eye of the beholder. Generally I think that the human condition remains more or less constant regardless of historical period.","gene-dead","04:00 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","36"

So spiritual is itself a watered out term. What i am talking about has to do with ""being"", a strong, inner sense of existing and being connected with everything. I am not talking about believing before seeing. rather the opposite. One of the initial steps in most spiritual paths is to empty and still the mind, no thougths, no daydreams, no movement, no ideas about what might happen and so on. And do it for hours. This is extraordinary hard, and require a huge effort. And you cant even be sure to attain results. So one has to accept that kind of insecurity. And most people who practice these sorts of things today never get past this initial step. Of course this has very little appeal with most people today who want the easy way out with instant gratification. As regards your comment about the human condition... it woudnt do you bad to study a little history. Go a few centuries back and you have no tvs, phones, cars, advertisement (at least not like we see today), stereos etc. All these things produce impressons that are mostly not useful, not wanted, and fill up the mind where they have be ""digested"". IOW pollution. Spend a few days alone in the mountains, away from sivilisation, and you might notice it.","gene-dead","05:12 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","40"

Oh well its your loss and nobody elese!","martinlb","283736","well i am going away now for a week so i wont be posting here anyway. btw some quotes for you to enjoy : Max Planck ""...I regard consciousness as fundamental. I regard matter as derivative from consciousness. We cannot get behind consciousness. Everything that we talk about, everything that we regard as existing, postulates consciousness."" The Observer, London, January 25, 1931 Werner Heisenberg ""The common division of the world into subject and object, inner world and outer world, body and soul is no longer adequate."" Erwin Schroedinger ""Subject and object are only one. The barrier between them cannot be said to have broken down as a result of recent experiments in the physical sciences, for this barrier does not exist"". Schrodinger (1961) claims that the Vedic slogan All in One and One in All was an idea that led him to the creation of quantum mechanics. ""Consciousness is never experienced in the plural, only in the singular. How does the idea of plurality (emphatically opposed by the Upanishad writers) arise at all? ... the only possible alternative is simply to keep the immediate experience that consciousness is a singular of which the plural is unknown; that there *is* only one thing and that what seems to be a plurality is merely a series of different aspects of this one thing produced by deception (the Indian maya) - in much the same way Gaurisankar and Mt. Everest turn out to be the same peak seen from different valleys."" (From: What is Life)","gene-dead","05:35 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","42"

Indeed I have and do spend time away from civilization albeit less nowadays as I have very young children. I do know what you mean but civilization has presented the distractions we know today in different forms for millenia. I would imagine ancient Rome or even Babylon had all the sex and death, etc. we are ""bombarded"" with today.
