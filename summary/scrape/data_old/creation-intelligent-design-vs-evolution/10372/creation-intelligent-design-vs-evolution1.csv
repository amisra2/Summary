It's pretty clear that everything science thought it knew about genes is false. Genes do not work in isolation. They do not perform only one function or code only one protein. Heck, the concept of the ""gene"" is being shattered. Science has so consumed itself looking at genes (or what they thought were genes) for the past century that they have lost sight of the fact that the genome is a functional unit, and cannot be broken apart and analyzed in bits and pieces without considering the context of the organism. And up until just a few years ago scientists thought there were over 100,000 genes in the genome -- now we know there are less than 25,000...but they still don't exactly how many! Does that give anyone else confidence that these guys have a freaking clue if they don't even know how many there are? http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20070908/bob9.asp The gene is dead ""The same sequences are being used for multiple functions,"" says Thomas R. Gingeras of Affymetrix. That introduces complications into the evolution of the genome, which had until recently been assumed to act through single DNA mutations affecting single genes. Now, ""a mutation in one of those sequences has to be interpreted not only in terms of [one gene], but [of] all the other transcripts going through the region,"" Gingeras explains More fundamentally, it muddies scientists' conception of just what constitutes a gene . In the established definition, a gene is a discrete region of DNA that produces a single, identifiable protein in a cell. But the functioning of a protein often depends on a host of RNAs that control its activity. If a stretch of DNA known to be a protein-coding gene also produces regulatory RNAs essential for several other genes, is it somehow a part of all those other genes as well? To make things even messier, the genetic code for a protein can be scattered far and wide around the genome. The ENCODE project revealed that about 90 percent of protein-coding genes possessed previously unknown coding fragments that were located far from the main gene, sometimes on other chromosomes. Many scientists now argue that this overlapping and dispersal of genes, along with the swelling ranks of functional RNAs, renders the standard gene concept of the central dogma obsolete . Long live the gene Offering a radical new conception of the genome, Gingeras proposes shifting the focus away from protein-coding genes. Instead, he suggests that the fundamental units of the genome could be defined as functional RNA transcripts. Since some of these transcripts ferry code for proteins as dutiful mRNAs, this new perspective would encompass traditional genes. But it would also accommodate new classes of functional RNAs as they're discovered, while avoiding the confusion caused by several overlapping genes laying claim to a single stretch of DNA. The emerging picture of the genome ""definitely shifts the emphasis from genes to transcr ipts ,"" agrees Mark B. Gerstein, a bioinformaticist at Yale University. Scientists' definition of a gene has evolved several times since Gregor Mendel first deduced the idea in the 1860s from his work with pea plants. Now, about 50 years after its last major revision, the gene concept is once again being called into question. The funny thing about all this, and the oh-so-ironic thing is this: what is the ONE thing that darwinists have always pointed to to show evidence of materialism -- evidence that we're merely an assortment of ""things?"" It's the GENE! And now -- of all things -- it's the gene that seems to have no physical reality! The ""gene"" is just a figment of people's imagination and subject to opinion and guesswork!","gene-dead","10:09 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","1"
"09-12-2007","10372",1,"chemist99a","283586","Nope the simple concept of genes in a simpler era is dead. Its been dead a long time and the concept advances with our continued scientific progress. Such is the way of the world and it always has been. After all the original concept of gene was totally abstract and not linked to any molecular architecture at all. It was an element of inheritance and it still is!","supersport","283588","face it -- life has stumped science -- it cannot be defined, it cannot be measured...it cannot be explained in any sort of scientific way.","gene-dead","10:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","3"

Science has managed to show that life and non-life are not distinct and are indeed simply a continuium of molecular complexity and function. There is no clear difference which can separate life from molecules which are generally NOT considered to be living. There is only matter and energy found in configurations of widely differing complexity thats it so far as matter/energy at the basic temperature range we exist in. Nobody is stumped by this at all.

Perhaps you might wish to start at the beginings of the gene concept. Its really too bad that Darwin and Mendel did not share the same circles and never met.

You are truly one confused individual if you can't tell there's a distinct difference between a living thing and a nonliving thing -- that non-living things are missing something that living things have.... Just because this difference cannot be analyzed, measured or defined does not mean it's not there. You can't analyze or define your thought patterns, dreams, brainwaves or consciousness either -- but that does not mean they aren't there. I think you've lost it -- You may very well belong in a mental facility.","gene-dead","12:26 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","8"

Philosophers have discussed things like the nature of the soul for centuries, not because it isn't one like current materialists believe, but because it is an elusive thing, that varies with the state of the particular person. To dismiss something just because it can't be measured in the lab isn't very wise IMO.","gene-dead","08:11 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","15"
