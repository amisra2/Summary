I can't see or feel your freedom or serenity but I believe you have each on occasion. You likely feel them in your soul only.","lesz","283770","And I pretty much know that the other side of the moon is there whether I can touch it, see it, or not. I know it in the same way I know the earth orbits the sun, or that humans and chimps had a more recent common ancestor than either did with horses or cheetahs. I suppose you could argue that such knowledge is ""only"" a subjective belief because the knowledge is not reality itself, it's like Plato's shadows in a cave, a mere reflection of reality. I suppose you could argue that, but I don't think it's a productive line to take. If reality didn't correspond to our mental projections of it, we would very rapidly come to grief, so there has to be some correspondence between what we believe (or know, or think we know) is real, and reality itself. And as someone once pointed out, the only thing to do with the Ultimate Skeptic who doubts the reality of everything is to ignore him! As to my feeling freedom or serenity in my soul, that depends on what you mean by soul. To me, a soul is the motion of electrical charges in a brain across interconnected networks of cells. The feelings are perfectly real, and given a fMRI machine or something of the sort, could probably even be tracked as they occur. They are as real as ripples on a lake... or the far side of the moon","gene-dead","04:07 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","46"
