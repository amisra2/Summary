"10-10-2011","15750",1,"None","None","None","AMD4EVER","440497","I have come across several different types of creationist debates in the past as it pertains to how we can explain the fossils and other evidence that many different types of creatures existed prior to humans. Explanation #1: The argument that I think makes the most sense is that God created the heavens, galaxy, earth, and some life. This life evolved and eventually became everything that we see around us today with the exception of humans which the Bible clearly stated God created man. I don't really believe this is how things went but I don't see a lot of fault in it either. Explanation #2: Nothing existed before man. Dinosaur bones have never been found. We either just think we found them because we don't understand what we are looking at or there is some worldwide conspiracy trying to make us think things used to live before man and the devil is laughing at all of us for being such fools. This argument is so idiotic that I just brush anyone who thinks like this off as incapable of reason. Explanation #3: This is a new one to me. One of my co-workers said he believes that God created all plants and animals to exist at the exact same time. He says that if we try to use carbon dating to disprove this that carbon dating has been proven to be flawed. He says that if we try to base the age of certain species on the depth of their remains location in the earth's crust he debated that we're just looking at a small fraction of the earth's crust and will surely find dino bones somewhere that will show the existed as recently as a few thousand years ago and human bones somewhere to show they existed hundreds of millions of years ago. I find debating #3 to be difficult because he is actually correct in both of his statements. Carbon dating isn't a 100% slam dunk and we have only looked through so much of the crust and are basing our conclusions on just a small piece of the puzzle. I'm certain that his idea is completely flawed but am trying to figure out how to prove it. Anyone care to offer up some ideas?","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","04:09 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","1"

This sounds like an amazing book except for one part. I don't consider evolution or creationism to have all the answers. Evolution's biggest blank spot is the missing link. We don't get to see macro evolution and have trouble finding evidence of it. In the video for the book the author says something along the lines of, ""See everything that changed in the past millennia and imagine what could happen over a million years."" What happened in the past millennia is that we've seen a great deal of micro evolution but no macro evolution. We can imagine what it would be like if macro evolution occurred but we can't prove that it occurs. This is one of the trouble spots I run into with evolution. The other trouble spot is that we know it takes a certain amount of a species in order to maintain it's existence. So how does a species exist after macro evolution occurs and there is just 1 or maybe a handful of them? They would be forced to interbreed for many generations to get their population up which genetically doesn't seem to work out so well. Maybe I'm showing my own ignorance here as this may all have been answered in this book but just by the video I get the sense that we are left with good evidence that macro evolution happens but need to leave it at that. Is this the case?","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","04:43 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","3"

Not 100% accurate could mean many things, it could mean you don't know the exact second or nano second that some event occurred, because there are geological shifts and geology itself is an improving science you cannot be 100% sure how and when something was deposited; but they both work. Further I don't believe carbon dating can work for most fossils, it's more of an archeology thing due to how fast C14 decays. It's like saying a driver can't stay perfectly in the middle of the lane nor know exactly when the light turns red or green so we can't really drive... yes we can, within acceptable tolerances. Now the primary problem, lack of disproof is not proof; it's an argument from ignorance to say otherwise. i.e. even if we were in the 12th century our inability to prove that plants existed independently of animals at one point does not mean they never did and it certainly does not mean they were both created at the same instant by a mystical being.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","11:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","5"

Is this the case?","pandion","440528","At least you looked. While the science of biological evolution does not claim to have all of the answers, the mythology of creationism does. You see, evolutionary biology is science by which people attempt to explain natural events with natural explanations. This is a process wherein unexplained observations are made. Data is then gathered and an hypothesis the may explain the observations is formulated. Then a prediction that must necessarily follow from the hypothesis, if it is correct, is made. An experiment if designed to test the prediction. If the experiment supports the hypothesis, then it may, depending on how stringent the experiment was, be considered a scientific theory. Evolution is a scientific theory that has been test to the extent that no educated or intelligent person doubts that it is correct. Modern debates about evolution are not about whether it happens, but about the mechanisms that cause it to happen. On the other hand, the mythology of creationism is the equivalent of throwing ones hands in the air and giving up. In this case, we attribute what we do not know and do not understand to super-naturalism. It has been that way since people invented gods to explain the unknown. Unfortunately, there are many books of writing that are believed to be written by a magical being. Of course, they were not directly written by this magical being. They were ""inspired"". And even though they all contain errors of fact and history, they are still accepted as without error. One of these books, the mythology of bronze age, nomadic herdsmen has become the basis of western religion (Judaism and christianity). Many people believe that this mythology is the literal truth as a mater of blind faith. As a result, they reject observations of reality that are in conflict with their belief in mythology. Actually, that's your problem since that the ""missing link"" is an archaic, religious idea that has no meaning in evolutionary biology. What are you talking about? Nonsense. Then you can explain 36 species of felidae (cat) and 42 species of canidae (dog) that ""micro-evolved"" in a few years after the flood and somehow spread themselves around the world. And then there are the birds -- there are 731 species in 311 genera in 74 families in North America, all in the class aves. At what point do you postulate a ""pair"" on the ark and the hyper-evolution of everything in a lower classification. But the numbers of bird species in North America are paltry when compared to those in South America and Africa. Unique species on those continents number in the thousands. Then consider Europe (comparable to NA) and Asia. How may thousands of birds were on the ark and how were their varied diets supplied (seed eaters, insect eaters, fruit eaters, nectar eaters, and carnivores and scavengers)? But science doesn't prove anything. Can you prove that the earth orbits the sun or does the sun orbit the earth? The tested theory is that the earth orbits the sun. And the observed data, the hypothesis, and the experiments are beyond the understanding of most people. Most people just accept the science - the earth orbits the sun. It isn't proven. It's a scientific theory. Then you haven't bothered to educate yourself. You are ignorant of the science and are willing to believe the mythology without evidence. Right. That's a problem if you reduce every species to two breeding individuals. They go extinct. In the case of Whooping Cranes, they were protected and their breeding grounds were protected when it was recognized that they were in danger of going extinct. And yet, their numbers continued to fall in spite of all efforts to preserve them. The breeding population fell to about 150 individuals before it began to climb again. No one knows why it continued to fall or why it began to grow again. We do know that Whooping Cranes were very close to the minimum viable population.

"10-11-2011","15750",1,"None","None","None","Bennedict","440587","Ah, the argument. Yes. If your co-worker is skeptical of carbon dating, so be it, but let it be known that carbon dating is not the only way of measuring the age of something. There are many independent ways to tell the age of something, and when they all point to approximately the same age for a given artifact, that can be quite convincing. If another method of dating supports carbon dating independently, that can be used as evidence for the accuracy of C14. On the point of finding dinosaur bones where we would not normally expect them to be, or finding human remains hundreds of millions of years old, as Sir Richard Dawkins himself would say, this is the single most convincing piece of evidence for evolution; of the millions (maybe billions?) of fossils ever found in the Earth's crust, not a single one was found in a place in a time period that it shouldn't be. Sure, we may only have found a certain amount of fossils buried, but when the figures are so overwhelmingly so, there's no way to doubt geographical distribution as evidence for evolution. Finding just one rabbit fossil (or any modern animal fossil) that predates modern times would certainly be something, but the fact that unsurprisingly, it hasn't happened yet, is reason to be sure of evolutionary theory. Both pieces of the argument are very easily refuted. In the case of ID, the argument breaks the scientific theory rule of falsifiability.

Text book publishers tailor the content of their books to conform to the superstition and mythology of the largest single market - Texas. The rest of the nation decides such matters at the level of the school district - not a huge market to which publishers pay attention. But, of course, the text book options offered to other states have already been limited because the publishers try to gain approval of the largest single market for science texts - Texas.","Bennedict","440734","Sorry, I know this is getting off track, but I've always been curious about the whole issue with evo in the states. Do you think Texas' involvement in textbook choices for high school students affects the registration numbers in your classes? In other words, if you taught at a different college of the same size in say California, would your classroom headcount be any different? I ask this because its a bit of a worry to think of the influence that people who have no scientific education outside of high school have on matters of scientific inquiry. If the number of students registering for college level biology courses is affected by state opinions, that has got to directly affect scientific study in Texas all together.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","03:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","24"

Where they go with a discussion can be somewhat random though it often tends to focus either on complexity, the big bang or scripture. The complexity line inevitably leads to a ""What are the chances of that?"" position. The chances irrelevant as you are looking at the end product of a sequence of past events. The Big-Bang line is a ""Something can't be created from nothing"" line which leads to a ""What came before time?"" position. This can be countered easily with a bit of Quantum Mechanics though getting your head around the concepts will be the most difficult bit. I refer to this as ""This last argument of Fools"" as once you've put the ball back in their court they don't have any follow up. The Scripture line is rare but tends to see the protagonist calling for scriptural references.

I'm retired. However, your question is interesting. U.S. universities do a great job in teaching math, science and engineering. They do such a good job that students from around the world come to the U.S. to study math, science, and engineering. But these are not popular courses of study for U.S. students. In fact, many university teachers of such courses are foreign since there is a real lack of qualified people to teach such courses in the U.S. Someone once expressed the opinion that this was because math, science, and engineering are difficult. English Lit. and so forth are easier. It is also true that most entering university freshmen are scientific illiterates. The U.S. ranks very near the bottom in the math and science abilities of high school graduates. We in the U.S. are shocked when we find out that a high school graduate from Canada enters a U.S. university as a sophomore. Even worse, U.S. high school graduates were shocked when they found that in Mexico they would be required to take an additional year of secondary education in order to meet the requirements to enroll in a Mexican university. And yet, U.S. universities rank with the best in the world. Even those (or especially those) in Texas. Maybe that is the reason that only about 60% of entering freshmen ever graduate. They are behind when they start and they just aren't able to catch up. Both of my sons took 2 years of physics, 2 years of biology, and 4 years of math in high school. It was a really good school back then. Both the advanced physics and the advanced biology teachers were Ph.D.s. My elder son is a B.S. in nuclear engineering from Texas A&M and a J.D. from the University of Texas Law School. My younger son earned two bachelor degrees from Texas Tech, math/chemistry and music. He also has a masters degree from Bowling Green State University in Ohio. He is a staff sergeant currently assigned to the 1st Infantry Division at Ft. Riley, KS. The 1ID is one of the Army units that has been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan over the last 10 years. My elder son told us about a meeting that he attended in the first few weeks of law school. It was announced as an orientation for those interested in pursuing intellectual property law (copyright and patent). When the law professor began, stated that anyone who did not have a hard science degree should leave since they could not be admitted to the patent bar. The room almost emptied. Most law students are English, sociology, history, accounting, or political science majors. But I digress. Even universities with religious affiliations teach biological evolution rather than any form of creationism or ID creationism. Any Catholic university teaches evolutionary biology. I speak from experience. Here in Texas, as I understand it, Baylor University (Baptist), SMU (Methodist), and TCU (Disciples of Christ) actually teach evolutionary biology rather than mythology in the biology curriculum.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","01:09 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","27"

This life evolved and eventually became everything that we see around us today with the exception of humans which the Bible clearly stated God created man. I don't really believe this is how things went but I don't see a lot of fault in it either. Explanation #2: Nothing existed before man. Dinosaur bones have never been found.

One of my co-workers said he believes that God created all plants and animals to exist at the exact same time. He says that if we try to use carbon dating to disprove this that carbon dating has been proven to be flawed. He says that if we try to base the age of certain species on the depth of their remains location in the earth's crust he debated that we're just looking at a small fraction of the earth's crust and will surely find dino bones somewhere that will show the existed as recently as a few thousand years ago and human bones somewhere to show they existed hundreds of millions of years ago.","Databed","443010","Came a little late for this, but I still want to respond, so... I guess my biggest problem with this is that we know we evolved from some kind of ape ancestor. The evidence is overwhelming. Another version of this accepts that we evolved from apes, but asserts that at some time in the recent past God decided to impart a soul on us at which time we were given free will, disobeyed God and ended up with original sin. I think this version has grown out of the need to explain how the Bible can be truth and in agreement with evolution which has been shown to be true. Yeah, this one is new to me. Anytime someone tries to use science to disprove something that science tells us, without any sort of pursuit of discovery or innovation, they are pretty much guaranteed to fail. That is what is being done here. Carbon dating is not the only dating technique used to date ancient things. There are several other isotopes and methods that are used that all rely on radiometric decay and each is accurate at different ages. Many creationists like to nitpick these methods because they claim scientists make assumptions about the initial conditions of the materials being tested. It is impossible to know exactly what chemical conditions were like long ago, yes, but we have a range in which we know those conditions had to fall based on the information we do have. Therefore, the correct answer is to give a date resulting from radiometric dating within a certain age range. This is common practice. There are other problems with contamination - however, this is unlikely to lead to an age that is older than it should be. As far as the geologic aspect, I think we have looked through a rather large representative portion of the Earth's surface history within the rock we can explore on Earth. Based on the radiometric dating above, we know that many of the rocks we look at have existed for a good fraction of the Earth's history. I think the oldest rocks on earth are more than 4 billion years old. Keep in mind too, that these two sciences, along with evolution, completely agree with one another. We know how long it takes rock to form, we know how old the rock is, we know when the animals found in rocks were around, we see them develop, we see them stacked on top of one another, we see more and more complex features arising as we ascend through the layers of rock, radiometric dating it all the way, then comes DNA testing and the known time rate of genetic drift, etc etc and it all makes even more sense. This is only a few of the sciences that go into the big picture of a very very old Earth. Every science, developed along its own lines, ends up agreeing with this picture in the end.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","07:44 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","95"

I find debating #3 to be difficult because he is actually correct in both of his statements. Carbon dating isn't a 100% slam dunk and we have only looked through so much of the crust and are basing our conclusions on just a small piece of the puzzle. I'm certain that his idea is completely flawed but am trying to figure out how to prove it. Anyone care to offer up some ideas?","ipetrified","464224","Debate 3 is horribly flawed. Because it is selectively with holding information. Carbon dating, truthfully is not 100 % accurate. A general rule, the acceptable threshold for error in science is 2%. So 98% is not bad eh? Much better chances than the lottery, I would say. Carbon dating is not used for dating inorganic material. We do not date rocks. We do carbon 14 date plants, fossils etc.. It's only accurate to about 50,000 years. (Although we stop using it so much after 25,000... important to note that 25,000 years is still much longer than the 9,000 year popular biblical age) We use things like Uraniam-Lead, Potassium-Argon etc.. Their half life are considerably longer and thus, their accuracy over longer periods of time are better. As for the dinosaur argument. He is an idiot. When we have a missing link, we are now able to determine at what depth we will find the next evolutionary phase of an animal. And most of the time, they find exactly what they expect to find at the same depth they expected it to be there. Also, dinosaurs roamed most parts of the Earth. We find Dinosaur bones all over the Earth. We have covered thousands of square miles via digging. IF there was any evidence to suggest dinosaurs were younger, we would have evidence of it by now. LET ME ENLIGHTEN YOU ON THE TACTICS CREATIONISTS USE -When I was in 10th grade, this incredibly pious, pompous, rotund girl interjected in Chemistry. We were talking about carbon 14 dating. She said it was not accurate because she watched some video (I forgot the name, but I looked it up at the time and found it was promoting creationism... of course.. she was highly christian). The video performed its ""own scientific experiment"". They had a rock from Pompey dated (yes, one from the eruption). The carbon dating said it was 2 million years old. But of course it wasn't. BUT what they forgot to mention was that, you do not carbon date rocks. They also left out that carbon dating is not the only method of dating... it is the most popularly known method. So they take advantage of ignorance and selectively give information to push the creationist agenda. Now if there was any solid proof for creationism, they wouldn't have to resort to such tactics.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","12:48 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","96"
