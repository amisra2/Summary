That makes you the fools.","pandion","440756","Don't be such a fool. Haven't you read anything that I have posted? Just because you base your opinion on pure fantasy and mythology doesn't mean that I do. Only the ignorant refer to me an an arse, pompous or otherwise. Grow up and offer some evidence. I have.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","02:19 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","31"

"10-15-2011","15750",3,"pandion","440755","Indeed. Your English is adequate for a non-native speaker. It seems to be quiet adequate to avoid discussion of the topic and throw about insults. So pointing out your errors of fact and science makes me look like an idiot? Maybe you should learn what you are talking about before you speak. I'm sorry that you ego is so fragile that you are reduced to spew when your errors are pointed out. Right. I have degrees from St. Mary's College, Montana State University, El Instituto de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, and the University of Montana. Thus, when I point out your silly errors based on no knowledge whatsoever, I speak from knowledge. I'm sorry that your ego is so fragile that you can't tolerate correction. Please grow up.","gansao","440765","I would question your reading comprehension. I have never questioned your qualifications,in fact they are irrelevant. I questioned your social skills and your manners. Where have I made errors of fact and science, you idiot?I have recommended a book by Richard dawkins.Are you saying that this was an error? Reading this book would be far more informative than being berated by a pompous old fart who seems to think that claiming to have qualifications excuses his rudeness. Take another look at this thread and tell me where I have asserted ANYTHING other than your rudeness and condescension. English? You cant even read it you XXXXX lol!","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","06:07 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","33"
"10-15-2011","15750",3,"pandion","440752","And so we see the last argument of fools, exactly as predicted. Wow! Ripskar, are you a psychic?","Ripskar","440776","No, just experienced. We described Quantum Fluctuation on another thread, which is actually further into the subject than I've got previously. Creationists haven't done the background research so invariably find themselves incapable of continuing beyond the opening statement. As such it's absurdly easy to defeat them here.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","09:26 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","34"

Except Ripskar, surprisingly. And to avoid contradicting myself, Darwin, male nipples, peacocks, ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, dog breeding, etc.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","12:24 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","35"

He was the one who left several absurdities hanging in the air and continues to do so.

"10-15-2011","15750",3,"None","None","None","Ripskar","440796","Because the irony of your position is that you have no counter argument, your arrogance in assuming that the stated position is unassailable has resulted in you sitting about doing nothing whilst scientists progress beyond your capabilities. Once that gets pointed out you obviously get all emotional, but that doesn't translate into anything more substantial, thus your argument just ends.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","01:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","38"

My question would be is this still a hypothesis or is it proven? Copy and pasting a segment that one knows includes maths that most of us are unfamiliar with does not make the content proven. Alchemy was very complex and great scientists( yes even greater than the genuises on this forum) in the past were convinced it was possible to find the philosophers stone....but it was all BS . Luminiferous aether ,steady state theory and phlogiston seemed a good idea at the time. The point is..who is the most ignorant the truly ignorant or the mislead scholars? Seems quite exciting though","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","08:42 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","41"

Ill try again.It is a hypothesis or is it proven? Let me help you.If I asked if Einsteins general theory of relativity was proven you may say that at least part of it was confirmed by Eddington thus satisfying my curiosity without having to educate me enough to understand the maths behind it. What seems to have passed you by is my point that complexity does not mean authority. I posted a better lightweight summmary IMO.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","10:26 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","44"
