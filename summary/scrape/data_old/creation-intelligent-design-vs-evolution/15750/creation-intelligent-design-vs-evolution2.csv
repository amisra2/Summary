With regard to dinosaur bones there are no such fossils above the K-T boundary. This is a layer of Iridium which spans the entire planet in rocks 65million years old. It's an extraterrestrial element the implications of which tell you why there can be no dinosaurs, pterosaurs, trilobites, etc. above this layer.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","03:11 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","17"

That's the line in the sediment to which I referred. That line is visible in many formations around eastern Montana. For example, Pompey's Pillar, a few miles from where I grew up. The dark line about 1/3 of the way up the pillar is the K-T boundary. It is a layer that contains high levels of iridium. Iridium is quite rare on earth but more common in extraterrestrial objects. Thus, a single geologic layer that can be identified around the globe that has a much higher level of iridium must have an extraterrestrial source. To repeat, no fossils of dinosaurs have ever been found above the K-T boundary, which has been quite reliably dated to 65 million years.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","01:59 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","18"

I grew up in Montana - ultra-conservative, white, and protestant. Before I went into the Army I had actually seen 3 blacks in person. In basic training I actually hung around with a black who was in my platoon. Later, in OCS at Ft. Sill, there were two blacks in my platoon. But my family is Catholic and therefore not young earth creationist. I first learned about evolution while attending a Catholic college. My biology professor was a Jew. My family understands that I am an evolutionary biologist. Actually, no. Not with my family. I have had some discussions with co-workers, and Texas is not an environment that encourages doubts about the TROOTH of the HOLY BABBLE. Down here, they are still trying to introduce ID as science and eliminate evolution as science. The thing is, the state has approval of what texts can be used in Texas schools. Texts that present evolution as science don't make the grade. Texts that hint that creationism or ID is the answer are approved. Now consider this: Of the 20 largest cities in the U.S., 6 are in Texas. 4. Houston 7. San Antonio 9. Dallas 14. Austin 16 Ft. Worth 19. El Paso Texas is the 2nd most populous state, with a population of about 25 million. California is more populous, but California does not control text books at a state wide level. As a result, Texas has an inordinate influence on what is presented as science to high school students. Text book publishers tailor the content of their books to conform to the superstition and mythology of the largest single market - Texas. The rest of the nation decides such matters at the level of the school district - not a huge market to which publishers pay attention. But, of course, the text book options offered to other states have already been limited because the publishers try to gain approval of the largest single market for science texts - Texas.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","01:29 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","22"

Do you think Texas' involvement in textbook choices for high school students affects the registration numbers in your classes? In other words, if you taught at a different college of the same size in say California, would your classroom headcount be any different? I ask this because its a bit of a worry to think of the influence that people who have no scientific education outside of high school have on matters of scientific inquiry. If the number of students registering for college level biology courses is affected by state opinions, that has got to directly affect scientific study in Texas all together.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","03:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","24"

Where they go with a discussion can be somewhat random though it often tends to focus either on complexity, the big bang or scripture. The complexity line inevitably leads to a ""What are the chances of that?"" position. The chances irrelevant as you are looking at the end product of a sequence of past events. The Big-Bang line is a ""Something can't be created from nothing"" line which leads to a ""What came before time?"" position. This can be countered easily with a bit of Quantum Mechanics though getting your head around the concepts will be the most difficult bit. I refer to this as ""This last argument of Fools"" as once you've put the ball back in their court they don't have any follow up. The Scripture line is rare but tends to see the protagonist calling for scriptural references. I like to hit them with the Mahabharatta as they have no experience beyond the Bible thus giving us a level playing field.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","08:43 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","25"

I'm retired. However, your question is interesting. U.S. universities do a great job in teaching math, science and engineering. They do such a good job that students from around the world come to the U.S. to study math, science, and engineering. But these are not popular courses of study for U.S. students. In fact, many university teachers of such courses are foreign since there is a real lack of qualified people to teach such courses in the U.S. Someone once expressed the opinion that this was because math, science, and engineering are difficult. English Lit. and so forth are easier. It is also true that most entering university freshmen are scientific illiterates. The U.S. ranks very near the bottom in the math and science abilities of high school graduates. We in the U.S. are shocked when we find out that a high school graduate from Canada enters a U.S. university as a sophomore. Even worse, U.S. high school graduates were shocked when they found that in Mexico they would be required to take an additional year of secondary education in order to meet the requirements to enroll in a Mexican university. And yet, U.S. universities rank with the best in the world. Even those (or especially those) in Texas. Maybe that is the reason that only about 60% of entering freshmen ever graduate. They are behind when they start and they just aren't able to catch up. Both of my sons took 2 years of physics, 2 years of biology, and 4 years of math in high school. It was a really good school back then. Both the advanced physics and the advanced biology teachers were Ph.D.s. My elder son is a B.S. in nuclear engineering from Texas A&M and a J.D. from the University of Texas Law School. My younger son earned two bachelor degrees from Texas Tech, math/chemistry and music. He also has a masters degree from Bowling Green State University in Ohio. He is a staff sergeant currently assigned to the 1st Infantry Division at Ft. Riley, KS. The 1ID is one of the Army units that has been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan over the last 10 years. My elder son told us about a meeting that he attended in the first few weeks of law school. It was announced as an orientation for those interested in pursuing intellectual property law (copyright and patent). When the law professor began, stated that anyone who did not have a hard science degree should leave since they could not be admitted to the patent bar. The room almost emptied. Most law students are English, sociology, history, accounting, or political science majors. But I digress. Even universities with religious affiliations teach biological evolution rather than any form of creationism or ID creationism. Any Catholic university teaches evolutionary biology. I speak from experience. Here in Texas, as I understand it, Baylor University (Baptist), SMU (Methodist), and TCU (Disciples of Christ) actually teach evolutionary biology rather than mythology in the biology curriculum.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","01:09 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","27"

I have degrees from St. Mary's College, Montana State University, El Instituto de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, and the University of Montana.
