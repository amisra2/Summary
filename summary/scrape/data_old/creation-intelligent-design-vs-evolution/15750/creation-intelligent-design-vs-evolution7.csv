"11-15-2011","15750",7,"AMD4EVER","440497","I have come across several different types of creationist debates in the past as it pertains to how we can explain the fossils and other evidence that many different types of creatures existed prior to humans. Explanation #1: The argument that I think makes the most sense is that God created the heavens, galaxy, earth, and some life. This life evolved and eventually became everything that we see around us today with the exception of humans which the Bible clearly stated God created man. I don't really believe this is how things went but I don't see a lot of fault in it either. Explanation #2: Nothing existed before man. Dinosaur bones have never been found. We either just think we found them because we don't understand what we are looking at or there is some worldwide conspiracy trying to make us think things used to live before man and the devil is laughing at all of us for being such fools. This argument is so idiotic that I just brush anyone who thinks like this off as incapable of reason. Explanation #3: This is a new one to me. One of my co-workers said he believes that God created all plants and animals to exist at the exact same time. He says that if we try to use carbon dating to disprove this that carbon dating has been proven to be flawed. He says that if we try to base the age of certain species on the depth of their remains location in the earth's crust he debated that we're just looking at a small fraction of the earth's crust and will surely find dino bones somewhere that will show the existed as recently as a few thousand years ago and human bones somewhere to show they existed hundreds of millions of years ago.","Databed","443010","Came a little late for this, but I still want to respond, so... I guess my biggest problem with this is that we know we evolved from some kind of ape ancestor. The evidence is overwhelming. Another version of this accepts that we evolved from apes, but asserts that at some time in the recent past God decided to impart a soul on us at which time we were given free will, disobeyed God and ended up with original sin. I think this version has grown out of the need to explain how the Bible can be truth and in agreement with evolution which has been shown to be true. Yeah, this one is new to me. Anytime someone tries to use science to disprove something that science tells us, without any sort of pursuit of discovery or innovation, they are pretty much guaranteed to fail. That is what is being done here. Carbon dating is not the only dating technique used to date ancient things. There are several other isotopes and methods that are used that all rely on radiometric decay and each is accurate at different ages. Many creationists like to nitpick these methods because they claim scientists make assumptions about the initial conditions of the materials being tested. It is impossible to know exactly what chemical conditions were like long ago, yes, but we have a range in which we know those conditions had to fall based on the information we do have. Therefore, the correct answer is to give a date resulting from radiometric dating within a certain age range. This is common practice. There are other problems with contamination - however, this is unlikely to lead to an age that is older than it should be. As far as the geologic aspect, I think we have looked through a rather large representative portion of the Earth's surface history within the rock we can explore on Earth. Based on the radiometric dating above, we know that many of the rocks we look at have existed for a good fraction of the Earth's history. I think the oldest rocks on earth are more than 4 billion years old. Keep in mind too, that these two sciences, along with evolution, completely agree with one another. We know how long it takes rock to form, we know how old the rock is, we know when the animals found in rocks were around, we see them develop, we see them stacked on top of one another, we see more and more complex features arising as we ascend through the layers of rock, radiometric dating it all the way, then comes DNA testing and the known time rate of genetic drift, etc etc and it all makes even more sense. This is only a few of the sciences that go into the big picture of a very very old Earth. Every science, developed along its own lines, ends up agreeing with this picture in the end.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","07:44 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","95"

I find debating #3 to be difficult because he is actually correct in both of his statements. Carbon dating isn't a 100% slam dunk and we have only looked through so much of the crust and are basing our conclusions on just a small piece of the puzzle. I'm certain that his idea is completely flawed but am trying to figure out how to prove it. Anyone care to offer up some ideas?","ipetrified","464224","Debate 3 is horribly flawed. Because it is selectively with holding information. Carbon dating, truthfully is not 100 % accurate. A general rule, the acceptable threshold for error in science is 2%. So 98% is not bad eh? Much better chances than the lottery, I would say. Carbon dating is not used for dating inorganic material. We do not date rocks. We do carbon 14 date plants, fossils etc.. It's only accurate to about 50,000 years. (Although we stop using it so much after 25,000... important to note that 25,000 years is still much longer than the 9,000 year popular biblical age) We use things like Uraniam-Lead, Potassium-Argon etc.. Their half life are considerably longer and thus, their accuracy over longer periods of time are better. As for the dinosaur argument. He is an idiot. When we have a missing link, we are now able to determine at what depth we will find the next evolutionary phase of an animal. And most of the time, they find exactly what they expect to find at the same depth they expected it to be there. Also, dinosaurs roamed most parts of the Earth. We find Dinosaur bones all over the Earth. We have covered thousands of square miles via digging. IF there was any evidence to suggest dinosaurs were younger, we would have evidence of it by now. LET ME ENLIGHTEN YOU ON THE TACTICS CREATIONISTS USE -When I was in 10th grade, this incredibly pious, pompous, rotund girl interjected in Chemistry. We were talking about carbon 14 dating. She said it was not accurate because she watched some video (I forgot the name, but I looked it up at the time and found it was promoting creationism... of course.. she was highly christian). The video performed its ""own scientific experiment"". They had a rock from Pompey dated (yes, one from the eruption). The carbon dating said it was 2 million years old. But of course it wasn't. BUT what they forgot to mention was that, you do not carbon date rocks. They also left out that carbon dating is not the only method of dating... it is the most popularly known method. So they take advantage of ignorance and selectively give information to push the creationist agenda. Now if there was any solid proof for creationism, they wouldn't have to resort to such tactics.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","12:48 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","96"
