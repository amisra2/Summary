""Nothing"" is a sample of matter and antimatter, and when they separate, either one or the other is expressed, creating something.

If it does then I understand even less than I thought.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","04:07 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","64"
"10-20-2011","15750",5,"None","None","None","Ripskar","441166","What is being talked about is the Quantum Vacuum. Defined as an absolute void. The start point is nothing, no particles, waves or anything else. Despite this nothingness observations from particle accelerators show that this has ""potentialities"" which can be expressed as Virtual Particles. These virtual particles can become actual particles but annihilate each other almost instantaneously. This produces a minute burst of energy which is observable as per the Casimir Effect. They are completely independent of Space-Time separation allowing for the Tunnel Effect allowing a particle to disappear from one point and reappear at another point instantaneously or even appear at two or more places simultaneously. An anti-particle has also been found to be equivalent to a normal particle travelling backwards in time.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","04:41 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","65"

"10-21-2011","15750",5,"None","None","None","Ripskar","441197","No you fail again, the virtual particles and energy are not part of the Quantum Vacuum, there is nothing in absolute terms. The virtual particles appear spontaneously. The energy is from the annihilation of the virtual particles that appeared spontaneously. You have no argument. That's what happens when you don't read the links.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","04:26 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","68"

How can the observation of anything , including the appearance of particles and minute bursts of energy be defined as nothing? If virtual particles are not part of a QV, and you observe virtual particles; than you are not observing QV; just as if gas particles are not part of a common vacuum and yet you observe them you do not have a common vacuum. So it appears, as once it appeared that lighting appears spontaneously, and that certain metals experience a force from nowhere. The quantum foam/noise is no more 'nothing' than any classical field. Negative energy as well I presume? Address the question ""what came before time"", 'with QM'.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","05:44 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","69"
"10-21-2011","15750",5,"None","None","None","Ripskar","441278","As you have stated the question ""What came before time?"" is essentially nonsensical. However because virtual particles are independent of spacetime Quantum Fluctuation can act as primary cause. The Quantum Vacuum does not contain virtual particles, if it did it would not be a quantum vacuum. The virtual particles emerge from the quantum vacuum despite this. To attempt to use classical logic in the Quantum world is futile. Observation has peculiar effects in Quantum Mechanics hence Schodinger's Cat, this is due to the fact that observation involves the transfer of quanta. Quantum Foam is the ""ripple effect"" of spacetime at the smallest level. Unless you are claiming that spacetime itself is composed of particles your statement is nonsensical.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","06:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","70"

Is quantum fluctuation nothing? At which point it ceases to be a quantum vacuum; which begs the question has a quantum vacuum been 'observed' much less scientifically saddled with the responsibility of generating virtual particles (I know the question is so obviously self-contradictory I could barely type it with a straight face). Lol, yes I've heard; but as I'm sure you know I am sadly ignorant of any 'new logic', and what's more intend to never accept it without it being supported by the old which puts me in an inescapable situation. Is the ripple effect of space time nothing?","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","07:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","71"
"10-21-2011","15750",5,"None","None","None","Ripskar","441282","So you are capable of doing some reading finally. It already has been. Quantum fluctuation arises from nothing. Beyond the Planck Level Spacetime becomes quantised and discontinuous, thus we observe the inability to observe beyond the planck level. This the point at which the search for the 'theory of everything' kicks in due to the problem of integrating gravity, inferring infinite infinities.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","07:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","72"

"10-22-2011","15750",5,"None","None","None","Ripskar","441316","Within our universe Quantum fluctuations are limited by the Planck Constant to a minimum duration of 10-43 seconds. Energy released by a Quantum fluctuation is proportional to the speed of the particles and thus inversely to the length of time of their existence. The energy release of the Big Bang infers a Quantum Fluctuation with a duration of 10-160 seconds, obviously faster than could be allowed for in the constraints of spacetime thus must have come from nothing.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","04:28 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","74"

Why don't you try to symbolize that logic eh?
