When debates come up concerning conflicts in worldviews, its often the observation thats involved that determines the validity of an argument, or how it will be applied to a political decision. While humans have five senses that enable us to observe reality, its usually the sense of sight that is applied to what science can learn - we see through a micorscope, we see through a telescope. etc. Are not most observations that evolutionists use to debate against ID/ religion not a result of sight from the human eye? There are five primary, or pure, colors. White, black, red, yellow, blue. Every color we see is a variation of one of these five. Im a little mystified why wikipedia shows green as a primary color, since its a mixture of blue & yellow, but it matters little. That link gives a little outline of what it is about the human eye that causes these colors to be visible to us. Ive never seen this addressed before, I dont know if its going to inspire emotion or rational thought, but here goes; The universe has billions of stars, billions of planets, billions of light years, billions of so many things, yet it only has 5 colors? Does the scientific community generally believe thats all the pure colors that exist throughout the universe, or is it open to the possibility that there could be more, maybe dozens, maybe hundreds, maybe billions? Could it be that human observation is far more limited than we think?","observation","09:20 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","1"

Thus, quantum considerations aside, there are a nigh infinite number of colors. Humans, of course, can only see a subset of those colors, ranging from about 400 to 700 nanometers. In particular, our eyes have cells ""tuned"" to three ranges of wavelengths; blue, red, and green. You could think of those as short, medium, and long wavelengths. By extrapolating from the relativity intensities from the particular cells we can ""figure out"" what wavelength is entering our eyes. http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tut...perception.htm Does this dispell your confusion? Edit: And just to address one other point, scientists are well aware of the limitations of the human eye. That's why, when exact determination of color is important, machines that can read precise wavelengths are used, rather than relying on the known to be limited instrument which is the human eye.","observation","09:29 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","2"

Without it we would discover nothing, for we can prove very little to begin with. Bear in mind that ""proof"" is an extremely high standard. Proof is the level at which a proposition's truth value is necessary (ex: given how we define ""two,"" it is impossible for ""two"" to not be ""one"" plus ""one""). Inference on the other hand is the only option outside of mathematics. With that in mind, the fact that we can't prove much of anything is more or less irrelevant; what we can do is find lots and lots of supporting evidence and safely infer information from it.","observation","10:55 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","9"
