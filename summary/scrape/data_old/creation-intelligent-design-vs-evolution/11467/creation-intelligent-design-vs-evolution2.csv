The definition, from dictionary.com, that you should have used is: To infer or estimate by extending or projecting known information.","marc9000","319814","But each persons worldview determines how far inferences and estimates go before they transcend into philosophy. When those studying ID infer and estimate, they quickly have concrete proof demanded from them by those who disagree with that concept. Weve been through all this before, were not going to get any further with it, and Id rather this thread didnt go there. Id rather stay with our understanding of the colors, and claims made by astronomy.","observation","08:13 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","17"

"08-09-2008","11467",2,"trebor","319807","From the posts below, do you understand why there are only 5 primary colors? I am sure you realise that black is all colors and white is none. Now, why are the other 3 colors considered 'primary' colors? Do you have the information to figure it out from the links provided below? If you can understand that, then you can understand the answer to your question.","marc9000","319816","My question doesnt really concern the very few pure colors that we understand. My question concerns the possibility of other colors existing that we cant possibly understand, and how those colors might hold information about astronomy that could contradict what we believe about the universe. When I was a kid I took a mild interest in the basics of the solar system. Long ago I got the planet distances and sizes in miles from the dictionary, and scaled it all down some, to try to get an idea of the distances involved. It seems that so many people just talk about the 93 million miles from earth the sun is, or the 100,000 light-year diameter of the Milky Way galaxie like they were trips to grandmas house. Im going from memory here - Im not going to look it all up again, but if I remember right, if the earth is scaled down to 1 inch in diameter, the moon would be about inch in diameter, about 30 inches away. No eye opener there, but the sun would be about 900 feet away, about 9 feet in diameter. Mars would be about 3/8 inch in diameter, 500 feet from earth if the orbits were lined up (1400 feet from the sun) Neptune would be about FIVE MILES away, (orbits lined up) When scaled down like this, it also scales down the speed of light. 186,000 miles per second, thats about 23 8000 mile diameter earths, all lined up. So with a 1 inch diameter earth, light would move at a casual walk. Casually walking without stopping for a year? For the most part, still an incomprehensible distance. 100,000 years? A very incomprehensible distance. Another scale down that I just hastily whipped up, to get light up to the speed of approximately 60 mph, one mile per minute, the speed of a car cruising down the interstate, would make the earth about 4 feet in diameter. The sun would be about 9 miles away, 432 feet in diameter, about as big around as a 45 story tall building. So if the sun was on one edge of New York city, earth would be over on the other edge. Neptune would be as far away as Washington DC. At our 60 mph light speed, how many light-days would it take to get to LA? 6 or 7? Not even a start on a light year, and upon leaving New York at 60 mph, that 4 foot earth with its microscopic astronomers are going to disappear in the rearview mirror really quick. Before TQ calls me a flat earther, I have no problem with the solar system distances above. I guess I can even swallow the proclamation that there are a couple dozen stars that range from 4 to 12 light years from earth, in spite of my light-days NY to LA analogy above, and what the microscopic specks on that 4 diameter ball can see. I realize that atheists love the idea of a universe so big that no God could oversee it all, and they click their heels and salute at billions of light years with no problem. No one can prove them wrong. But Richard Dawkins has claimed that life anywhere else in the universe has to have evolved by the Darwinian method. Thats the same kind of thinking that says light behaves all throughout the universe exactly the same way it behaves here in our solar system, and our knowledge of five whole colors tells us so, so we can make maps of the universe involving billions of light years, and ram it down school childrens throats, while telling them to leave what they learned in Sunday School at home. Its not science.","observation","08:20 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","19"

""Color"" is just our brains' way of comprehending wavelength of light, so instead of saying ""color,"" let's say ""wavelength."" You took Kronus's statement as meaning that we can make machines that can see wavelengths that we can't see with our eyes. This is true. But it's not detecting any ""new"" wavelength. It's just detecting a wavelength that our eyes are incapable of detecting. You can't see radio waves, so radio waves are meaningless to your eye , but they're not meaningless to your clock radio receiver. Most are certain colors because that is the wavelength emitted at the greatest intensity, but many stars emit all wavelengths at some intensity or another. For example, our star is yellow, but it also emits infrared wavelengths (heat), ultraviolet wavelengths (sunburns), x-ray wavelengths , and others. I'm going to stop the sentence right there because this makes it clear that you aren't grasping the electromagnetic spectrum. There is no such thing as an unrecognizable wavelength. You can't name a wavelength that isn't in the spectrum: every possible wavelength has a place in the electromagnetic spectrum. If so, it has nothing to do with what our eyes can't see.","observation","10:58 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","22"

Here's an example: http://science.hq.nasa.gov/skyspy/ht...sn1604rad.html Or, on the other end of the spectrum, you could use an x ray telescope, again mapping the wavelengths we can't see to those that we can: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/so...solar_014.html Just to be sure you understood, it was the picture below that picture you were supposed to look at. If we can't see the wavelengths that something is giving off, then we can't see it. Every object around you right now is giving off infrared light, but even if the room were pitch dark you wouldn't be able to see the glow because our eyes don't pick up that wavelength. It would just look dark. Mistakes are always possible, but not due to what you seem to be concerned about. For the sort of science you seem to be refering to we don't use naked eye observations. We use machines designed to pick up the appropriate wavelengths of light. We know the limitations of the eye, and so built tools that can do things the eye can't.","observation","09:43 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","24"
"08-10-2008","11467",2,"Kronus","319808","Gotta contradict you there. White is all colors, black is none.","pandion","319852","If you are talking about additive color mixing, that is correct. The primaries are red, blue and yellow. Additive color mixing applies to light where all colors is white and no color is black. On the other hand, with subtractive color mixing (pigments), the three primary colors are magenta, yellow, and cyan. All pigments is black and none is white. So the color of an object is determined by the mix of the pigments and what light they reflect. You might be aware that the three colors of ink in a color printer are magenta, yellow, and cyan.","observation","10:16 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","25"

Something that could interfere with how we read it at those distances. Theres not a thing wrong with human curiosity, the things weve learned and guessed at, and the future things well learn and guess at. People who choose to explore these kinds of things should be completely unrestricted to study and guess and hypothesize and theorize all they want. But there should be a point where we ask them to do it on their own nickel, on their own time, and refrain from teaching it in public schools as fact. We make that demand of ID studies, and it needs to be made of studies of astronomy, or anything considered by the general public to be subjective. Billions-of-light-years astronomy is not ONE BIT more objective than searches for intelligence in biology. I'm showing that it very well may, your closed mindedness notwithstanding.","observation","01:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","27"

If there are things is space that we cant see, they may not be just a separate addition to what we can see, they may throw off our calculations of what we think we see. I think my scaling down from post #19 should be a good way to give at least some idea of distances that are claimed in astronomy, the 60 mph light travel, the 4 diameter earth in New York, etc. Make the earth the size of a grain of sand, hanging in the air in New York. Then drive at 60 mph to LA. A lot faster than the speed of light comparatively, probably still didnt go one light year yet. If more people would take the time to consider, or if teachers would take the time to teach the unimaginable distances of light years by putting it in some kind of perspective, it may change the public perspective of what is science and what is not, what is deserving of public establishment and what is not.","observation","02:00 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","28"

It seems that the only beliefs that were completely changed were the really ancient ones, that the earth is flat, or that all stars were fixed to a giant sphere, all at the same distance from earth which lay at the spheres center. It wasnt todays machines and tools that did it, it was naked eye study from as far back as 500 years ago. How recently have we discovered the limitations of the eye, and built these tools? Youre making these tools out to be the cats meow for space exploration, yet modern methods only seem to ADD TO, not CHANGE what astronomers discovered hundreds of years ago. That does not indicate any breakthrough knowledge in our very limited ability to see. Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, in the early 1800s, was the first to use parallax in calculating the distance to a star. Like myself, he had no university education, making him worthless to most 4forums posters. If weve made tremendous new discoveries about colors and light, Id expect his conclusions to turned upside down, yet in fact they are only a few percentages different than what modern methods tell us. Do 21st century college graduates with all the latest tools really know more about light behavior or color recognition than non college graduate Friedrich Bessel did 200 years ago? Wheres the proof?","observation","02:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","29"

White is all colors, black is none.","isly ilwott","319884","That depends upon whether you are talking about paint or light. ****************************************** On edit: I see I was premature in responding to the 15th post. This question was answered twice on the second page. Nonetheless, it is true that paint and light must be studied in each a separate light. You see, red paint absorbs all but red light; that color it reflects back to your eye. Red paint, when illuminated with a light beam from which the red frequencies have been removed, will appear black. Black bodies are interesting also. A study of them would enhance anyone's understanding of light.","observation","03:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","30"
