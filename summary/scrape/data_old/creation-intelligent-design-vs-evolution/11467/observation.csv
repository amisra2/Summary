When debates come up concerning conflicts in worldviews, its often the observation thats involved that determines the validity of an argument, or how it will be applied to a political decision. While humans have five senses that enable us to observe reality, its usually the sense of sight that is applied to what science can learn - we see through a micorscope, we see through a telescope. etc. Are not most observations that evolutionists use to debate against ID/ religion not a result of sight from the human eye? There are five primary, or pure, colors. White, black, red, yellow, blue. Every color we see is a variation of one of these five. Im a little mystified why wikipedia shows green as a primary color, since its a mixture of blue & yellow, but it matters little. That link gives a little outline of what it is about the human eye that causes these colors to be visible to us. Ive never seen this addressed before, I dont know if its going to inspire emotion or rational thought, but here goes; The universe has billions of stars, billions of planets, billions of light years, billions of so many things, yet it only has 5 colors? Does the scientific community generally believe thats all the pure colors that exist throughout the universe, or is it open to the possibility that there could be more, maybe dozens, maybe hundreds, maybe billions? Could it be that human observation is far more limited than we think?","observation","09:20 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","1"

Thus, quantum considerations aside, there are a nigh infinite number of colors. Humans, of course, can only see a subset of those colors, ranging from about 400 to 700 nanometers. In particular, our eyes have cells ""tuned"" to three ranges of wavelengths; blue, red, and green. You could think of those as short, medium, and long wavelengths. By extrapolating from the relativity intensities from the particular cells we can ""figure out"" what wavelength is entering our eyes. http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tut...perception.htm Does this dispell your confusion? Edit: And just to address one other point, scientists are well aware of the limitations of the human eye.

My question concerns the possibility of other colors existing that we cant possibly understand, and how those colors might hold information about astronomy that could contradict what we believe about the universe. When I was a kid I took a mild interest in the basics of the solar system. Long ago I got the planet distances and sizes in miles from the dictionary, and scaled it all down some, to try to get an idea of the distances involved. It seems that so many people just talk about the 93 million miles from earth the sun is, or the 100,000 light-year diameter of the Milky Way galaxie like they were trips to grandmas house. Im going from memory here - Im not going to look it all up again, but if I remember right, if the earth is scaled down to 1 inch in diameter, the moon would be about inch in diameter, about 30 inches away. No eye opener there, but the sun would be about 900 feet away, about 9 feet in diameter. Mars would be about 3/8 inch in diameter, 500 feet from earth if the orbits were lined up (1400 feet from the sun) Neptune would be about FIVE MILES away, (orbits lined up) When scaled down like this, it also scales down the speed of light. 186,000 miles per second, thats about 23 8000 mile diameter earths, all lined up. So with a 1 inch diameter earth, light would move at a casual walk. Casually walking without stopping for a year? For the most part, still an incomprehensible distance. 100,000 years? A very incomprehensible distance. Another scale down that I just hastily whipped up, to get light up to the speed of approximately 60 mph, one mile per minute, the speed of a car cruising down the interstate, would make the earth about 4 feet in diameter. The sun would be about 9 miles away, 432 feet in diameter, about as big around as a 45 story tall building. So if the sun was on one edge of New York city, earth would be over on the other edge. Neptune would be as far away as Washington DC. At our 60 mph light speed, how many light-days would it take to get to LA? 6 or 7? Not even a start on a light year, and upon leaving New York at 60 mph, that 4 foot earth with its microscopic astronomers are going to disappear in the rearview mirror really quick. Before TQ calls me a flat earther, I have no problem with the solar system distances above. I guess I can even swallow the proclamation that there are a couple dozen stars that range from 4 to 12 light years from earth, in spite of my light-days NY to LA analogy above, and what the microscopic specks on that 4 diameter ball can see. I realize that atheists love the idea of a universe so big that no God could oversee it all, and they click their heels and salute at billions of light years with no problem. No one can prove them wrong. But Richard Dawkins has claimed that life anywhere else in the universe has to have evolved by the Darwinian method. Thats the same kind of thinking that says light behaves all throughout the universe exactly the same way it behaves here in our solar system, and our knowledge of five whole colors tells us so, so we can make maps of the universe involving billions of light years, and ram it down school childrens throats, while telling them to leave what they learned in Sunday School at home. Its not science.","observation","08:20 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","19"

""Color"" is just our brains' way of comprehending wavelength of light, so instead of saying ""color,"" let's say ""wavelength."" You took Kronus's statement as meaning that we can make machines that can see wavelengths that we can't see with our eyes. This is true. But it's not detecting any ""new"" wavelength. It's just detecting a wavelength that our eyes are incapable of detecting. You can't see radio waves, so radio waves are meaningless to your eye , but they're not meaningless to your clock radio receiver. Most are certain colors because that is the wavelength emitted at the greatest intensity, but many stars emit all wavelengths at some intensity or another. For example, our star is yellow, but it also emits infrared wavelengths (heat), ultraviolet wavelengths (sunburns), x-ray wavelengths , and others. I'm going to stop the sentence right there because this makes it clear that you aren't grasping the electromagnetic spectrum. There is no such thing as an unrecognizable wavelength.

If we can't see the wavelengths that something is giving off, then we can't see it. Every object around you right now is giving off infrared light, but even if the room were pitch dark you wouldn't be able to see the glow because our eyes don't pick up that wavelength. It would just look dark. Mistakes are always possible, but not due to what you seem to be concerned about. For the sort of science you seem to be refering to we don't use naked eye observations.

The primaries are red, blue and yellow. Additive color mixing applies to light where all colors is white and no color is black. On the other hand, with subtractive color mixing (pigments), the three primary colors are magenta, yellow, and cyan. All pigments is black and none is white. So the color of an object is determined by the mix of the pigments and what light they reflect.

Then drive at 60 mph to LA. A lot faster than the speed of light comparatively, probably still didnt go one light year yet.

It wasnt todays machines and tools that did it, it was naked eye study from as far back as 500 years ago. How recently have we discovered the limitations of the eye, and built these tools? Youre making these tools out to be the cats meow for space exploration, yet modern methods only seem to ADD TO, not CHANGE what astronomers discovered hundreds of years ago. That does not indicate any breakthrough knowledge in our very limited ability to see. Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, in the early 1800s, was the first to use parallax in calculating the distance to a star. Like myself, he had no university education, making him worthless to most 4forums posters. If weve made tremendous new discoveries about colors and light, Id expect his conclusions to turned upside down, yet in fact they are only a few percentages different than what modern methods tell us.

My question concerns the possibility of other colors existing that we cant possibly understand, and how those colors might hold information about astronomy that could contradict what we believe about the universe. Before TQ calls me a flat earther, I have no problem with the solar system distances above. I guess I can even swallow the proclamation that there are a couple dozen stars that range from 4 to 12 light years from earth, in spite of my light-days NY to LA analogy above, and what the microscopic specks on that 4 diameter ball can see. I realize that atheists love the idea of a universe so big that no God could oversee it all, But Richard Dawkins has claimed that life anywhere else in the universe has to have evolved by the Darwinian method. Thats the same kind of thinking that says light behaves all throughout the universe exactly the same way it behaves here in our solar system, and our knowledge of five whole colors tells us so, so we can make maps of the universe involving billions of light years, and ram it down school childrens throats, while telling them to leave what they learned in Sunday School at home. Its not science. I realize that atheists love the idea of a universe so big that no God could oversee it all,","Peeling","319894","You're actually asking a very pertinent question, but you're phrasing it in a way that's guaranteed to attract the wrong kind of answer Remember: 'colour' is a label we attach to a particular electromagnetic wavelength - specifically, the ones our eyes are sensitive, or 'tuned' to pick up. When you enquire about 'other colours' existing, you're in effect talking about non-visible electromagnetic frequencies. Now, we can tune electronic receivers to pretty much any frequency we like, thus 'seeing' a much broader range of colours, from radio waves to X-rays, gamma rays and so forth. It's kind of strange to think of it like this, but a radio transmitter is doing exactly the same thing as a torch: spitting out light, just at a different frequency. And since, as you know, you can listen to your radio indoors, that means your opaque-to-visible-light walls are translucent on other frequencies - which is slightly unnerving, frankly. Anyway, by the very meaning of 'colour' - no, there are no 'colours' of which we are ignorant that could overturn our understanding of the universe. However, your question does touch on relevant issues like dark matter, which is something we can't 'see' using EM waves in the normal sense. We can only observe it indirectly by its gravitational effects on light we can see. Well, that makes no sense at all That's like saying atheists love the idea of a number so big that no number could be bigger. The fundamental problem here is that you get far more pleasure cooking up these fantastic stories than you ever could applying some critical thinking and nipping them in the bud The reason we make maps of the universe on the scale of billions of light years is that the scientific method has led us to that tentative but evidentially robust conclusion. I mean, look at this . A section of the sky the width of a dime 75 feet away, crammed with galaxies. And there's nothing special about that dime's worth of sky, either. The frankly inconceivable scale of the universe is something we just have to try and deal with as best we can. Your earlier comment was revealing in that respect: Clearly, you have a problem reconciling such a vast, humanity-dwarfing universe with your religion, otherwise you wouldn't perceive it as a coup for atheists. This thread itself seems aimed at securing reasonable doubt within your mind as to the veracity of current estimates - why would you want to do that if you didn't find them troubling? I don't see the size of the universe as having any implications one way or another, theistically speaking. Omnipotence is what it is: no one thing can be described as harder than any other for an omnipotent being. My position can be summarised thus: I see no evidence for an attentive, involved, anthropomorphic deity that isn't better explained by human ingenuity and/or frailty. I find no compelling reasoning in support of any kind of ultimate creator that does not in turn beg the question of his origin, and again I find the theistic willingness to suspend such rules in the special case of god to be a reflection of our own limitations: we cannot imagine ourselves not existing, and therefore falsely believe that we can imagine a personality enduring forever. We can't. Whatever it is you're imagining when you think of god being timeless, must necessarily be wrong. You can no more imagine that than you can imagine the colour of ultra-violet.","observation","05:34 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","32"

"08-12-2008","11467",3,"Peeling","319931","Following on from my earlier post, to address a few points I missed: As it turns out, no, it isn't like that at all Dawkin's statement is correct. The reason you find it presumptuous is that - if you'll forgive me for saying so - you're doing what you always do when discussing evolution and conflating it with other phenomena. Darwinian evolution does not mean life elsewhere has to look like it does here, or be based on cells and DNA, or even on carbon. Darwinian evolution does not mean life must have arisen in the absence of a creator. Darwinian evolution is simply this: the inevitable result of inheritable variation and competition for limited resources. Can life ever reproduce perfectly? No: uncertainty is demonstrably integral to the physics of our universe. Can life ever have access to unlimited resources? No: the instant you reproduce, the resources available per organism are halved. Dawkins is merely saying that whereever life may exist and in whatever form, it cannot avoid being subject to Darwinian evolution. Late edit for an important point: The close correlation between Bessel's estimates and those produced by other methods is, in fact, highly significant. The more independent methods there are for establishing a fact, the better. Why? Because it safeguards against the 'unknown and unknowable' variables AA and your good self are fond of invoking. The reasoning goes thus: whatever the chances may be of one particular technique being unexpectedly and wildly inaccurate, it's highly unlikely that a completely independent technique would be inaccurate to exactly the same degree. Carbon dating is a good example of this: the technique has been calibrated by several independent methods (tree rings, lake varves, ice cores, coral growth, etc etc). All those methods are potentially error-prone. However, the consillience of those results means that in order to dispute them it is not enough to simply say 'well, there might be some source of error you haven't thought of' and dismiss them out of hand. You have to explain why the 'unknown variable' that invalidates ice core dating would just happen to induce the same wrong result as the completely different 'unknown variables' that invalidate tree ring, lake varves, coral growth etc etc. The burden of proof is very much upon the skeptic. It is sort of funny, though, that no matter what happens you're not happy. Multiple methods confirm the same results and you complain because they haven't contradicted each other. Would it be grossly unfair of me to predict what you would be saying if they had contradicted each other?","marc9000","320127","It could avoid it if a powerful enough creator was involved. Evolutionists constantly complain that creationists dont take enough time to study the basics of evolution, it really does go both ways. You, Dawkins, and about 100 other posters here dont know enough about Judeo Christianity to criticize it, if youll forgive me for saying so. I basically agree, but when one side, one path of exploration is free to build and build independent methods using the public domain, money and education, and the other path is not, blocked in the courts - separation of church and state / combination of atheism ansd state - it makes sense that path number one is going to come up with more independent methods than path number two. You've just inadvertantly exposed why there is so much fear of ID. Would it be unfair of me to predict the panic in the secular scientific community if ID were free to explore multiple methods of its own to the same degree that evolution is, that is, the huge public establishment? Were not happy no matter what happens because the playing field is not level no matter what happens. We look into a telescope, and we see galaxies, inconceivable distances even when scaling the earth down to a grain of sand. No matter how confident we are, greater and greater light year distances MEAN SOMETHING, when it comes to the likelihood of losing information. Its speculative, its imprecise, and its largely useless information. The same things that are used as weapons in throwing ID out of the scientific realm.

"08-13-2008","11467",3,"marc9000","320124","Then thats as far as we can go on it, and thats fine. Not being a science worshiper myself, I simply dont automatically take this type of blanket statement as automatically true. What largely prompted this thread happened last Tuesday - 6:30 AM, and a six-figure weather forecaster scientist guy assured everyone watching him that a pretty nice day was ahead, largely cloudy yet with peeks of sun, with a slim chance of very spotty rain. 2 hours later, the beginning of widespread heavy rain, for three solid hours. Unusual of course, but if we have scientific blunders concerning a few miles, I can imagine we could have a few blunders concerning hundreds of thousands of light years. Then the issue Ive raised has some merit? Is dark matter the only possible thing we cant see using EM waves, or could there be other things that could throw off our conclusions at these great distances? Space dust and clutter does exist, and its only logical that greater distances increase its likelyhood of interference. No poster yet has said a word about my scale downs, to bring into perspective the great distances were talking about, the 4 earth, the 1 earth. Dont you think thats a pretty good way to make someone think about these distances? The nearest star to us, Centauri is 4.22 light years away, making it 1050 miles away from that grain of sand earth. If the grain of sand earth is in New York city, the nearest star is in Montgomery Alabama. Sirius, 8.55 light years, 2129 miles, just about New York to LA. Heres how it makes sense; If atheists seek to support their belief system, they are more likely to accept what science tells them about topics like this without giving the details much thought. People are often short on patience you know, post # 40 indicates it. I honestly wonder if those analogies dont soar over many peoples heads. They're not scientific, they're common sense. Im not really cooking up fantastic stories, Im asking logical questions. Crammed with them, sure, why not? Its easy, only a few million light years. The scientific method is used in weather forecasting too. Do you think the scientific community should be more compelled to stress some type of similar analogies like my grain-of-sand one above to make it more clear, especially to students, just how inconceivable these great distances are? No? Its not their job to teach simple math? Maybe they sincerely think that most people have a perfect perception of how far 4, or 8, or thousands of light years are. If they dont care, if its not their job, then maybe its just arrogant elitism, and its not good for a society. The US wasnt built on arrogant elitism, and I daresay neither were most European countries including yours. I suspect that the scientific community is just as happy that the public doesnt have much perception or concern about how far away a hundred thousand light years are, it could help keep the public from asking too many troubling questions. Hahahaha, there could be 100 crazed flat-earth creationists joining with me in asking questions about evolution and astronomy, and it wouldnt be within light years of the panic and scrambling that evolutionists/atheists have been doing for years now concerning ID. This thread is just aimed at watching the dances. Would I be getting the insults Im getting in this thread if they all didnt find this troubling? At least Im not advocating hauling astronomy to court and getting it thrown out of significant parts of the public realm. Do you think theyre all genuinely mystified that someone would suggest that other branches of science be held to the same criteria that evolutionists have set for ID? This thread wouldn't exist without it, a lot of controversy wouldn't exist without it, How big is the universe? Are there two divisions - the observable, and the unobservable? Is the unobservable predictable, just more galaxies and groups of galaxies, going on forever and forever and forever? If its all that endless and limitless, there would have to be an endless, limitless number of planets exactly like this one. Same number of grains of sand, same number of blades of grass, same number of humans who look exactly like each one of us, doing exactly the same things at exactly the same times. Anything anyone could imagine would HAVE to be out there somewhere. There would be planets exactly like this only dogs rule, or others exactly like this where cats rule. I dont believe there are any more earths like this one. I dont believe there are any planets where dogs rule. I believe there is some kind of limit to the universe somewhere. I'm not afraid of being mocked because of it.","Peeling","320138","And nor does anyone else. I think you grossly underestimate the thoroughness of much of the science you criticise. That's a pretty tortured comparison What exactly makes the forecaster's error one of measuring distance? Throw off our conclusions about what? I'm getting a bit confused as to what you're trying to cast doubt upon. Dark matter is stuff that doesn't interact via the electromagnetic force, so again by definition anything that we can't 'see' using EM waves is dark matter. this is an interesting article about one way we can observe it indirectly Dust and clutter we can see, and chemically analyse through emission or absorption spectra. But again, what exactly do you think it's interfering with? I think it's fine, although when you shrink the earth to 1"" across one starts to lose one's grip on how tiny a person is. I don't really get what the problem is. Illuminating, but again - so what? I still don't see what this has to do with your claim that atheists love the idea of a universe too big for any god to preside over it. I think you've realised that argument makes no sense and you're trying to turn it into something else. But ok, let's follow this new avenue instead. If anyone is actively seeking to support a belief system, no matter what it is, they'll readily accept hypotheses and conclusions they find agreeable whatever the source. Equally, they will dismiss theories or conclusions they find disagreeable, whatever the source, and without giving the details much thought. This has no bearing on the scientific validity (or lack thereof) of the hypotheses or conclusions themselves. To put it another way, the fact someone can unquestioningly take statements about the universe's vast scale at face value does not mean if they did ask questions they would find it to be in error. If you'll forgive me for saying so, you seem to have a rather fuzzy idea of what it means for something to be 'scientific' I don't think your scale analogies (if that's what you're talking about) are soaring over anyone's head. I think they, like me, are wondering what you're trying to show with them. Yes, and then answering them yourself, with fantastic stories Again, you're going to have to explain what relevance the difficulties we have forecasting the behaviour of a complex, chaotic system has to the straightforward observation of galaxies. I mean, they're galaxies. Right there, in a picture in front of you. I'm struggling to understand what you think can have gone wrong Let's use the same kind of analogy you've employed. If I want to take a picture of a basketball, I can do that close up, right? But if I want to take a picture of 1500 basketballs, all spaced out, I have no option but to do so from further away. With a standard 28mm lens on a 35mm camera, and allowing 4 square feet of floor per basketball, I would need to be roughly 90 feet up in the air to fit them all in the frame. Now imagine I want to take that same picture with an extreme telephoto lens, equivalent to peeking through a dime-sized hole seventy-five feet away. In order to see all those basketballs through that hole, they're going to have to be a bit further away. Almost nineteen miles in fact. Now make them 1500 earth-sized planets. It's a straightforward scaling up of similar triangles: now I'd have to be almost 2,000,000,000 miles away. 1500 suns? 217,011,334,736 miles away. 1500 solar systems (just out to pluto, not including the comets)? 919,679,070,315,789 miles away, or 156LY. If we include the comets, that becomes 2,299,197,675,789,472,500 miles. But we aren't looking at basketballs, planets, or solar systems. We're looking at galaxies , giving us a whopping 145,473,622,268,931,148,838,190 miles or 24,746,725,672 LY. Now, that's actually rather more than the measured distance to those galaxies, mainly because I'm assuming they're all laid out flat. To get a more accurate estimate we need to think about looking through a 'cone' of space, with galaxies at different distances. But I dunno - maybe I'm just swallowing all this without really thinking about it Um... I'm no stranger to these analogies. I think every astronomical book I've ever encountered has had some variant of 'If earth was a tennis ball...' Well, no - that would be for teachers to do. On the contrary, anyone who takes an interest in such things is well placed to appreciate just how hard it is to grasp such distances. ....no, sorry, you're losing me again now. If I choose to take an interest in a subject, it's suddenly my responsibility to ensure everyone else takes an interest in it too, lest I be guilty of elitism? Most people don't care how far away Andromeda is. If they take an interest, I'm happy to oblige. No. They were built on slavery. Oh hang on, that is arrogant elitism! Why do you keep talking about 'the public' and 'scientists' as if they're somehow seperate? Scientists are members of the public too. They're members of the public who have taken and interest and do ask troubling questions. That's how science has advanced. It's a good thing. However, you have inadvertantly put your finger upon the primary reason ID is vilified by scientists: it's a PR campaign knowingly exploiting ignorance to leverage public opinion for religious and political purposes, and it is doing so without a care in the world for the damage it is doing to science. Now who's choosing to believe something that panders to their beliefs without thinking too hard about the details? Like I said: you're much happier telling fantastic stories than thinking critically about them. Evolution has been a 'theory in crisis' for hundreds of years now, and for an equally long time ID has been confidently on the brink of shattering revelations. Call me when something changes Not everyone reacts to repeated accusations of global scientific conspiracy, incompetence and corruption the same way. You ought to at least consider the possibility that you're merely being offensive Er, they are held to the same standards. ID fails to meet them. That's the point That's certainly true, but that doesn't make ID as it stands valid science. It's a PR campaign, designed to achieve precisely what it has achieved in you. Yes, although that line changes over time. No. Current estimates put it at at least 93 billion light years. Logically incorrect. One can as many red balls as one likes, and still only have one green one. Again, logically incorrect. That's like saying there must be a world just like this one where water flows uphill - clearly that's nonsense: this world has been shaped by forces that ensure water flows downhill . And nor should you be. Mocked, that is. What I would venture to chastise you for is your oft-demonstrated arrogance. You don't see it that way, I think, but arrogance is what it is. Time and time again you describe something that you can clearly see is stupid, and blithely assume that other people have been stupid enough to accept it. A more useful attitude would be to think 'If I think this is stupid, maybe I haven't understood it properly.

My inability to grasp the scale of a billion miles or a billion minutes is irrelevant to the truth of that statement.

Given your earlier statements regarding the responsibility scientists supposedly have to make clear just what they want the general public to swallow, what's your take on the failure of creationists to make clear the implausible density of the pre-flood biosphere? No, they're gathering data that our own faculties are too limited to apprehend. Our eyes can't see the microwave aftermath of the Big Bang, a star's red-shift, analyse absorption or emission spectra, or spot gamma-ray bursts.

Although in a sense, such a fundamental shift in understanding has in fact happened.

Evolution would still be occurring. Actually, I don't think I've been particularly critical of Christianity at all. I've been critical of faith on a number of occasions, and I'm critical of the justifications offered for Christianity being 'true' or being of genuine divine origin, but as a belief system I don't think I've given it much stick at all. You can believe all you like; you'll only hear from me when you try and justify that belief objectively. You need to seperate in your mind the idea of looking for design and the ID movement. They are not the same thing. We can talk about the difficulties with detecting design in more detail elsewhere, if you like, but that's really only a tangential issue. ID as it stands is a religious PR campaign. Anyone is free to propose a method for detecting design. The ones proposed so far are faulty. What gets up the nose of scientists is 1) that the ID movement is asking for these worthless methods that have fallen at the first hurdle to be given equal prominence in science classrooms to theories that have withstood centuries of critical and empirical bombardment, and 2) that they're being dishonest. The infamous 'cdesign proponentsists' debacle being a classic example. Cry foul all you like - that's the real goal of the ID movement: to manipulate public opinion by false appeals to 'fair play'. Fair would be ID hypotheses successfully weathering the critical storm of peer review like everything else you get taught in the classroom. The proponents of the ID movement know full well that you either don't know or will readily refuse to believe that theories like the Big Bang and evolution have won out on merit after a long, bitter slog. Their stated goal is to foster a default position of cynicism and mistrust of scientific methods, people and results that are not biblically derived. They want to emotionally vaccinate you against being convinced by reason, argument or evidence. You tell me: has it worked? I invite you to refute my earlier calculations regarding the distance requirements for seeing that many galaxies in such a tiny area of sky. Moreover, you're walling yourself into a paradox: you're saying that we could be wrong about the vast distances to other galaxies because they're so far away.","marc9000","320621","Evolution is more powerful than God, could we agree to disagree on that?

The only thing theyve done for me is given me an idea of how complex the simplest biological structures are, very recently discovered, and how evolutionists try so hard to disguise the complications it makes for their entire belief system. Im saying this, that anytime / everytime, when information is transferred over distances, when the methods of transfer do not change as the distance gets larger, the information gets less and less reliable. No space, in any environment, is perfectly pure.

"08-18-2008","11467",4,"marc9000","320618","1)Theres no question that a lot of science is like that, but it gets dangerous when its a subject that can be philosophical - something can be very narrowly explored and still be thorough, new exploration can constantly be started at step 3 for example. Astronomy can be like that, Darwinism IS be like that, and ID can be like that. Whenever popular assumptions are made without proof, those assumptions are built upon, without looking behind those assumptions and critically examining its foundation. Evolution is like that - Darwin had no idea that the simplest forms of life were so complicated. Philosophers (Huxley, Spencer many others) took right off with the social implications of evolution, and of course its all being continued today by Dawkins, Stenger and many others. Darwins simple thoughts that mice spontaniously generated from dirty hay for example, We now know that the simplest forms of life are not simple, yet the scientific community continues to remain faithful to Darwinism/ evolution, and not look back behind Darwinism, something that ID can do. 2) Thorough science is public science. Demands of thoroughness are made of ID that were not made of astronomy in 1850, 1950, or 2008. It was a conclusion from observation. He observed the clouds and the temperature and the biometric pressure etc and came to a conclusion that it was going to be a dry day. Astronomers look through a telescope and see a glimmer of light through thousands of light years of dark matter, and come to a conclusion that they see a galaxy. Our conclusions that we see a galaxy, hundreds of thousands of light years away. Were seeing glimmers of light. Maybe theyre something else, much closer. They made the landmark observations by studying a galaxy cluster 3 billion light years away. Is there a chance that maybe they started their observations at step three? Our ability to see what we think we see, and be so sure about it that we establish it as fact, then use it as a foundation for further exploration. To no longer subject step one to scrutiny. The way Darwinism isnt subject to scrutiny, in spite of what weve learned about the simplest forms of life. To go back to step one, as ID seeks to do. Tininess can mean insignificance, when it comes to great distances. When we shrink the earth to a grain of sand, the Hubble telescope becomes microscopic, can something that microscopic see inconceivable distances, even when those distances remain inconceivable even after theyve been proportionally scaled down? Distances mean things. If Im viewing webpages or sending messages to places like Australia or Germany, I sometimes notice just a little less speed and dependability than when I do it withiln the U.S. Compared to thousands of light years, overseas internet communication is drop in the bucket concerning distance, yet I suspect distance and all its complications are causing it. Space is comparatively clear compared to earths dense atmosphere, but its not perfectly clear. When any vision thats less than perfect is multiplied by thousands of light years, who can say for sure just how severe the distortion really is? Youve touched on something important - It DOES have a bearing on scientific validity if theres a REFUSAL TO OBSERVE something thats relevant. I was 15 years old in 1969 when men supposedly walked on the moon. I was a normal, patriotic American, I wanted to believe they did. A small percentage of people didnt believe it back then, mostly non religious types, some people wont believe anything unless they see it. I just shrugged them off, but the one thing that I didnt completely understand was the 1/6th gravity thing, why the astronauts werent able to jump 20 feet in the air. Have you ever wondered why we cant use the technology that we use to see 3 billion light years away, and focus a telescope on the surface of the moon and clearly see the left-behind base of the lunar modules from Apollo, or the moon-rover vehicles? Is this an example of refusal to observe? The moon is only just over a light-second away, we ought to be able to see a gnat at that distance. This coming from someone who says hundreds-of-thousands-of-light-years telescope gazing IS science, Richard Dawkins evolution proclamations IS science, and study for evidence in biological design IS NOT science. Its your fuzziness that Im trying to explore. If theres one thing evolutionists do well, its mocking any type of question about anything they like with the fantastic stories chant, the evil conspiracy chant, EAC chant, etc. So much ridicule for anyone but themselves. The evil ID conspiracy seems to be the only one on earth they allow, the only one on earth that cannot be mocked. This kind of double standard should show any casual observer that attacks on ID are more rooted in emotion than anything else. Youre thinking about space being crystal clear with no interference whatsoever. If theres.0000000000000000000000000000000001 percent of space dust and dark matter and interference, multiplied over your 24 billion light years may be thick enough to play tricks on those who think they can see through it with something as imperfect as the human eye, and all the tools the human eye and its attached imperfect body has come up with. The majority of scientists are atheists. The majority of the general public is not. I dont believe scientists became atheists because of science, I believe they became scientists because of their atheism. The EIDC (evil intelligent design conspriacy) ? Its the only conspiracy in existence? It will take a while, its a pretty new thing. It needs thoroughness, something astronomy has needed centuries to come up with. As you should consider when you describe ID as you did above, the PR campaign knowingly supporting ignorance. The double standard is amazing. ID hasnt had time to meet them. Unlike astronomy, unlike evolution, unlike so many other scientific diciplines, it has been politically attacked in its infancy. Best selling books by Dawkins, Stenger, Hitchens, etc are PR campaigns. Theyve had the claim to valid science to help them achieve what they have in you. Whats on the other side of that? Youre telling me that this earth fell together by unguided processes. If unguided processes are unlimited, and space for them is unlimited, they would have to be unlimited. Forces? The only kinds of forces that exist are ones that we can conceive? Im really surprised to see that, coming from you. Do you not notice the arrogance that Im on the receiving end of on these forums? What inspired you to chastise me for arrogance? Something like my post #20 (a response to arrogance) or the simple fact that I sometimes ask questions that the mighty status quo finds uncomfortable ? Are you desperate for the last word in this thread?","Peeling","320647","As usual, we're proceeding from your unshakeable assumption that theories are invariably the product of a philosophy rather than a methodology. This assumption falls at quite literally the first hurdle, failing to square with Darwin's own religious predilictions. Today's 'simplest forms of life' have had just as many billions of years to evolve as everything else. That 'evolution says we evolved from chimps' misconception keeps tripping you up in different guises. You might want to check the assumptions you're making. Dawkins is a staunch critic of Social Darwinism. Also, anyone who still thinks the 'social implications' of evolution promote selfish individualism hasn't thought things through. After all, what is an individual organism? Answer: a cooperative of cells. If evolution naturally favoured individualism, multicellular organisms could not have evolved. And what do we then see individual organisms doing? Banding together cooperatively to ensure their collective future. Societies - be they the society of cells you call your body, or the one in which your body lives - work, and evolution favours what works. Er, that was Aristotle. But what's a couple of millennia between friends? As I've explained before, ID (in its present form anyway) can do no such thing. We can go over that again in another thread if you like - maybe a one-on-one debate? All that's demanded of ID is that it make a meaningful contribution to science. What it has produced so far is very easily demonstrated to be ill-conceived and meaningless. If it were a scientific discipline it would be merely bad science, and it would go the way of all bad science in the end: either it would sort itself out and prove its worth, or it would be consigned to history. But it isn't science: it's a PR campaign. Consequently, it doesn't matter if it's bad science, so long as it's sufficiently plausible -sounding to make the layman - the intended audience - buy into the PR spin that ID is being persecuted by an atheistic establishment. Humour me for a moment. Forget about whether or not I'm actually right about this and consider: if the ID agenda were as I describe it, can you think of any reason why it wouldn't work on you? No, what he did was observe the clouds and temperature and pressure and humidity etc, sampled sparsely across a wide area, and then - and this is the crucial step you missed out - he fed those data into a predictive model . That model tried to simulate what would happen next and yielded a prediction . Not a conclusion. The model is complex and sensitive, and the data very sparse - thus the high margin for error. In contrast, when we use (for instance) parallax to estimate distance, the model is very simple and the data extremely complete. Marc, don't be ridiculous. Look at the picture I linked to. You can clearly see galaxies, and lots of them. I used very simple trigonometry to produce esimates for their distance: somewhere around 4 billion light-years. Probably less, since I was considering a ball of galaxies spanning the width of the frame, which omits the corners. Lo and behold, my relatively crude trig method puts us in the same ballpark as the other methods used for measuring their distance. Look at the picture, marc. Once you've done that, we can talk about what else they might be. Doesn't matter. They weren't taking the picture to establish the distance, and I started my trig at step one and came to the same analytical conclusion from the contents of the picture alone. I won't argue that ID seeks to take us back a step I don't want to overly burden this discussion, so I won't go into it here, but we can take a closer look at what 'design' means in our prospective one-on-one if you like. Nobody sees anything distant - we see the light entering our eyes. It's not about how far Hubble can see, but how far the light has travelled to get to us. Interesting question. In a cubic centimetre of air there are approximately 26,875,000,000,000,000 molecules of gas. In a cubic centimetre of space (within our galaxy) there are approximately... 1. So looking through a light year of space is a bit like looking through a little over 35cm of air. On a clear day in the Grand Canyon you could see (earth's curvature permitting) about 225km, which would be equivalent to about 640,000LY Of course, that's not the whole story. The 'haze' in space is almost pure hydrogen, so it's clearer than terrestrial air would be at the same density, and doesn't disperse the same wavelengths of light. There's also no heat-haze. Dark matter doesn't figure into absorption because, well, that's the whole point of dark matter: it doesn't interact with EM waves. Oh, and the 1 atom per cubic cm figure only holds inside this galaxy. Beyond that the figure drops, so (just like with the earth's atmosphere) we get a clearer view looking straight 'up' or 'down' out of our galactic disk, which is only around 1000LY thick. Look in those directions and you're only having to see through 500LY of galactic haze, barely scratching the surface of the 640,000 figure calculated above. In short, in terms of clarity of view it's no harder for us to see very distant galaxies than it is for you to spot a low-flying light aircraft. You're shifting the goalposts. Originally you were complaining about people swallowing scientific results without criticism. Now you're saying the real problem is that the results might not have been scientific in the first place. If this is really what you want to talk about, let me know and we can do that instead. I am seriously not going to get into this in this thread. By all means we can discuss it elsewhere if you like, but the evo forum is not the place. Incorrect . Hubble could spot a football field on the moon, maybe. I didn't say that looking for evidence of biological design is not science. I said the ID movement isn't science. Until you appreciate that distinction, you're not going to understand my point of view. The ID movement's goals and methods are a matter of documented fact. Freely admitted to by its proponents. That particular inconvenient truth seems to make no impression upon you. Sure, there's interference. We've used it to see the helium web between galaxies. Because, of course, it has to be that simple. Reality has to tie in perfectly with your prejudices. It can't be complex and nuanced. I notice you never, ever actually deal with the documented fact of the ID/creationist agenda. It's by no means a new idea. It's been the default belief for centuries, and in all that time it has taught us - what? With new mathematical and scientific tools at our disposal, sure, let's take another look. But it does need thoroughness. It needs to prove itself. And, like every other scientific discipline it needs to do that before it starts asking for equal representation in the science classroom. The difference is, I'm making a statement of documented fact about specific individuals. You regularly level accusations of fraud, bias and laziness at 'scientists' in general. I've shown in another thread the difference between your view of the issue and mine: in my version of events, everyone is telling the truth about what they believe. In yours, everyone except creationists is deliberately lying. That's a pretty fundamental difference in our attitudes and I think it's reflected in the response we get to our respective posts. Surely you jest! Astronomy wasn't politically attacked in its infancy? Sorry to burst that bubble, but they got to me far too late to make a difference I quite agree that any popular mainstream book is, to some degree, a PR campaign, and they can be used to bring science to the masses (as you at one point insisted scientists have a responsibility to do). But you can take away those popular mainstream books and still have the science. Take away ID's PR campaign and there's nothing left. It's a meaningless question. You only think it's meaningful because you're picturing the wrong kind of 'edge' to the universe. To be fair, it's the only kind of edge that can be pictured, by the very nature of what a 'picture' is Not necessarily true - but as you say, something for another thread. You're twisting this into a completely different argument. You were justifying your disbelief in a vast universe by saying that in an unlimited space every conceivable variation on earth would have to occur, which is silly so the idea of an unlimited universe is silly. I explained why that reasoning was wrong. Now you're adding new factors into the mix: you're saying that not only is this hypothetical space unlimited, it has wildly different and inconceivable rules in different places. Since that universe is not the one scientists believe we inhabit, you are constructing a strawman. By all means, do not believe in an unlimited universe where the rules change every few lightyears. I'll happily join you. I certainly see a degree of reciprocity But again, you're trying to make all the problems someone else's fault. I don't think the kind of response you get from other posters is necessarily appropriate - if I did I would be doing the same. Did I say nobody else here was arrogant? No. I said you were. And I stand by that, for the reasons I already outlined. I've bolded the most recent statement I think qualifies as arrogant for your consideration.

It isn't. It's not about imposing physical limitations upon god. Recall that old chestnut: can god create a rock so heavy he can't lift it? Either answer would seem to place a limitation on god, so the supposed conclusion is that god cannot be omnipotent. However, god can still create a rock of any size he chooses, and he can still lift it - so in what way is he less than omnipotent? What the question really exposes is the ability of language to frame a nonsensical question. The same kind of thing is going on here. It doesn't matter what god does, life that reproduces will evolve. That doesn't in any way limit god's physical abilities, it merely demonstrates that the term 'evolution' would apply whatever he did. Right? Even if he deliberately kept every species static, that would be evolution of a sort: a force (in this case god) would be selecting one option from many potential variations. If we manage to contrive a situation where evolution doesn't happen, we start bumping up against the criteria for life itself. For instance, if god just popped each new generation into existence, the creatures in question would not, strictly speaking, be reproducing - which would violate a necessary criteria for life. In the end it's a semantic point more than anything, and not a statement limiting god's abilities. No. What you're seeing in the courts is the ID movement being exposed for what it is, rather than what its proponents claim it to be. Thence originates the conflation of which you speak. Indeed, the ID movement is doing potentially irreperable damage to the chances of design-based science ever being taken seriously. The boy who cried wolf, and all that.

You aren't particularly curious about the alleged science behind ID. Within this very post, you've explicitly refused to discuss the subject on that level. No: you only want to talk about it in terms of ideologies, morals, politics - the arena in which the ID movement thinks it can win by emotional appeal. You've bought into the PR spin put on the debunking of Behe and Dembski's work: it's not that they're simply wrong, they're being persecuted.

Individualism vs. a cooperative are both present (in different ways) in both a religious and non religious worldview. My mistake. But youre right - not much difference in their views concerning the simplest forms of life. There's nothing I can say about ID that hasn't already been said. Yes, it wouldnt work on me - I wouldn't need it, because I see PR spin far more clearly in the emotion and establishment that opposes ID. Ive never shifted anything. The thread is entitled observation and thats what were talking about. I dont see other evolutionists here, or the scientific community agreeing with you on that. But since you admit it, it shows the double standard. Looking for evidence of biological design is not considered science just because the ID movement is doing it, while evolution IS science, in spite of the fact that it is largely promoted by militant atheists. Because the evolutionists goals and methods can be documented in the same way. Do I need to link you to some Dawkins / Sam Harris webpages, or do you believe me? The exact same way that ID goals and methods have to tie in with your prejudices. The reality that Im talking about really is that simple.

That life may have purpose, that there are consequences from a higher being for our actions, the list is long. Why do you never name them, with specifics of what theyve done, like I have with so many atheist book authors?

Most of them constantly call ID proponents liars. You never take exception to it - you seem to give them a free pass on it just like the free pass they get for being far more arrogant than me. Well now that is my mistake, (one Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno was burnt at the stake in 1600 for suggesting, among other things, that the sun was simply a nearby star.) But I was talking more about the complications of todays politics and money, vs yesterdays comparable simplicity in those matters. Some things dont change so drastically however - I suspect it was generally the same human emotion that burned him at the stake as blocks ID from the public realm today. The same human desire to protect the status quo. The same way ID got to me far too late to make a difference. Ill admit that ID has less substance to prove design than it does substance to question evolution. But questioning evolution can be done with observation.

It's not about imposing physical limitations upon god. Recall that old chestnut: can god create a rock so heavy he can't lift it? Either answer would seem to place a limitation on god, so the supposed conclusion is that god cannot be omnipotent. However, god can still create a rock of any size he chooses, and he can still lift it - so in what way is he less than omnipotent? What the question really exposes is the ability of language to frame a nonsensical question. The same kind of thing is going on here. It doesn't matter what god does, life that reproduces will evolve. That doesn't in any way limit god's physical abilities, it merely demonstrates that the term 'evolution' would apply whatever he did. Right? Even if he deliberately kept every species static, that would be evolution of a sort: a force (in this case god) would be selecting one option from many potential variations. If we manage to contrive a situation where evolution doesn't happen, we start bumping up against the criteria for life itself. For instance, if god just popped each new generation into existence, the creatures in question would not, strictly speaking, be reproducing - which would violate a necessary criteria for life. In the end it's a semantic point more than anything, and not a statement limiting god's abilities. No. What you're seeing in the courts is the ID movement being exposed for what it is, rather than what its proponents claim it to be. Thence originates the conflation of which you speak. Indeed, the ID movement is doing potentially irreperable damage to the chances of design-based science ever being taken seriously. The boy who cried wolf, and all that. Call me when Behe is thrown in jail for thought-crime It's a shame you aren't prepared to talk about the very subject you think you should be given more discussion time. If you change your mind, let me know. Whoever said a religious PR campaign was a crime? The point is, it has no place in the science classroom because it hasn't earned one. Again the insinuation that evolution is a belief system rather than a theory. Again the 'theory in crisis' routine. One can clearly see it working. You aren't particularly curious about the alleged science behind ID. Within this very post, you've explicitly refused to discuss the subject on that level. No: you only want to talk about it in terms of ideologies, morals, politics - the arena in which the ID movement thinks it can win by emotional appeal. You've bought into the PR spin put on the debunking of Behe and Dembski's work: it's not that they're simply wrong, they're being persecuted. And when I offer to correct that misapprehension, you don't have the time to listen.","marc9000","321225","It really is about a power struggle, and the evidence is in the atheist PR campaign. http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/ar...TICLE_ID=57512 http://www.alternet.org/story/36195 Youre right about that, IF we can broaden the definition of evolution to include everything including reproduction - make it so broad that its practically a meaningless term. The way the word ""evolution"" is constantly redefined to suit an argument is something we've discussed before. So the ID movement - people like Johnson, Morris, Dembski, or Behe - do irreparable damage to the chances of design based science ever being taken seriously, while the atheist movement - Dawkins, Harris, Stenger, Hitchens - dont do irreparable damage to science being taken seriously? If he weren't afraid of being labeled a crybaby, I'm sure he could tell some interesting stories. Ideologies, morals, politics are what the top selling books by Dawkins, Harris, Stenger, and Hitchens are loaded with. Science is their tool. Thats the reason I want to talk about it in those terms. Again, you know that theres nothing I could say about ID that hasnt already been said. Anyone can counter it, a simple search of the internet would provide a variety of responses to anything said about ID. The opposition to ID is many multiples of what ID is. Not every discussion about religion vs. non religion has to go straight to ID. Whenever science and religion clash, it is often claimed that science uses evidence: repeatable, testable, and observable, while religion is nothing but faith. I just decided to start this thread to have a look at observation, and see how subjective it can be. There is a difference between observation that everyone can agree on, and observation where different people see different things. You look at galaxies that are billions of light years away like you're looking at the back of your hand. And of course evolutionists are equally confident when they make proclamations about what happened on earth billions of years ago. Not everyone sees it that way, and it's more than just a lack of education. There is more to observation than simple fact, and there can be more to faith than simple hope. The reason I started this thread is because so often when religion and science clash, the claim is made that religion is faith, while science is observation. Im trying to show that it does go both ways; that when science can t observe all the steps required for evolution, or all the theories it has about deep space, faith is involved. When religious people use ID terms such as irreducible complexity, specified complexity, and universal probability bound, they are using observation, even if its nothing more than asking questions about another accepted belief. OBSERVATION CAN BE USED TO QUESTION SOMETHING. It can be used to encourage proof. The status quo doesnt like to be questioned. It was true of religion 100 or 200 or more years ago, and its true of science today.

"08-24-2008","11467",4,"marc9000","321221","Darwins biography shows that he was troubled concerning religion, and that his evolutionary exploration may have been related to it. That is your faith, no observation there. Chimps? Where did I say that?? Links? What is the difference between social Darwinism and atheism? My mistake. But youre right - not much difference in their views concerning the simplest forms of life. There's nothing I can say about ID that hasn't already been said. Yes, it wouldnt work on me - I wouldn't need it, because I see PR spin far more clearly in the emotion and establishment that opposes ID. Ive never shifted anything. The thread is entitled observation and thats what were talking about. I dont see other evolutionists here, or the scientific community agreeing with you on that. But since you admit it, it shows the double standard. Looking for evidence of biological design is not considered science just because the ID movement is doing it, while evolution IS science, in spite of the fact that it is largely promoted by militant atheists. Because the evolutionists goals and methods can be documented in the same way. Do I need to link you to some Dawkins / Sam Harris webpages, or do you believe me? The exact same way that ID goals and methods have to tie in with your prejudices. As you never deal with the Dawkins / Harris agenda. That life may have purpose, that there are consequences from a higher being for our actions, the list is long. Why do you never name them, with specifics of what theyve done, like I have with so many atheist book authors? Why are you actually the one who levels accusations of non science and conspiracy at ID in general? Again, most other evolutionists here and the scientific community dont agree with you. Most of them constantly call ID proponents liars. You never take exception to it - you seem to give them a free pass on it just like the free pass they get for being far more arrogant than me. Some things dont change so drastically however - I suspect it was generally the same human emotion that burned him at the stake as blocks ID from the public realm today. The same human desire to protect the status quo. Ill admit that ID has less substance to prove design than it does substance to question evolution.

OBSERVATION CAN BE USED TO QUESTION SOMETHING.","Peeling","321314","That's a pretty weak riposte. Hardly evidence of the militant atheism you insist is necessary to fuel the otherwise unsupportable nonsense of evolution. 1. The age of life on earth has been established by three methods, so it's a pretty sound deduction, at least. 2. Evolutionary theory accommodates the great age of the earth, even if you don't, which means that it regards even the simplest modern life as the product of 3.5 billion years of evolution. Regardless of what you believe, it's incorrect of you to say the complexity of modern life is a problem for the theory. I didn't mean to imply you did, sorry. What I meant is that it's the same mistake in a new guise: you think evolutionary theory requires some very simple life to exist today to bridge the gap from non-life. It doesn't. There are no primitive organisms alive today. Bacteria are not primitive; they did not evolve into us. Chimps are not primitive; they did not evolve into us. It would be quicker to say what they have in common: nothing. Social Darwinism is a hypothesis based on an unfortunate but forgivable misunderstanding of the implications of evolution, one that some people found or indeed find attractive. The evolution of altruism hadn't even been considered when social darwinism was proposed. 'My mistake' would have sufficed Perhaps not, but you could still have the courage of your convictions, justify your personal conclusions on the matter, and expose them to critical analysis. You've decided that ID is valid science and that an atheist conspiracy is trying to silence its advocates. It also seems you've decided that you like that story so much you're going to avoid exposing yourself to any information or argument that could change your mind. ""Shooting me in the head wouldn't kill me if I had already been stabbed to death"". That does not answer the question Then why do you ignore the sections of my post directed towards it? It's all there: the density of interstellar haze, comparisons with earth's atmosphere, the clearly discernable photos of distant galaxies. If that's what we're talking about, by all means join in. Once again you're starting from the wrong premise, that the ID movement is somehow concerned with looking for evidence of biological design. It isn't. It's concerned with creating the impression of scientific controversy so that it can cry foul when its sciency-looking papers are debunked. They, like you, want to move the evolution issue away from what can be demonstrated and proven and into the emotive realm of politics and perception. And again, this is their self-proclaimed agenda, not anything I'm making up. So am I to understand that you agree with me here, that the ID movement is a PR campaign and not science? That would certainly save us a lot of typing Documented. Fact. Still nothing to say about that? So you have no answer, but it's still somehow my fault? Dawkins is an atheist. If he wants to explain to people some of the reasons why, even evangelise atheism, that's fine by me. If he wants to teach evolution as being the best scientific explanation of the shape of our biosphere, that's also fine by me, because it really is the best explanation so far, by far. If he wants to criticise religion from a secular viewpoint, that's also fine. What wouldn't be fine is for him to set up a 'Christians for Truth' foundation to hose out spurious and poorly-researched theological statements about the messiah's prediliction for young girls and animals, and to respond to the monumental umbrage this would elicit by claiming that parts of the church are trying to silence valid dissenting christian opinion. The list is precisely that, and no longer The idea that a creator is necessary to endow life with purpose is short-sighted anyway, because what then endows the uncreated creator with purpose? And if an exception can be made for him, why not for us instead? Knock yourself out. Certainly there are clear examples of lies told in the name of creationism. But they aren't lies about what people believe or what their own motivations are. And most creationists aren't lying, they're merely regurgitating wrong information. Your version of events requires almost everyone to be lying about what they believe and why. I don't think that's realistic. Who's saying they're far more arrogant than you? Impatience or even aggression are not the same as arrogance. ""Manifested through presumptuous claims or assumptions"" are what I'm referring to here. You put forward a hypothesis (such as the one in this thread), apparently the product of a few moment's idle rumination, and presume that thousands of scientists who've dedicated their working lives to the subject either never thought of it or are deliberately and fraudulently glossing over it. And when people fail to be suitably impressed you unfailingly interpret that as getting under their skin or 'asking difficult questions', an attitude, if I may say, greatly facilitated by your stated unwillingness to engage with substantive rebuttals such as the ones I've presented here. Don't get me wrong, I don't think you're arrogant in an unpleasant or overbearing way. Which makes it harder for you to see it for what it is, I think. Who the heck is 'blocking ID' from the public realm? Everything they publish is aimed at the layman! They're only blocked from science classrooms because they haven't come up with anything worth teaching yet. Is that really so much to ask? That we reserve science lessons for teaching the fruits of science? In order to defeat ID in the courts it was first necessary to debunk the science. So that challenge has in fact been met. If you look closely, neither of those phrases end in 'agree' *sigh* No, look: reproduction is a prerequisite for evolution, I'm not saying it is evolution. Maybe they do, but that's not really what I meant. Again you're focused on the public, political side of things while I'm talking about science. For instance, Catastrophism endured a period of being persona non grata because it had been tainted by the same kind of dogmatic theism that lies behind ID. And no, not because it's atheists vs theists, but because predetermined conclusions have no place in science. Of course, because that completely unfounded speculation would make you right, it must be true! Then fine, let's talk about Dawkins, Harris, Stenger and Hitchens! We can pop over to the philosophy forum, or maybe the worldview page - that doesn't see much action - and get right down to it. Why waste time discussing actual scientific results when you're only interested in the use to which they're put? I'm not interested in what other people have to say about ID, I'm interested in your justifications for the conclusions you've reached on the topic. You've created for yourself a narrative in which the output of the ID movement is valid science unfairly quashed by militant atheists pretending to be scientists. But if ID hasn't produced valid science, that narrative collapses. All your speculation about motives and politics doesn't matter a bean if ID really hasn't earned a place in the science classroom. That for me makes it the crux of the matter - and you don't want to discuss it. I think it's perfectly clear from the first few posts exactly where you intended this thread to go from the very beginning In your second post you tried to bring in the philosophical angle. You then brought ID into the mix in post 8, and when Kronus tried to correct your earlier mistake you clung determinedly to the philosophical angle even though it was a non-sequitur. When Kronus said 'we extrapolate', he meant our brains extrapolate from the limited information presented to us by our eyes, not that scientists extrapolate the existence of intermediate colours based on our observations of the primary ones. Looking at the back of my hand hardly requires an orbital telescope. Undervaluing critical thinking also plays a vital role. Oh dear, no. There's a difference between a leap of faith and a quantifiable judgement call. The evidence favouring common descent, for instance, is so staggeringly vast that the odds of it not being true far, far exceed any universal probability bound. So either you deny the validity of the UPB for drawing scientific conclusions, which knocks ID into a cocked hat, or you accept the implications it has for the truth of common descent. Yes: we call that 'science'. Which begs the question: if you're such a fan of the methodology, why don't you like the results it produces? None of the ID terms you mention are observations, so I'm not sure what you meant there. If you want to talk about it properly, actually discuss the real scientific validity and significance of ID terms, we can do that.","observation","08:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","54"
