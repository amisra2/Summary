That's why, when exact determination of color is important, machines that can read precise wavelengths are used, rather than relying on the known to be limited instrument which is the human eye.","marc9000","319733","So we can make machines to see better than we do? I wonder what would happen if one of our machines dismantled something that Galileo or Einstein saw?","observation","10:10 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","30"

If a telescope can see a new color, how can we observe the information? On your link, the star shown is red in color. Could we see it at all if it was a color that the human eye cant see? Would it appear as red, orgray or brown to us, or would it be invisible? With our limited number of recognizable colors, is there a possibility that we are coming to false conclusions about the universe?","observation","08:15 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","125"

Here's an example: http://science.hq.nasa.gov/skyspy/ht...sn1604rad.html Or, on the other end of the spectrum, you could use an x ray telescope, again mapping the wavelengths we can't see to those that we can: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/so...solar_014.html Just to be sure you understood, it was the picture below that picture you were supposed to look at. If we can't see the wavelengths that something is giving off, then we can't see it. Every object around you right now is giving off infrared light, but even if the room were pitch dark you wouldn't be able to see the glow because our eyes don't pick up that wavelength. It would just look dark. Mistakes are always possible, but not due to what you seem to be concerned about. For the sort of science you seem to be refering to we don't use naked eye observations. We use machines designed to pick up the appropriate wavelengths of light. We know the limitations of the eye, and so built tools that can do things the eye can't.","observation","09:43 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","209"

It seems that the only beliefs that were completely changed were the really ancient ones, that the earth is flat, or that all stars were fixed to a giant sphere, all at the same distance from earth which lay at the spheres center. It wasnt todays machines and tools that did it, it was naked eye study from as far back as 500 years ago. How recently have we discovered the limitations of the eye, and built these tools? Youre making these tools out to be the cats meow for space exploration, yet modern methods only seem to ADD TO, not CHANGE what astronomers discovered hundreds of years ago. That does not indicate any breakthrough knowledge in our very limited ability to see. Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, in the early 1800s, was the first to use parallax in calculating the distance to a star. Like myself, he had no university education, making him worthless to most 4forums posters. If weve made tremendous new discoveries about colors and light, Id expect his conclusions to turned upside down, yet in fact they are only a few percentages different than what modern methods tell us. Do 21st century college graduates with all the latest tools really know more about light behavior or color recognition than non college graduate Friedrich Bessel did 200 years ago? Wheres the proof?","observation","02:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","270"

Hundreds of years ago astronomers said ""I saw such and such"". And they had, their eyes weren't lying to them. You say that as if it were some sort of problem? Early astronomers mapped the stars, plotted the course of the planets, discovered the moons of Jupiter. They did their jobs, and they did them well. Which means they didn't just make up a bunch of stuff which we now find ourselves needing to refute. They only made statements which they could support, and given the task they had set out for themselves and the tools they had available that was a fairly small set of statements. You are, of course, wrong. Huge amounts of knowledge has been added. Change does not need to be revamping the past, it can be growth towards the future. We haven't, and no one has said we have. Do you need a tutorial on the basics of light? Because I can't help but get the impression that you have some serious misconceptions that are seriously hindering your ability to follow what we're saying here.","observation","06:44 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","209"

That prompted your above statement that we dont use naked eye observations. Your answer was, in effect, that its not mans limited, human capabilities that are making the determinations, its machines that man has built that make the determinations. If these machines arent coming to completely new, different conclusions, then they arent showing themselves to be on the completely different level that you clearly implied that they were on.","observation","10:46 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","108"

All you refered to was ""naked eye observations from hundreds of years ago"". If you don't actually ask what you want to know, it's pretty unlikely that my responses will help much. Sorry, that simply makes no sense. Machines don't determine anything, they don't reach conclusions, we just use them to collect data. Can you give some sort of concrete example of what you think is happening?","observation","08:33 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","85"
