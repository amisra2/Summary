You keep proclaiming that you are not equating YEC with christianity as a whole, then you go and do exactly that.","obvious_child","352194","I'd love to see this too.

"05-02-2009","12630",4,"Archangel","352127","It proves that there are enough bible believing christians who are also working geologists and Earth Scientists to have an association of like minded members. Are you going to insist that among all of these christian geologists, that not one of them are YECs who work in the field of oil exploration? With that said, I have at least proven that there are enough christian geologists to justify having a professional association. Neither you nor the obvious child have even tried to show that no christian geologists work in the field of oil exploration. Again you read into my statement in order to attribute something to me which I never said. Show where I have equated YEC with christianity as a whole, in context, if you can.","obvious_child","352196","Where did anyone suggest otherwise? Oh wait. That was you. Notice how everyone else was talking specifically about YEC. The first mention of Christanity was by you. In fact virtually all of the mentions of Christanity are by you. No one said that a Christian has a problem with geology. What we have said and as others have agreed, including tester, that YEC geologists have a big fat problem. You have not addressed this at all. And you have deliberately gone out of your way to avoid this and turn this discussion into what you perceive as defense of Christanity when no one except you was talking about the religion, but as pointed out, you have repeatively argued that Christanity = YEC. Maybe cultural YECs. Not any who actually accept YEC as actual science. And we've explained why this is a fact. A fact you deliberately choose to ignore. Explain to me why a YEC would look for oil on seabeds when that completely contridicts their flood belief? You won't. Come again? Care to re-read the opening post and title? But thanks for providing even more proof that you think YEC = Christanity. Everyone except YOU was talking only about YEC in relation to geology. You are talking about Christanity as a replacement for YEC in geology and attacking us on attacking YEC. If you didn't think Christanity = YEC, you wouldn't have replaced YEC with Christianity. Thus of course proves you are a liar in your post that you don't think YEC = Christanity. LOL. Everyone was talking about YEC. You are taking the attacks on YEC as attacks on Christanity. There's no better proof that you equate the two as the same.","yec-oil-fields","04:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","47"

Especially since everyone except Arch is talking about YEC and not Christanity.","Roesgen08","352209","You're basically committing the same thing that you criticize Archangel for. You criticize Archangel for saying YEC = Christianity (which he never said). You go on to make the same dishonest claim by saying that YEC is not Christianity. It's also false for you to claim that you did not bring up Christianity. Aside from the first post being based on a Christian belief, you filled up a large part of post #18 with a substantial misrepresentation about Archangel's beliefs about the relationship between YEC and Christianity. No one said that YEC = Christianity other then you. In fact, this entire forum is full of posts detailing how YEC is merely one belief within the greater religion, one not held by many Christians. You, on the other hand, have been shown to constantly tie and lie YEC to equate to Christanity despite that being obviously full of #### and complete untrue. Furthermore, you have again dishonestly tried to argue that non-acceptance of YEC = atheism. Neither of course are valid, but at this point, you have no honest discussion tools and thus are forced to rely on obvious lies. We are talking specifically about YEC. Not Christanity. Learn to seperate the two for a change. You continue to carry on with your pointless misrepresentation basically out of your personal hatred towards Archangel. You are more interested in your vendetta than actually discussing the issue of YEC's compatibility with doing jobs in geology.","yec-oil-fields","06:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","49"
"05-02-2009","12630",4,"obvious_child","352186","Then explain how a YEC 'geologist' can use evolutionary principles to hunt for oil and gas when their belief system suggests something completely different. Explain to me how a YEC 'geologist' won't have a problem when their belief system is completely contradicted by actual geology?","Archangel","352210","And let me separate and highlight the meat of the above post for clarity in explaining why YECs can accept the science of Geology while rejecting the evolutionists interpretation of the available evidence. As I have repeatedly said, there is no reason to accept that the evolutionists explanation for the existing conditions is factual at all!!! That rejection of the evolutionists interpretation of the existing conditions has no bearing at all on his acceptance of those geological conditions which are undeniable and scientifically reliable focal points for effectively locating oil deposits. Can you evos comprehend that position? I don't accept your explanation or interpretation for how and why these conditions exist, but I don't deny the conditions themselves DO EXIST. It remains to be proven which of us is interpreting the available evidence as to the origins of when these deposits originally formed. But no YEC Geologist we could find would deny the conditions themselves do exist. IN OTHER WORDS CHILD, IT ISN'T NECESSARY FOR QUALIFIED GEOLOGISTS TO ACCEPT THE EVOLUTIONISTS EXPLANATION FOR WHEN IT OCCURRED FOR THEM TO FULLY UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE HOW IT GOT THERE. CAN YOU GRASP THAT CONCEPT CHILD? ARE YOU SMART ENOUGH TO COMPREHEND THIS STATEMENT? I DOUBT IT, BUT LET'S SEE IF YOU RETURN WITH THE SAME IGNORANT DENIALS OF WHAT I AM SAYING OR IF YOU FINALLY GET IT.","yec-oil-fields","06:06 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","50"

Oh, and define ""evolutionist"" for me. Is it any scientist you disagree with, or is it a specific discipline? Yes, it does. How do you expect to locate likely deposits of oil if you do not believe the science which dictates the manner in which they were deposited, why they can be found in a specific strata or type of rock, and even how it was created? That's like saying there's no reason I can't be a master pastry chef, even though I refuse to believe that eggs exist. We ""evos"" can comprehend it quite well. We just completely disagree (for reasons that have been pointed out a few times now). Can you comprehend that? Great, so why do they exist? No, it doesn't: 1) proof is for mathematics 2) Geology as a science is about as ""rock-solid"" (wow, bad pun) as you can get. And no YEC geologist would be able to make heads or tails of these ""conditions"" because they would have absolutely no framework in which to place them, meaning they would not be able to do their jobs! But it is neccesary for them to actually be able to understand and apply the science of geology, which completely contradicts YEC. Can you grasp that? YOU ARE WRONG. Is that small enough words for you? When will you become smart enough to realize bold, fancy colored text and emoticons do not make you correct? Insist all you want, you are wrong. This has been explained to you countless times. Speaking of ignorant denials... We have here a large, bolded, red paragraph of you yelling ""You're wrong! You're wrong! You're a stupid-head"", and you call that a convincing argument?","yec-oil-fields","06:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","51"

"05-02-2009","12630",4,"Archangel","352204","The saved person most definitely knows he is saved since it is by personal revelation through which this personal relationship with God is born. Of course from your perspective no one knows because you have never had such a deep or personal experience. So what you're saying is that by mentioning both in the same post, I'm saying that unless someone is a YEC then they aren't a christian? Because that is what you attributed to me. Yet you have yet to post evidence of me saying that to anyone. Nor have you supported your original claim here, you said this: Last I checked, no credible fossil fuel firm hired YEC geologists. Prove this assertion since you researched it thoroughly enough to start a thread about. How corrupt are you to claim I am lying when you have never supported or proven the original claim Then if there are a thousand posts I have written which states that a christian must accept YEC in order to be a true christian, then why have you run away rather than post just one quote of me saying it? Could it be because you are a liar who wouldn't know the truth if you tripped over it? Yeah, that's it. That rejection of the evolutionists interpretation of the existing conditions has no bearing at all on his acceptance of those geological conditions which are undeniable and scientifically reliable focal points for effectively locating oil deposits. but I don't deny the conditions themselves DO EXIST. But no YEC Geologist we could find would deny the conditions themselves do exist. You haven't proven anything. All you have done is spew your same old drivel which ignores what I actually say and reinterprets it to mean what you want it to say. You must corrupt what I say since you can't accept the truth of my beliefs and win your fallacious argument.","obvious_child","352223","Apparently you think you can supersede the Will of God with your own. But that's entirely expected given your arrogance. Wrong. What I'm saying is that you have used them interchangeably and to mean the same thing. Huh? You were the first one to replace YEC with Christianity. I said I could be wrong. But that's all you got. I see you deliberately wish to avoid the actual geology here. You mean the whole ""seabed"" issue you deliberately wish to avoid? You ever going to get around to how YEC doesn't make any sense with oil and gas exploration? LOL. It would help if you could read. No one said that you directly stated it. What we have argued is that you have tied them to mean the exact same thing. Then why are you deliberately ignoring my discussion about the geology of the issue? Why are you deliberately ignoring how the flood doesn't make an ounce of sense in how do it now? Why are you deliberately ignoring how your cited Israeli oil company is looking for oil in places where YEC argues it should not exist? Liar. You do deny the conditions themselves. You have stated you accept YEC as fact. YEC, for the 5th time i'm explaining this, argues that the flood created all of the gas and oil deposits through the weight of the water on top of the organic material. Therefore, oil and gas should be deposited uniformly across landmasses and not found under oceans and other large bodies of water. How many times are you going to keep pretending you don't deny the very conditions? See above. Yelling about how you think you're right when you can't even discuss the actual geology and how YEC doesn't make sense doesn't mean you win. It makes you look like a fool. Blah, blah, blah. You ever going to get around to how YEC doesn't make sense or are you going to keep trying to insult us without ever discussing the actual science, which is the meat of this discussion?","yec-oil-fields","08:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","53"

How many times in this thread have you deliberately ignored the discussion of why YEC doesn't make sense? Explain to me why oil companies look for ocean based oil and gas when the flood argues that no deposits should be found there. Explain to me why oil companies look in areas where diatoms lived in great numbers? Explain to me why oil companies specifically look for oil and gas in geological areas which are conducive to oil formation and NOT uniformly across land as the Flood would produce? Yell at us all you want, you cannot for your life, argue on a reality based, evidence based, fact based basis why you are right.","yec-oil-fields","08:33 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","55"
