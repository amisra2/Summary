A poster mentioned yesterday that he was reporting your thread (I believe it was Giant Oreo) because it was a troll thread. Symbiote also opined that your thread was stupid.","GiantOreo","352270","No, not because it was a troll thread. I said no such thing. I said I was reporting the thread for the admin to look at the posts in it because it was filled with spam between O_C and Archangel due to Archie and O_C's ongoing feud with one another. I said I'm sick of both of them and their BS wasting badwidth on the fora. I said nothing in the positive nor negative about the thread itself being a troll thread - just that it was filled with their spam from their lover's spat. - - One would think that someone (such as yourself) so concerned about people posting truthfully about other posters would do so in their own posts.........","yec-oil-fields","12:28 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","134"

Indeed, obviously you care nothing about the truth, since your complaint with me rests on nothing more than semantics.","yec-oil-fields","01:13 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","55"

That is not the point here, nor is it the topic. The point is your mischaracterization of my post. I never called it a troll thread like you claimed I did.

And thus you are making an ASSumption of what I was talking about, and you put words into my mouth in your claim (and ironically, and hypocritically enough is exactly what you are moaning about O_C doing with the whole Archie and YEC=Christianity topic). You claimed I said I was reporting it because it was a troll thread. I said no such thing. Therefore your statement is false. I corrected you on it and you still insist that your claim is true, thus making it a lie (deliberate falsehood). And no, it is not fair for you to characterize that as my take. The only fair way to characterize it and be remotely accurate would be to characterize my take on it as a spam thread (and even then, I never said the whole thread was spam). I said nary a word about trolling, thus it is not fair to characterize my take on it as anything to do with the word ""troll"" as it was not used by me. Those are YOUR words you are putting into my mouth.","yec-oil-fields","01:38 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","214"

By your standard you just made an assumption of what I was talking about. You had to contradict yourself to argue that I contradicted myself. So that doesn't prove anything negative about me. So while you BITCH about this, you've only invented some inconsistency that you now say makes me inconsistent with what I've said. A troll thread can be defined as what you said ""filled with spam between O_C and Archangel due to Archie and O_C's ongoing feud with one another"", thus it was a troll thread. Therefore, my statement is true. You foolishly believe that your spin on a comment is the truth and thus falsely call yourself to have ""corrected"" what I have said. You've merely spun what you said and labeled it as a correction. You've done this deliberately, and thus you are telling the lie.","yec-oil-fields","01:46 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","169"

No, I did not, given that I didn't say that you said I was confirming it. I pointed out that while I was not denying it, I was not confirming it either. See above instead of BITCHing. That is YOUR definition of a troll thread. I said no such thing, despite your claim that I called it a troll thread. I'm sorry it bugs you that I pointed out your lie about me. It seems to really be getting to you. At this point, you have turned this thread into spam and drawn myeself and others into it by your TROLLING (yes, this time I DID use that word, although that does not mean I am saying the THREAD is a troll thread).","yec-oil-fields","01:55 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","160"

I read the post straight and your attempt to make statements continually followed up with ""I did not say"", ""I did not say"", ""I did not say"" doesn't prove anything. Anyone can go on all night about what they did not say. Doesn't prove a thing. Yes, you did. You claimed that I put words into your mouth, which I did not do. In your desperate attempts to invent some dirt on me, you mischaracterized what I said so that you could pretend I put words into your mouth and then cry foul. The BITCHing is all done by you. That is what I believed was your definition of a troll thread as well. Show me where I said you ""called it"" a troll thread. Not at all, give me more. You're the only one desperately lying here. Trying to pretend I put words in your mouth, thus you lie while trying to obfuscate the lies of your friend Obvious Child. Again though, bring it on, now that you've made it clear that you're only out to cover your friend by trying to annoy me. Nice try of attempted false equivalence. You can dishonestly say that I did what OC did, but that's just a lie. He misrepresented Arch's comment, I accurately represented your comment about the admin edited thread being a troll thread. Whatever you lie about and say about me will not change that OC misrepresented Arch's beliefs about Christianity.","yec-oil-fields","02:30 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","295"
