Btw, I see you outright refuse to address the use of YEC in oil exploration. Interesting how you claim the entire OP is a lie, yet you pretend that the actual science portion isn't even relevant despite being an obvious part of that. Let's also remember this portion: ""Anyone know of oil or gas firms around the world that actually use YEC "" Clearly, you do not want to talk about the science.

One is an atheist and the other is a christian/creationist. But both graduated with honors. Are you actually suggesting that the Christian would be at some disadvantage over the atheist because he believes in God and has a personal relationship with him? Beside, christians are using their knowledge of the bible in order to find oil. So don't fall for the obvious childs ridiculous claims that our belief in God limits the christians aptitude for comprehending science. It isn't necessary to embrace the fairy tales in order to appreciate the proven scientific methodologies required to find oil. Anyone who buys into or defends his ignorant premise actually loses credibility for supporting such foolishness. After all, you just prove you're no more mature than an obvious child.

As for your hypothetical question, there is absolutely no reason that a Christian, even one with creationist beliefs, cannot be a successful geologist. I work with lots of them, in fact, I'd venture to say that most geologists where I live are Christians. It would come down to how fervent the individual's beliefs are regarding creationism - Roman Catholic style belief? No problem. YEC beliefs but willing to bend the rules and set aside those beliefs to work within the scientific parameters of their profession? No problem. Die hard YEC? No chance. A Master's degree in Geochemistry or Geology from Stanford, Yale etc... would be impossible to obtain if a person was faithful to their beliefs in a young earth. Geochemistry/Geology are founded on the very principle of an old earth and everything that scientifically supports that fact . They are simply not compatible with YEC beliefs. That's not so say a YEC'er couldn't get a degree in geochemistry/geology from Yale or Stanford, but they could not do so without working under the accepted scientific standards that would be required of all students. That would require them to ""set aside"" their YEC beliefs. I'll be honest, I didn't bother to read the link. I don't really care. I'm sure you could Google up a couple more stories to make yourself feel better about it too, but the simple fact of the matter is that the Bible is completely irrelevent to oil and gas exploration, and anyone choosing to base their exploration on the Bible is at a severe disadvantage.

Applied petroleum geochemistry - Google Book Search The reason why I disagree with you is because a student can learn the intricacies of the science without accepting the origins of what that science claims. For example, they could study plate tectonics, without personally believing it had to happen over hundreds of millions or billions of years. Or sedimentary deposits without personally believing they took billions of years to form. It is the science regarding how and where to apply the science which is important. Not the length of time these process took to occur. This is an opinion you are welcome to maintain, but I disagree with you for the reasons mentioned repeatedly.

As long as one can produce correct answers on exams to the satisfaction of the teachers, and produce a thesis or dissertation that does not espouse creationism, the any advanced degree is possible.

Just two points I would like to comment on. The addition of the capped and bolded is to stress that creationists don't reject science, they interpret the same available evidence differently than secular scientists do. That is an important detail which conventional evolutionists refuse to acknowledge. From the creationists perspective it could be said that it is the secularists who reject the obvious by placing their faith in unreliable results and interpretations of the available evidence. I say this because I find it demeaning and arrogant to matter of factly state that creationists must deny some reality in order to believe as they do, when they in fact accept the real world conditions as they exist but have a different explanation for how the evidentiary pieces fit together.","yec-oil-fields","07:09 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","129"

In order to produce those answers and thesis, the student would have to completely set aside their personal beliefs and faith by not responding to the questions asked or writing the thesis based on those personal beliefs. You cannot correctly answer the question ""What time period, in millions of years ago, does the Cretaceous Period represent?"" if you're a YEC, because to be truthful and faithful to your beliefs, your answer on the exam sheet would have to be ""There is no Cretaceous Period, the world is only 6000 years old"". You would have to completely set aside your personal beliefs and faith, and LIE in front of your god in order to answer that question correctly. Huh, I've never seen a BA or MA in Geology...new to me. This just tells me that either his degree is a sham, or his religious beliefs are a sham, since he clearly doesn't feel particularly strongly about one of them. Being that he must have a very firm grasp of the subject matter and was able to answer the questions correctly and apply the science in order to obtain those degrees, I'll hazard the guess that it's his religious beliefs... I can't imagine the inner conflict that the obvious incompatibilty and irrationality of trying to balance the two must create. I think you'd pretty much have to be schizophrenic to pull it off, as I don't see there being any possible way for a person to be a staunch YEC and obtain degrees in the geoscience or biological fields.

Did you read that link archie? If you did, do you feel you understood it? You've just completely proved my point with that link. It's OK to make a simple mistake archie, it wasn't even an important factor in the conversation. I think you'd find just simply owning up to it and moving on would be much easier... This is simply not true. You can understand a simple aspect of sedimentation - say the formation of a point bar in a river system. That process of sedimentation is not time specific in the sense that it has been an ongoing process throughout the Earth's history. It is time specific in that we understand exactly how the process works and the approximate rate at which sediment is deposited and preserved. In fact, the modern process is used as an analogy for the ancient. However, when the entire stratigraphic column is taken into account in terms of sedimentary deposition and preservation, you cannot simply ""overlook"" the factor of time, it's not scientically possible. You can propose alternate theories for sedimentation as I'm sure you'll attept to do, but without valid scientific support for them, they don't do much good. Actually, no, they don't, not when dicussing geology and YEC beliefs. Christianity and science? Sure, I'd venture to say the majority of scientists in the western world are Christians.

Here's the thing waxy; you think you can and have explained the stratigraphic column rationally with the available evidence we have on it. And I could study the known facts derived from mapping and studying it if I was a geologist.

YEC flood model clearly argues that the precursor for hydrocarbons are destroyed in ocean water, therefore no oil can be created in ocean conditions. I already linked the Institute for Creation science on this which you chose to ignore. Observable fact however, states that the plate movement over millions and billions of years has moved oil deposits created on land under the seabed. And observable fact has several major companies pumping billions of barrels of oil from the sea floor for decades. Observable fact does not support a YEC view of the world. Furthermore, as the Israeli oil company you linked as alleged ""evidence"" of your claim is actually looking for oil underwater DESPITE YEC's claim there shouldn't be any oil there not to mention they are drilling almost 3 miles into the crust to look for oil specifically into rock known to have existed in the Triassic. Explain to me how the Flood managed to lay down three miles of compacted sediment and rock in the span of 40 days. That's 396 feet of sediment a day. That's roughly one of these every day . And we can explain it at this time. You just choose to ignore the actual facts despite using the products derived from sciences you reject. And you do realize that the link you provided is discussing how using geochemistry can determine the origin of the source of oil? Namely what type or organic material, algae, bacteria or plant matter and whether it was marine or terrestrial that was turned into oil. It isn't talking about using geochemistry to actually find the oil. It is using geochemistry to analyze the existing, already found oil. Where does it say that? Btw, that document states that oil is a hydrocarbon. P.84 Why did you say that oil wasn't a hydrocarbon and then go and link a book that says it is?","yec-oil-fields","05:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","134"

I understand your point, but I don't think that regurgitating the expected information on exams us necessarily abandoning faith. I know that I sometimes gave teachers the answers that they expected rather than what I thought was true. In my case it wasn't about faith in mythology but my understanding of the material, but still. Of course, the topics chosen by creationists for theses and dissertations could skirt any issues of the age of the earth or common ancestry. A geologist could actually talk about radiometric ages of rocks and profess a belief that such ages were put in place by some magical god. Of course, Jonathan Wells undertook his PhD in order to learn enough about evolutionary biology to defeat the evil lie. He knew he was lying the whole time, but he was lying for Father Moon and Jesus. Me too. Until I read Wise's CV I had never heard of it. No. His degrees are real. He was admitted to Harvard on the basis of his BA, and Harvard actually granted his degrees. I have no basis to judge the motives of the man. Of course, since his graduation he has had a stellar scientific career, first teaching at Bryan College in Dayton, Tenn. and now at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Wikipedia says that his job was previously held by another scientific light, William Dembski. I'm not so sure. Lying for Jesus could not possibly cause inner conflict.
