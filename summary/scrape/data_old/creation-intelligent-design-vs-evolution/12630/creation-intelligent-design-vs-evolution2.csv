That would essentially be uniform globally on land masses thus a YEC view on oil and gas exploration should expect that deposits are almost uniformly found everywhere on land because the compression force of flood waters is equal. Even more strange, since it was the water of the flood compression was primarily on land, there should not be deposits underwater. Reading seismic logs and other data that is specific to locations and specific geological areas to determine where to drill contridicts YEC as we should be able to find oil and gas everywhere on land according to that belief. Understanding basic gas and oil geology refutes one of the biggest beliefs in YEC. YEC argues that gas and oil deposits should be found uniformly across the globe's land masses. This obviously is not true.","yec-oil-fields","07:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","16"
"04-30-2009","12630",2,"Waxy","351862","Yes, at it's simplest and smallest scale, oil/gas exploration and development is nothing more than following trends and interpreting geophysical well logs and seismic data. I'm sure there are a few geologists (and most engineers lol) working out there for whom this would pretty much be the extent of their knowledge and skills. So to some extent, Archie is correct. After a couple of hours of basic instruction most grade schoolers, and likely even Archie, could look at a well log and decide if there's oil/gas there, or look at a seismic line and choose a drilling location, it's not that hard. However, if that's all that you understand, or if you're trying to apply some YEC depositional theory completely incompatible with reality, your chances of being a successful exploration and development geologist are somewhere in the very low single digit percentages. Understanding depositional models, paleoenvironments, regional basinal depositional histories, oil source rocks, oil generation and migration, trapping mechanisms, diagenesis, timing of deposition and deformation, and on and on are critical to being a successful geologist, and would be VERY difficult to reconcile with hard line YEC beliefs.

One is an atheist and the other is a christian/creationist. But both graduated with honors. Are you actually suggesting that the Christian would be at some disadvantage over the atheist because he believes in God and has a personal relationship with him? Beside, christians are using their knowledge of the bible in order to find oil. So don't fall for the obvious childs ridiculous claims that our belief in God limits the christians aptitude for comprehending science. It isn't necessary to embrace the fairy tales in order to appreciate the proven scientific methodologies required to find oil. Anyone who buys into or defends his ignorant premise actually loses credibility for supporting such foolishness. After all, you just prove you're no more mature than an obvious child.

No one said that YEC = Christianity other then you. In fact, this entire forum is full of posts detailing how YEC is merely one belief within the greater religion, one not held by many Christians. You, on the other hand, have been shown to constantly tie and lie YEC to equate to Christanity despite that being obviously full of #### and complete untrue. Furthermore, you have again dishonestly tried to argue that non-acceptance of YEC = atheism. Neither of course are valid, but at this point, you have no honest discussion tools and thus are forced to rely on obvious lies. We are talking specifically about YEC. Not Christanity. Learn to seperate the two for a change. Christanity =/= YEC. Evolution =/= Atheism. Given that your entire post is based on a lie, there's not much to say besides to respond to your link. First, there's no mention of the name of the field. Second, I found something regarding their drilling. This is quite interesting in the context of YEC. ""Zions Chief Executive Officer, Richard Rinberg, said today, It has been a long and difficult journey, but we have overcome the many challenges and, in a few days, the drilling rig should begin the drilling of Zions second well, on our Joseph License, to the Triassic Formation (down to a depth of 15,400 feet) and then, we plan, to the Permian Formation (down to a depth below 18,000 feet). "" Zion Oil Updates Drilling Schedule; 2,000 Horsepower Drilling Rig Arrives in Israel So much for ""YEC"" in oil production. If they believed in YEC, they wouldn't be looking for deposits underwater. I see you are deliberately ignoring how the flood screws up your argument. I wonder if you are capable of posting without relying entirely on personal insults and obvious lies.","yec-oil-fields","10:33 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","18"

In any event, I'll take this as two separate scenarios: 1) Would a Christian be at a disadvantage? Not necessarily; many Christians (perhaps the majority?) respect the scientific method and do not impose faith-based beliefs on their interpretation of the natural world when physical evidence is available. 2) Would a Creationist be at a disadvantage? Again, it depends on what is intended by the word ""Creationist."" Assuming that Archangel means someone who believes Earth is several thousand years ago, rejects common descent via biological evolution and expects the physical world to be consistent with a literal interpretation of Genesis? Yes, absolutely, but it would not be ""because he believes in God and has a personal relationship with him."" It would be because he rejects the extremely well-substantiated theoretical framework upon which ""Oil Exploration"" is based. The value of scientific theories is that they allow one to make predictions; in this case the appropriate prediction, presumably, would be where to find oil. And, I guarantee that the petroleum geologists at Shell, Exxon, do not invoke ""young-Earth creationism"" in their pursuit of hydrocarbons: it provides ZERO predictive power, whereas plate tectonics (over billions of years), and an understanding of biological evolution and radiometric dating has been extremely effective at helping geologists find LOTS of oil.","yec-oil-fields","11:59 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","21"

Of course you must once again corrupt and pervert what I said by redacting just enough to attempt to change the meaning in what I said like the completely dishonest putz that you are.

But that is your MO schmuck, and you are consistent in your dishonesty which is why I kick myself for getting involved with attempting to reason with you, once again.","obvious_child","352069","Which essentially proves my point. You lump Creationist and Christian together when others have specifically separated them. No one said anything about YEC = Christanity which you have essentially done here. Thanks for showing you never learn. If you think you're fooling anyone, you're quite delusional. I see you still outright refuse to deal with YEC's problem on how oil was made and how oil is actually searched for. I like how you cited a firm that is looking for deposits underwater when you accept a belief that argues that the firm is wasting its time since there can't be any deposits underwater according to the Flood. You claim YEC isn't a problem, but you adamantly refuse to even acknowledge how it contridicts how gas and oil companies have been doing it for years. Willful delusions, but what can I expect from someone who rejects the foundation of nuclear power but calls for more of it?

I am a creationist in that I take the creation story literally and in no way hold to the fairy tale of evolution in any way, shape or form. I also am not a geologist with a specialty in finding oil deposits, but as a layman I can tell you that if I was educated in the science of recognizing the physical signs for oil and gas deposits, My young earth creationism would NOT infringe on my studies at all since it is the verifiable science which would aid me in doing the job. Not the theoretical principles of origin upon which it is based. The fact is that you would be hard pressed in this diverse and free society to find any science which is completely free of bible believing christians who have no problem at all ignoring the secular humanist fluff which attempts to explain how things came into being while focussing on the science of how things actually work in reality. Let me give you further evidence of why the premise of this thread is not only dishonest, but juvenile and insane. The obvious child said this in the OP: Last I checked, no credible fossil fuel firm hired YEC geologists. But I could be wrong. Anyone know of oil or gas firms around the world that actually use YEC and YEC geologists in their exploration for new fields? If this is true, I would like him to prove his statement isn't a blatant lie by providing the sources he researched in order to come to this conclusion that no credible fossil fuel firm hired YEC geologists. And then he goes on to ask an unprovable question which just confirms that this is a baiting thread which has no more validity to it than his ability to dream up ridiculous assumptions which are born in his warped and disturbed imagination. One further question I would aske those who do believe in evolution is, if you are such an intelligent and insightful lot then why don't any of you, and I mean ANY OF YOU AT ALL ever have the intellectual honesty or fortitude to challenge him or others who create these strawman and fallacious threads? I mean, after all, this obvious child is the guy who said this in another baiting thread he started, and I quote him precisely: If god made human from dirt, how come there are still dirt around? Is this really the depth of thinking you believe deserves to go unchallenged?","yec-oil-fields","06:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","24"

And, as for your example, you still don't understand that your very creationist beliefs mean that you would have to discount the vast majority of the knowledge you would need to succesfully do your job. And no, I'm not going to explain what, why, or how.

Gas and oil exploration is not based on a global flood principle. As I've stated several times and as you deliberately wish to ignore , YEC dictates that gas and oil deposits should be uniformly deposited on land masses as YEC argues that it was the weight of the water that did the necessary compression to turn organic material into hydrocarbons, not as evolution and actual science argue, the decay of largely algae (Diatoms) in specific geological locations dependent upon specific geological circumstances. How you can think that you can accept YEC and still practice good, useful and practical geology at the same time without abandoning either is insane and completely devoid of any facts whatsoever. You accept a belief which completely rejects modern geology. This is again, as stated nowhere even close to how actual hydrocarbon exploration is done. Obvious strawman there. Again, further proof that you dishonestly tie YEC to mean Christanity. You have constantly been shown to be a massive liar in this regard but don't seem to care that you are dishonestly arguing that Christanity and YEC are the same and that one cannot be a Christian if they do not accept your narrow view of YEC. No one except you argued that Christianity = YEC. If you think your little tantrum is going to excuse you from your failure to reconcile YEC with actual geology, you'd dead wrong. What do you mean?
