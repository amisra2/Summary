Compressed Diatoms are found in certain areas under certain types of geological conditions. This is inherently contradictory to YEC which believes that the flood created the hydrocarbon reserves. The problem with such reasoning is that a flood would do this evenly and uniformly since it is the weight of the water that is doing the compression. A YEC model would expect oil and gas to be found everywhere as that is how they are formed under the global flood model. Hence why it is relevant. You are just too stupid to understand how your belief cannot be molded with reality. See above.

But again, that requires a YEC to contradict their belief in the flood. As earlier stated, previous YECs have gone into the field, looked at the data and evidence and abandoned YEC as it makes absolutely no sense. YEC 'science' is not used in hydrocarbon production. Total and utter bull. If that was true, why does Chevron's oil exploring ship specifically hunt for areas believed to have large diatom populations in the past? While they are looking for specific physical signs, they also start to look in specific areas based on the back story. Your argument essentially says that they randomly look for physical signs rather than start with areas believed to have high concentrations of organisms that turned into oil.

However, if that's all that you understand, or if you're trying to apply some YEC depositional theory completely incompatible with reality, your chances of being a successful exploration and development geologist are somewhere in the very low single digit percentages. Understanding depositional models, paleoenvironments, regional basinal depositional histories, oil source rocks, oil generation and migration, trapping mechanisms, diagenesis, timing of deposition and deformation, and on and on are critical to being a successful geologist, and would be VERY difficult to reconcile with hard line YEC beliefs.

"04-30-2009","12630",2,"None","None","None","obvious_child","351876","But the problem with your first statement Waxy is that YEC believes that oil and gas deposits were created by the flood, that the weight of the water was the primary force of compression. That would essentially be uniform globally on land masses thus a YEC view on oil and gas exploration should expect that deposits are almost uniformly found everywhere on land because the compression force of flood waters is equal. Even more strange, since it was the water of the flood compression was primarily on land, there should not be deposits underwater. Reading seismic logs and other data that is specific to locations and specific geological areas to determine where to drill contridicts YEC as we should be able to find oil and gas everywhere on land according to that belief. Understanding basic gas and oil geology refutes one of the biggest beliefs in YEC. YEC argues that gas and oil deposits should be found uniformly across the globe's land masses. This obviously is not true.","yec-oil-fields","07:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","16"

No one said that YEC = Christianity other then you. In fact, this entire forum is full of posts detailing how YEC is merely one belief within the greater religion, one not held by many Christians. You, on the other hand, have been shown to constantly tie and lie YEC to equate to Christanity despite that being obviously full of #### and complete untrue. Furthermore, you have again dishonestly tried to argue that non-acceptance of YEC = atheism. Neither of course are valid, but at this point, you have no honest discussion tools and thus are forced to rely on obvious lies. We are talking specifically about YEC. Not Christanity. Learn to seperate the two for a change. Christanity =/= YEC. Evolution =/= Atheism. Given that your entire post is based on a lie, there's not much to say besides to respond to your link. First, there's no mention of the name of the field. Second, I found something regarding their drilling. This is quite interesting in the context of YEC. ""Zions Chief Executive Officer, Richard Rinberg, said today, It has been a long and difficult journey, but we have overcome the many challenges and, in a few days, the drilling rig should begin the drilling of Zions second well, on our Joseph License, to the Triassic Formation (down to a depth of 15,400 feet) and then, we plan, to the Permian Formation (down to a depth below 18,000 feet). "" Zion Oil Updates Drilling Schedule; 2,000 Horsepower Drilling Rig Arrives in Israel So much for ""YEC"" in oil production.

That does not mean that an individual Young-Earth Creationist would be unable to perform a specific duty within that company. Certainly no oil company would inquire about a candidate's religious beliefs.

"05-02-2009","12630",5,"obvious_child","352187","How you figure that? The OP and everyone else is discussing YEC. Waxy specifically was discussing YEC. No one was talking about Christanity as a whole. Then Arch comes and notice it is HIM who takes the whole discussion as an attack on Christanity rather than YEC. It was HIS post that specifically said Christanity rather than YEC like the rest of us. Notice the first use of the word ""Christian"" It is in post #8. Arch's post. This is the exact quote: ""But hey it's child and he needs to post any fallacious attack on christians he can dream up."" Never mind how everything up to that point was specifically about YEC. Outside of quotations of Arch's post, the next time we see the equating is in post #17: ""One is an atheist and the other is a christian/creationist."" Again, another Arch post. The even more obvious thing is that arch tries to make this into an atheist vs Christian argument rather than science vs YEC. The sheer amount of tying is insane. Post #27 has Arch linking to a Christian geologist website despite no one except him talking about the religion as a whole. Remember that the title of the thread is ""YEC in oil fields"" NOT ""Christanity in oil fields."" need I go on or will you accept that Arch argues YEC = Christanity? He's not equating the two by using the terms interchangeably? So a part that is interchangeable with another in similar machine is not the same part? So a standard spark plug used in every Toyota car is not the same since they are interchangeable? That doesn't make much sense. If any. Where did you go to school? And was your English teacher fired after you left? Actually, if you bothered to read the thread, everyone except Arch is talking about YEC and geology. Arch has attempted to turn this into Christanity vs detractors despite no one attacking Christanity.","Roesgen08","352238","Already explained that to you yesterday. Again, from Archangel: ""An acceptance of YEC IS NOT A SALVATION ISSUE WHICH DETERMINES IF ONE ACTUALLY KNOWS THE LORD JESUS CHRIST ON A PERSONAL BASIS IN ANY WAY. SO I HAVE NEVER SAID EVEN ONCE ON THIS OR ANY FORUM, NOR HAVE I SAID TO ANY PERSON EVER THAT UNLESS YOU ACCEPT YEC, THEN YOU CAN'T BE SAVED."" Source It could be possible that Archangel thinks that you really are anti-Christian. One could express being anti-Christian by attacking the most salient part of the group of Christians (i.e. the Creationists). One doesn't have to equate Christianity with YEC to perceive an attack on YEC to be the primary means of waging a broader offensive on Christianity as a whole. I think that this quote works against you a bit. If Archangel really did believe what you say, that Christianity and YEC are the same thing, then why mention both? Wouldn't that be like saying a US American? If Christianity and YEC are the same, maybe he would just use one term instead of both. Well, let's pull out an essay from the website that was referenced and pull out a passage: Age of the earth. Agreement: Young-earthers, by definition, and scientific creationists both agree that the earth is about 10,000 to perhaps 20,000 years old. Conflict: Most conventional geologists would accept the 4.5 billion year old age given by several independent lines of evidence. Comment: Unfortunately, here is where many scientific creationists err. The Bible clearly states the age of the earth in the beginning (Genesis1:1). Why is a young earth necessary? From my own correspondence, scientific creationists and young-earthers ""want"" a young earth so that evolution will not have time to operate. Does the scientific evidence support a young earth? NO! (But remember, in science one is never 100% certain. There is always the possibility of error.) But is this a problem? Have any of you, ever, found evidence from your geological investigations to discredit the claims in the Bible or deny Jesus? I havent. I fully believe that God has given us talents to use to investigate his creation. Should we fear the results? I have struggled many, many years with the creation/evolution debate. The questions raised above represent only a small number of the ideas, thoughts, and queries I have had. While writing this I happened across a Bible verse that put the debate in perspective: For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered or come into mind. (Isaiah 65:17) Until this time, I welcome your comments and thoughts. While the author is not saying he is 100% sure that creationism is true, it's clear that he clearly leans towards creationism. Therefore, Archangel's listing of the website as a site of people who believe in YEC is fair enough, given that part of the selected reading is very favorable to creationism. What you really need to prove your argument about Arch is a slam dunk. Something along the lines of this: People who do not believe in creationists are not real Christians. That's would be a slam dunk for you, if you could ever show that Arch said anything like that. Already addressed this in response to your quote on post #8. A better school than yours. You obviously took the little bus to school. I bothered to read the thread, you bothered to see only what you wanted to see. Although the evidence does not prove such a conclusion, I could accept Arch being wrong. The dishonesty you show means that you cannot accept the possibility that you are wrong.","yec-oil-fields","09:42 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","63"

Including other Christians. Seriously? If I was anti-Christian, I'd be making the bull**** threads like those in the gay and religion forum. Don't know. But he doesn't do it for the rest. The rest he removes creationist or YEC and instead replaces it solely with Christianity. What form of Creationism? He clearly rejects YEC. But that does not mean he rejects a Deist view of origin. But that is not what we are talking about. Except that it's not YEC and we have long been discussing just YEC. Grasping for straws you are. You are dishonestly arguing that all forms of Creationism are the same where this discussion was always focused on JUST YEC. Maybe to you. The rest of us all accept that Arch believes YEC = Christanity. Cite. hardly.

It's not a question of what he ""did""; it's a question of your interpretation of what he did and the possibilities that you rule out without even considering them. Oh, more accurately? Then it should be very easy to prove that Arch doesn't simultaneously think: YEC is not equal to Christianity AND You are anti-Christian I don't know if you are or you aren't, but given that you've just implied that there are anti-Christians, is it not reasonable to conclude that someone could believe you to be an anti-Christian rightly or wrongly? Which again can be explained by him possibly perceiving you as a Christian basher. He says: ""Have any of you, ever, found evidence from your geological investigations to discredit the claims in the Bible or deny Jesus? I havent."" Before this he says: ""Does the scientific evidence support a young earth? NO!"" The Bible (read literally) supports a young earth. He says there is no scientific evidence to discredit this. So he's not just a deist, but more of the God made the universe like it says in the Bible kind of creationist. What's dishonest is your claiming that the source is not YEC without providing proof, as well as your dishonesty in not recognizing that the author's very low relative value on science makes him closer to YEC than deism. Lastly, it's dishonest of you to say that I am grasping at straws, when it's your straws. You're the one who chose to pick Arch's source as evidence of her supposed YEC = Christianity views. You provide no quotes from the source, but instead find yourself on the defensive and that's me ""grasping at straws""? Clearly delusional on your part. Again, given that two people who believe in evolution have commented on the dishonesty of your YEC = Christianity thread, and the thread was shat upon by a third person as well, your claim to be a spokesman of some sort is compromised. If you cannot remember comments I made in posts that are less than an hour old, then that is your problem. Find it yourself. Believe that you have some intelligence if you wish, I know better than to try to get you to see reason. Again, you fail on two fronts here: you fail to distinguish between your subjective OPINION that someone uses a word interchangeably and the objective facts of how someone used the word. Secondly, your opinion is compromised by the fact that you have not provided any reason to reject alternative hypotheses to your opinion.

They also argue that oil and gas are found largely in sedimentary rock. The thing is that such rock covers roughly 75% of the land and most of the ocean floor. Therefore, we should be finding oil pretty much everywhere according to flood geology models. Interestingly enough, Flood geology rejects plate tetonics as well as rejecting oil formation in ocean water. It's internally a bunch of contradictions. Oil can't form in ocean water, but the sea floor made of rocks where oil is expected to be is has oil. Wait what? I can go on and on. But you get the point.

So basically you don't address what I say and accuse me of doing what you just did. It does appear more and more that your comments are dishonest. You showed no mountains. You showed several quotes that you interpreted in the worst possible way, without providing any reason to reject alternative ways of interpreting those quotes. You continue to make lame insults, instead of good arguments. Again, it is amazing that you cite an example of your failure to understand a reading passage as an example of me not understanding something. The stupidity in your posts is quite amazing. The author saying ""no"" to science proves that he leans towards creationism! He said science is not 100% accurate in the sentences that followed.

The Bible says the world was created in 6 days and so was man. That means that the world was created basically at the same time as the advent of man. That means that dinosaurs roamed the earth at the same time as man. Thus the dinosaur fossil record (geology) directly contradicts Genesis. Feel free to ask them if they see that contradiction. You ignore what comes after that quote: ""(But remember, in science one is never 100% certain. There is always the possibility of error.)"" I agree.

It is all based on an interpretation of the evidence which seeks any explanation which subtracts the Genesis account from the equation. You refuse to accept that creationists accept the same end results while having an independent interpretation of how it came to be. The majority of hydrocarbons found naturally occur in crude oil, where decomposed organic matter provides an abundance of carbon and hydrogen which, when bonded, can catenate to form seemingly limitless chains.[1][2]..... Liquid geologically-extracted hydrocarbons are referred to as petroleum (literally ""rock oil"") or mineral oil, while gaseous geologic hydrocarbons are referred to as natural gas. All are significant sources of fuel and raw materials as a feedstock for the production of organic chemicals and are commonly found in the Earth's subsurface using the tools of petroleum geology. Show me where the first link says that YECs say oil should be found everywhere? You post links and make blanket statements rather than just quote where that link specifically says what you claim it says. Really??? Show where where the link you posted says this is the only interpretation of the existing evidence to the exclusion of all other formations. It does? Yet you don't actually quote where it says this directly at all, do you!!! If a ""high sedimentation rate"" will preserve organic material, a catastrophic sedimentation rate, such as we envision for the worldwide Flood, would uproot, kill, and bury organic material so rapidly as to cut the porphyrins off from oxidizing agents which would destroy them in the ocean water. Yeah, I enjoy the taste of your failure to actually support or prove that any of the false claims and misrepresentations you make are true at all. You make claims about what YECs believe while proving nothing at all.

Hydrocarbon - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Once again, Arch has absolutely no clue about what he talks about. Diatoms were algae that decayed and were compressed into crude oil. Seriously, that's like 5th grade biology. I'm still not sure whether you are too ignorant or too uneducated you actually understand these subjects. Let's do this real simple. The link I posted from the Institute of Creation science states that oil should be found in sedimentary rock. That rock covers 75% of the land mass of Earth and most of the ocean floor. Therefore, by simple math, the flood model argues that we should find oil frankly everywhere that sedimentary rock is found. It is not my fault you cannot understand the written word. Do you have any others? I didn't think so. It could help if you could read: Explain to me how oil deposits can be found under the sea bed when the precursors to crude oil are destroyed by ocean water.

There is also Kurt Wise, BA in geology from the University of Chicago (funny, I thought that geology was a science), an MA in geology from Harvard, and a PhD in paleontology, also from Harvard. His Harvard dissertation advisor was Stephen Jay Gould. Wise made no secret of his creationist beliefs and yet he was able to avoid expression of his beliefs in his academic work, his thesis and his dissertation. In other words, while believing in a universe that is only 6000 years old, Wise managed to discuss evidence that is millions of years old. I think that it is quite difficult to earn a degree in science and be a creationist.

Thus, the 3 miles of sediment would have been deposited essentially all at once. I gotta wonder, where did 3 miles of sediment enough to cover every location on the planet come from? The surface of the planet is 510,072,000 km and after translating into miles and then multiplying by 3 miles, we get 950,832,139 cubic miles of necessary sediment (compacted).

Here's an example from a very highly respected scientific institution. Has Modern Evolutionary ""Science"" Become Unscientific? Dr. Nathaniel Abraham, Ph.D., is a biologist, scholar, and research scientist specializing in zebrafish, developmental biology, and programmed cell death. He was fired from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, a highly esteemed research facility based in New England in March of 2004. The reason? Dr. Abraham believes in Creation and does not accept evolution as a scientific fact. With his termination, Dr. Abraham became one of many scientists and academics who have dedicated years of their lives to the pursuit of scientific knowledge; but because they are unwilling to spout the ""party line"" with respect to evolution, they are being forced out of their field. Read how CLA is defending the rights of this Christian scientist to practice his profession consistent with his faith. Dr. Abraham came to the United States from India to earn his Ph.D. in biology at St. John's University in New York. While at St. John's, he became an expert in zebrafish. He did a groundbreaking doctoral dissertation in his area of research science. Dr. Abraham was well respected at St. John's, and it was no secret that he was a strong Christian who believed the Bible and believed in Creation. Many of his colleagues there enjoyed asking him questions about issues of science and religion. In the first sentence of the acknowledgements in his doctoral thesis, Dr. Abraham thanks his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Fired for His Faith While Dr. Abraham was completing his Ph.D. program at St. John's, he began to look for a postdoctoral position where he could continue his research. He married, brought his wife to America, and they were expecting their first child. Life was looking very good. He applied for a research position at Woods Hole after seeing the opportunity listed on the Internet. Scientists at Woods Hole were interested in expanding their toxicology laboratory to include programmed cell death research using the zebrafish benchmark model, which was Dr. Abraham's specialty. In fact, Dr. Abraham was so valuable to them in this endeavor that he assisted them for several months in designing and building their lab before he was able to join them fulltime as a researcher. Dr. Abraham contributed greatly to the design of the new facility and his superiors were pleased with his work. The relationship between Dr. Abraham and Woods Hole was mutually beneficial and productive until one lunchtime shortly after Dr. Abraham began working fulltime at Woods Hole. In a passing conversation with his supervisor, Dr. Abraham happened to mention that he believed in Creation. His supervisor expressed concern that if Dr. Abraham believed in Creation, he was not qualified to do the job he had been hired to do. Dr. Abraham told his superiors in writing that he was willing to analyze his research using evolutionary concepts if that was warranted, but he was not willing to personally renounce his belief in Creation or accept evolution as a scientific fact. Dr. Abraham pointed out that his belief in Creation was irrelevant to the research he was doing. After all, he had developed his research specialty and expertise at St. John's University, where his faith had not been an issue. Dr. Abraham believed a scientist should merely do the experiments and follow the evidence wherever it led. The ""establishment"" scientists at Woods Hole were not convinced. They wanted Dr. Abraham to share their wholehearted acceptance of evolution as a scientific fact, or they felt he was not ""fit"" to work in the field of science-at least not at their prestigious laboratory. They finally told Dr. Abraham he would have to leave if he did not accept evolution as fact. Dr. Abraham's decision to hold to his Biblical faith and to his belief in Creation was a very costly decision for him. His wife was about to have their baby. Without a job, Dr. Abraham would lose his visa, which would soon expire. Woods Hole was not willing to even permit Dr. Abraham to complete the first year of his potential three-year employment. As a result, Dr. Abraham was forced to send his expectant wife home to India, and he missed the birth of his first child. Attorneys for the Christian Law Association are now representing Dr. Abraham in a lawsuit against Woods Hole to test whether America's courts will permit this sort of blatant religious discrimination against scientists in America. Religious Discrimination in the Scientific Community Dr. Abraham's private Biblical faith did not affect his ability to do the job for which he had been hired, but his supervisors refused to tolerate his belief in Creation. This is a phenomenon that is becoming increasingly common in both the academic and scientific research communities. ""Establishment"" scientists have become increasingly willing to require that everyone who works in the field of science must accept the tenets of evolution as fact or be banned from the profession. Attorneys for the Christian Law Association believe that Title VII antidiscrimination laws protect scientists from being terminated because of their religious beliefs. In addition to limiting opportunities for Christian scientists and researchers, highly qualified professors are also losing their jobs and being denied tenure at some American universities merely because they do not toe the line regarding evolution. What the scientific community seems to be saying to creationists or to those who hold to intelligent design, is that if you are not willing to accept an evolutionary philosophy, we will indeed shun you, terminate you, and push you out of the field of science. Does that mean that in the future scientists will be forced to deny their belief in God or their belief that an intelligent designer played a part in the origins of the universe or of life on earth in order to work? Just where would such a repressive attitude lead? Interestingly, just as some secular university science departments and research laboratories are forbidding anyone to defy the new scientific principle recognizing ""evolution's role as the central organizing principle of modern biology"" (a quote from the press release for a new book called Science, Evolution and Creationism, published by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences along with the Institute of Medicine, both advisory bodies to the U.S. government in the area of science and medicine), more and more scientists are coming to the conclusion that there is increasing scientific evidence for intelligent design in the universe. The Discovery Institute in Seattle, Washington, has compiled a list of over 700 scientists who have signed the following statement. We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged. CLA believes it is very important at this point in history to defend Dr. Abraham's right to work as a scientific researcher no matter what his personal religious beliefs. We agree with Dr. Abraham that scientists should follow the evidence wherever it leads. Establishment scientists should not be allowed to put a thumb on the scale of evolutionary research outcomes. Dr. Abraham's lawsuit against Woods Hole represents more than one person's termination for refusing to abandon his religious beliefs. If those in the scientific establishment in America's laboratories and universities are permitted to fire anyone who does not accept evolution as ""the central organizing principle of modern biology,"" America will be on a slippery slope toward renouncing the traditional rules of scientific inquiry, which are based upon experimentation and observation that is always open to testing by competing theories. What is True Science? True science is founded on the proposition that everything we think we know about the natural world can, in principle, be rejected if it does not meet the test of observation and experiment. The very practice of science, at its core, is a constant exercise of extending what we do know about the world, and then correcting what we thought we knew for sure. The Academic Press Dictionary defines science as ""the systematic observation of natural events and conditions in order to discover facts about them and to formulate laws and principles based on these facts."" We should remember that it was their observation of order in the universe that led the scientists of the Middle Ages to begin their quest to discern that order. Many of these early scientists were Christians who believed that the Creator God had made an orderly universe and that His order could be discerned by using scientific methods of experimentation and observation. The consideration of alternative explanations for scientific claims is vital to the development of a scientific mind. There are actually four terms used in science to address the results of experimentation and observation. They are hypothesis, theory, fact (near-certainty), and law. A scientific hypothesis is a testable scientific idea that can be proved right or wrong with experiments. It is an educated guess that can be verified or disproven by observation or experimentation. A scientific theory is defined as the culmination of many scientific investigations drawing together all the current evidence; thus, it represents the most powerful explanations scientists have to offer. The closest we can get to absolute truth in science are indisputable observations which we call facts or near-certainty. Finally, a scientific law generalizes a body of observations to which no exceptions have been found. It appears that modern establishment scientists, such as those at the Woods Hole research laboratory, no longer think of evolution as merely a ""hypothesis"" or even a ""theory."" Instead, evolution has now become more like a ""law."" In fact, the scientific establishment is now claiming that evolution is ""the central organizing principle of modern biology,"" a conclusion from which no working scientist or academic can apparently deviate. How did this happen? Did someone find the ""missing link"" that scientists have searched for to prove that men were formerly monkeys and we somehow missed it? If some scientist has conclusively demonstrated in a laboratory that evolution produced life on earth, we must have missed that too. Did some recent experiment contradict the work of Louis Pasteur who conclusively demonstrated in the mid-19th century that life cannot spring spontaneously from non-life? Pasteur's work in developing pasteurization through that experiment still appears to be valid in our milk cartons, and no verified ape/man is as yet on display in the Smithsonian Institute. Instead, evolutionary scientists appear to have taken a ""leap of faith"" and declared without evidence or proof that evolution is a verified ""fact"" or ""law,"" no matter how it is defined. The unsupported conclusory statement being touted not only by establishment scientists, but also by many high school and university teachers that ""evolution is the fundamental concept underlying all of biology and is supported by multiple forms of scientific evidence"" throws an incendiary bomb directly into the heart of the traditional scientific method. The Evolution of Evolution In reality, the word evolution is a very slippery term. When simply defined as ""change over time"" within species it is relatively non-controversial. Fruit flies, moths, and Galapagos finches all provide examples of change over time. However, when modern scientists tout evolution as a near fact or law and then extrapolate from this meaning that it is also a fact that flies, moths, and finches all evolved from a remote common ancestor, the word becomes extremely problematic. When modern scientists or educators propound the philosophical notion that ""evolution is the fundamental concept underlying all of biology,"" they are not confirming some grand new scientific development in our understanding the concept of evolution. What we have instead is merely evidence that the term evolution itself has now evolved. This gigantic leap in the evolution of evolution provides research facilities like Woods Hole with a rationale to fire a world renowned scientist like Dr. Abraham merely because he has a different belief-one based on the Bible and not on evolutionary philosophy. What is at Stake? When establishment scientists declare evolution as the winner in the contest of determining the origins of the universe and of life, their conclusion has nothing at all to do with traditional science. Darwin merely provided a rationale for science to reject religion and God. Ponder carefully that if evolution is allowed to become the ""the fundamental concept underlying all of biology"" by which all of life must be interpreted and understood, many more eminent and qualified scientists like Dr. Abraham will lose their jobs. In fact, we could reach a point in America where believing in God automatically disqualifies a person from working in the field of science, despite the fact that the whole field of modern science developed because early scientists believed God had created a rational and orderly universe with controlling principles that could be known.

Creationist's lawsuit against Woods Hole dismissed | NCSE Slackjawed creationist surprised at his own incompetence at a scientific job - The Panda's Thumb","Archangel","353280","The status or outcome of the lawsuit wasn't the issue schmuck, the injustice of a qualified scientist being deemed unqualified because he doesn't accept evolution as a scientifically proven fact is. And it wasn't dismissed because it had no merit, he missed the window available to sue. From your first link: The lawsuit was dismissed, the Boston Globe (April 29, 2008) reported, when ""US District Court Judge William G. Young agreed with the institution's lawyer that the researcher did not file his lawsuit within the time frame required by law."" As for your second link, it is just a blatant lie which fits with the dishonesty of the community you support. It says this: The commission [the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination] dismissed his complaint earlier this year. The commission said Abraham was terminated because his request not to work on evolutionary aspects of the project would be challenging for Woods Hole because the research was based on evolutionary theories. Here is what my article says about that: Dr. Abraham told his superiors in writing that he was willing to analyze his research using evolutionary concepts if that was warranted, but he was not willing to personally renounce his belief in Creation or accept evolution as a scientific fact. Dr. Abraham pointed out that his belief in Creation was irrelevant to the research he was doing. After all, he had developed his research specialty and expertise at St. John's University, where his faith had not been an issue. Dr. Abraham believed a scientist should merely do the experiments and follow the evidence wherever it led. The ""establishment"" scientists at Woods Hole were not convinced. They wanted Dr. Abraham to share their wholehearted acceptance of evolution as a scientific fact, or they felt he was not ""fit"" to work in the field of science-at least not at their prestigious laboratory. They finally told Dr. Abraham he would have to leave if he did not accept evolution as fact. As usual little child focuses on the irrelevant minutia rather than the focus of the article which is the requirement to accept evolution as fact even if it doesn't interfere with ones work. Try reading it again for comprehension. The repeated insistence that committed christians can't serve as scientists because of creationist convictions is wrong and only a problem for the sanctimonious evolution scientists who demand that all of their scientists accept and toe the party line or else they wont hire them. Here's an example from a very highly respected scientific institution. Has Modern Evolutionary ""Science"" Become Unscientific? Dr. Nathaniel Abraham, Ph.D., is a biologist, scholar, and research scientist specializing in zebrafish, developmental biology, and programmed cell death. He was fired from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, a highly esteemed research facility based in New England in March of 2004. The reason? Dr. Abraham believes in Creation and does not accept evolution as a scientific fact. With his termination, Dr. Abraham became one of many scientists and academics who have dedicated years of their lives to the pursuit of scientific knowledge; but because they are unwilling to spout the ""party line"" with respect to evolution, they are being forced out of their field. Read how CLA is defending the rights of this Christian scientist to practice his profession consistent with his faith. Dr. Abraham came to the United States from India to earn his Ph.D. in biology at St. John's University in New York. While at St. John's, he became an expert in zebrafish. He did a groundbreaking doctoral dissertation in his area of research science. Dr. Abraham was well respected at St. John's, and it was no secret that he was a strong Christian who believed the Bible and believed in Creation. Many of his colleagues there enjoyed asking him questions about issues of science and religion. In the first sentence of the acknowledgements in his doctoral thesis, Dr. Abraham thanks his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Fired for His Faith While Dr. Abraham was completing his Ph.D. program at St. John's, he began to look for a postdoctoral position where he could continue his research. He married, brought his wife to America, and they were expecting their first child. Life was looking very good. He applied for a research position at Woods Hole after seeing the opportunity listed on the Internet. Scientists at Woods Hole were interested in expanding their toxicology laboratory to include programmed cell death research using the zebrafish benchmark model, which was Dr. Abraham's specialty. In fact, Dr. Abraham was so valuable to them in this endeavor that he assisted them for several months in designing and building their lab before he was able to join them fulltime as a researcher. Dr. Abraham contributed greatly to the design of the new facility and his superiors were pleased with his work. The relationship between Dr. Abraham and Woods Hole was mutually beneficial and productive until one lunchtime shortly after Dr. Abraham began working fulltime at Woods Hole. In a passing conversation with his supervisor, Dr. Abraham happened to mention that he believed in Creation. His supervisor expressed concern that if Dr. Abraham believed in Creation, he was not qualified to do the job he had been hired to do. Dr. Abraham told his superiors in writing that he was willing to analyze his research using evolutionary concepts if that was warranted, but he was not willing to personally renounce his belief in Creation or accept evolution as a scientific fact. Dr. Abraham pointed out that his belief in Creation was irrelevant to the research he was doing. After all, he had developed his research specialty and expertise at St. John's University, where his faith had not been an issue. Dr. Abraham believed a scientist should merely do the experiments and follow the evidence wherever it led. The ""establishment"" scientists at Woods Hole were not convinced. They wanted Dr. Abraham to share their wholehearted acceptance of evolution as a scientific fact, or they felt he was not ""fit"" to work in the field of science-at least not at their prestigious laboratory. They finally told Dr. Abraham he would have to leave if he did not accept evolution as fact. Dr. Abraham's decision to hold to his Biblical faith and to his belief in Creation was a very costly decision for him. His wife was about to have their baby. Without a job, Dr. Abraham would lose his visa, which would soon expire. Woods Hole was not willing to even permit Dr. Abraham to complete the first year of his potential three-year employment. As a result, Dr. Abraham was forced to send his expectant wife home to India, and he missed the birth of his first child. Attorneys for the Christian Law Association are now representing Dr. Abraham in a lawsuit against Woods Hole to test whether America's courts will permit this sort of blatant religious discrimination against scientists in America. Religious Discrimination in the Scientific Community Dr. Abraham's private Biblical faith did not affect his ability to do the job for which he had been hired, but his supervisors refused to tolerate his belief in Creation. This is a phenomenon that is becoming increasingly common in both the academic and scientific research communities. ""Establishment"" scientists have become increasingly willing to require that everyone who works in the field of science must accept the tenets of evolution as fact or be banned from the profession. Attorneys for the Christian Law Association believe that Title VII antidiscrimination laws protect scientists from being terminated because of their religious beliefs. In addition to limiting opportunities for Christian scientists and researchers, highly qualified professors are also losing their jobs and being denied tenure at some American universities merely because they do not toe the line regarding evolution. What the scientific community seems to be saying to creationists or to those who hold to intelligent design, is that if you are not willing to accept an evolutionary philosophy, we will indeed shun you, terminate you, and push you out of the field of science. Does that mean that in the future scientists will be forced to deny their belief in God or their belief that an intelligent designer played a part in the origins of the universe or of life on earth in order to work? Just where would such a repressive attitude lead? Interestingly, just as some secular university science departments and research laboratories are forbidding anyone to defy the new scientific principle recognizing ""evolution's role as the central organizing principle of modern biology"" (a quote from the press release for a new book called Science, Evolution and Creationism, published by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences along with the Institute of Medicine, both advisory bodies to the U.S. government in the area of science and medicine), more and more scientists are coming to the conclusion that there is increasing scientific evidence for intelligent design in the universe. The Discovery Institute in Seattle, Washington, has compiled a list of over 700 scientists who have signed the following statement. We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged. CLA believes it is very important at this point in history to defend Dr. Abraham's right to work as a scientific researcher no matter what his personal religious beliefs. We agree with Dr. Abraham that scientists should follow the evidence wherever it leads. Establishment scientists should not be allowed to put a thumb on the scale of evolutionary research outcomes. Dr. Abraham's lawsuit against Woods Hole represents more than one person's termination for refusing to abandon his religious beliefs. If those in the scientific establishment in America's laboratories and universities are permitted to fire anyone who does not accept evolution as ""the central organizing principle of modern biology,"" America will be on a slippery slope toward renouncing the traditional rules of scientific inquiry, which are based upon experimentation and observation that is always open to testing by competing theories. What is True Science? True science is founded on the proposition that everything we think we know about the natural world can, in principle, be rejected if it does not meet the test of observation and experiment. The very practice of science, at its core, is a constant exercise of extending what we do know about the world, and then correcting what we thought we knew for sure. The Academic Press Dictionary defines science as ""the systematic observation of natural events and conditions in order to discover facts about them and to formulate laws and principles based on these facts."" We should remember that it was their observation of order in the universe that led the scientists of the Middle Ages to begin their quest to discern that order. Many of these early scientists were Christians who believed that the Creator God had made an orderly universe and that His order could be discerned by using scientific methods of experimentation and observation. The consideration of alternative explanations for scientific claims is vital to the development of a scientific mind. There are actually four terms used in science to address the results of experimentation and observation. They are hypothesis, theory, fact (near-certainty), and law. A scientific hypothesis is a testable scientific idea that can be proved right or wrong with experiments. It is an educated guess that can be verified or disproven by observation or experimentation. A scientific theory is defined as the culmination of many scientific investigations drawing together all the current evidence; thus, it represents the most powerful explanations scientists have to offer. The closest we can get to absolute truth in science are indisputable observations which we call facts or near-certainty. Finally, a scientific law generalizes a body of observations to which no exceptions have been found. It appears that modern establishment scientists, such as those at the Woods Hole research laboratory, no longer think of evolution as merely a ""hypothesis"" or even a ""theory."" Instead, evolution has now become more like a ""law."" In fact, the scientific establishment is now claiming that evolution is ""the central organizing principle of modern biology,"" a conclusion from which no working scientist or academic can apparently deviate. How did this happen? Did someone find the ""missing link"" that scientists have searched for to prove that men were formerly monkeys and we somehow missed it? If some scientist has conclusively demonstrated in a laboratory that evolution produced life on earth, we must have missed that too. Did some recent experiment contradict the work of Louis Pasteur who conclusively demonstrated in the mid-19th century that life cannot spring spontaneously from non-life? Pasteur's work in developing pasteurization through that experiment still appears to be valid in our milk cartons, and no verified ape/man is as yet on display in the Smithsonian Institute. Instead, evolutionary scientists appear to have taken a ""leap of faith"" and declared without evidence or proof that evolution is a verified ""fact"" or ""law,"" no matter how it is defined. The unsupported conclusory statement being touted not only by establishment scientists, but also by many high school and university teachers that ""evolution is the fundamental concept underlying all of biology and is supported by multiple forms of scientific evidence"" throws an incendiary bomb directly into the heart of the traditional scientific method. The Evolution of Evolution In reality, the word evolution is a very slippery term. When simply defined as ""change over time"" within species it is relatively non-controversial. Fruit flies, moths, and Galapagos finches all provide examples of change over time. However, when modern scientists tout evolution as a near fact or law and then extrapolate from this meaning that it is also a fact that flies, moths, and finches all evolved from a remote common ancestor, the word becomes extremely problematic. When modern scientists or educators propound the philosophical notion that ""evolution is the fundamental concept underlying all of biology,"" they are not confirming some grand new scientific development in our understanding the concept of evolution. What we have instead is merely evidence that the term evolution itself has now evolved. This gigantic leap in the evolution of evolution provides research facilities like Woods Hole with a rationale to fire a world renowned scientist like Dr. Abraham merely because he has a different belief-one based on the Bible and not on evolutionary philosophy. What is at Stake? When establishment scientists declare evolution as the winner in the contest of determining the origins of the universe and of life, their conclusion has nothing at all to do with traditional science. Darwin merely provided a rationale for science to reject religion and God. Ponder carefully that if evolution is allowed to become the ""the fundamental concept underlying all of biology"" by which all of life must be interpreted and understood, many more eminent and qualified scientists like Dr. Abraham will lose their jobs. In fact, we could reach a point in America where believing in God automatically disqualifies a person from working in the field of science, despite the fact that the whole field of modern science developed because early scientists believed God had created a rational and orderly universe with controlling principles that could be known.
