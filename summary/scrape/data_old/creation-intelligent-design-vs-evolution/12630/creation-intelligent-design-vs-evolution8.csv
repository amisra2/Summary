"05-03-2009","12630",8,"Roesgen08","352292","I didn't say you were confirming it. By your standard you just made an assumption of what I was talking about. You had to contradict yourself to argue that I contradicted myself. So that doesn't prove anything negative about me. So while you BITCH about this, you've only invented some inconsistency that you now say makes me inconsistent with what I've said. A troll thread can be defined as what you said ""filled with spam between O_C and Archangel due to Archie and O_C's ongoing feud with one another"", thus it was a troll thread. Therefore, my statement is true. You foolishly believe that your spin on a comment is the truth and thus falsely call yourself to have ""corrected"" what I have said. You've merely spun what you said and labeled it as a correction. You've done this deliberately, and thus you are telling the lie.","Archangel","352340","You know what's also funny RG? Remember when child accused me of calling you and others into this debate for support, which is patently ridiculous? That's because he did exactly that with G.O. who is now back pedaling on his original attack on this thread as the dishonest spam that it is. I would still like to the the sources little child checked as the premise for this thread since he made the claim in the OP. He said this: Last I checked, no credible fossil fuel firm hired YEC geologists. We all know it was a lie since he refuses to support it with any evidence at all. So my question is, why are we even responding to a thread which is based on lies?","yec-oil-fields","08:59 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","108"

Which sounds more plausible to an educated, reasoning person?","Archangel","352386","The great antiquity of the earth is what you think you see through evolutionary biology and geology. My source says the interpretations of the evidence which you rely on are wrong. And of course your sources say mine are wrong, and there in lies the rub. This is why we can all agree on the provable science of bio-chemical geology. But will never agree on how it came to be as it is. This is why this thread is based on a lie. YECs can and do accept what is current and observable geological evidence, but as for accepting your interpretations for how and when it got that way, that's another story.","yec-oil-fields","04:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","112"

To deny the Earth's antiquity is folly of the first order and de facto ascribing to the all-powerful deceiver scenario. Science says your interpretation of your source isn't factual. Biblical stories as metaphor is still one option open to you that you choose to reject.","yec-oil-fields","04:52 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","113"
"05-03-2009","12630",8,"T.Q","352313","Seeing as how my statement explicitly says the exact opposite in more than one manner, no. And again, no. Seeing as how you were just telling me that I said the exact opposite of what I explicitly, in no uncertain terms actually stated, I think your idea of who can and can't comprehend simple statements is suspect. No. Are you actually incapable of understanding the written word...the fact that you keep insisting that he is a creationist is not only dishonest, it shows your complete lack of functioning mental faculties!","Roesgen08","352396","That's not what your statement says. You state that ignorant people believe that science is 100% accurate, thus I said it is likely that you believe science is 100% accurate. Your merely saying no, shows that you cannot actually defend your opinion with reason or facts. Again, I explained your failure in understanding my reply and grasping simple statements. Obviously, you use insults since you lack the ability to understand the issues. I'll report your posts for you and maybe the admin can give you some help.","yec-oil-fields","05:44 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","114"

Or, that I've already done so and you have dismissed it out of hand. My mistake for not automatically assuming you were attempting to be insulting. Awfully nice of you, especially after calling me ignorant and accusing Giant Oreo of lying when he is correcting you on your interpretation of his very own words. What a peach you are!","yec-oil-fields","06:10 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","115"
"05-03-2009","12630",8,"Archangel","352336","No little child, the fact is that there is no irrefutable absolute evidence in your arsenal at all. It is all based on an interpretation of the evidence which seeks any explanation which subtracts the Genesis account from the equation. You refuse to accept that creationists accept the same end results while having an independent interpretation of how it came to be. The majority of hydrocarbons found naturally occur in crude oil, where decomposed organic matter provides an abundance of carbon and hydrogen which, when bonded, can catenate to form seemingly limitless chains.[1][2]..... Liquid geologically-extracted hydrocarbons are referred to as petroleum (literally ""rock oil"") or mineral oil, while gaseous geologic hydrocarbons are referred to as natural gas. All are significant sources of fuel and raw materials as a feedstock for the production of organic chemicals and are commonly found in the Earth's subsurface using the tools of petroleum geology. Show me where the first link says that YECs say oil should be found everywhere? You post links and make blanket statements rather than just quote where that link specifically says what you claim it says. Really??? Show where where the link you posted says this is the only interpretation of the existing evidence to the exclusion of all other formations. It does? Yet you don't actually quote where it says this directly at all, do you!!! If a ""high sedimentation rate"" will preserve organic material, a catastrophic sedimentation rate, such as we envision for the worldwide Flood, would uproot, kill, and bury organic material so rapidly as to cut the porphyrins off from oxidizing agents which would destroy them in the ocean water. Yeah, I enjoy the taste of your failure to actually support or prove that any of the false claims and misrepresentations you make are true at all. You make claims about what YECs believe while proving nothing at all. And the Creationist link you posted proves that you are nothing more than bluff and bluster just like your teacher daewoo who has been MIA since our last debate when he too was shown to be a liar.","obvious_child","352404","Because their interpretation does not result in the same end. You constantly refuse to admit this. More insults. No discussion of the actual science. Typical. [quote]And it isn't hydro carbons which they produce, but carbon which is converted into bio diesels or an oil based lubricant type material Here is what hydro-carbons are: Hydrocarbons And it aint oil. LOL. Oh this is hysterical. A hydrocarbon is a long chain of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Arch doesn't know what a hydrocarbon is. Hydrocarbon - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Once again, Arch has absolutely no clue about what he talks about. Diatoms were algae that decayed and were compressed into crude oil. Seriously, that's like 5th grade biology. I'm still not sure whether you are too ignorant or too uneducated you actually understand these subjects. Let's do this real simple. The link I posted from the Institute of Creation science states that oil should be found in sedimentary rock. That rock covers 75% of the land mass of Earth and most of the ocean floor. Therefore, by simple math, the flood model argues that we should find oil frankly everywhere that sedimentary rock is found. It is not my fault you cannot understand the written word. Do you have any others? I didn't think so. It could help if you could read: Explain to me how oil deposits can be found under the sea bed when the precursors to crude oil are destroyed by ocean water. I asked you this before and you ignored it. lol. I think it's funny how you make such accusations when you don't even understand what was written. Especially amusing since your own site you linked says oil is a hydrocarbon. Ah typical Arch. Post something you think is right without any understanding of it.","yec-oil-fields","06:36 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","116"

Hydrocarbons As for the rest of your tirade, you prove nothing while offering nothing more than your blustering that you are right. And btw, that was your creationist link I quoted, not mine. And anyone who reads it in context can see that it isn't supporting your claims. That's why I posted it. And I would still like to see the sources you allegedly checked as the premise for this thread since you made the claim in the OP. You said this: Last I checked, no credible fossil fuel firm hired YEC geologists. We all know it was a lie since you refuse to support it with any evidence at all.

Not even an apology accusing me of providing no evidence. And you again cited your link which states that Hydrocarbons are in fact chains of oxygen and carbon atoms as I so stated for what reason? I offer nothing to you? How about a citation from a Creationist website, which you have used in the past? Explain why if someone read what you posted how it would help you. Please, let's see if you even understand that article. I'm betting not. I do love how you refuse to address how the Creationist Flood Model argues for oil to be found in sedimentary rock but not in the ocean. Huh. How does that work? Hint: it doesn't. I'm a liar, but you can't refute anything I said. Go figure. Creationism, merit, evidence and fact free since the Epic Of Gilgamesh. And I love your quote on how you think oil isn't a hydrocarbon.
