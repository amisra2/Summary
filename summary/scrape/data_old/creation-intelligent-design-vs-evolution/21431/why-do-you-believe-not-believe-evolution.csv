Let me start by saying that I'm not a believer in evolution unless you mean the biological definition of evolution, namely, a change in the frequency of alleles from generation to generation. I don't have a problem with that idea, rather I have a problem with the idea that humans and chimps share a common ancestor, a claim which I consider unproved and indeed unprovable. I am of the opinion that atheists believe these things because they're atheists and evidence (or lack of same) has little to do with it. In this, I point to Dawkin's claim that evolution makes it possible to be an ""intellectually satisfied atheist"" in the sense that it provides some sort of an explanation for life as we know it as long as you don't delve too deeply into it and adopt the standard, ""There are problems with the theory, of course, but science is all about welcoming problems and doing further research with the faith that the answers will be discovered eventually."" That being the case, to any person who admits that he's a beliver in evolution because of his atheistic beliefs, I say, ""I have no quarrel with thee. Go thy way in peace."" No, my beef is with those people who think that evolution is supported by the facts or even proved by the facts or even (more amazingly) that science and/or evolution has disproved God as I consider these claims to be completely indefensible. I'm also interested in anyone who thinks the Bible preaches evolution (that should be a hoot) so feel free to chime in.

If you are as persistent as you are ignorant of what evolution actually is, then you might stick around for a little bit. Lets see, lets see.... Came out firing, huh? Okay, so we're only dealing with the biological definition of evolution...gotcha. Do you mean as opposed to the evolution of the universe? I guess I can accept you definition, but it is way too simple to encompass all that evolution describes. Change in frequency of genes, expressed or not, is part of evolution. The science also deals with natural selection, which clearly you have left out in your description, but it is very important. There are many things that go into that ""change in frequency"" other than just blind chance which you seem to already be implying. Why is it unprovable? Indeed , it has been proven, but I can see that someone who, for whatever reason, believes this to be unprovable, would also be using the same reasoning to call unproven. So can you tell me why it is unprovable? All the above means is that atheists don't make things up. Should we just make things up to give ourselves intellectual satisfaction? Well then what good are you then? You're basically saying that as long as one's logic is bad you don't have a problem. No, you like to pick apart good logic. Okay. No one who isn't a complete idiot thinks that we have proven God not to exist...so are you just trying to get all the XXXXXX to come forth to debate you? don't care about what the Bible says.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","12:15 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","3"

However, these things are things that ""evolved"" due to the interaction and efforts of intelligent actors. Unless you're an intelligent design advocate, I doubt that would be profitable for either of us. I noted the tone of your response as rather insulting and so I hope you won't feel offended when I take the same tone. What comes around goes around, you know. What reason do you or does anyone have for thinking that chimps and humans share a common ancestor? You gave no reason, but you didn't object to Freedom mentioning that there is an apparent similarity between chimp and human DNA. Usually people tell me that it's 99 percent, but as you'll see if you look at (the url had to be deleted as my post count is less than 5) the latest numbers are closer to 96 percent. A deeper reading tells us that all of this information comes from one single male chimp named Clint who lived in Atlanta. Now I could easily go from there into questions as to why anyone would think that this one chimp is representative of all chimps(and I probably will, but in future posts, not this one. Rather in this post I will work around to my point by starting with this allegory: My wife believes (as do a great many Peruvians) that when a child is sick or uncomfortable that this problem can be cured by passing an egg over them and that this egg will draw out of them the fright or illness as it hovers over their body. Later the egg can be cracked open and inspected to see exactly what problem there is with the child. My wife routinely does this with my children and she is quite confident that it works. However, I'm not a believer and I believe I have good reasons not to be. I shall generalize the theory as follows: If I pass the egg over the child (hereinafter ""P"") then the child will feel better (hereinafter ""Q"") so the situation can be represented symbolically as P=>Q (P implies Q or if P then Q). Later the child feels better (Q) and we therefore determine that P has been confirmed. Unfortunately this is a classic example of the ""affirming the consequent"" logical fallacy. Nothing has been proved at all. Rather it seems likely to me (and perhaps to you too) that the child was likely to get better all on his own and so passing the egg over him had no bearing at all on the final outcome. I assume that we agree so far. The problem is that the chimpanzee-human-DNA-similarity argument follows fundamentally the same logical pattern. If humans and chimps share a common ancestor (P) then their DNA will be quite similar (Q). We find that their DNA is quite similar (Q) therefore P is confirmed. In reality the only thing that has been confirmed is that you are sorely in need of a remedial logic class. But wait, you may exclaim, yes it's true that nothing is proved per se but really it should be analyzed statistically. What are the chances that out of the 3 billion or so genes that 96 percent of them would be similar just by chance ? Really the odds are quite staggering, don't you think? Here we have the second logical fallacy: The strawman argument. You see, those people who oppose your claim do not believe that chimp and human DNA are similar just by chance but rather as a result of intelligent (often divine) design. In short, your argument has not accomplished anything at all except to reinforce the belief that you already had. Which leads me back to my original conclusion: You believe in evolution not because the facts support it but rather because of an a priori philosophical bias in favor of evolution due to your atheistic beliefs. You see, the only way that you could hope to prove that chimps and humans share a common ancestor is to prove that there was one (and only one) incident of spontaneous generation of life in the past. If that could be proved, then humans and chimps sharing a common ancestor would be fait accompli - however, evolution apologists normally back away from all discussion of abiogenesis as ""having nothing to do with evolution."" Now I don't know whether these people are dishonest, ignorant, or both, but the claim is demonstrably false. The (Neo-Darwin) theory of evolution has everything to do with abiogenesis. It seems to me that either the chance of life arising spontaneously for no reason is either so extremely remote that it could never happen even given an infinite stretch of time or that it is common enough that it did happen and that being the case, why not believe that it has happened not once but several times ? Either way the nail is in the coffin of the theory of common descent. But before I close I wanted to note your passing reference to the theory of natural selection. This theory has serious problems and a simple look at the peacock makes them glaringly evident. According to the theory of natural selection the peacock did not originally start with a long, ornate tail but rather it developed the same over generations of natural selection. Unfortunately for you, this is so ridiculous that it almost makes one laugh aloud. Who could seriously advance the idea that having a long and cumbersome tail like that makes the bird better at finding food or evading predators? Of course it does nothing of the sort, rather it makes the bird easier to be converted into some carnivore's lunch. This is, of course, why the theory is usually presented in such a way as to be tautological. ""Strange as it may seem,"" we are told, ""the peacock actually was the fittest, which we know because it survived."" Surival of the fittest where the ""fittest"" are those who have survived. So we have the remarkable theory of the survival of those who have survived. So while it may be hard to argue that this theory is false , we can at least argue that the theory is supremely unuseful as it provides no predictive value. It's untestable, unfalsifiable, and can hardly be considered scientific. Of course we usually have evolutionary apologists retreating to the tacking paradox. ""Evolution is falsifiable,"" they claim. ""All you have to do is find a rabbit fossil in the Cambrian period and voila !"" Of course they don't accept the same logic when Christians employ it. If someone were to say, ""We believe in Jesus the Christ, a god of order who has created an orderly universe. All you have to do to disprove our religion is to prove that the universe is disorderly and voila !"" then I seriously doubt that a good number of atheists would suddenly accept that Christianity is testable, falsifiable, and should be taught in science classes in public schools whereas they do think the theory of evolution should be taught. It's rather hypocritical, don't you think?","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","01:58 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","8"

In his paper, whose link I would be glad to publish if I only had 5+ posts, he says ""There is increasing concern that in modern research, false findings may be the majority or even the vast majority of published research claims. However, this should not be surprising. It can be proven that most claimed research findings are false. Here I will examine the key factors that influence this problem and some corollaries thereof."" Although I can certainly understand the confusion on your part between a mathematical model that doesn't support your pre-conceived (or perhaps I should say ill-conceived) conclusions regarding a subject and a conspiracy theory.

A deeper reading tells us that all of this information comes from one single male chimp named Clint who lived in Atlanta. Now I could easily go from there into questions as to why anyone would think that this one chimp is representative of all chimps(and I probably will, but in future posts, not this one. Rather in this post I will work around to my point by starting with this allegory: My wife believes (as do a great many Peruvians) that when a child is sick or uncomfortable that this problem can be cured by passing an egg over them and that this egg will draw out of them the fright or illness as it hovers over their body. Later the egg can be cracked open and inspected to see exactly what problem there is with the child. My wife routinely does this with my children and she is quite confident that it works. However, I'm not a believer and I believe I have good reasons not to be. I shall generalize the theory as follows: If I pass the egg over the child (hereinafter ""P"") then the child will feel better (hereinafter ""Q"") so the situation can be represented symbolically as P=>Q (P implies Q or if P then Q). Later the child feels better (Q) and we therefore determine that P has been confirmed. Unfortunately this is a classic example of the ""affirming the consequent"" logical fallacy. Nothing has been proved at all. Rather it seems likely to me (and perhaps to you too) that the child was likely to get better all on his own and so passing the egg over him had no bearing at all on the final outcome. I assume that we agree so far. The problem is that the chimpanzee-human-DNA-similarity argument follows fundamentally the same logical pattern. If humans and chimps share a common ancestor (P) then their DNA will be quite similar (Q). We find that their DNA is quite similar (Q) therefore P is confirmed. In reality the only thing that has been confirmed is that you are sorely in need of a remedial logic class. But wait, you may exclaim, yes it's true that nothing is proved per se but really it should be analyzed statistically. What are the chances that out of the 3 billion or so genes that 96 percent of them would be similar just by chance ? Really the odds are quite staggering, don't you think? Here we have the second logical fallacy: The strawman argument. You see, those people who oppose your claim do not believe that chimp and human DNA are similar just by chance but rather as a result of intelligent (often divine) design. In short, your argument has not accomplished anything at all except to reinforce the belief that you already had. Which leads me back to my original conclusion: You believe in evolution not because the facts support it but rather because of an a priori philosophical bias in favor of evolution due to your atheistic beliefs. You see, the only way that you could hope to prove that chimps and humans share a common ancestor is to prove that there was one (and only one) incident of spontaneous generation of life in the past. If that could be proved, then humans and chimps sharing a common ancestor would be fait accompli - however, evolution apologists normally back away from all discussion of abiogenesis as ""having nothing to do with evolution."" Now I don't know whether these people are dishonest, ignorant, or both, but the claim is demonstrably false. The (Neo-Darwin) theory of evolution has everything to do with abiogenesis. It seems to me that either the chance of life arising spontaneously for no reason is either so extremely remote that it could never happen even given an infinite stretch of time or that it is common enough that it did happen and that being the case, why not believe that it has happened not once but several times ? Either way the nail is in the coffin of the theory of common descent. But before I close I wanted to note your passing reference to the theory of natural selection. This theory has serious problems and a simple look at the peacock makes them glaringly evident. According to the theory of natural selection the peacock did not originally start with a long, ornate tail but rather it developed the same over generations of natural selection. Unfortunately for you, this is so ridiculous that it almost makes one laugh aloud. Who could seriously advance the idea that having a long and cumbersome tail like that makes the bird better at finding food or evading predators? Of course it does nothing of the sort, rather it makes the bird easier to be converted into some carnivore's lunch. This is, of course, why the theory is usually presented in such a way as to be tautological. ""Strange as it may seem,"" we are told, ""the peacock actually was the fittest, which we know because it survived."" Surival of the fittest where the ""fittest"" are those who have survived. So we have the remarkable theory of the survival of those who have survived. So while it may be hard to argue that this theory is false , we can at least argue that the theory is supremely unuseful as it provides no predictive value. It's untestable, unfalsifiable, and can hardly be considered scientific. Of course we usually have evolutionary apologists retreating to the tacking paradox. ""Evolution is falsifiable,"" they claim. ""All you have to do is find a rabbit fossil in the Cambrian period and voila !"" Of course they don't accept the same logic when Christians employ it. If someone were to say, ""We believe in Jesus the Christ, a god of order who has created an orderly universe. All you have to do to disprove our religion is to prove that the universe is disorderly and voila !"" then I seriously doubt that a good number of atheists would suddenly accept that Christianity is testable, falsifiable, and should be taught in science classes in public schools whereas they do think the theory of evolution should be taught.

Please do not be one of those people who likes to argue semantics. In this forum I think it is clear what one means when he says, ""evolution."" I have already read the entirety of your response and if you think I find any of it insulting then you definitely misunderstand my stance. I could only find any of your response insulting if I had a personal stake in what I write. Unlike you, I have nothing at stake. I don't rely on my heart in giving me direction as I feel what my heart tells me is very misleading. I still have the same feeling as you, but I have been able to escape from early childhood brainwashing and come to conclusions based on unbiased reason. I do realize that you will no doubt try to find bias in what I say, but you will only be able to come upwith misled speculation. You do realize that Clint shares 99.99999999% of his DNA with other chimps, right? Besides, I highly doubt that Clint is the only Chimp that has had his DNA sequenced. In addition, DNA has been sequenced from both genomic and mitochondrial DNA from Neandertals. It not only shows that we are even more closely related to this other human species, we actually interbred with them. So, unless you carry the pure homo sapiens genome only found within a couple of tribes in Africa, you are related to Neandertal. In addition, every experiment ever performed in the field of genetics has supported the theory of evolution. Not just some of them, ALL of them. So, DNA does in fact carry information that backs up the story of evolution; however, im sure you are armed and ready to throw out the common designer argument. To that, I show you endogenious retroviral insertions. I wont go into this other than to say, if you want to argue that similarities exist between our genome and that of other species because of a common designer, this basically proves that that designer is trying to deceive us. He is representative of all chimps because he is a chimp. It really is that simple. If he were diseased, have some kind of anomalous genetic pattern, that would one thing. But...I seriously doubt that and as I stated above, I seriously doubt he is the ONLY chimp to have had his DNA sequenced. Please know that if you need to be able to reference your liberal arts philosophy class teachings to be able to spot bad logic, you have intelligence issues. And whats more, you have committed the most common of creationist falacies: your beloved scarcrow argument. You have constructed some elaborate, dumbed down representation of what genetic evolutionists are telling us and refuted it with nothing more than your own cry of logical falacy. Of course its wrong - you have a total lack of understanding of what you are refuting! Your example here is actually a strawman, but not as you think. As I said in my original post, you would claim that it was all ""just by chance."" Creationists are the ones who say this, not evolutionists. You are so far out of your league it makes me want to spark some in depth arguments about genetic scaffolding and the landscape of a series of genetic mutations with Freedom. In contrast, I believe in evolution because it is obvious! It takes the grown up brain of a brainwashed child to miss it. The claim is demonstrably true. If you want to argue abiogenesis, we can. However, evolution is a theory. Theories explain how something happens. It just so happens that evolution says nothing of abiogenesis. I will give you that most of the people smart enough to truly understand evolution DO believe that abiogenesis occured at some point and at some place. In fact, abiogenesis probably DID happen more than once. It probably has happened MANY times. However, life on Earth is so far advanced, there is no way to detect such a small event and there is no chance any self replicating molecule could compete with the complex chemical processes that are a part of the processes of life today. However, there are forms of life that most likely did result from a type of abiogenesis. Look at prions. Proteins by themselves cannot replicate. However, deformed proteins known as prions have found a way to do so and cause very devestating diseases. The peacock I have already adressed. As far as your claim that Christianity is not proven false, I beg to differ. Your belief system if not even internally consistent. You have to twist meanings around, simply ignore discrepencies, and totally ignore the conflict with what was written down by independent authors of the day. Your belief system is screwed up that it takes a complete disregard for that very same logic that you are no doubt going to continue to misuse in the coming days.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","06:52 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","28"

"12-07-2012","21431",3,"Databed","467283","The peacock I have already adressed....","Zosimus","467309","First of all, the peacock you have not already addressed rather you have merely alluded to it but I will save you some trouble and make your argument for you as we already know what the argument is. What you meant to say was something like this: Zosimus, you are clearly unaware of how natural selection works. While it's true that long peacock tails don't make them better at finding food or fending off predators, the fact is that peahens find these tails attractive. When peahens see long, symmetrical tails with lots of eyespots those are markers for male quality showing that he has better genes, more testosterone, and is generally a better mate than his competitors. Accordingly peahens prefer to copulate with him than the competitors. So, you see, natural selection perfectly accounts for the existence of long, ornate peacock tails. That's a well-stated argument, but unfortunately it's completely wrong. As you can see at Peacock Feathers: That's So Last Year - ScienceNOW that a seven-year study meant to confirm this theory failed miserably to reproduce anything approaching this conventional wisdom. Despite ""observing 268 matings, the team was unable to pinpoint any single male trait that females preferred."" They checked for longer tails, eyespot size, color, shape, symmetry and nothing predicted female choice. This brings me back around to two points I've already pointed up: Most published research findings are false and the reasons why this is are known and contained at PLOS Medicine: Why Most Published Research Findings Are False where John Ioannidis indicates, ""Claimed Research Findings May Often Be Simply Accurate Measures of the Prevailing Bias"" and also notes, ""Several methodologists have pointed out that the high rate of nonreplication (lack of confirmation) of research discoveries is a consequence of the convenient, yet ill-founded strategy of claiming conclusive research findings solely on the basis of a single study assessed by formal statistical significance, typically for a p-value less than 0.05."" Accordingly it should not be surprising that commonly held evolutionary beliefs are false and emperically falsifiable. What is surprising to me, however, is that this research into peacocks and sexual selection (which was published back in 2008) seems to have escaped your notice. I mean anyone with a web browser and google can easily determine that what you have said is known to be false. So why are you spouting refuted explanations for peacock traits as though they were gospel? The reason is simple: You don't care about the truth of matter at all. You have already made up your mind about the situation and and anything that may call this conclusion into question is to be ignored. The rest of your post is just an insipid regurgitation of things you have assumed, been told, or made up over the years. Chimps share 99.99999999% of their DNA with other chimps. And you know this ... how? You claim that ""Neandertals"" are closely related to humans. First of all, it's spelled Neanderthal. I might have forgiven you had you only misspelled it once in your post, but you misspelled it every time. Second, the mtDNA findings of Neanderthals place them well within human limits. What you refer to as ""neandertals"" are just humans that lived awhile back. So what does that prove? As far as I can tell, nothing. In reference to mtDNA, as you know (and can read on wikipedia) the ""mitochondrial eve"" (that is, the woman who contributed all of our mtDNA) is believed to have lived 200,000 years ago. This number is drawn from evolutionary assumptions based on the idea that humans and chimps diverged some 5 million years ago and the difference in mtDNA between humans and chimps. However, as you can read at http://www.dnai.org/teacherguide/pdf...e_romanovs.pdf actual investigation into the rates of mutations in mtDNA put these numbers very much into question. Pooling all studies together put the rate of mtDNA mutation closer to one mutation per 1,200 years instead of the number derived from evolutionary assumptions of one every 12,000 years - off by a factor of 10. Now in most sciences a theory that was off by a factor of 10 would find itself in the rubbish bin, but not the neo-Darwin theory of evolution. This theory is different than other theories. Why? Well that's because atheists don't care about the facts of the matter. They are simply interested in believing in evolution regardless of the evidence for or against it because it already fits in well with their a priori philosophical biases and it provides them with lots of federal grants so they can continue studying on the taxpayer's dole.

"12-07-2012","21431",3,"Zosimus","467309","First of all, the peacock you have not already addressed rather you have merely alluded to it but I will save you some trouble and make your argument for you as we already know what the argument is. What you meant to say was something like this: Zosimus, you are clearly unaware of how natural selection works. While it's true that long peacock tails don't make them better at finding food or fending off predators, the fact is that peahens find these tails attractive. When peahens see long, symmetrical tails with lots of eyespots those are markers for male quality showing that he has better genes, more testosterone, and is generally a better mate than his competitors. Accordingly peahens prefer to copulate with him than the competitors. So, you see, natural selection perfectly accounts for the existence of long, ornate peacock tails. That's a well-stated argument, but unfortunately it's completely wrong. As you can see at Peacock Feathers: That's So Last Year - ScienceNOW that a seven-year study meant to confirm this theory failed miserably to reproduce anything approaching this conventional wisdom. Despite ""observing 268 matings, the team was unable to pinpoint any single male trait that females preferred."" They checked for longer tails, eyespot size, color, shape, symmetry and nothing predicted female choice. This brings me back around to two points I've already pointed up: Most published research findings are false and the reasons why this is are known and contained at PLOS Medicine: Why Most Published Research Findings Are False where John Ioannidis indicates, ""Claimed Research Findings May Often Be Simply Accurate Measures of the Prevailing Bias"" and also notes, ""Several methodologists have pointed out that the high rate of nonreplication (lack of confirmation) of research discoveries is a consequence of the convenient, yet ill-founded strategy of claiming conclusive research findings solely on the basis of a single study assessed by formal statistical significance, typically for a p-value less than 0.05."" Accordingly it should not be surprising that commonly held evolutionary beliefs are false and emperically falsifiable. What is surprising to me, however, is that this research into peacocks and sexual selection (which was published back in 2008) seems to have escaped your notice. I mean anyone with a web browser and google can easily determine that what you have said is known to be false. So why are you spouting refuted explanations for peacock traits as though they were gospel? The reason is simple: You don't care about the truth of matter at all. You have already made up your mind about the situation and and anything that may call this conclusion into question is to be ignored. The rest of your post is just an insipid regurgitation of things you have assumed, been told, or made up over the years. Chimps share 99.99999999% of their DNA with other chimps. And you know this ... how? You claim that ""Neandertals"" are closely related to humans. First of all, it's spelled Neanderthal. I might have forgiven you had you only misspelled it once in your post, but you misspelled it every time. Second, the mtDNA findings of Neanderthals place them well within human limits. What you refer to as ""neandertals"" are just humans that lived awhile back. So what does that prove? As far as I can tell, nothing. In reference to mtDNA, as you know (and can read on wikipedia) the ""mitochondrial eve"" (that is, the woman who contributed all of our mtDNA) is believed to have lived 200,000 years ago. This number is drawn from evolutionary assumptions based on the idea that humans and chimps diverged some 5 million years ago and the difference in mtDNA between humans and chimps. However, as you can read at http://www.dnai.org/teacherguide/pdf...e_romanovs.pdf actual investigation into the rates of mutations in mtDNA put these numbers very much into question. Pooling all studies together put the rate of mtDNA mutation closer to one mutation per 1,200 years instead of the number derived from evolutionary assumptions of one every 12,000 years - off by a factor of 10.

I will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you just missed my first response, but you should go back and see for yourself - Post #26. So we can't confirm in this newest study with farmed peacocks that females have any preference. However, it was confirmed before in earlier studies. You chose to completely ignore the older studies in favor of the one that fits your view. Again, quite hypocritical if you ask me. On top of that, if you believe this does anything to hurt TOE, you are sadly mistaken. There are hundreds of such examples that evolutionists can only speculate on. In fact, evolutionists differ in their point of view on how or why many features evolved in certain organisms. But no evolutionist would argue that there is no such thing as sexual selection or that just because they don't have an immediate answer for the hows and whys that evolution simply can't explain either. You pulled this essay from a medical journal! Don't you think that that the author of this essay has spent most of his time reviewing medical research? On top of that, while he doesn't come right out and limit his scope to that of the medical field, almost all of his examples are obviously pertaining to medical research. How many times does he reference study size?? You think he is talking about how many DNA specimens to collect or how many bones of a T-rex have been included? He is talking about patients and population sizes. Only a complete XXXXX would think this is even applicable to whether or not evolution is a valid theory. Because, you know, all those research studies to confirm evolution.... Wow, I guess we can't all be peacock experts. Apparently you have spent a lot of time on this subject. By the way, no one, even those responsible for the study you are sooo in to, actually believes that peacocks don't get their feathers as a result of sexual selection. All the study concluded is that the researchers were unable to pinpoint what exactly is preferable to the female. There are many other factors that could have come in to play and acting like the study included all possible grounds is simply irresponsible. What, are you going to start arguing that chimps don't share the same genome now? Did God create each one individually? Neandertals were humans, hence, Homo neanderthalensis . Wow, for someone so anxious to correct the spelling of a species of human, you would think you knew what human actually meant, right? By the way, Neandertal is acceptable. Please do better fact checking before you make such a wild accusation of poor spelling. Actual investigation over a period of years as opposed to simply looking at the divergence in species all over the planet is a better method for determining mutation rates. You have chosen your exerpt very well to prove your point, too. Why don't you summarize the conclusion of this article for us...I think it basically says that the ones doing the research have several reasons for the discrepancy in rates and in no way doubt the accepted timeline of evolutionary history. So stupid... I really hope you did not spend too much time compiling this silliness. Hopefully you will do a better next time, although I am really not sure that I am dealing with someone intelligent enough to have this discussion. You are a Christian right?

I said the prayer, became Christian and then went to their church where they spent their time babbling, frothing and rolling around on the floor. I thought, These guys are crazy, and I never went back. Now despite having told me before that I was saved (forever, and that nothing could separate me from the love of God) they later told me I was going to hell. Does that make me Christian? You decide. I do not believe that God created the entire universe out of nothing in six days time. Even if God had done such a thing, that would make him responsible for all the evil in the world since by that act of creation he would be responsible for the acts of all things he created unless someone is implying that God tried to create everything perfectly, but failed. Now that we have that out of the way, lets get down to science. From my point of view science is easy and clear to understand. First you get a theory and then you try to disprove the theory. Theories that are not disprovable (like the idea that God created the universe exactly as we see it) are not scientific. That doesnt mean theyre wrong, theyre just untestable. Now there exists a theory of evolution (Darwin style) and it should be testable. Now by that I mean that there should be some concrete observation that I could make that would prove the theory wrong. Now most Darwin apologists when confronted with this claim that finding a perfectly preserved rabbit fossil in the Precambrian would effectively disprove Darwinism. However, as you can see from a simple look at Precambrian rabbit - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia most people dont agree that such a finding would indeed disprove evolution including noted expert on the Philosophy of Science Peter Godfrey-Smith. Evolution, like all other scientific theories, is just that: A THEORY. Its unproven and indeed unprovable. It makes certain claims and some of these claims can be tested. Now it doesnt matter how many claims are tested and come out correctly if some testable claims turn out to be wrong. As Einstein is reported to have said, No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong. The difference between the theory of relativity and the theory of evolution is that observations that go against the theory of relativity are taken seriously whereas observations that go against the theory of evolution are explained away using ad hoc hypotheses. Now the authors of the peacock study I quoted were not shy about speculating that maybe the train had been formed using sexual selection, but now female tastes have changed. The problem with making that ad hoc hypothesis is that it effectively renders natural selection untestable because no finding no matter how inconsistent with what is predicted ever results in the theory being called into question. It is beyond question an article of faith for its adherents. Anyone who calls it into question gets labeled a Christian and has to spend all of his time fielding questions about beliefs he doesnt have along with people trying to pull him out of the closet a stealth Christian. Be honest now what would you think if a Christian came on here and claimed the Bible was completely true 100 percent inerrant. Now when this Christian was challenged on the Bible says PI = 3 (round table, 10 cubits diameter, 30 cubits circumference) he said, Well, PI was 3 at that time but has since changed to the number we now use. What would you think of that argument? Wouldnt you laugh at him and consider the argument invalid? Well thats exactly how I feel about people who say that peahens must have used to prefer long-tailed peacocks but now dont. Its absurd because with this argument you can justify anything at all. Every time I come onto forums like this I hear people saying they believe in evolution because the facts and the studies back it up. Where are these studies? What are the facts? One of the landmark studies about sexual selection was the 1948 fruit fly study performed by Angus John Bateman. Now as we have already learned from Ioannidis article there is a strong risk that solitary studies that rely solely on a 95-percent statistical confidence level are wrong. Until very recently this study was never reproduced it was merely accepted as gospel. Why? Because Bateman was preaching to the choir. Only now some 60+ years later has the experiment been redone. (See Biologists reveal potential 'fatal flaw' in iconic sexual selection study ). What do we find? Bateman's 1948 study is the most-cited experimental paper in sexual selection todayOur team repeated Bateman's experiment and foundthat Bateman's paper should never have been published, so says said Patricia Adair Gowaty, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCLA. What was wrong? His methodology resulted in more offspring being assigned to fathers than mothers, something that is impossible when each child must have both a father and a mother, Gowaty said. But Gowaty and her colleagues, by performing the same experiment, found that the data were decidedly inconclusive. In their repetition -- and possibly in Bateman's original study -- the data failed to match a fundamental assumption of genetic parentage assignments. Specifically, the markers used to identify individual subjects were influencing the parameters being measured (the number of mates and the number of offspring). When offspring die from inherited marker mutations, the results become biased, indicating that the method is unable to reliably address the relationship between the number of mates and the number of offspring, said Gowaty. Nonetheless, Bateman's figures are featured in numerous biology textbooks, and the paper has been cited in nearly 2,000 other scientific studies. Repeating key studies is a tenet of science, which is why Bateman's methodology should have been retried as soon as it became important in the 1970s, she said. Those who blindly accept that females are choosy while males are promiscuous might be missing a big piece of the puzzle. ""Our worldviews constrain our imaginations,"" Gowaty said. ""For some people, Bateman's result was so comforting that it wasn't worth challenging. I think people just accepted it."" P.S.

"12-10-2012","21431",4,"Zosimus","467409","Evolution, like all other scientific theories, is just that: A THEORY. Its unproven and indeed unprovable. It makes certain claims and some of these claims can be tested. Now it doesnt matter how many claims are tested and come out correctly if some testable claims turn out to be wrong. As Einstein is reported to have said, No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong. Be honest now what would you think if a Christian came on here and claimed the Bible was completely true 100 percent inerrant. Now when this Christian was challenged on the Bible says PI = 3 (round table, 10 cubits diameter, 30 cubits circumference) he said, Well, PI was 3 at that time but has since changed to the number we now use. What would you think of that argument? Wouldnt you laugh at him and consider the argument invalid? Well thats exactly how I feel about people who say that peahens must have used to prefer long-tailed peacocks but now dont. Its absurd because with this argument you can justify anything at all. Every time I come onto forums like this I hear people saying they believe in evolution because the facts and the studies back it up. Where are these studies? What are the facts? Repeating key studies is a tenet of science, which is why Bateman's methodology should have been retried as soon as it became important in the 1970s, she said. Those who blindly accept that females are choosy while males are promiscuous might be missing a big piece of the puzzle. P.S. Ayn Rand was an idiot.","Freedom","467415","I disagree, that may be what they're teaching kids in schools these days but saying something is true while claiming it's unprovable is unprovable The most important parts of science are provable and proven. The method, the facts (observations), and even the conceptual explanations (theories) are all provable. In many cases the words and analogies are different but so long as one considers the theory the absolute relationship (usually expressed in math) that is irrelevant. It's happened already. I would think the bible rounded. It allows the theory to survive peahens being observed to not care. In my experience when someone gets something wrong in any field of study is probably because they didn't consider the full dynamics through time. Time adds another dimension to thought and is easily overlooked. Ignoring the relationship between different points in time is the only way to think evolution can form novel systems so you aren't the only one, but you can't just dismiss the possibility because you don't have evidence for it. Sexual selection surely exists, if it doesn't exist in peahens right now that only means peahens won't be contributing to the body of observation on sexual selection in modern times. They mean the fossil record showing a pattern of common descent. In general that does seem to be the case. If I were to pick a species that would not be that way it would be fruit flies. Look Zosimus our own species has examples of sexual selection in it. What force prevents it from existing in any other species or being disconnected from objective benefit to some degree?

I thought God could do anything. There was a certain man named Blaise Pascal, who invented probability and game theory. He is famous for ""Pascal's Wager"" which is the claim that man should believe in God because even if the odds are extremely low the payoff is high so that's the right bet to make. Now let's assume, for the sake of argument, that there is a God and Jesus is God and the only other gods are the Holy Spirit and God the Father and that they're all one. This implies that a person should belong to one of the many Christian churches in existence. Now let's compare the Christian churches in light of Pascal's observations, shall we? It seems to me that the chances of Evangelical Christianity being right are about the same as Jehovah's Witnesses' chances of being right, or Mormons being right. The difference, however, is that if you're an evangelical Christian and you die you get to spend all of eternity playing a harp and singing praises to God. While this may excite some, it sounds rather boring to me. On the other hand if you're Mormon and you're right then you become God and you can have as many wives as you want and spend all of eternity having sex with them. Better yet, they're all perfect so they're not even jealous of one another. Plus you can have kids, if you want, or not, and you never have to worry about paying for them because you can just materalize resources out of nothing. In fact, considering that all your wives will be perfect, I think it's pretty clear that perfect women are bisexual by mere definition, which would permit you to have as many threesomes as you'd like throughout eternity. It should be clear from this analysis that if you're going to be Christian, you should be Mormon as they have a much better afterlife. In fact, I would consider it to be infinitely better than playing a harp and singing praises to God on cloud 9. Finally, if you really analyze Genesis, you'll find that the word commonly translated as ""create"" (bara) actually means ""to fatten up"" which strongly implies that God didn't create the Earth out of nothing, but rather that there was pre-existing matter that he organized into its current form. Maybe God can't create something out of nothing at all.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","03:23 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","62"

So we take a rock and a vacuum and we drop said rock and we find that it works. So then we take a leaf and that works too. So we take a glass and that works too. How do we know that the next object selected will also work? In short, how do we know that the past is a good guide to the future? The response often given by people who haven't seriously thought about it is to say, ""Well, it's always worked in the past."" Unfortunately, however, this is circular logic. You cannot assume that the past is a good guide to the future because it worked in the past and will, therefore, work in the future because you are assuming what you are setting out to prove. This problem, known as the problem of induction, cannot be justified logically. You cannot use induction to prove induction because that's begging the question. In order to prove it deductively you must supply the missing postulate, which is this: All objects share the same properties and that's why a rock and a glass fall at the same rate. This postulate, however, is clearly false as a glass has properties that a rock doesn't. There are currently two proposed solutions to this problem: 1) Popperian falsification and 2) Bayesian statistics. Now I've already posted several times the mathematical proof that Bayesian statistics results in published results being wrong more often than right and the only serious objection I've heard to it is ""That guy is quoting from medical studies."" So what? The second solution is called falsificationism. This postulates that theories are theories - working assumptions, and that true science is spent in trying two theories against one another to try to falsify the one or the other (see Falsifiability - Karl Popper's Basic Scientific Principle ). Now in order for falsificationism to work you must have a theory that is, at least theoretically, falsifiable. There should be something I could observe that would disprove, for example, the theory of gravity. In fact, there are things that could be observed. For example in 1919 during a solar eclipse gravitational lensing was first observed and Newton's Law of Gravity was disproved whereas Einstein's theories were accepted. Now let's say that we are working under a theory of natural (sexual) selection and we go and visit three islands. On the first island the girls are strictly monogamous and jealous of their men. Why? ""Well,"" the Darwinist explains, ""it's sexual selection. Men prefer monogamous women because he knows that those babies are really his."" On the second island the girls are bisexual. Why? ""Sexual selection again,"" says the Darwinist. ""Guys like girls who are into sex and so they prefer women who are bisexual."" On the third island the girls are heterosexual but promiscuous. Why? ""Sexual selection again,"" says the Darwinist. ""The more guys the girl has sex with, the more likely she is to get pregnant. She won't have to worry as much about her man being sterile. Plus if the men kill babies that aren't theirs, by sleeping with a lot of men, he won't be sure the baby isn't his."" So what does this really mean? Everything can be explained by sexual selection - monogamy, bisexuality, and promiscuity. But what does that really prove? Nothing except that the theory can fit any data that is fed into it. This theory is worthless because it forbids nothing. It makes no predictions and therefore is unfalsifiable, untestable, and worthless. So don't bother telling me about how our species has sexual selection in it. It means nothing and anyway most of that natural selection is in the mind of the researchers. Don't believe me? Try reading Hundreds of Natural-Selection Studies Could be Wrong, Study Demonstrates in which we see that hundreds of studies have been done with a faulty statistical model that doesn't work at all. Here's a quote: To demonstrate how small sample sizes can lead to incorrect results, the team used computer simulations to examine the evolution of genes in three primates: humans, chimpanzees, and macaques. The scientists mimicked the procedures used by the authors of a 2007 paper, which applied the branch-site method to 14,000 orthologous genes -- genes that are genealogically identical among different species -- and which found that the method predicted selection in 32 of the genes. Nei and his team also studied selection using Fisher's exact test, but this test did not detect any selection. ""The results indicate that the number of nucleotide substitutions that occurred were too small to detect any selection; therefore, all of the 32 cases obtained by the branch-site method must be false positives,"" said Nozawa.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","03:26 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","63"
"12-11-2012","21431",5,"Databed","467427","Scientists have used the idea of evolution to seek out countless intermediate forms. They both predict the strata the fossils would be found in and the overall appearance of the unknown specimen. This has happened many times. Scientists have predicted relationships between living species based on morphology found in fossil record, geographical distribution and similarities in modern forms. These assumptions and conclusions were well established before DNA was first sequenced. The vast majority of the phylogeny based on pre-DNA analysis was confirmed with DNA studies. Some of the tree was wrong and corrected. Never has there been any anomaly that comes even close to casting doubt on the theory. There are many ways the DNA sequencing could have sunk evolution if it were the wrong theory. Instead it supports evolution. Evolution suggest that species will evolve to fill an available niche. Paleontologists have studied many ancient ecosystems and concluded that some species are yet to found. They have predicted the findings of many species that were later confirmed. (Mostly large carnivores) Evolution explains many seemingly poorly designed structures in modern animals. Only through the lense of accepting that life has evolved through many previous iterations and forms do many of these structures make sense. Only a blind process can result I many of these forms. Genetic signatures found in the genomes of different species can be tracked to the point in the family tree where all the species who share the signature also last shared a common ancestor. Thousands of these markers are common to many species and are the result of a single event of retroviral insertion within the egg, sperm or zygote that led to the last common ancestor. No theory other than evolution can explain this and it even predicts it. It means you are likely to find ERVs (endogenous retroviral insertions) placed precisely along the family tree of all monkeys, apes and humans. In fact, these ERVs are well documented. We can even match much of the code to the modern day versions of the viruses that originally created them. Evolution predicts the viral code to be different in the modern day versions and indeed they are. Evolution predicts that many mutations will occur in species that are bad for the organism. This happens all the time. Evolution predicts that structures that are useless to an organism will disappear, but that the DNA for them may remain. Indeed we find countless examples of vestigial structures and DNA sequences so that chickens may grow teeth, whales have pelvises and even vestigial leg bones, and genetic code that once coded for some useful function now causes genetic disease when triggered. Evolution predicts that humans will share many primal urges with animals. Obviously, they do.","Zosimus","467442","My good friend, Databed, you have no idea what you're talking about and it makes me sad. You see, you have a theory of evolution (E) that makes certain predictions (P) so we can say: If E then P (or E=>P) Later you find P and you think that the theory has been confirmed. In reality, however, you have merely engaged in a logical fallacy known as ""affirming the consequent."" None of these findings mean anything at all because one solitary time that the theory doesn't match up with predictions then the theory is falsified. The only time any of these findings might have any meaning at all would be if they met a 95-percent statistical confidence level. Even under those circumstances the results are most likely wrong. Maybe you don't understand why. Let me explain. Let's imagine that I'm a geneticist who is doing research on 1000 different genes in 1000 different studies. None of these genes have anything to do with anything but still we expect that 5 percent of those studies will show a 95-percent confidence level just by chance alone . So that means out of those 1000 genes, 50 of them will show as false positives. Assuming that I submit all of my studies for publication, chances are good that most of the negative results won't get published. Who cares that I studied a gene and didn't find a relationship, right? Yet all of the false positives are likely to be published. That means that even though I'm 100 percent unbiased and doing everything perfectly, 100 percent of my published studies will be wrong. As I have previously pointed out by referring you to PLOS Medicine: Why Most Published Research Findings Are False the numbers get even worse when bias is involved. As much as you might want to believe that simply reaching a p=0.05 or less in one solitary study means that real scientific progress has been made, both experience and mathematics are solidly against you. Let's imagine that there are 10,000 genes being studied by 10 teams, each team doing 1,000 and I am just one member of one team. Of those 10,000 genes only 0.3% of them actually correlate with what we are studying. Assuming that we are using an excellent method that is 95 percent accurate, that still means we expect to find 50 false positives and 3 real positives. That means after the study the chance that any one of the genes that I studied actually being a real find is a mere 5.66 percent. Now that's quite a jump from 0.3% to 5.66% but it's still far below 50 percent. Additionally there's no way of knowing that the method I'm using really is 95 percent accurate. In order to know that, I'd need to have a method that's 100 percent accurate and to be able to match my results against that method. On the other hand, if there was a 100 percent accurate method, then we wouldn't be screwing around with my method that's only 95 percent, would we? I'm glad that you have faith in science and evolution and all that, but it's all a house of cards built on assumptions that don't stand up to solid investigation. As you can see at Convergent evolution of Darwin's finches caused by... [Evolution. 2004] - PubMed - NCBI in Darwin's finches (the ones that started this whole business) the differences in beak robustness cannot be explained by natural selection and investigations have shown flow of genes from G. fortis to G. scandens. Now maybe you're not aware of this, but supposedly different species don't breed and so genes don't supposedly flow from one species into another. Obviously that is not the case here, which raises the question: Why bother to think that they're different species at all? The reason why you believe that has nothing to do with the evidence (or lack of same) but rather because you have made up your mind previously due to your own emotions, and the facts you spout are just rationalizations for what you have already decided to believe. Not that there's much fact in your post. Where are your links to supporting studies? Why do I post links and no one else does? The reason is simple: Because the facts are on my side.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","03:28 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","64"

Let me guess NOTHING AT ALL would convince you that evolution is false because its part of your religious worldview, isnt it? Or maybe you dont like to admit that evolution is a subset of biology so you think that looking at medical and biological studies are useless. Heres a simple study proving that Darwinism is false: Epigenesis: The New Biology | Dr. Pulos Intelligent rats were bred and placed into two cages. One cage had lots of interesting toys and opportunities to explore and learn whereas the other cage was boring with nothing but food and cage. The conclusion of the study was simple: The offspring of the rats in the interesting cage were more intelligent than their parents for three generations in a row whereas the offspring in the boring cage were less intelligent for three generations in a row. Remember, of course, that they all had the same genes . It was just a matter of which genes got expressed in the following generations. This explanation perfectly explains Darwins finches without the need for multiplying factors. How does 'natural selection' account for the epigenesis study? It can't because all the rats bred normally and had the same genes. Accordingly the theory of natural selection cannot account for the world as we know it.","Databed","467547","First off, you have yet to supply a ""false positive"" that is relevant to your claims in post #64.

I meant Rev. 4:8 not 18. In this we find that in heaven everyone stands round the throne of God praising him. While that may sound like great fun to you, it's not up my alley. You didn't like the link for bara. Fine. Try Old Testament Word Studies in which we find that bara means ""create, cut, shape, perforate, and strengthen, make well, make grow"" Now perhaps you think that it means to create out of nothing. Fine - believe as you wish. However, you cannot claim that the Bible supports this meaning. In the beginning of the creation story, for example, the spirit of the LORD is moving upon some waters and he exclaims, "" Sea la luz! "" (which for some reason you translate as ""Let there be light"" as if light was always going to be and he just let it happen. Strange...). Nevertheless it indicates that before God created there was something there that he was creating from. Now maybe you can argue that God created those waters before the story of creation really gets going. Still, you can argue anything you want. Now in Genesis 1:27 we see that God created man (also with the word bara) yet we see that man was formed out of the dust of the ground - so again, you cannot claim that bara means to create out of nothing when used to refer to the acts of divine beings. But let's say, for the sake of argument, that before he was born Jesus (aka Jehovah) really did create the entire universe out of nothing. If that is the case, then he has surely also created evil. Now perhaps you will argue that every being has free will, yet surely God in his omniscience could have said, ""I'm about to create Cain... but I see that he will team up with Satan and kill Abel and that will be bad... so maybe I'll skip making him."" But he did no such thing, so while you may be eager to let God wash his hands of the responsibility, we can still easily see that if the standard Christian story of creation is true, then God has created and is directly responsible for evil and that he knew ahead of time what he was doing. Now as for your links proving Mormonism wrong, logically, the only thing that is proved therein is that the author has no understanding of Mormon theology. Mormons believe, for example, that Jesus achieved exaltation after his earth life. Yet, you may ask, who exalted Jesus? Who saved him? Surely you and Mormons agree that Jesus saved himself - that he needed no expiacin (which for some unfathomable reason you call at-one-ment) and so the supposed infinite regression problem exists only in the mind of the author of the paper. So again, I challenge you to solve the two problems I have set for you: 1. How do you account for the existence of evil? This is the prime philosophical challenge for Christianity. 2. How do you account for your lack of belief in Mormonism, considering that their theology generates a greater present value calculation than that of your own faith? P.S. Quoting the Bible may make you feel good, but it's pointless. Not only does everyone's interpretation of said document vary, but you cannot hope to convince someone of Christianity by the Bible since, if they accept the Bible as true, they are already Christians.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","02:28 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","90"

"12-17-2012","21431",7,"Freedom","467528","To live and compete life must be efficient. To be efficient is to waste little resources and gain resources with little effort or risk. Females normally invest more resources, that is a fact. Therefore for females to be efficient with their resources they would need to be careful what they invest in. No I was certainly not referring to fruit flies. I think any creature with that little intelligence and such a fast life style would show little to no sexual selection. The danger in the life of any fruit fly is that it dies before mating not that it wastes resources producing eggs which are tiny even compared to itself. I would expect to see no choosiness in insects beyond ""whatever male survives getting to me wins."" but you didn't disprove my claims, you just admitted that I didn't claim to be referring to the Bateman study. You seem to be versed in logical terminology so you should know that an invalid argument does not prove it's conclusion false. I did not claim that, this is a strawman fallacy. Red Herring Perhaps I get it from observed consistency in every conceivable objective analysis of reality. Logic and therefore human thought itself is predicated on the absence of contradiction in the universe. It is an axiom that none of us can escape except by ceasing to think at all. A is never non-A. The universe exists, and so too does everything in it. Imperfection in knowledge is not mysticism in reality as countless examples throughout history and in each individuals own life teach us. When you find something or see something that you did not expect, that contradicts what you thought; you change your beliefs because the universe sure as hell isn't going to change for you. Depends on which things you are talking about Yes, induction. If we're at the end of a cycle then there is a cycle; which by definition is a pattern. @Databed, this is the kind of things I have thought about you but not cluttered our exchanges with because it's irrelevant. This is the same mistake Darwin made about inheritable traits, it's hardly new. More importantly this Lipton guy is a nutcase: Mysticism from a lab coat is still mysticism. If genes don't turn themselves on or off what could? Inside a cell nucleus the only candidates for changing the expression of genes are proteins which are being constructed as expressions of genes. What the hypothesis here, that your thoughts are emitting radiation just right or are they causing the correct molecules to appear out of the void? If it's some system whereby the state of your thoughts is monitored by the biology and determines gene expression that is still the genes turning themselves on or off. More importantly though gene expression is not the same thing as gene inheritance. Are you suggesting that gene expression is inherited as well as genes?","Zosimus","467634","I find your argument quite confusing. You claim that low intelligence corresponds with low sexual selection. Nevertheless sexual selection is supposedly engrained in the genes and the instinct of an animal. If an animal prefers a specific mating scent, for example, supposedly those males that produce said scent will be favored in breeding regardless of intelligence or lack of same. The arguments you are making (or at least appear to be making) are those contained at Mate choice - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia which claim that R.A. Fischer in 1915 claimed runaway selection resulted in making things like long peacock tails. Yet I have already posted links refuting this claim. Later in the article we see that Bateman supposedly presented experimental evidence using Drosophila for supposed sexual selection, yet this study, when redone, was inconclusive and had methodological flaws. So kindly refer me to the study you are referring to and ensure that this study does not reference the now-refuted Bateman study. Next you claim that you are not using induction to support induction. But later you say ""Perhaps I get it from observed consistency in every conceivable objective analysis of reality."" So basically you are claiming that what you have seen so far is a valid sample of the universe as a whole - in a sense that you can use your past experiences to predict your future experiences. But how do you know that the past is a good guide to the future? Just because it worked in the past? Isn't that circular logic? Let's take this premise and run with it. Let's assume that my experiences are representative of the entire universe. I can, therefore, claim that the entire universe speaks Spanish. After all, my wife speaks Spanish, my friends speak Spanish, my students speak Spanish, the administrative staff here speaks Spanish. All the bus drivers and bus riders speak Spanish. Therefore the entire UNIVERSE speaks Spanish. Do you think this is a valid logical chain? No? Then why is your chain of reasoning more valid? Finally as for gene expression, YES, I am suggesting that gene expression is inherited as well as genes (see Inherited variation in gene expr... [Annu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. 2009] - PubMed - NCBI ) nor am I suggesting that gene expression is controlled by psychic impulses. Rather I am suggesting that things like diet can affect it (see Up-regulation of the tumor suppressor... [Anticancer Res. 1998 May-Jun] - PubMed - NCBI ) or exposure to sun (see Vitamin D found to influence over 200 genes, highlighting links to disease ). Quote: ""The vitamin D receptor is a protein activated by vitamin D, which attaches itself to DNA and thus influences what proteins are made from our genetic code"" (emphasis added).","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","02:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","92"

As you would know, had you bothered to read the article: ""The scientists mimicked the procedures used by the authors of a 2007 paper, which applied the branch-site method to 14,000 orthologous genes -- genes that are genealogically identical among different species -- and which found that the method predicted selection in 32 of the genes."" Now maybe you don't understand. If one theorizes that chimps and humans share a common ancestor and that certain DNA sections are found to be identical, and if one theorizes that natural selection can and does occur, then one must conclude that there was no natural selection in the identical section (since they are identical, supposedly remaining that way in the absence of natural selection). Yet we read that the statistical method indicates that 32 of the genes had indeed been naturally selected for. ""...therefore, all of the 32 cases obtained by the branch-site method must be false positives,"" said Nozawa. So you cannot claim that there are no false positives considering that false positives have been detected as recently as March 2009. Additionally as you can read at JAMA Network | JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association | Contradicted and Initially Stronger Effects in Highly Cited Clinical Research we find that 45 highly-cited studies were reexamined by John Ioannidis and his findings were as follows: Eleven had never been retested. Seven had been refuted and seven had been found to be exaggerated whereas 20 were replicated. Accordingly 41.2 percent of the highly-cited research was known to be wrong yet was still being highly cited as though it were authoritative. He went on to point out that 5 out of 6 non-randomized studies were refuted. At least in medical studies you have the possibility of randomized and double-blind studies, but when was the last time you saw a randomized, double-blind evolutionary study? Such things are simply not done. Accordingly it should be no surprise that I can go with a Google browser and quickly find studies refuting almost all cases of supposed natural selection. I just go to Sexual selection - RationalWiki and find what has supposedly been sexually selected for and then do a Google search finding that it's wrong (giraffes, for example, see Sexual selection is not the origin of long necks in giraffes - Mitchell - 2009 - Journal of Zoology - Wiley Online Library ). ------------------- Now as referring to your later comment that you think that I think that all these studies are wrong because of bias or some kind of conspiracy theory. If you had bothered to read the article you are criticizing, you would see that bias is only one of the reasons why things can go wrong. Let's take the example of a person who is undergoing a test for a serious disease. The person tests positive for the disease using a test that is known to be 95 percent accurate - that it produces wrong results only 5 percent of the time. Does that mean we can be 95 percent sure the person has that disease? Absolutely not! First you need to consider the odds prior to the test that the person had the disease. Let's say this disease is quite rare and only 1 percent of the population has this disease. As such the a priori probability that the person has the disease is only 1 percent. Accordingly if we take a population of 10,000 people with 100 of them having the disease we will find that 95 percent of the people that are positive for the disease will test positive (95 people) whereas of the 9,900 people who do not have the disease 5 percent of them will falsely test positive for the disease (495 false positives). As such the after-test probability that the person really has the diease is 95/(95+495) = 95/590 = 16 percent. Yes, that's right! A test that is 95 percent accurate can produce only a 16 percent probability that the person really has the disease! In short almost 84 percent of the people who test positive for the disease do not have it at all! This is why the author of the paper criticizes ""...the convenient, yet ill-founded strategy of claiming conclusive research findings solely on the basis of a single study assessed by formal statistical significance, typically for a p-value less than 0.05."" Yet I can come onto forums like these and hear people say things like, ""I do not believe in evolution in the same way that I do not believe in gravity. It is a known fact."" Yet they ""know"" it's a fact thanks to Bayesian (or subjective) statistics(!) (see What is Subjective (Bayesian) Probability? - YouTube ) - a method for measuring the subjective probability of something that starts off by making a guess. Now perhaps you can argue, as Bayes did, that with enough tests the starting (guessed) probability will eventually converge on the true probability, but I don't know how you can claim that on the basis of one single study . Going back to the disease example above, let's suppose that the doctors do not know the percentage of the population that has the disease being tested for. What will they do? They will guess and hope for the best. I'm glad that all of you are comfortable with scientists guessing their results, but quite frankly, I am not comfortable with it at all. What I want to see is multiple randomized double-blind studies that agree with one another. And what I don't want to see is a lot of regurgitation of refuted studies and a lot of atheistic shouting that neo-Darwin evolution is unconditionally true and unquestionable.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","02:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","93"

It also serves to contrast the goodness of God, and as a warning to those who think it might be fun to try it. And if you sow evil, you will reap evil.

"12-19-2012","21431",7,"Zosimus","467635","As I have already pointed out at Hundreds Of Natural-selection Studies Could Be Wrong, Study Demonstrates there are known problems with the statistical methods used to highlight supposed incidences of natural selection. As you would know, had you bothered to read the article: ""The scientists mimicked the procedures used by the authors of a 2007 paper, which applied the branch-site method to 14,000 orthologous genes -- genes that are genealogically identical among different species -- and which found that the method predicted selection in 32 of the genes."" Now maybe you don't understand. If one theorizes that chimps and humans share a common ancestor and that certain DNA sections are found to be identical, and if one theorizes that natural selection can and does occur, then one must conclude that there was no natural selection in the identical section (since they are identical, supposedly remaining that way in the absence of natural selection). Yet we read that the statistical method indicates that 32 of the genes had indeed been naturally selected for. ""...therefore, all of the 32 cases obtained by the branch-site method must be false positives,"" said Nozawa. So you cannot claim that there are no false positives considering that false positives have been detected as recently as March 2009. Additionally as you can read at JAMA Network | JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association | Contradicted and Initially Stronger Effects in Highly Cited Clinical Research we find that 45 highly-cited studies were reexamined by John Ioannidis and his findings were as follows: Eleven had never been retested. Seven had been refuted and seven had been found to be exaggerated whereas 20 were replicated. Accordingly 41.2 percent of the highly-cited research was known to be wrong yet was still being highly cited as though it were authoritative. He went on to point out that 5 out of 6 non-randomized studies were refuted. At least in medical studies you have the possibility of randomized and double-blind studies, but when was the last time you saw a randomized, double-blind evolutionary study? Such things are simply not done. Accordingly it should be no surprise that I can go with a Google browser and quickly find studies refuting almost all cases of supposed natural selection. I just go to Sexual selection - RationalWiki and find what has supposedly been sexually selected for and then do a Google search finding that it's wrong (giraffes, for example, see Sexual selection is not the origin of long necks in giraffes - Mitchell - 2009 - Journal of Zoology - Wiley Online Library ). Now as referring to your later comment that you think that I think that all these studies are wrong because of bias or some kind of conspiracy theory. If you had bothered to read the article you are criticizing, you would see that bias is only one of the reasons why things can go wrong. Let's take the example of a person who is undergoing a test for a serious disease. The person tests positive for the disease using a test that is known to be 95 percent accurate - that it produces wrong results only 5 percent of the time. Does that mean we can be 95 percent sure the person has that disease? Absolutely not! First you need to consider the odds prior to the test that the person had the disease. Let's say this disease is quite rare and only 1 percent of the population has this disease. As such the a priori probability that the person has the disease is only 1 percent. Accordingly if we take a population of 10,000 people with 100 of them having the disease we will find that 95 percent of the people that are positive for the disease will test positive (95 people) whereas of the 9,900 people who do not have the disease 5 percent of them will falsely test positive for the disease (495 false positives). As such the after-test probability that the person really has the diease is 95/(95+495) = 95/590 = 16 percent. Yes, that's right! A test that is 95 percent accurate can produce only a 16 percent probability that the person really has the disease! In short almost 84 percent of the people who test positive for the disease do not have it at all! This is why the author of the paper criticizes ""...the convenient, yet ill-founded strategy of claiming conclusive research findings solely on the basis of a single study assessed by formal statistical significance, typically for a p-value less than 0.05."" Yet I can come onto forums like these and hear people say things like, ""I do not believe in evolution in the same way that I do not believe in gravity. It is a known fact."" Yet they ""know"" it's a fact thanks to Bayesian (or subjective) statistics(!) (see What is Subjective (Bayesian) Probability? - YouTube ) - a method for measuring the subjective probability of something that starts off by making a guess. Now perhaps you can argue, as Bayes did, that with enough tests the starting (guessed) probability will eventually converge on the true probability, but I don't know how you can claim that on the basis of one single study . Going back to the disease example above, let's suppose that the doctors do not know the percentage of the population that has the disease being tested for. What will they do? They will guess and hope for the best. I'm glad that all of you are comfortable with scientists guessing their results, but quite frankly, I am not comfortable with it at all. What I want to see is multiple randomized double-blind studies that agree with one another. And what I don't want to see is a lot of regurgitation of refuted studies and a lot of atheistic shouting that neo-Darwin evolution is unconditionally true and unquestionable.","Databed","467707","Are you really going to insult me with this again? The false positive he refers to is not one which confirms evolution or natural selection actually occur!!!! Please, you need a reality check. The article explains that the statistical method they were using to analyze gene sequences is flawed. In this case, the bias is not in the study, not in the article and not in the information. It's in the reader. You want so badly to find something debunking evolution, so the first article you find that says in the title ""natural selection"" and ""wrong"" you take to mean you've actually got some ammunition in this argument. The fact is, you have nothing because you decided to completely ignore the fact that the title says ""natural selection studies"" and not just ""natural selection."" I never claimed that there were no false positives. These are clinical studies. What is wrong with you? And I am not concerned with whether the giraffe's long neck is the result of sexual selection or not. That has no bearing on whether evolution is correct or incorrect. You have a hard time staying relevant, don't you? Irrelevant to evolution. You just wasted your time writing all of this. You are taking a few examples from clinical studies of bad test methods as they apply to medical diagnosis and blanketing it across all of science as if one example of poor reasoning casts doubt on all reasoning. I hope you are capable of realizing how dumb that is. As far as the type of evidence for evolution, look at it this way. In a crime investigation, labs use tire impressions to prove that a particular tire was at a particular place within a particular time interval. Happens all the time. Now, say you have one thousand beat up, worn tires, each with distinctive cuts, gravel in the tread, wear patterns, etc. In order to prove a theory, you need to prove that any combination of one or more tires was at a particular place at a particular time, etc etc. So you set out to prove that any one of the tires was there and to your amazement, you prove that ALL the tires were there. That's the kind of evidence that we have for evolution. Now, evolution is a simple theory that explains a LOT of things we see in biology. You are going to find lots of studies related to evolution. However, there are no studies in modern times that serve to confirm or refute that evolution occurs as the process of descent from a single organism through natural selection. The studies you are looking for don't exist or if they do, they failed and never got submitted.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","09:25 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","103"
"12-19-2012","21431",7,"Zosimus","467634","I find your argument quite confusing. You claim that low intelligence corresponds with low sexual selection. Nevertheless sexual selection is supposedly engrained in the genes and the instinct of an animal. If an animal prefers a specific mating scent, for example, supposedly those males that produce said scent will be favored in breeding regardless of intelligence or lack of same. The arguments you are making (or at least appear to be making) are those contained at Mate choice - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia which claim that R.A. Fischer in 1915 claimed runaway selection resulted in making things like long peacock tails. Yet I have already posted links refuting this claim. Later in the article we see that Bateman supposedly presented experimental evidence using Drosophila for supposed sexual selection, yet this study, when redone, was inconclusive and had methodological flaws. So kindly refer me to the study you are referring to and ensure that this study does not reference the now-refuted Bateman study. Next you claim that you are not using induction to support induction. But later you say ""Perhaps I get it from observed consistency in every conceivable objective analysis of reality."" So basically you are claiming that what you have seen so far is a valid sample of the universe as a whole - in a sense that you can use your past experiences to predict your future experiences. But how do you know that the past is a good guide to the future? Just because it worked in the past? Isn't that circular logic? Let's take this premise and run with it. Let's assume that my experiences are representative of the entire universe. I can, therefore, claim that the entire universe speaks Spanish. After all, my wife speaks Spanish, my friends speak Spanish, my students speak Spanish, the administrative staff here speaks Spanish. All the bus drivers and bus riders speak Spanish. Therefore the entire UNIVERSE speaks Spanish. Do you think this is a valid logical chain? No? Then why is your chain of reasoning more valid? Finally as for gene expression, YES, I am suggesting that gene expression is inherited as well as genes (see Inherited variation in gene expr... [Annu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. 2009] - PubMed - NCBI ) nor am I suggesting that gene expression is controlled by psychic impulses. Rather I am suggesting that things like diet can affect it (see Up-regulation of the tumor suppressor... [Anticancer Res. 1998 May-Jun] - PubMed - NCBI ) or exposure to sun (see Vitamin D found to influence over 200 genes, highlighting links to disease ). Quote: ""The vitamin D receptor is a protein activated by vitamin D, which attaches itself to DNA and thus influences what proteins are made from our genetic code"" (emphasis added).","Freedom","467713","Well here is where the terminology is causing some confusion. When I say sexual selection I mean what pandion means and not what is really natural from the term. I do not mean any trait selected for by the opposite gender or competing within the same gender. I mean specifically those traits which have no bearing on survival. As databed said this is counter-intuitive because obviously sexual selection is an attempt to predict the quality of genes with respect to objective values and any difference between the outcome of mate selection and survival should be chocked up to errors or inefficiency in evaluating the genes of potential mates. You're right it's not tied to intelligence alone and I shouldn't have implied that, but it is tied to an attempt to evaluate genes before mating; something I don't think organisms with the ecological niche like the fruit fly would do. Their lives are short and fast and there is little room for being picky. Higher intelligence does correlate to sexual selection however because more complex evaluations are possible and complex processes are more prone to error than simple ones. You posted a link which you purported failed to find any sexual selection. I pointed out why this does not refute the possibility of sexual selection. Well before he got banned you could have asked accipiter and he would have told you I don't use references. Not quite true, but I don't use them in place of arguments certainly. I don't need a study demonstrating sexual selection when I can derive it's existence from well established facts. Do reproductive ratios depend on who can find a mate and how often they reproduce? Yes. Do animals display selectivity in reproduction? Yes. Are animals infallible? No. Therefore at least some of the time reproductive ratios are affected by animals selecting useless traits in mates. It's an axiom which means it can appear to be circular logic, but it's an axiom so it's inescapable as well. We cannot think except by assuming the existence of truth. If it's true that the universe has mechanics than those mechanics govern the future just as surely as they have governed the past. Without mechanics no consistent phenomenon are possible, yet we observe consistent phenomenon. Therefore, even if we don't understand it at the time we can only assume there are mechanics relating all future events to the current state of things and the current state of things to the past state of things. because all I said is that spanish is not and cannot be non-spanish and that if you can identify that everyone you know is speaking spanish you could have done it five minutes ago and predicted they would still be speaking spanish if you understood the reasons people speak any language. Obviously it changes during an organisms lifetime, it could not operate any other way. However I still don't buy this could truly be considered heritable since it is a dynamic system.

"12-21-2012","21431",9,"Easyrider","467700","If you're questioning the deity (or pre-incarnation deity) of Jesus Christ, I have reams of scriptural evidences to support it. Let me know if you want to see them. Jesus is "" THE (divine) Angel of the Lord"" in the OT, where Angel means messenger. Jesus is the ""I AM"" in the Burning Bush account in Exodus. Evidences of this in the following link. Angel of the LORD Justin Martyr declared ""Our Christ conversed with Moses out of the bush, in the appearance of fire. And Moses received great strength from Christ, who spake to him in the appearance of fire."" Irenaeus wrote ""The Scripture is full of the Son of Gods appearing: sometimes to talk and eat with Abraham, at other times to instruct Noah about the measures of the ark; at another time to seek Adam; at another time to bring down judgment upon Sodom; then again, to direct Jacob in the way; and again, to converse with Moses out of the bush."" 2 is fine with me. God said in advance in Genesis that he was going to create man in the image and likeness of God, and that a knowledge of good and evil was one of the goals. So I'll ask you a question: How do you create man with free will (as opposed to a pre-programmed robot) and at the same time not have evil as one of the behaviors that man can choose to do?","Zosimus","467796","I think you have a very black-and-white view of the world. For example, imagine that I run into a homeless man. What are the choices I have in regards to this person? I can aid him, I can ignore him, I can kill him and rob him of what little he has collected from begging, and probably a horde of other choices (such as trying to aid him without giving him money, etc.). So to claim that people cannot make choices without giving them the option to do evil is not true. But to make sure we're on the same page, let me sum up your argument: God (aka Jesus) exists, has always existed, and always will exist. For countless eons this being was completely alone without even a universe existing for him to do anything with. While doing nothing but thinking and using his eyes to regard the vast emptiness around him, he suddenly decided to create the entire universe out of nothing complete with angels and humans. His primary motive in so doing was to have these newly created fans cluster around his freshly-created throne and adore him for all eternity. Unfortunately due to a personality quirk he decided that these things must have ""free will"" and so he created evil so that they could decide not to adore him for eternity but rather spend their time plundering, raping, and murdering one another. Then, because of another quirk of his personality, he would decide to save some of them (but not others) but felt that there should really be a price to pay for all of their ""sins"" against which he had established laws to compel them not to do things he had previously created for them to do. So he had a part of his personality be born to a virgin in Jerusalem for the express purpose of showing off to them that he could do it perfectly whereas the rest of them (who he had created) couldn't do it perfectly. Then he arranged for his other personality to be brutally slaughtered and to suffer a horrible, degrading death including abandoning it in the moment of its cruelest suffering causing it to exclaim, ""My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"" And meanwhile whenever God isn't amusing himself by having bets with Satan over whether or not Job will curse him if he lets Satan kill his entire family, steal his life's work, and torture him with diseases (that God created so that Satan could have something to torture people with) he is putting the final touches on a lake of endless fire that he plans to cast those people who he created with an evil streak into in order to enjoy watching them suffer for all eternity for not having chosen to cluster around his throne and sing praises to him for endless eons.

In a crime investigation, labs use tire impressions to prove that a particular tire was at a particular place within a particular time interval. Happens all the time. Now, say you have one thousand beat up, worn tires, each with distinctive cuts, gravel in the tread, wear patterns, etc. In order to prove a theory, you need to prove that any combination of one or more tires was at a particular place at a particular time, etc etc. So you set out to prove that any one of the tires was there and to your amazement, you prove that ALL the tires were there. That's the kind of evidence that we have for evolution. Now, evolution is a simple theory that explains a LOT of things we see in biology. You are going to find lots of studies related to evolution. However, there are no studies in modern times that serve to confirm or refute that evolution occurs as the process of descent from a single organism through natural selection. The studies you are looking for don't exist or if they do, they failed and never got submitted.","Zosimus","467797","I think you have a very bad view of 1) the purpose of this thread and 2) what science is and how it works. First of all, my argument is (and has always been) that you believe in evolution because you are atheist and for no other reason. You claim that there are mountains of evidence in support of evolution. Despite this, I have yet to see you post even one link. Are you certain that all of this evidence doesn't exist in your own mind and nowhere else? Second, let's examine science: What it is, what it aims to do, and how well it works. Science is a philosophy. Despite what many people have claimed, there is no specific scientific method. Science only stipulates that all information comes through the senses - they claim that the only way to know that swans are white, for example, is to go and look at a swan and to see it with your eyes. Now in the past science claimed that all swans were white because scientists had not seen swans of any other color. However, after many years they found black swans in Australia and they had egg on their faces. David Hume was among the people who had pointed out the logical defects in science. His observations are now known as the ""problem of induction."" How many white swans do you need to see before you know that all swans are white? There is no satisfactory answer to this question. Hume's proposed solution (abandoning logic) is science's true solution, but it doesn't have a nice ring to it so they just tried ignoring the problem. Karl Popper is the only one I know of who really seriously addressed the problem. He proposed ""falsificationism"" as the standard by which science should work. Since science can't prove anything true, science should stick to what it can do: proving things false. As such, he claimed, science should accept theories that are highly falsifiable in the sense that they make many testable predictions and then work to test them as rigorously as possible. Unfortunately for Popper, he criticized Darwinism heavily as being unfalsifiable (or nearly so). He was one of the most prominent people to claim that peacock's tails refuted Darwinism and when sexual selection was advanced as a solution to the problem he essentially said that with enough ad hoc hypotheses you can explain away any experimental finding at all. None of this sat well with those who needed evolution in order to have a coherent worldview. So they did what most empiricists do when they are in trouble: They turned to mathematics to help them out, ignoring the fact that mathematics isn't empiricial. So mathematics suggested statistics as a possible solution to science's shortcomings. Drawing from Bayes' theorm. That fine Presbyterian minister and avid pool player had suggested that you could determine if a line bisecting a pool table really was in the center by throwing billiard balls out on the table in such a way that they could land anywhere. He proposed starting by guessing that the line was in the center and adjusting based on probability. Frequentist statisticians were incensed at the idea of starting with a guess and those two camps have still never fully reconciled. To put it in layman's terms, imagine that you are running tests on, let's say, the speed of light. You have already tested it 4 times and you have come up with certain numbers. What are the chances that the next test will come out the same? Well, say statisticians, let's compare the test to fishing socks out of a sock drawer. Imagine we have 5 pairs of socks in a sock drawer and we fish them out one at a time. The first 4 times we have come up with a red pair - what are the chances that the last pair is another color? Well, figure the mathematicians, what we do is assume that the last pair is another color (red, for example), and calculate the chances that we would see the results we have seen. The chances will be the same (an assumption I consider dubious, but let's go with it for now). The chance of pulling out the first red pair is 4/5 or 80 percent. The chance of pulling out the second red pair is 3/4 so the chance of pulling out both is 3/5 (the 4s cancel). The chance of pulling out the third pair is 2/3 so now you are at 2/5 (the 3s cancel) and the chance of pulling out the last pair is 1/2 so now you are at 1/5 (the 2s cancel). So statisticians will now argue that there is an 80 percent chance that the next result (usually called the n+1) will be the same as those previously found. So we can say that we are 80 percent certain that the speed of light will be the same the next time we test it. Of course this doesn't fully solve the problem, does it? I mean if we test the half-life of uranium 100 times and we find it consistent we can say that the chances of the half-life changing on the 101st time is only 1 percent, right? Assuming we agree with the assumptions (I personally don't) will that enable us to say that the half-life will stay the same for the next 4.5 billion years? Or that it was the same for 4.5 billion years in the past? Work out the math on that and you'll find it not particularly impressive. Imagine that you have a sock drawer with 4.5 billion socks in it and the first 100 you pull out are red. Does that guarantee that ALL the socks in the drawer are red? Hardly. So science now uses the believed-magical 95 percent statistical confidence level to work these problems out. Why 95 percent? Why not 94 percent or 96 percent? Well, really there's no reason: It's just an arbitrary number that exists to permit science to announce victory with nothing much backing it up. Of course there are various problems with this method. The first one I have already pointed out - it doesn't work. The 95 percent statistical confidence level results in 80 percent of published research findings being false and later refuted. This would be embarrassing to me, but science doesn't care as they have politicians and the press in its pocket. The second problem is a more theoretical one: Bayes insisted that the ball should go out onto the pool table in such a way that [b]it could land anywhere[b] but obviously science can't take samples of, for example, the half-life of uranium in such a way that we might randomly get the results for the half-life of uranium as it was 2 billion years ago in the same way that socks pulled out of a sock drawer could come out in any order they wanted - willy nilly. Science attempts to solve these problems by putting 5 or 10 percent on something based on statistical assumptions. I'm still not impressed. Finally your tire sample metaphor is really flawed and shows that not only do you not understand science, nor Darwinism, you don't even understand forensics (which is another seriously flawed scientific endeavor). Let's look at fingerprints, for example. Science assures us that no two people have the same fingerprints and that science can easily identify if you were at the scene of a crime by getting your fingerprints and matching it with fingerprints at the scene of the crime. How does this work? First of all, you should know that there are as many as 150 ridge characteristics in your fingerprint. Fingerprint experts examine the fingerprint against your fingerprint in order to obtain a match. Assuming that science is right, 150 points of match would be very, very good, wouldn't it? Sure. But experts rarely find that many matches. In fact, there is no established standard on how many points of coincidence there should be. At one time Scotland had a requirement that a print should show at least 16 matching points (see BBC NEWS | UK | Scotland | Court fingerprint system scrapped ) but that's been scrapped and the US doesn't require that anyway. Experts often claim a match on as little as 6 coinciding points. So what are the numbers? How many people in a city the size of Los Angeles (4 million plus) are there that would have fingerprints with as much as 6 matches with yours? Or seven, ten, or any other number you can pull out. What are the odds? The answer is simple: No one knows because no studies have ever been done. Nevertheless experts will go on the stand and say that they are certain the fingerprints belong to the accused and then the guy goes to jail. So don't come to me saying that some expert can ""prove"" that the fingerprints belong to you or the tire tracks or whatever. That's the kind of stuff you see on TV for entertainment rather than in the real world. Fingerprints, tire track matching, and other supposed forensic methods have never been exposed to the kind of scrutiny that DNA had to undergo (see Faulty Fingerprints ). ""Since 1995, Collaborative Testing Services, a company that evaluates the reliability and performance of fingerprint labs, has administered an annual and voluntary test. It sends fingerprint labs a test that includes eight to twelve pairs of prints that examiners confirm or reject as matches. The pairs usually consist of complete, not partial prints, making identifications easier than the real situations examiners face. Nevertheless the error rate has varied from 3% to a dismal 20%."" ------------------------ Isn't that sad? Even under idealized situations forensic science finds it very hard to reach what I would call a ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" scenario. Fortunately for the US justice system people who know these things are usually excluded from jury pools. Otherwise the US would be hard pressed to have the highest per capita incarceration rate in the world. P.S. I reiterate my request that you post some kind of links to back up your claim that the evidence for evolution is like finding all the tire tracks in the world at the scene of the crime.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","12:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","129"

"12-21-2012","21431",9,"Zosimus","467796","I think you have a very black-and-white view of the world. For example, imagine that I run into a homeless man. What are the choices I have in regards to this person? I can aid him, I can ignore him, I can kill him and rob him of what little he has collected from begging, and probably a horde of other choices (such as trying to aid him without giving him money, etc.). So to claim that people cannot make choices without giving them the option to do evil is not true. But to make sure we're on the same page, let me sum up your argument: God (aka Jesus) exists, has always existed, and always will exist. For countless eons this being was completely alone without even a universe existing for him to do anything with. While doing nothing but thinking and using his eyes to regard the vast emptiness around him... ... he suddenly decided to create the entire universe out of nothing complete with angels and humans. His primary motive in so doing was to have these newly created fans cluster around his freshly-created throne and adore him for all eternity. Unfortunately due to a personality quirk he decided that these things must have ""free will"" and so he created evil so that they could decide not to adore him for eternity but rather spend their time plundering, raping, and murdering one another. Then, because of another quirk of his personality, he would decide to save some of them (but not others) but felt that there should really be a price to pay for all of their ""sins"" against which he had established laws to compel them not to do things he had previously created for them to do. So he had a part of his personality be born to a virgin in Jerusalem for the express purpose of showing off to them that he could do it perfectly whereas the rest of them (who he had created) couldn't do it perfectly. Then he arranged for his other personality to be brutally slaughtered and to suffer a horrible, degrading death including abandoning it in the moment of its cruelest suffering causing it to exclaim, ""My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"" And meanwhile whenever God isn't amusing himself by having bets with Satan over whether or not Job will curse him if he lets Satan kill his entire family, steal his life's work, and torture him with diseases (that God created so that Satan could have something to torture people with) he is putting the final touches on a lake of endless fire that he plans to cast those people who he created with an evil streak into in order to enjoy watching them suffer for all eternity for not having chosen to cluster around his throne and sing praises to him for endless eons.

No one who actually accepts Jesus as their Lord and Savior argues that they, and they alone have the right to decide who is going to Hell. Just as Archangel never worshiped Christ, you never worshiped him either. You bow to your interpretation of the Bible. Not what Christ said, but what you believe to be key. Hinduism. Buddhism. Shinto. Zoroastrianism. Yezdism. I can keep going on naming religions and their respective Gods all day. Nothing you can do can prove that either they don't exist/aren't true and that yours is. Pascal's wager is so fundamentally retarded that only the mentally incompetent would actually use it. Your religion is based on faith. Just as theirs are. You have no actual evidence that your God actually exists (if you did, you wouldn't need faith as your God would be a fact). There is nothing saying that other Gods don't exist and they can't punish you. You are in the exact same boat as the very people you condemn in the name of your perverted interpretation of the Bible. Besides, Christianity hasn't made any predictive prophecies either that actually came true. Your threats are no more scary then people warning me that if I reject Odin, he'll punish me. Prove to me Odin doesn't exist. You can't. Look, right now you are falling back on idle threats of damnation. That's all you have left. Thanks for proving my point you psychopath.

"12-26-2012","21431",12,"Freedom","467713","Well here is where the terminology is causing some confusion. When I say sexual selection I mean what pandion means and not what is really natural from the term. I do not mean any trait selected for by the opposite gender or competing within the same gender. I mean specifically those traits which have no bearing on survival. As databed said this is counter-intuitive because obviously sexual selection is an attempt to predict the quality of genes with respect to objective values and any difference between the outcome of mate selection and survival should be chocked up to errors or inefficiency in evaluating the genes of potential mates. You're right it's not tied to intelligence alone and I shouldn't have implied that, but it is tied to an attempt to evaluate genes before mating; something I don't think organisms with the ecological niche like the fruit fly would do. Their lives are short and fast and there is little room for being picky. Higher intelligence does correlate to sexual selection however because more complex evaluations are possible and complex processes are more prone to error than simple ones. You posted a link which you purported failed to find any sexual selection. I pointed out why this does not refute the possibility of sexual selection. Well before he got banned you could have asked accipiter and he would have told you I don't use references. Not quite true, but I don't use them in place of arguments certainly. I don't need a study demonstrating sexual selection when I can derive it's existence from well established facts. Do reproductive ratios depend on who can find a mate and how often they reproduce? Yes. Do animals display selectivity in reproduction? Yes. Are animals infallible? No. Therefore at least some of the time reproductive ratios are affected by animals selecting useless traits in mates. It's an axiom which means it can appear to be circular logic, but it's an axiom so it's inescapable as well. We cannot think except by assuming the existence of truth. If it's true that the universe has mechanics than those mechanics govern the future just as surely as they have governed the past. Without mechanics no consistent phenomenon are possible, yet we observe consistent phenomenon. Therefore, even if we don't understand it at the time we can only assume there are mechanics relating all future events to the current state of things and the current state of things to the past state of things. because all I said is that spanish is not and cannot be non-spanish and that if you can identify that everyone you know is speaking spanish you could have done it five minutes ago and predicted they would still be speaking spanish if you understood the reasons people speak any language. Obviously it changes during an organisms lifetime, it could not operate any other way. However I still don't buy this could truly be considered heritable since it is a dynamic system. It would be more accurate to say the parent and child have the same ability to adapt to vitamin D dosages.","Zosimus","467942","In your post you said, ""I pointed out why this does not refute the possibility of sexual selection...."" I think, however, that you are on the wrong track. We are not here to argue whether or not sexual selection is possible but whether sexual selection is a justified true belief. Now merely saying that A is possible does not mean that A is known to have occurred. You can only claim to know A if the following conditions are met: 1) A is true 2) You believe A 3) You have good reason to believe A 4) Your belief in A is not coincidental and 5) You would believe not A if there were good reason to do so. My goal here is not to disprove Darwinism but rather to raise enough doubt to point out that most believers in evolution are lacking point 5: They would not disbelieve evolution regardless the evidence found. You said, ""I don't need a study demonstrating sexual selection when I can derive it's existence from well established facts. Do reproductive ratios depend on who can find a mate and how often they reproduce? Yes. Do animals display selectivity in reproduction? Yes. Are animals infallible? No. Therefore at least some of the time reproductive ratios are affected by animals selecting useless traits in mates."" This is proof of nothing. I could easily find a dozen Christians who could construct a similar justification for God. Romans 1:20 jumps immediately to mind and I'm sure there are enough thumpers around here to aid me should I need to make that point. You said, ""If it's true that the universe has mechanics than those mechanics govern the future just as surely as they have governed the past. Without mechanics no consistent phenomenon are possible, yet we observe consistent phenomenon."" Yet this argument doesn't stand up to Platinga's argument that science is incompatible with evolution. If we suppose that our bodies and brains evolved in such a way as to recognize patterns of danger and to respond accordingly (under the theory that running from imaginary danger is better than not running from real danger) then why do we think ourselves truly capable of recognizing real patterns (as opposed to just seeing patterns in everything, although they don't really exist)? Why should an evolutionist believe that humans are capable of understanding the universe? Platinga claims that only the belief that one is formed in the image of God makes one capable of arguing that a human can comprehend the universe. Finally, I don't think you understand the Spanish-speaking argument. I can easily go out of my house and find a host of Spanish-speaking people. In fact, I would be hard pressed to find people who don't speak Spanish. In reality, however, this is because I live in Peru and not because the universe speaks Spanish exclusively. My entire sample base is chosen from people around me. There is no chance that I will stumble across a person in Constantinople or Beijing because I am only drawing samples from my own location (and time period). For me to claim that everyone in the universe speaks Spanish (and it has always been that way) is known to be wrong. A thousand years ago no one here spoke Spanish at all - Spanish didn't arrive until the Spanish conquistadores forced it down our throats. The same argument could be applied against almost anything science claims. How do we know that gravity works the same in distant universes as it works here? As a point in fact, we can pretty much see that there are problems with the theory of gravitation in that galaxies don't rotate the right way according to the theory of gravity (unless, of course, you postulate that undetectable ""dark"" matter can be sprinkled wherever you please to make the numbers work out). Our entire experience with gravity is drawn almost exclusively from the solar system we live in and the planet where we live and work.

Get real and stop trying to sell that garbage in here. http://www.4forums.com/political/cre...d-ape-dna.html","Zosimus","467945","Well, Databed, if you don't like philosophical arguments then you picked the wrong user to argue with because that's my entire argument in a nutshell: Science is philosophically flawed, evolution with it, and this explains why 80 percent of published studies are wrong. Popperian falsification is far superior to Bayesian statistics and it can be proved that most claimed research findings are false. The high rate of nonreplication (lack of confirmation) of research discoveries is a consequence of the convenient, yet ill-founded strategy of claiming conclusive research findings solely on the basis of a single study assessed by formal statistical significance, typically for a p-value less than 0.05. However, it appears you'd rather talk about ERVs and nested hierarchies. Specifically you have theory (E) that predicts findings (F). When you locate said findings you think the theory has been confirmed. Really, however, the only thing you have done is engaged in a classic logical fallacy - to wit: E=>F, F, therefore E. This is a classic example of the ""affirming the consequent"" fallacy. Well, let's pretend that your theory is scientific and think for a few moments on what things might be found that might disprove your theory. Imagine, for example, that we found an ERV in humans and another ape (not chimpanzee) that were very similar. Yet when we checked in chimps they did not have the same ERV. If that were found, we would easily be able to seriously question the theory that similar ERVs are the result of sharing a common ancestor. Can such a thing be found? Certainly - all we have to do is to go to Spread Of Endogenous Retrovirus K Is Similar In The DNA Of Humans And Rhesus Monkeys where we find that humans and rhesus monkeys share a very similar ERV that cannot be found in chimpanzees. As you can read in the article, Rhesus monkeys supposedly seperated from chimpanzees some 25 million years ago and chimps and humans supposedly seperated some 5-7 million years ago. Yet this finding throws a spanner in the works. Why don't chimps have the same ERV that we share with rhesus monkeys? Well, of course, Darwinism is never to be foiled. Suddenly we'll find that we're not descended from chimps at all, but rather we are descended from rhesus monkeys. Or there will be two theories claiming to be Darwin's true path - both refuting each other, but united in insisting that evolution is unquestionably correct. Darwinism will never be seriously questioned because it's not a scientific theory - it's an article of faith for true believers (like you). All this finding shows to me is what I've already said - evolution relies on constant ad hoc hypotheses to avoid falsification and therefore cannot lay claim to being an evidence-based theory of life. It is, rather, an a priori philosophical bias in the minds of atheists who reject the possibility of a designer in knee-jerk fashion.

How could you possibly convince me that the earth is older than 6,000 years of age? Radioactive dating is usually the argument employed. Half life of uranium, blah, blah, extrapolate... 4.5 billion years (give or take). Yet this argument presupposes that uranium has been radioactive for 4.5 billion years and that the rate of decay has been constant.

How you get through the world without killing yourself in the process is truly amazing. You really have zero concept of logic, don't you? Below I will prove that the square root of 2 is an irrational number. Well, actually, I will cut and paste a proof that the square root of 2 is an irrational number. Here's how the proof works. First we start by assuming that the square root of 2 is rational and then we prove that this leads to inescapable contradictions. Then we realize that our initial assumption was false. The proof that square root of 2 is irrational: Let's suppose 2 were a rational number. Then we can write it 2 = a/b where a,b are whole numbers, b not zero. We additionally assume that this a/b is simplified to the lowest terms, since that can obviously be done with any fraction. Notice that in order for a/b to be in its simplest terms, both a andb must be not be even. One or both must be odd. Otherwise, you could simplify. From the equality 2 = a/b it follows that 2 = a 2 /b 2 , or a 2 = 2 * b 2 . So the square of a is an even number since it is two times something. From this we can know that a itself is also an even number. Why? Because it can't be odd; if a itself was odd, then a * a would be odd too. Odd number times odd number is always odd. Check if you don't believe that! Okay, if a itself is an even number, then a is 2 times some other whole number, or a = 2k where k is this other number. We don't need to know exactly what k is; it won't matter. Soon is coming the contradiction: If we substitute a = 2k into the original equation 2 = a 2 /b 2 , this is what we get: 2 = (2k) 2 /b 2 2 = 4k 2 /b 2 2*b 2 = 4k 2 b 2 = 2k 2 . This means b 2 is even, from which follows again that b itself is an even number!!! WHY is that a contradiction? Because we started the whole process saying that a/b is simplified to the lowest terms, and now it turns out that a and b would both be even. So 2 cannot be rational. ----------------------------------------------- The above is a simple proof found in basically any college textbook that shows how to prove something using contradiction. Just because you didn't go to college (or partied your way through it) is no excuse for not knowing this. There is no way to prove that the square root of 2 is irrational by starting with the assumption that it is irrational. Attempting to do so only results in you using circular logic.

The Cohen line is patrilineal -- passed from father to son without interruption for 3,300 years, or more than 100 generations. Dr. Skorecki considered a hypothesis: if the Cohanim are descendants of one man, they should have a common set of genetic markers -- a common haplotype -- that of their common ancestor. In our case, Aaron HaCohen. A study was undertaken to test the hypothesis. If there were a common ancestor, the Cohanim should have common genetic markers at a higher frequency than the general Jewish population. In the first study, as reported in the prestigious British science journal, Nature (January 2, 1997), 188 Jewish males were asked to contribute some cheek cells from which their DNA was extracted for study. Participants from Israel, England and North America were asked to identify whether they were a Cohen, Levi or Israelite, and to identify their family background. The results of the analysis of the Y chromosome markers of the Cohanim and non-Cohanim were indeed significant. A particular marker, (YAP-) was detected in 98.5 percent of the Cohanim, and in a significantly lower percentage of non-Cohanim.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","07:48 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","187"

"12-27-2012","21431",13,"Zosimus","467945","Well, Databed, if you don't like philosophical arguments then you picked the wrong user to argue with because that's my entire argument in a nutshell: Science is philosophically flawed, evolution with it, and this explains why 80 percent of published studies are wrong. Popperian falsification is far superior to Bayesian statistics and it can be proved that most claimed research findings are false. The high rate of nonreplication (lack of confirmation) of research discoveries is a consequence of the convenient, yet ill-founded strategy of claiming conclusive research findings solely on the basis of a single study assessed by formal statistical significance, typically for a p-value less than 0.05. However, it appears you'd rather talk about ERVs and nested hierarchies. Specifically you have theory (E) that predicts findings (F). When you locate said findings you think the theory has been confirmed. Really, however, the only thing you have done is engaged in a classic logical fallacy - to wit: E=>F, F, therefore E. This is a classic example of the ""affirming the consequent"" fallacy. Well, let's pretend that your theory is scientific and think for a few moments on what things might be found that might disprove your theory. Imagine, for example, that we found an ERV in humans and another ape (not chimpanzee) that were very similar. Yet when we checked in chimps they did not have the same ERV. If that were found, we would easily be able to seriously question the theory that similar ERVs are the result of sharing a common ancestor. Can such a thing be found? Certainly - all we have to do is to go to Spread Of Endogenous Retrovirus K Is Similar In The DNA Of Humans And Rhesus Monkeys where we find that humans and rhesus monkeys share a very similar ERV that cannot be found in chimpanzees. As you can read in the article, Rhesus monkeys supposedly seperated from chimpanzees some 25 million years ago and chimps and humans supposedly seperated some 5-7 million years ago. Yet this finding throws a spanner in the works. Why don't chimps have the same ERV that we share with rhesus monkeys? Well, of course, Darwinism is never to be foiled. Suddenly we'll find that we're not descended from chimps at all, but rather we are descended from rhesus monkeys. Or there will be two theories claiming to be Darwin's true path - both refuting each other, but united in insisting that evolution is unquestionably correct. Darwinism will never be seriously questioned because it's not a scientific theory - it's an article of faith for true believers (like you). All this finding shows to me is what I've already said - evolution relies on constant ad hoc hypotheses to avoid falsification and therefore cannot lay claim to being an evidence-based theory of life. It is, rather, an a priori philosophical bias in the minds of atheists who reject the possibility of a designer in knee-jerk fashion. Cheers.","Databed","468002","So, are you asserting that 80% of our scientific knowledge is wrong? You are an idiot. There is no research into whether or not evolution occurs. This is why you found no false positives in which the said positive was confirming evolution. Stop talking about stupid p-value and statistics. Like I said earlier when you attacked my knowledge of forensics, this is not the same kind of evidence we use to verify evolution. Stop your irrelevant, dimwitted attempt at being profound - as if you are blowing our minds here. Minds...not blown, or if they are, only by your total lack of any ability to understand anything that wasn't concocted in your own stupid brain. I believe Freedom already addressed this. You are misusing your 100 level logic terms again. Why would we do that, you think 80% of science is completely false. No, you would either come to the conclusion that the two species either didn't share a common ancestor after the insertion event or that the genome had been purged of the insertion. I though you understood this... Again, there is no wrong conclusion in the paper - the bias is in the reader. Their conclusion is that the retroviral insertion has been partially purged from one species. What's more, there are STILL remnants of that insertion within the genome of all three species. You read one tiny article on the subject and this makes you an expert? You really need to do more research before you come in here and make yourself look stupid. They do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

What you are thinking of is a conditional statement. /If sqrt(2) is rational then it can be expressed as a/b (with said conditions) /It cannot be expressed as a/b //Therefore it is not rational The conditional can work in the other way just as easily. /If and only if sqrt(2) is irrational can it be impossible to express as a/b (wc)(we get to say this because that the definition of rational is that you can write a fraction of whole numbers) /It cannot be expressed as a/b //Therefore it is irrational Where's the assumption of rationality?

Yet it took me less than a minute to write a simple computer program that calculates rational numbers that might be the square root of 2. For example the program suggested that 1368369/967583 might very well work. Well if you calculate it out carefully you find that it's pretty close but not exactly the square root of 2. So what should we do? Should we let one program run constantly finding new possibilities while another program runs discarding them in the hopes that one day we will eventually find the rational number that is the exact square root of 2? No - there's no need. Why? Because there exists a logical proof (which I have already posted) that demonstrates that it will never be possible to find a rational number that is the square root of 2. How did that proof start? Well, it started by positing that the square root of 2 was a rational number and going from that to find contradictions. You cannot merely say that the square root of 2 is an irrational number by simply asserting that it is so.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","12:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","215"
"01-02-2013","21431",15,"Easyrider","467980","The fascinating story of how DNA studies confirm an ancient Biblical tradition The Cohanim - DNA Connection From the article: Jewish tradition, based on the Torah, is that all Cohanim are direct descendants of Aaron, the brother of Moses. The Cohen line is patrilineal -- passed from father to son without interruption for 3,300 years, or more than 100 generations. Dr. Skorecki considered a hypothesis: if the Cohanim are descendants of one man, they should have a common set of genetic markers -- a common haplotype -- that of their common ancestor. In our case, Aaron HaCohen. A study was undertaken to test the hypothesis. If there were a common ancestor, the Cohanim should have common genetic markers at a higher frequency than the general Jewish population. In the first study, as reported in the prestigious British science journal, Nature (January 2, 1997), 188 Jewish males were asked to contribute some cheek cells from which their DNA was extracted for study. Participants from Israel, England and North America were asked to identify whether they were a Cohen, Levi or Israelite, and to identify their family background. The results of the analysis of the Y chromosome markers of the Cohanim and non-Cohanim were indeed significant. A particular marker, (YAP-) was detected in 98.5 percent of the Cohanim, and in a significantly lower percentage of non-Cohanim.","Zosimus","468157","The article is absurd as well as your conclusions. The article claims that this special YAP- marker which has been preserved for some 3300 years. This marker is not found in Levites. Yet Aaron was the great-grandson of Levi. As such he received his Y chromosome from Levi the same as all other Levites. Why should we believe that Aaron's offspring were able to keep it intact for 3300 years but Levi couldn't keep it for a paltry 3 generations. Later we read that they find a CMH marker that correctly identified 97 of 106 Cohens tested. That's about 91.5 percent - yet real studies are based on reaching a 95 statistical confidence level. The CMH test is 3.5 percent short. Later we read that the test works on ""over 80 percent"" of self-identified Cohens. This is, again, well short of the 95 percent level. Then the doctor claims: ""For more than 90 percent of the Cohens to share the same genetic markers after such a period of time is a testament to the devotion of the wives of the Cohens over the years. Even a low rate of infidelity would have dramatically lowered the percentage."" Again, this is not true. It's entirely possible that women who married Cohens cheated a lot, but merely got it on with their husband's brother or cousin who had the same Y chromosome.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","12:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","216"
"01-02-2013","21431",15,"Databed","468002","So, are you asserting that 80% of our scientific knowledge is wrong? You are an idiot. There is no research into whether or not evolution occurs.

No, I am not claiming that scientific knowledge is 80 percent wrong; rather that is the conclusion of several studies. For example at Lies, Damned Lies, and Medical Science - David H. Freedman - The Atlantic we find, ""80 percent of non-randomized studies (by far the most common type)...were later convincingly refuted."" At Cancer industry total fraud exposed: Nearly all 'scientific' studies fail to be replicated we read that 47 of 53 studies could not be replicated. That's more than 88 percent wrong. Now I know what you want to say - you want to say that this is just concentrated in the medical industry. Are you really that naive? I say again: It can be proved that the majority of published research findings are false. This is a direct quote from PLOS Medicine: Why Most Published Research Findings Are False So don't shoot the messenger. Learn to live with the truth, instead. Now back to Spread Of Endogenous Retrovirus K Is Similar In The DNA Of Humans And Rhesus Monkeys wherein we read: ""...a surprising pattern was observed."" Now since you seem to be too much of a simpleton to understand clear English let me explain it to you: When something found is surprising that means that it was not previously predicted by theories. If it had been predicted, then the findings would not have been surprising. Now the researchers say, ""The data suggested that the humans and rhesus have been purging ERV-K copies from their genomes..."" This is speculation. The only way to know that humans have been purging ERV-K copies from their genomes is to get DNA from humans some 5,000 years ago and compare it to DNA from humans today. Needless to say 5,000 year old DNA is not something you can just pick up at WalMart. Instead we are seeing conclusions drawn from a questionable premise: That humans, chimps, and rheuses monkeys share a common ancestor. These surprising findings do not support that conclusion. That's when ad hoc hypothesizing comes into play. This is why Imre Lakatos said, ""...nobody to date has yet found a demarcation criterion according to which Darwin can be described as scientific."" One final note: You said, ""...this is not the same kind of evidence we use to verify evolution."" This sentence smacks of Verificationism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia the refuted logical positivist philosophy that claimed that statements are only legitimate if they can be verified to be either true or false (empirically). However, as almost everyone has pointed out, the statement that unverifiable statements are illegitimate is itself unverifiable (and therefore illegitimate according to its own reasoning).","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","12:43 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","217"
"01-02-2013","21431",15,"None","None","None","Zosimus","468161","The Truth Wears Off In 1991, the Danish zoologist Anders Mller, at Uppsala University, in Sweden, made a remarkable discovery about sex, barn swallows, and symmetry. It had long been known that the asymmetrical appearance of a creature was directly linked to the amount of mutation in its genome, so that more mutations led to more fluctuating asymmetry. (An easy way to measure asymmetry in humans is to compare the length of the fingers on each hand.) What Mller discovered is that female barn swallows were far more likely to mate with male birds that had long, symmetrical feathers. This suggested that the picky females were using symmetry as a proxy for the quality of male genes. Mllers paper, which was published in Nature, set off a frenzy of research. Here was an easily measured, widely applicable indicator of genetic quality, and females could be shown to gravitate toward it. Aesthetics was really about genetics. In the three years following, there were ten independent tests of the role of fluctuating asymmetry in sexual selection, and nine of them found a relationship between symmetry and male reproductive success. It didnt matter if scientists were looking at the hairs on fruit flies or replicating the swallow studiesfemales seemed to prefer males with mirrored halves. Before long, the theory was applied to humans. Researchers found, for instance, that women preferred the smell of symmetrical men, but only during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle. Other studies claimed that females had more orgasms when their partners were symmetrical, while a paper by anthropologists at Rutgers analyzed forty Jamaican dance routines and discovered that symmetrical men were consistently rated as better dancers. Then the theory started to fall apart. In 1994, there were fourteen published tests of symmetry and sexual selection, and only eight found a correlation. In 1995, there were eight papers on the subject, and only four got a positive result. By 1998, when there were twelve additional investigations of fluctuating asymmetry, only a third of them confirmed the theory. Worse still, even the studies that yielded some positive result showed a steadily declining effect size. Between 1992 and 1997, the average effect size shrank by eighty per cent. And its not just fluctuating asymmetry. In 2001, Michael Jennions, a biologist at the Australian National University, set out to analyze temporal trends across a wide range of subjects in ecology and evolutionary biology. He looked at hundreds of papers and forty-four meta-analyses (that is, statistical syntheses of related studies), and discovered a consistent decline effect over time, as many of the theories seemed to fade into irrelevance. In fact, even when numerous variables were controlled forJennions knew, for instance, that the same author might publish several critical papers, which could distort his analysisthere was still a significant decrease in the validity of the hypothesis, often within a year of publication. Jennions admits that his findings are troubling, but expresses a reluctance to talk about them publicly. This is a very sensitive issue for scientists, he says. You know, were supposed to be dealing with hard facts, the stuff thats supposed to stand the test of time. But when you see these trends you become a little more skeptical of things. What happened? Leigh Simmons, a biologist at the University of Western Australia, suggested one explanation when he told me about his initial enthusiasm for the theory: I was really excited by fluctuating asymmetry. The early studies made the effect look very robust. He decided to conduct a few experiments of his own, investigating symmetry in male horned beetles. Unfortunately, I couldnt find the effect, he said. But the worst part was that when I submitted these null results I had difficulty getting them published. The journals only wanted confirming data. It was too exciting an idea to disprove, at least back then. For Simmons, the steep rise and slow fall of fluctuating asymmetry is a clear example of a scientific paradigm, one of those intellectual fads that both guide and constrain research: after a new paradigm is proposed, the peer-review process is tilted toward positive results. But then, after a few years, the academic incentives shiftthe paradigm has become entrenchedso that the most notable results are now those that disprove the theory. Jennions, similarly, argues that the decline effect is largely a product of publication bias, or the tendency of scientists and scientific journals to prefer positive data over null results, which is what happens when no effect is found. The bias was first identified by the statistician Theodore Sterling, in 1959, after he noticed that ninety-seven per cent of all published psychological studies with statistically significant data found the effect they were looking for. A significant result is defined as any data point that would be produced by chance less than five per cent of the time. This ubiquitous test was invented in 1922 by the English mathematician Ronald Fisher, who picked five per cent as the boundary line, somewhat arbitrarily, because it made pencil and slide-rule calculations easier. Sterling saw that if ninety-seven per cent of psychology studies were proving their hypotheses, either psychologists were extraordinarily lucky or they published only the outcomes of successful experiments. In recent years, publication bias has mostly been seen as a problem for clinical trials, since pharmaceutical companies are less interested in publishing results that arent favorable. But its becoming increasingly clear that publication bias also produces major distortions in fields without large corporate incentives, such as psychology and ecology.

As for copying, do you have any evidence of significant errors in the manuscripts? Strongs 3117 yowm (yom) (day) d. days, lifetime (pl.) e. time, period (general) Yowm - Old Testament Hebrew Lexicon - New American Standard In my personal Strongs Concordance, on page 48 of the definitions, it also has or fig. (figuratively) a space of time defined by an associated term (and context). You apparently didn't dig deeper into context, etc. For instance, on the third ""day,"" God formed the land out of the seas. There is no time frame given for the formation of the land and seas. Some time after the land was formed, God created the plants: Then God said, ""Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with seed in them, on the earth""; and it was so. (Genesis 1:11) And the earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with seed in them, after their kind; and God saw that it was good. (Genesis 1:12) The text clearly states that the earth ""sprouted"" the plants (the Hebrew word deshe, Strong's #H1877, usually refers to grasses). The Hebrew word dasha, (Strong's #H1876) indicates that the plants grew from either seeds or small seedlings in order to have ""sprouted."" In addition, these plants produced seeds. The Hebrew word here is zera (Strong's #H2233), which is most often translated ""descendants."" This makes matters very difficult for the 24-hour interpretation. Not only do the plants sprout and grow to maturity, but produce seed or descendants. There are no plants capable of doing this within a 24-hour period of time. Things actually get worse for this interpretation. Genesis 1:12 clearly states that God allowed the earth to bring forth trees that bore fruit. The process by which the earth brings forth trees to the point of bearing fruit takes several years, at minimum. God did not create the trees already bearing fruit. The text states clearly that He allowed the earth to accomplish the process of fruit bearing through natural means. Because the process of the third day requires a minimum period of time of more than 24 hours, the Genesis text for the third day clearly falsifies the interpretation that the days of Genesis one are 24-hour periods of time. Genesis Clearly Teaches that the Days Were NOT 24 Hours But wait, it gets even worse for you in thinking the Genesis account stipulates 24 hour days. Genesis 2:4 literally reads, ""in the day (yom) of the Lord God making (made) the earth and heavens."" Right away, Moses, the author of Genesis, who also wrote of the 'days' of creation, describes those 'days' as one day, or one time period. It's the same Hebrew word. The implication is clear - Moses' day (yom) in Genesis 2:4 refers not to a 24-hour day but, rather, to a much longer period of timein this case, the entire span of creation events. I call it the preponderance of the evidence. What did you expect, a tape recording from the first century? Did Jesus Claim to be God? Did Jesus Christ Claim to Be God? - Hank Hanegraaff - Is Jesus Christ God? The Catholic Church didn't form until much, much later.

Second, although it is true that John Ioannidis' opinion is not truth, per se, the fact that he prepared a mathematical proof that the majority of research findings are false should make things simple for you. If you wish to destroy his proof all you need is a little mathematical ability - I encourage you to have at it and post your mathematical counter-proof right here. You might want to start at ""ASSESSING THE UNRELIABILITY OF THE MEDICAL LITERATURE: A RESPONSE TO "" by Steven Goodman and Sander Greenland to get you off on the right foot, but be aware that this critique has been counter-critiqued at Why Most Published Research Findings Are False: Author's Reply to Goodman and Greenland Personally I'd welcome a real debate here. I could have sworn this was a debate forum but real debate seems to be lacking. Now, finally, for ERV-K copies. First of all in the study one supposes that the ERV-K was partially found by the team doing the study. As I've already pointed out, the vast majority of research findings are false with non-replication rates between 67-88 percent. As such, I doubt that this study in question supposedly finding partially-purged ERV-K copies could be replicated. Additionally I cite the follow-up post I made about replicated studies also eventually being impossible to demonstrate despite concerted effort. Another point to note would be this: Even if this study had found exact ERV-K copies in chimps, this would mean nothing at all because confirmations do not strengthen a hypothesis. Perhaps you doubt this. To illustrate the point, let's turn to Hempel's Paradox. Imagine that we have two men living on the same island who are in disagreement about the color of ravens. The first man insists that all ravens are black, whereas the second man is equally insistent that he once owned a white raven, has seen a white raven on the island so at least some ravens are white. They have come to me for help in proving that all ravens are black (or white) as they cannot leave the island. As I have never seen a raven, I merely collect all the birds I can find and bring them back to the island. I have green parrots, gray pigeons, white doves, brown sparrows, etc., in copious quantities. After seeing the evidence Man 1 argues as follows: All ravens are black is the same as saying that all non-black things are not ravens. Here we have a large number of non-black things, none of which are ravens. Accordingly my hypothesis has been confirmed not once but several times. You will also note, he argues, that we have some white birds. Any one of those could have been a raven, but none of them are. Accordingly your claim that some ravens are white has been badly damaged by all of this evidence. Naturally Man 2 disagrees saying that all of the evidence collected has no bearing on whether or not ravens are black, white, or any other color. Who do you agree with, and why? Be specific. Personally I feel (regarding ERV-K copies) that any finding that is not predicted is harmful to the theory and any finding that is predicted is merely neutral to the theory in question. Now perhaps you and other people think that statistics holds the key to resolving these problems in the philosophy of science. I am skeptical about that, as well. As Popper noted, if we imagine a hypothesis (H) and Evidence (E). Part of this hypothesis may be deductively entailed from the evidence. To cater for this possibility we break H into A and B and E into B and C. In this way the B part of the evidence supports the B part of the hypothesis. A, B, and C are probabilistically independent. Accordingly the probability of (A and B) is equal to the P(A) times the P(B). Now in order for us to say that the hypothesis is confirmed by the evidence we must say that the probability of the hypothesis (given the evidence) i.e. P(H|E) is greater than P(H) on its own. Now since we have divided E into A and B we can see that the extent to which the evidence supports the hypothesis is the same as the deductive support we can draw from the B portion. In other words the probability of A given the evidence i.e. P(A|E) is the same as P(A). So there's no way, according to this logic, that inductive findings can give probabilistic support to a theory. Although if you have a differing point of view, I'll be glad to hear you out. P.S.

No, I am not claiming that scientific knowledge is 80 percent wrong; rather that is the conclusion of several studies. For example at Lies, Damned Lies, and Medical Science - David H. Freedman - The Atlantic we find, ""80 percent of non-randomized studies (by far the most common type)...were later convincingly refuted."" At Cancer industry total fraud exposed: Nearly all 'scientific' studies fail to be replicated we read that 47 of 53 studies could not be replicated. That's more than 88 percent wrong. Now I know what you want to say - you want to say that this is just concentrated in the medical industry. Are you really that naive? I say again: It can be proved that the majority of published research findings are false. This is a direct quote from PLOS Medicine: Why Most Published Research Findings Are False Now back to Spread Of Endogenous Retrovirus K Is Similar In The DNA Of Humans And Rhesus Monkeys wherein we read: ""...a surprising pattern was observed."" Now since you seem to be too much of a simpleton to understand clear English let me explain it to you: When something found is surprising that means that it was not previously predicted by theories. If it had been predicted, then the findings would not have been surprising. Now the researchers say, ""The data suggested that the humans and rhesus have been purging ERV-K copies from their genomes..."" This is speculation. The only way to know that humans have been purging ERV-K copies from their genomes is to get DNA from humans some 5,000 years ago and compare it to DNA from humans today. Needless to say 5,000 year old DNA is not something you can just pick up at WalMart. Instead we are seeing conclusions drawn from a questionable premise: That humans, chimps, and rheuses monkeys share a common ancestor. These surprising findings do not support that conclusion. That's when ad hoc hypothesizing comes into play. This is why Imre Lakatos said, ""...nobody to date has yet found a demarcation criterion according to which Darwin can be described as scientific."" One final note: You said, ""...this is not the same kind of evidence we use to verify evolution."" This sentence smacks of Verificationism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia the refuted logical positivist philosophy that claimed that statements are only legitimate if they can be verified to be either true or false (empirically). However, as almost everyone has pointed out, the statement that unverifiable statements are illegitimate is itself unverifiable (and therefore illegitimate according to its own reasoning).","Databed","468251","Are these scientific studies? Well then, 80% of them must be wrong. Take 80% of the 20% and 20% of the 80% percent and we find that only 16% + 16% = 32% that must be correct. But wait! Then that means 32% of those studies must be correct! So only 68% percent are actually wrong. So take 68% of the 32% and 32% of the 68% and we find that 22% + 22% = 44% are correct. With a p-value of .05 we should be able to keep iterating and get to somewhere around 95% of the studies we see are actually correct. There, is this biased? BTW, you are STILL, STILL, STILL, STILL using examples that pertain to MEDICAL STUDIES EXCLUSIVELY!!!!!!!!! Evolution is not part of the medical field. That is, unless you take into account epidemiology, where the rapidly evolving microbes are ONLY understood under the light of evolution. Why do we keep needing new antibiotics and new vaccines? Medical Yup, medical You are simply wrong about this. We do have >5,000 year old DNA from humans and probably from chimps as well. There is no problem here. Humans have been purging ERV-K. We know this because we have hundreds of DNA markers that tell us where and when certain markers within the genomes of primate species originated. In case you didn't know, evolution predicts that DNA changes over time. So why then is it some kind of problem for evolution when it is observed that the genome has actually changed? Why is this any different from hominids evolving from apelike ancestors? I think you misunderstand what this article is saying. It is NOT saying the ERV is absent in homo sapiens or rhesus monkeys. Please get that through your head. The study says that the ERV-K sequence is disappearing from these genomes suggesting that evolution is ""tinkering"" with this area of the two genomes. It is not understood why. Maybe I will let Freedom tackle why this is not verificationism. Basically, when you come in here and refute the validity of medical studies and then claim therefore evolution is false, I will stand by my statement that you are refuting the WRONG evidence both in content and in classification.

The paper itself is only for the raw data. Ah, so you post a link to an article to make a point; and then deny some of it's claims because it's probably wrong.... I do indeed. Man one is correct. Man 2 is correct, the sample size of ravens was zero. Induction occurs when a finite set of probabilities are assessed from a finite set of evidence. All non-black things and all non-ravens is not a finite set of evidence. If you had brought back a million ravens and all were black (there are a finite number of ravens) it would be perfectly proper induction to conclude that probably all ravens are black. His hypothesis was strengthened by repeated confirmations. Hypotheses are competing with each other. Very few findings are predicted by both. Therefore unequal harm can often appear like the advancement of one hypothesis over another. I must be missing something, but if the extent to which the evidence supports the hypothesis is the same as the deductive support it's 100%.","Zosimus","468260","The reasoning is very simple. First of all, let's assume that we are investigating a genetic line containing 10,000 different genes. Our previous research, or estimations, or whatever, suggests that perhaps some 500 of those are involved in cancer regulation. We are doing research in order to determine if the gene in question really does regulate cancer. As such our a priori opinion of the gene is 5 percent - that is any given gene, without doing any studies, has a 5 percent chance of being involved in cancer regulation. After this we apply a study that is 95 percent correct - that is, that it produces correct answers 95 percent of the time and false positives only 5 percent of the time. As such we can conclude that our study will produce (9,500 x 0.05)=475 false positives and (500x0.95)=475 true positives. Assuming that all of our positives are published, half of our work will be wrong right out of the gate. This does not even take into account bad study design, personal bias, or data dredging. There are programs on the market that can easily find a statistical match in data by manipulating the data in ways such as dropping one person from the study. Researchers may be highly motivated to get published and may use these programs in order to generate positive findings in order to advance their career. They may honestly (but mistakenly) believe that the result of the experiment should be true and be frustrated that their research shows the finding they need but not at a level that is considered statistically significant. The study may be poorly designed or may overlook crucial elements that results in a false positive. Additionally, what happens if 12 groups are studying the same thing? Just by chance one of the groups may get a false positive while the others rightly find the negative result. Peer-reviewed journals generally publish positive findings rather than negative ones, unless that negative refutes a previous finding. As such the false positive will get published but the three real negatives will not get published. These three factors together will result in non-randomized small-scale studies being wrong the vast majority of the time. If you look at PLOS Medicine: Why Most Published Research Findings Are False and search for ""schizophrenia"" you will see the author's math regarding a fairly typical research design that yields a chance of being right of about 4.4 10 4 Now Databed will say, as he always does, that this is all about medical discoveries as though researcher bias, publication bias, data mining, and low pre-study odds existed only in medical research. I'm sure that evolutionary biologists are completely unbiased when it comes to discussion of the prevailing (pro-Darwin) paradigm... not! I'm sure peer-reviewed journals in biology are just as pleased to publish negative results as opposed to new, exciting, positive findings that appear to bring new insight and advance scientific discovery... not! So why should I (or anyone) think that non-randomized small-scale studies published in evolutionary journals somehow magically avoid all the pitfalls that plague researchers in the medical field? Now as for ERV-K copies, you say that the researchers found fragments of the ERV-K that was being purged. Were these findings statistically significant? Was data-mining software used to find these statistical matches? Are the researchers completely unbiased? How many humans, monkeys, and chimps were used in the study? Are we talking 1,000s of chimps or perhaps just a handful? Has this study been replicated? Do we know that this study is not the only positive result of perhaps 10 teams working on the same problem where the other 9 had negative findings and didn't get published? The answer is simple: We don't know any of the above factors. So from an objective standpoint we can say that this study has not changed our opinion of the world much, if at all. So why does Databed rabidly support evolution whereas Easyrider is just as adamant against it? The answer is simple: Previous to this study they had already made up their mind about evolution/creationism. This leads me back to the original point of the thread: People who believe in evolution do so because of an a priori philosophical commitment to atheism and all that entails. Now as for Hempel's paradox, do I understand you correctly to be claiming that there are an infinite number of non-black birds on Earth at this moment? Surely you cannot mean that. If you believe that finding a black raven makes it more likely that all ravens are black then logically you must think that finding a green parrot also makes it more likely that all ravens are black since the green parrot is a non-black non-raven. You already said you agreed with Man 1 when he stated that saying ""All ravens are black"" is the same as saying ""All non-black birds are not ravens."" Logically the two statements are the same, but you think (for some unexplained reason) that finding a black raven increases the odds of ""All ravens are black"" and (we can assume) the theory that all non-black birds are not ravens. Is it because the conclusion violates your intuition? Furthermore you claim that bringing back large numbers of black ravens would increase the possibility of all ravens being black. Consider this possibility: The men are arguing over the color of ravens (as before) and I am entrusted to bring back evidence to prove the point once and for all. While leaving the island I use my phone to call Shaq's Shack of Black run by Shaq (a black man named after the famous basketball player) who believes that black is a deeply spiritual color. In his store he sells all kinds of black things - black clocks, black folders, black pens, black shoes, etc. He agrees to order as many ravens as he can get his hands on from a supplier and when I arrive at his shop (two days later) I make off with 193 black ravens and quickly return to the island. Do these black ravens really prove that all ravens are black or do they actually just prove that Shaq's Shack of Black only sells black things? I would tend to think the latter, although perhaps the men on the island will really be convinced of the former. The question that really needs to be asked is not what evidence was found but how that evidence was collected and whether that procedure had a legitimate non-zero chance of falsifying the hypothesis in question. Hopefully what we can agree on is that any finding that is surprising bodes ill for the claim that all ravens are black. If I show up with what appears to be a blue raven perhaps Man1 can insist that it's not really a raven at all, or that it's color is not authentic (that I'd had it dyed), or insist that it is actually black and that the blue color is a figment of our imagination, or that his claim was true at the moment he made it but that this raven is very young and wasn't born at that time or was left on the planet by extraterrestrials for no other reason than to confound him. These are all what we call ""ad hoc"" hypotheses - non-premeditated claims made for no other reason than to keep a cherished belief from being seriously called into question. Theories that use a large number of these hypotheses are simply not testable and therefore not scientific. Finally, back to Popper's Bayesian analysis of Hempel's Paradox. Imagine that we have a man who has a hypothesis (H) that when he cheers for his favorite team and his favorite player at the stadium that his team invariably wins. We can divide his claim into two parts (A and B). Let A = he is cheering and B = his favorite player is playing. Suppose we also know that his favorite player is the best player on the team, who only plays in home games because of some legal problems he has that have resulted in a restriction on travel for him. Therefore the evidence (E) can also be divided into B and C. Let B = the best player on the team is playing and C = his team wins. In this case we can see that when analyzing P(A and B|B and C) that deduction leads us to the conclusion that his team usually wins when the best player is playing and not when he is cheering. So although P(H|E) may seem to be greater than P(H) alone there are good reasons to believe that all of that probability is due to B and not to A.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","11:26 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","231"

So only 68% percent are actually wrong. So take 68% of the 32% and 32% of the 68% and we find that 22% + 22% = 44% are correct. With a p-value of .05 we should be able to keep iterating and get to somewhere around 95% of the studies we see are actually correct. There, is this biased? BTW, you are STILL, STILL, STILL, STILL using examples that pertain to MEDICAL STUDIES EXCLUSIVELY!!!!!!!!! Evolution is not part of the medical field. That is, unless you take into account epidemiology, where the rapidly evolving microbes are ONLY understood under the light of evolution. Why do we keep needing new antibiotics and new vaccines? Medical Yup, medical You are simply wrong about this. We do have >5,000 year old DNA from humans and probably from chimps as well. There is no problem here. Humans have been purging ERV-K. We know this because we have hundreds of DNA markers that tell us where and when certain markers within the genomes of primate species originated. In case you didn't know, evolution predicts that DNA changes over time. So why then is it some kind of problem for evolution when it is observed that the genome has actually changed? Why is this any different from hominids evolving from apelike ancestors? I think you misunderstand what this article is saying. It is NOT saying the ERV is absent in homo sapiens or rhesus monkeys. Please get that through your head. The study says that the ERV-K sequence is disappearing from these genomes suggesting that evolution is ""tinkering"" with this area of the two genomes. It is not understood why. Maybe I will let Freedom tackle why this is not verificationism. Basically, when you come in here and refute the validity of medical studies and then claim therefore evolution is false, I will stand by my statement that you are refuting the WRONG evidence both in content and in classification. I don't understand why you think you are being relevant. I guess maybe you had an angle, or a pitch, it failed, and now you are really trying to keep it alive even though NO ONE is buying into it.

Second, the same logic you vainly tried to use to disprove the proof can easily be applied to induction. Imagine, for example, that we theorize that induction leads to knowledge. Our confidence in induction is 100 percent. However, after 10 tries, induction fails us once. Imagine, for example, that we used induction to calculate that the prices of houses would continue to go up in leaps and bounds in the USA and were quite disappointed. Our confidence in induction drops to 91 percent. But wait! We are using induction to measure how effective induction is. So really our confidence in induction should drop to 82.6 percent (10 2 /11 2 ) but wait that means our estimation of induction must drop further... until, finally, we come to the conclusion that induction is 0 percent likely to lead to knowledge.

Finally, you claim that humans have been purging ERV-K because you have 5000+ year old DNA. The answer is, of course, that you think you have 5,000+ year old DNA. You make this claim, but this claim is unverifiable and suspect. Considering that science cannot accurately measure and demonstrate things we can easily see in front of our eyes on a daily basis, how in the world can you seriously make the claim that you can know about things that were going on 5,000 years ago? The bottom line is simple: The theory made certain predictions. An experiment was done. The results were surprising, i.e., not in line with the predictions. Later the predictions were modified in such a way as to make it seem that it was in line with the theory when it wasn't. Now you want to claim victory but sorry - I'm not buying it. P.S. I still think you're missing the point. I'm not here trying to disprove evolution - I'm here trying (and I believe, succeeding) in proving that you believe in evolution because you made up your mind before any of this evidence came around.

"01-05-2013","21431",16,"Zosimus","468260","The reasoning is very simple. First of all, let's assume that we are investigating a genetic line containing 10,000 different genes. Our previous research, or estimations, or whatever, suggests that perhaps some 500 of those are involved in cancer regulation. We are doing research in order to determine if the gene in question really does regulate cancer. As such our a priori opinion of the gene is 5 percent - that is any given gene, without doing any studies, has a 5 percent chance of being involved in cancer regulation. After this we apply a study that is 95 percent correct - that is, that it produces correct answers 95 percent of the time and false positives only 5 percent of the time. As such we can conclude that our study will produce (9,500 x 0.05)=475 false positives and (500x0.95)=475 true positives. Assuming that all of our positives are published, half of our work will be wrong right out of the gate. This does not even take into account bad study design, personal bias, or data dredging. There are programs on the market that can easily find a statistical match in data by manipulating the data in ways such as dropping one person from the study. Researchers may be highly motivated to get published and may use these programs in order to generate positive findings in order to advance their career. They may honestly (but mistakenly) believe that the result of the experiment should be true and be frustrated that their research shows the finding they need but not at a level that is considered statistically significant. The study may be poorly designed or may overlook crucial elements that results in a false positive. Additionally, what happens if 12 groups are studying the same thing? Just by chance one of the groups may get a false positive while the others rightly find the negative result. Peer-reviewed journals generally publish positive findings rather than negative ones, unless that negative refutes a previous finding. As such the false positive will get published but the three real negatives will not get published. These three factors together will result in non-randomized small-scale studies being wrong the vast majority of the time. If you look at PLOS Medicine: Why Most Published Research Findings Are False and search for ""schizophrenia"" you will see the author's math regarding a fairly typical research design that yields a chance of being right of about 4.4 10 4 Now Databed will say, as he always does, that this is all about medical discoveries as though researcher bias, publication bias, data mining, and low pre-study odds existed only in medical research. I'm sure that evolutionary biologists are completely unbiased when it comes to discussion of the prevailing (pro-Darwin) paradigm... not! I'm sure peer-reviewed journals in biology are just as pleased to publish negative results as opposed to new, exciting, positive findings that appear to bring new insight and advance scientific discovery... not! So why should I (or anyone) think that non-randomized small-scale studies published in evolutionary journals somehow magically avoid all the pitfalls that plague researchers in the medical field? Now as for ERV-K copies, you say that the researchers found fragments of the ERV-K that was being purged. Were these findings statistically significant? Was data-mining software used to find these statistical matches? Are the researchers completely unbiased? How many humans, monkeys, and chimps were used in the study? Are we talking 1,000s of chimps or perhaps just a handful? Has this study been replicated? Do we know that this study is not the only positive result of perhaps 10 teams working on the same problem where the other 9 had negative findings and didn't get published? The answer is simple: We don't know any of the above factors. So from an objective standpoint we can say that this study has not changed our opinion of the world much, if at all. So why does Databed rabidly support evolution whereas Easyrider is just as adamant against it? The answer is simple: Previous to this study they had already made up their mind about evolution/creationism. This leads me back to the original point of the thread: People who believe in evolution do so because of an a priori philosophical commitment to atheism and all that entails. Now as for Hempel's paradox, do I understand you correctly to be claiming that there are an infinite number of non-black birds on Earth at this moment? Surely you cannot mean that. If you believe that finding a black raven makes it more likely that all ravens are black then logically you must think that finding a green parrot also makes it more likely that all ravens are black since the green parrot is a non-black non-raven. You already said you agreed with Man 1 when he stated that saying ""All ravens are black"" is the same as saying ""All non-black birds are not ravens."" Logically the two statements are the same, but you think (for some unexplained reason) that finding a black raven increases the odds of ""All ravens are black"" and (we can assume) the theory that all non-black birds are not ravens. Is it because the conclusion violates your intuition? Furthermore you claim that bringing back large numbers of black ravens would increase the possibility of all ravens being black. Consider this possibility: The men are arguing over the color of ravens (as before) and I am entrusted to bring back evidence to prove the point once and for all. While leaving the island I use my phone to call Shaq's Shack of Black run by Shaq (a black man named after the famous basketball player) who believes that black is a deeply spiritual color. In his store he sells all kinds of black things - black clocks, black folders, black pens, black shoes, etc. He agrees to order as many ravens as he can get his hands on from a supplier and when I arrive at his shop (two days later) I make off with 193 black ravens and quickly return to the island. Do these black ravens really prove that all ravens are black or do they actually just prove that Shaq's Shack of Black only sells black things? I would tend to think the latter, although perhaps the men on the island will really be convinced of the former. The question that really needs to be asked is not what evidence was found but how that evidence was collected and whether that procedure had a legitimate non-zero chance of falsifying the hypothesis in question. Hopefully what we can agree on is that any finding that is surprising bodes ill for the claim that all ravens are black. If I show up with what appears to be a blue raven perhaps Man1 can insist that it's not really a raven at all, or that it's color is not authentic (that I'd had it dyed), or insist that it is actually black and that the blue color is a figment of our imagination, or that his claim was true at the moment he made it but that this raven is very young and wasn't born at that time or was left on the planet by extraterrestrials for no other reason than to confound him. These are all what we call ""ad hoc"" hypotheses - non-premeditated claims made for no other reason than to keep a cherished belief from being seriously called into question. Theories that use a large number of these hypotheses are simply not testable and therefore not scientific. Finally, back to Popper's Bayesian analysis of Hempel's Paradox. Imagine that we have a man who has a hypothesis (H) that when he cheers for his favorite team and his favorite player at the stadium that his team invariably wins. We can divide his claim into two parts (A and B). Let A = he is cheering and B = his favorite player is playing. Suppose we also know that his favorite player is the best player on the team, who only plays in home games because of some legal problems he has that have resulted in a restriction on travel for him. Therefore the evidence (E) can also be divided into B and C. Let B = the best player on the team is playing and C = his team wins. In this case we can see that when analyzing P(A and B|B and C) that deduction leads us to the conclusion that his team usually wins when the best player is playing and not when he is cheering. So although P(H|E) may seem to be greater than P(H) alone there are good reasons to believe that all of that probability is due to B and not to A.","Freedom","468351","What if the test is 99%? 95 wrong 495 right 83% to overall identification.

Since HIV numbers are easily available on the net, I'll work with those. According to proponents of the Rapid ELISA test, the test is 99.5 percent effective (see How HIV is Diagnosed - Tests Used to Diagnose HIV Infection - ELISA, EIA and PCR Tests - HIVInfoSource.org ). I also note that out of the 315 million US residents an estimated 1.2 million are HIV+ while 240,000 of these don't know that (see CDC Vital Signs - New Hope for Stopping HIV ). Since this article was posted in December 2011 I'm going to tack on 50,000 more (see article) and say that none of them are aware that they are HIV+ - this means that out of every 10,000 people 9.23 are HIV+ and unaware of their condition. Since the Rapid ELISA test is 99.5 percent accurate that means that 499.5 false positives will be produced (0.05 x 9991) whereas 9 real positives will be produced. As such a person testing positive for HIV with the Rapid ELISA test is really only 1.77 percent likely to have the disease. So simply having a very, very accurate test is not a panacea to the problems plaguing researchers. In reality, of course, 99.5 percent accurate is an unfounded number (see HIV & AIDS - Factors Known to Cause False Positive HIV Antibody Test Results ) wherein a large number of known causes of false positives are stated. But really I want to delve deeper - past this instance and into the exact problems of determining how accurate a test is. Let's suppose, for example, that we have discovered a new virus and we have a test that tests for the antibodies produced to fight against this disease. How do we know how accurate the test is? Really the only way to know that the test (let's call it Test A) is accurate is to compare it against another test (Test B) that is known to be 100 percent accurate. The immediate problem jumps right out at us - if we already have a Test B that is 100 percent accurate, then why are we screwing around with a new test (Test A) with unknown accuracy? Additionally we can assume that we know Test B was 100 percent accurate because we compared it against Test C and it matched up 100 percent. Test C, of course, matched 100% with Test D, which was verified against Test E, and that against test F... ad infinitum . Obviously that is not done - so how do we really determine that Test A works at all? The answer is simple: Test A is compared against itself to see how often it agrees with itself. Now it's entirely possible that Test A routinely produces false positives if the person has, for example, AH1N1 influenza (and agrees with itself a very high percentage of the time). In short, just because the test agrees with itself very, very often doesn't mean that it's very accurate in the real world . Now let's talk about induction. Induction is a form of logic that is known to produce false outcomes even when all inputs are true. As such, I consider it to be extremely unreliable. You, on the other hand, think that it is reliable. Let's agree, for the sake of argument, that induction is accurate. If that's so, then that means that the past is a good guide to the future. As you can see at Medical Research Article: Lies, Damned Lies, and Medical Science Health and Medical News and Resources 80 percent of non-randomized studies turn out to be wrong. Since we believe in induction, we can conclude that 80 percent of all future non-randomized studies will also be wrong. With that in mind I challenge you to produce a randomized study that supports evolution. Don't just say ""...I do know the odds of similar DNA existing in two individuals without a common ancestor increases by the power of the matching base-pair positions."" If that study was not randomized we can safely conclude that it was wrong. Now you are trying to poke holes in Hempel's paradox through loopholes that can easily be eliminated. Let's change the hypothetical situation ever so slightly. We have two men (I'll call them Aaron and Charles). Aaron owns a nice, black raven and claims that all ravens are black. Charles claims to have once owned a white raven and says that he has also seen a white raven flying around the island. I go off and bring back large numbers of green parrots, red robins, and blue bluejays. Aaron claims that this greatly supports the contention that all ravens are black. ""Any of these birds,"" he reasons, ""could have been a raven. That would have falsified my claim. In fact, he says, it's entirely possible that the black raven you see in my office is the only raven in existence. That would positively prove that all ravens are black.""

Let's ignore the fact that the above isn't a sentence and delve into this logic more deeply. Let's do so by imaginging a devout Marxist who is reading a newspaper next to me. He says, ""Millions have tried to disprove Marxism, but no one has succeeded."" He then proceeds to go to every news story in the paper and he easily draws out from the stories how the story is evidence of the class bias of the newspaper. Even the stories not printed are confirmations for the theory of Marxism, in his estimation. Everywhere he looks he sees confirmations of his theory. There has never been any observation that does not fit with the theory of Marxism. What does that prove, really? Nothing except that his theory accommodates all data. Let's compare this theory to Einstein's Theory of Relativity, which predicted gravitational lensing of light. This situation is quite different because the outcome was predicted ahead of time, people unenlightened by the theory would have predicted something else, and so when lensing was observed people were understandably far more impressed by that than by a Marxist (or evolutionist) twisting every finding into support for his pet theory through the use of ad hoc hypotheses. From Sir Karl Popper ""Science as Falsification,"" 1963 The most characteristic element in this situation seemed to me the incessant stream of confirmations, of observations which ""verified"" the theories in question; and this point was constantly emphasize by their adherents. A Marxist could not open a newspaper without finding on every page confirming evidence for his interpretation of history; not only in the news, but also in its presentation which revealed the class bias of the paper and especially of course what the paper did not say. The Freudian analysts emphasized that their theories were constantly verified by their ""clinical observations."" As for Adler, I was much impressed by a personal experience. Once, in 1919, I reported to him a case which to me did not seem particularly Adlerian, but which he found no difficulty in analyzing in terms of his theory of inferiority feelings, Although he had not even seen the child. Slightly shocked, I asked him how he could be so sure. ""Because of my thousandfold experience,"" he replied; whereupon I could not help saying: ""And with this new case, I suppose, your experience has become thousand-and-one-fold."" What I had in mind was that his previous observations may not have been much sounder than this new one; that each in its turn had been interpreted in the light of ""previous experience,"" and at the same time counted as additional confirmation. What, I asked myself, did it confirm? No more than that a case could be interpreted in the light of a theory. But this meant very little, I reflected, since every conceivable case could be interpreted in the light Adler's theory, or equally of Freud's. Now you claim that there are several methods of radioactive dating that are accurate out to the 5,000 year old timescale. I assume that you refer to carbon dating since we are unlikely to find radioactive argon in DNA samples. A simple look at Is Carbon Dating Accurate? shows that the answer is basically no. Scientists refer to C-14 dating if it supports their preconceived (aka biased) notions, but otherwise they just ignore it. And as for your claim that 5,000 years is nothing, I picked that date to cater to the young earth advocates (if any) in the forum. As for refuting evolution - I hardly need do that. The mere existence of the peacock refutes Darwinism outright. Finally, as for poking fun at garlic, and ignoring medical studies like Antibacterial activity of allicin from Allium sativum against antibiotic resistant uropathogens - ISPUB the mechanics of garlic administration is simple: Taking garlic pills is problematic because stomach acid destroys alliinase, the simple solution has been to pair the garlic with an acid neutralizer. There are already several products on the market (for example Garli-eze ) that can produce the active ingredient in simulated tests.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","11:10 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","236"

It may even make you feel warm and cozy at night or help you get over the loss of a loved one. It may make the universe make sense for you and even get federal grant money so you can research it and make a nice living. However, at the end of the day, it just isn't science. Real science has predictive power - it lets you put a man on the moon. Theories that don't succeed in predicting get discarded. Not in evolutionary biology, however, you just make an exception for every species that doesn't fit your model, never revisit the underlying assumptions, and scream loudly if someone disagrees with you. This is why I say (as I have stated before) that pro-evolutionists agree with evolutionary theory (if it can even be classified as a theory) because of a priori concerns (such as atheism) that have nothing whatsoever to do with any information gathered.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","11:33 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","238"

For one thing, see above for posts indicating that we do in fact have human genomes much older than 5,000 years. Secondly, 5,000 years is NOT enough time to see any purging of ERV-K from our genome. Thirdly, what are you trying to prove here? I have already told you that we DO possess ERV-K in our genome. There are several different variants of the same ERV in fact due to duplications, insertions, etc. You simply do not understand the relevance of this, and also, you refuse to accept the timescales involved. I don't know what I have to do to get you to see that your arguments indicate a total lack of understanding of the implications of ERV's within our genome and that of our primate cousins. Here is a link that discusses the same study you originally posted that explained of the purging of ERV-K PLOS ONE: Demographic Histories of ERV-K in Humans, Chimpanzees and Rhesus Monkeys This article is basically explaining why there is a difference within the sequences of ERV-K within several genomes of primates. Please understand the timescales that are involved here. To be sitting here arguing about 5,000 years is stupid. We know ancient humans had ERV-K because WE have ERV-K and so do chimps, monkeys etc etc. End of argument. So what? Do you think that they mention ERV-K in this article? BTW, to sit here and claim that a partial genome is worthless is stupid. There is much information that can be gleamed from such a small genomic fragment. In addition, you seem to think that an ERV is like a point marker. Again, you are under the wrong impression. ERV-K is spread out across our genome through transpositioning, insertions, duplications, etc. Therefore, it would not be too big of a surprise to find part of it in a fragmental sequence. Again, irrelevant as we have >5,000 year human genome and also because we already know the ERV is there because we possess it in our own genome. Dendrochronology is used to calibrate carbon dating, yes. It is not necessary, it just makes for more accurate dating. Without it, you will still get a date - it will be a range, but it will indicated as such. Carbon dating may be employed in identifying approximate locations of growth rings found in ancient timbers so that the growth rings may be matched up.

But if you think that these scientists doing this are just complete XXXXXX who can't match their shapes, your just simply wrong.

"01-15-2013","21431",17,"Databed","468727","I'm having trouble grasping why you think this is even relevant to our discussion? For one thing, see above for posts indicating that we do in fact have human genomes much older than 5,000 years. Secondly, 5,000 years is NOT enough time to see any purging of ERV-K from our genome. Thirdly, what are you trying to prove here? I have already told you that we DO possess ERV-K in our genome. There are several different variants of the same ERV in fact due to duplications, insertions, etc. You simply do not understand the relevance of this, and also, you refuse to accept the timescales involved. I don't know what I have to do to get you to see that your arguments indicate a total lack of understanding of the implications of ERV's within our genome and that of our primate cousins. Here is a link that discusses the same study you originally posted that explained of the purging of ERV-K PLOS ONE: Demographic Histories of ERV-K in Humans, Chimpanzees and Rhesus Monkeys This article is basically explaining why there is a difference within the sequences of ERV-K within several genomes of primates. Please understand the timescales that are involved here. To be sitting here arguing about 5,000 years is stupid. We know ancient humans had ERV-K because WE have ERV-K and so do chimps, monkeys etc etc. End of argument. So what? Do you think that they mention ERV-K in this article? BTW, to sit here and claim that a partial genome is worthless is stupid. There is much information that can be gleamed from such a small genomic fragment. In addition, you seem to think that an ERV is like a point marker. Again, you are under the wrong impression. ERV-K is spread out across our genome through transpositioning, insertions, duplications, etc. Therefore, it would not be too big of a surprise to find part of it in a fragmental sequence. Again, irrelevant as we have >5,000 year human genome and also because we already know the ERV is there because we possess it in our own genome. Dendrochronology is used to calibrate carbon dating, yes. It is not necessary, it just makes for more accurate dating. Without it, you will still get a date - it will be a range, but it will indicated as such. Carbon dating may be employed in identifying approximate locations of growth rings found in ancient timbers so that the growth rings may be matched up. As you can imagine, its not easy to just look at a tree and know immediately where it belongs. But if you think that these scientists doing this are just complete XXXXXX who can't match their shapes, your just simply wrong. It is still obvious that you believe that any science that dates the earth as older than 6,000 can't be correct. So come out and say that you don't believe in Jesus or the Bible then! I want to hear you say that you believe the world is billions of years old. I want to hear what better way than science there is to understand our world? Can you do that? Until you can, I will continue to believe that you are a religious crackpot. Your claim was that we do not have human DNA older than 5,000 years. My link proved you wrong.","Zosimus","468922","You don't seem to get it at all. You say that I don't seem to understand the relevance of ERV-K findings. I do understand their relevance: They have none. You see, you have a theory (T) that predicts findings (F). Then when you find those things (F) you think that confirms T. This is a classic example of the ""affirming the consequent"" logical fallacy. Now maybe you are of the opinion that one logical fallacy proves nothing but several thousand of them can prove Darwinism. I, however, am of the opinion that large numbers of logical fallacies prove the exact same thing that one logical fallacy does, namely, nothing. But while we're on the subject of carbon 14, let's take a look at New Research Documents Extremely High Atmospheric Carbon 14 During Last Ice Age | UANews wherein we find that all evidence points to carbon 14 having been higher in the past. Now maybe you're shrugging your shoulders and saying, ""So what?"" Here's the point: The half-life of carbon 14 is believed to be around 5730 years. For simplicity sake, let's assume that we have a piece of wood that has a small amount of carbon 14. Now we start by saying, ""We believe this wood to be 9,000 years old."" So they go to ice core samples or dendrochronology work and tell us what the 14 C levels were estimated to be 9,000 years ago. Now I seriously doubt that they can really know that, but let's ignore that argument for the moment to hone in on the one I want to make. Let's imagine that they say that 9,000 years ago the 14 C levels were x and based on that the wood turns out to be 8,600 years old (plus or minus). Victory is proclaimed and everyone goes home. In reality, however, it is entirely possible that the wood is really only 2,870 years old. Why do I say that? Well, if 14 C levels were ""x"" 8,600 years ago and 0.5x 2,870 years ago then both samples will have the exact same amount of 14 C in them today (because of the half-life). Now the math here is simplified just to make a point but the point is this: As long as 14 C was higher in the past than it is now there will always be multiple possible dates for each fragment of wood tested. The date that is selected will always be the one that confirms what scientists already believe.

What I look for is not what was found but how it was found. For example the newspaper said that the group diverged from humans some 800,000 years ago. In the actual study it says, ""We estimated the... population divergence... to be 170,000-700,000 years."" This was done by comparing the number of differences between chimpanzees and modern-day West Africans and extrapolating. You'll excuse me if I'm not impressed by a method of dating divergence that is accurate plus or minus more than 60 percent. I also note, ""Assuming 6.5 million years of sequence divergence between humans and chimpanzees, the bone [can] be tentatively dated to between 74,000 and 82,000 years before present....However, we caution that multiple sources of error may affect this estimate."" Somehow the newspaper forgot to mention what the article really said: That multiple sources of error make what was reported to be more of a guess than a finding. Most of their estimates were made using the TreeMix software. The benefits of the software for researchers are simple in that it offers sustantial data mining opportunities and a number of flexible models that permit you to pick which model you want in order to get the results you desire as opposed to having a rigorous test that allows you to test whether the model fits the data. I wonder how much monkeying with parameters went on before they found the settings that gave them the results they were hoping to find. Apparently not enough because they admit, ""While this procedure does not provide a perfect fit to the data (for example, it does not model Neandertal admixture), it agrees with our previous finding that Denisovans have contributed to the genomes of present-day Melanesians, Australian Aborigines, and other South-East Asian islanders."" Well that's a relief that even though it doesn't fit the data that way that at least it does confirm their preconceived biases... er... findings. I also thought it was amusing that they determined that the DNA strands broke more often around guanine, according to their research, which means that ""guanine nucleotides are frequently lost from ancient DNA, possibly as the result of depurination."" This also permits them to throw guanine nucleotides in where needed to fill in the missing DNA. Of course where guanine doesn't match up well that could be one of the few times they throw in a different nucleotide so that things work out as they need them to. I also read with amusment this part: ""To estimate average per-base error rates in the Denisovan genome we counted differences between the sequenced DNA fragments and regions of the human genome that are highly conserved within primates [approximately 5.6 million bases, (8)]. The error rate is 0.13% for the Denisovan genome, 0.17% to 0.19% for the genome sequences from the eleven present-day humans, and 1.21.7% for the two trios sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Pilot project.""

You seem to have given up finding this little piece in favor of a philosophical assertion that no one can ever know anything. It is thinking like this that results in someone who does in fact know nothing and in doing this you demonstrate your total lack of understanding of what a theory actually does.

Again, for the 47th time, it is NOT, NOT, NOT a deductive argument that I use to support my acceptance of evolution as a proper theory. We are speaking two different languages here: yours is that of an unthinking automaton and mine is that of a realist. Do you even understand how carbon dating is calibrated? We have a carbon bearing object whose age and source of carbon is known. We measure the carbon 14 content. We back calculate to obtain the atmospheric carbon 14 ratios for its known date of origin. We create a table containing lots of data for different objects of known date of origin. This is the calibration curve. Now, we have several different methods for dating a carbon bearing object. One is historical information associated with the object. Another is to use wood with an intact tree ring structure. This is dendrochronology and apparently you have a problem with it although the reasons you have expressed make no sense - I don't think you actually understand how it works. Another method of figuring out historical carbon 14 ratios is to use trapped gas within bubbles found in ice cores or from organic material found in ice sheets. Since ice sheet layers can be dated very reliably this method is fairly sound. One thing to keep in mind is that curves developed by different methods are more or less consistent with each other. However, no one claims that the curves are perfect. This is one reason why dates based on carbon 14 dating are given as a range. Now, once you have a calibration curve, you can measure the carbon 14 ratio and calculate how long ago it had a level consistent with atmospheric levels. Again, you could get more than one answer here, but only by a small bit and both numbers are necessarily within the age range expressed as the determined age of the object. The problem here is that you act like scientists are trying to hide all of this. You act like they don't already know there is error within their methodologies. The truth is, they do know what they're doing and they are honest with their answers. This isn't to say that mistakes are impossible and that nothing is assumed or extrapolated to fill in missing data.

Are you seriously asking or just getting really desperate at this point? Do you honestly believe that they can't tell whether or not their sequencing is accurate? Just looking back at this, it actually makes sense. Now, i seriously doubt that this is correct because this guys mathematical model does not take into account that some groups have been completely isolated for thousands of years. Look at it this way. You have millions and millions of ancestors. In a perfectly dispersing population, mathematically, one of those ancestors should actually fall into every single persons ancestral tree. You are probably used to seeing a family tree that branches and becomes more complex as you move forward in generations. However, it actually does so in the reverse as well. In fact, in reverse there are no dead ends. By the way, I hope that you are able to grasp the difference between the last common ancestor of all LIVING humans and that of all humans and Neandertals.

Again, you could get more than one answer here, but only by a small bit and both numbers are necessarily within the age range expressed as the determined age of the object. The problem here is that you act like scientists are trying to hide all of this. You act like they don't already know there is error within their methodologies. The truth is, they do know what they're doing and they are honest with their answers. This isn't to say that mistakes are impossible and that nothing is assumed or extrapolated to fill in missing data. But to sit here and discount the science as completely false shows extreme ignorance as to how science actually works. By the way, I see that yet again you totally failed to respond to the bulk of my post. Again, I assert that you are a religious kook.","Zosimus","469103","You think that it affirms (T) but you don't say what that affirmation consists of. Makes more probable? How so, exactly? Normally calculating probabilities like this are done using Bayes Theorm. I have already posted about this but perhaps you didn't understand it so let's start from the very, very beginning. In order to use Bayes Theorm we must know that probability of the hypothesis (H) a priori . Now we don't know this, but we have the Principle of indifference - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia which states that since there are two possibilities for Darwinism (either right or wrong) that our starting probability should be 50 percent (1/2). I am an open-minded person and so I adopt a 50-50 chance for Darwinism. Now we have a study showing that females do not prefer males with large, ornate trains. No relationship has been detected related to eyespot symmetry, size, number, or anything else that relates to male reproductive success. This is what we call the evidence (E). What we want to calculate is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence. We write this as P(H|E). Now Bayes Theorm says that: P(H|E) = ( P(E|H) * P(H) ) / P(E) Now I think we all agree that the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis is quite low. Darwinism theorizes that traits that do not foster survival and/or reproductive success do not endure. Accordingly the P(E|H) is less than 1 percent. Really, I would have to know how many genes are involved in creating the tail and how likely those genes are to have occurred purely by chance and then we'd have to measure how much the long train harms peacock survival. Now in order to do this calculation we need to know the probability that the evidence is true (from a Bayesian point of view). P(E) = P(H) x P(E|H) + P(H-wrong) x P(E|H-wrong) and that's (0.5 * .01 + .5 * 1) at most 50.5% P(H|E) < ( 1% * 50% ) / 50.5% P(H|E) < 0.99% So that's my calculation for how likely Darwinism is - at the most optimistic it is 1 percent. Now let's run the numbers for creationism. Again we start with P(H) = 50% Now we note that chimps and humans have 96 percent of their DNA similar to chimps. We'll consider P(E)=100% and run the numbers. P(H|E) = (100% * 50%) / 100% = 50% You see the probability of creationism hasn't changed at all. The reason for this is because the P(E) and P(E|H) are always 100 percent. There is no evidence that you can find that is not 100% compatible with creationism. All a creationist has to do is shrug his shoulders and say, ""God made it that way for a reason that only he can understand."" Accordingly no amount of experimentation can ever budge the chance of creationism away from our initial guess at its probability. That's why we say that creationism is not a subject for scientific inquiry . Since it cannot be empirically falsified our estimation of its probability will forever remain unchanged at whatever starting number we use. Of course your proposed solution for falsification in Darwinism is ad hoc hypotheses. If you take this route then the only thing that happens is that Darwinism becomes what creationism is: An unfalsifiable, non-scientific article of faith for the devout to accept as is. Now as for 14 C dating a simple look at Fluctuation of atmospheric C14 during the last six millennia - Damon - 2012 - Journal of Geophysical Research - Wiley Online Library shows that 14 C levels have fluctuated up to 30 percent just in the past 6,000 years. 14 C was higher in the past. Now the question is: How long does it take 14 C to drop by 30 percent? To do that we need to solve for x such that x 5730 = 0.5 So x = 0.999879 meaning approximately 0.0121% of 14 C is lost per year. So now the question is: How many years will we need before 14 C drops by 30 percent. In other words 0.999879 x = 0.7 So that means x (log(0.999879)) = log (0.7) so x = log (0.7) / log (0.999879) = 2,947 years is how long it will take 14 C to drop by 30 percent. What does this mean? That means that a piece of wood from a tree in the past that died on a specific day would have the same amount of 14 C in it as a piece of wood from a tree that died 2,947 years previously if the 14 C at that time in the atmosphere was 30% higher. Yet people will tell you that 14 C dating is very accurate considering that the half-life is known to within +/- 40 years. Ha! Anyway how are these 14 C concentrations calibrated? Yes, as we've already discussed it's from dendrochronology - but I certainly hope you don't think they cut down 1 tree that was 6,000 years old and got the 14 C out of it! No, no, that's not how it's done. First we can take a tree that's alive today and cut it down and maybe the tree is maximum 200 years old so that will (theoretically) give us the 14 C levels for 200 years. So then you have to find another tree was cut down maybe 100 years ago and match it up to the tree you have to extend back to 300 years. This is called ""wiggle matching."" Now problems with wiggle matching were first pointed out in 1986 in a paper by Yamaguchi in which he pointed out that a specific tree known to be in the 16th century could be wiggle matched with 99.9 percent confidence to 113 different places. This problem with wiggle matching was already pointed out previously in the link I had previously posted, but I guess you didn't read it or didn't understand it. You can try reading http://cio.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/roo...ronkRamsey.pdf which starts, 'The calibration of a single radiocarbon date from the notional "" 14 C age to the true calendar age almost always results in a considerable loss of precision.' No kidding. 'There is, therefore, no single valued, differentiable, inverse function which can be used for calibration.' It's worth reading. I especially enjoyed the part on 'measurement bias.' As you said in your post, it's not that scientists aren't aware that their measurements are probably wrong and rely on estimations, assumptions, and are often refuted by later field work. Of course they're aware, it's just that these admissions (which are so freely made in the actual studies) somehow rarely make it into the newspaper coverage of the purported ""finds."" No, my complaint is not just that science is completely unreliable. My complaint is not merely that scientists are biased. My complaint is not merely that the so-called 'scientific method' doesn't even exist. My complaint is not that even if the scientific method did exist then things like astronomy, which everyone agrees is 'science' wouldn't be classifiable as science since they don't do experiments - rather they watch the skies and report on what they observe. My complaint isn't even that the history of science is replete with examples of scientists persecuting other scientists and doing everything possible to prevent real advances in knowledge from occurring, like what happened with Doppler and what is currently happening with Halton Arp. My complaint is that no definition of 'science' can possibly include Darwinism because it just simply isn't science. It's not testable, falsifiable, or open to experimental exploration. It is, at best, a tautology. At worst it is a group of ad hoc hypotheses masquerading as science in order to give atheists a semi-plausible worldview with no epistemological basis. As such I don't see one lick of difference between Darwinism and creationism or even intelligent design. And I hereby reiterate my charge: You only believe in Darwinism because you have an a priori philosophical bias due to your atheistic mindset.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","03:44 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","261"

Look, you keep demanding information from me that you claim does not exist. All I do is go to Google, put in a quick search and post to you the first couple of links I find that verify that you have no clue. If you want to delve deeper into the subject matter, why don't you do that prior to posting such easily refutable claims? It's in no way circular. What are you even talking about? Secondly, if you think they only rely on this as a dating method, you are wrong again. I think that statement was more to demonstrate just how well the specimen they collected was sequenced. The sample contains genes from mother and father you clown. Over the many, many genes within the genome they are able to determine diversity to a fairly high degree. Are you seriously asking or just getting really desperate at this point? Do you honestly believe that they can't tell whether or not their sequencing is accurate? Just looking back at this, it actually makes sense. Now, i seriously doubt that this is correct because this guys mathematical model does not take into account that some groups have been completely isolated for thousands of years. Look at it this way. You have millions and millions of ancestors. In a perfectly dispersing population, mathematically, one of those ancestors should actually fall into every single persons ancestral tree. You are probably used to seeing a family tree that branches and becomes more complex as you move forward in generations. However, it actually does so in the reverse as well. In fact, in reverse there are no dead ends. By the way, I hope that you are able to grasp the difference between the last common ancestor of all LIVING humans and that of all humans and Neandertals. If If all the humans on Earth were to die except for a small family, then the mother and father of that family would then fit the bill.","Zosimus","469106","My dear Mr. Databed, I'll write an off-the-cuff response since I had already prepared a different response to you and didn't see your late-to-the-wire response. Let's see if we can reconstruct your argument. You know that evolution is true because ERV-K remains are found in human DNA as well as chimp DNA in sections of the genome that science has no clue what purpose it serves. When I pointed out that humans share ERV-K similarities with rhesus monkeys that are not shared with chimps - a finding that has the potential to falsify the claims you have made. In that you have responded with the claim that ERV-K copies are being purged from the genome. This is an unknowable speculation on your part and on that of the researcher. You would need to have human DNA that was thousands of years old that you could compare with DNA of a direct descendent to even begin to make that claim credible - something that you don't have and likely can't get as DNA starts to be degraded almost immediately. In response to that you state that DNA greater than 5,000 years old has already been obtained and this date is deduced by (drumroll) assuming that evolution is true! So you assume evolution is true, and reason around in a circle to prove that evolution is true? Why waste time? Just embrace the napkin religion: It's the only true religion, which you can know because it says so right on the napkin!! Now as for genetic diversity. How do you know, for example, that the child wasn't conceived as a result of an incestuous relationship between brother and sister or father and daughter?

Ok, here is the conclusion of the link you provided on methodologies of creating calibration curves based on dendrochronology. What a bafoon you are. I did not say that - and I don-t care what newspapers print. Ok, so lets look at it then: I posted a whole host of predictions that evolution makes. They are confirmed all the time with new findings. Sooo, the predictions are tested all the time and so is the theory. Science does not require a theory to be tested in a laboratory. We can have this argument if you want, but you will lose if we do. Well this is an outright dumb thing to say. I can think of a million things we could find to falsify evolution. Its not fair to claim that something is no falsifiable just because you've been unable to falsify it! Sure it is. Lets experiment on the Neandertal genome. I hypothesize, based on fossil evidence that Neandertals were interbreeding with homo sapiens. This is based on a sudden explosion in Neandertal art at a time when their numbers were dwindling and homo sapiens numbers were increasing. Lets run an experiment that compares the two genomes to see. And......what do we find??? I think you know by now. Ok, and you are a religious nut. At least I back up why I believe what I believe.

Listen very carefully, or read rather....ALL PRIMATES ALIVE TODAY POSSESS ERV K WITHIN THEIR GENOME. PLEASE GET THIS THROUGH YOUR THICK 2% NEANDERTAL SKULL. Wow, you are so desperate!! Ok, look at it this way (I feel like i'm explaining this to my 4 year old): Say I have 1,000 genes. Of those genes I have one copy from both parents - so two total copies. Now, some of the time I would expect those copies to be different, and sometimes the same. The frequency at which like genes occur will give me an idea as to how many different copies there are within the total genome. EVEN if the parents were brother and sister, their genes STILL reflect what THEY inherited from THEIR parents. So, are you getting it? Now, of those 1,000 genes, the copies are like 33% of the time. Therefore, I can deduce that there are on average three copies of each gene exist within the gene pool. So what happens if you have a father and daughter having a child? Well, it doesn't matter because it would be statistically the same as JUST looking at the father or just looking at the daughter!","Zosimus","469271","Dear Databed, You are using a system (science) that is known to be based on a logical fallacy. Nowadays almost every scientist that you speak to about the problem of induction will either shift uncomfortably in his seat and change the subject, go red in the face and insult you, or say that he is a Bayesian. Now you may be wondering exactly what the Bayesian approach to the philosophy of science is, exactly. Don't worry you can easily read it at http://www.strevens.org/research/sim...lity/Bayes.pdf and if you can't understand the math you can always go to https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability and watch a video on statistics and probability. What I posted in the post was my calculation of the subjective probability of neo-Darwinism (commonly called the modern evolutionary synthesis) which I have called ""evolution"" since the beginning of the thread. Now I am really surprised that I do some math and your only response is ""So stupid..."" Let's try again, but from your point of view. Since you are a true believer in evolution we will assign the probability of evolution P(H) to 100% i.e., 1. Now we will look at A HERV-K provirus in chimpanzees, bonobos and gori... [Curr Biol. 2001] - PubMed - NCBI in which we find that there is an HERV-K in chimps, bonobos, and gorillas but NOT in humans. Now since the theory of common descent argues that HERV-Ks found in chimps and gorillas should also show up in humans (since we theorize that the HERV-K infected first the ancestors of gorillas and chimps, this explaining why they both have the HERV-K), this finding obviously poses a problem for the theory of common descent, which is a subset of the theory of evolution. Now we want to do the calculation of the probability of evolution given the evidence, which we'll say P(H|E). Those of us who paid attention in statistics class know that P(H|E) = (P(H)*P(E|H)) / P(E). Now we need to figure out the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. I think we can agree that it's quite low. If humans, gorillas, chimps, and bonobos share a common ancestor then it's pretty unlikely that gorillas, chimps, and bonobos will share an HERV-K while humans don't. Let's say 5 percent. Now we need to calculate the probability of the evidence. Since P(H)=1 the math is quite easy. We know that 80 percent of non-randomized published studies are wrong so we can just use P(E) at 0.2. Now the math! P(H|E) = 5% / 20% = 25 percent. So if you were a rational, well-informed and open-minded human being, that's the subjective probability you should assign to evolution after seeing this study. Now, of course, you're not. Evolution is absolutely essential to your worldview so you have zero interest in a rational response to this study, especially if it might require you to take non-evolutionary theories seriously. Now regarding 14 C concentrations in the atmosphere, I tried searching for them by going to Google but as you can see no information springs to hand immediately. So I tried another search and only found New Research Documents Extremely High Atmospheric Carbon 14 During Last Ice Age | UANews which doesn't contain actual data. Now if you have the actual data, then let's put it up here so we can go over the math until everyone is satisfied. As for 14 C and dendrochronology I refer you back to the original link I posted when this whole thing started: Carbon Dating 2 and I quote: Unfortunately, this method of calibrating Carbon dating by using tree-ring dating is itself flawed. Dr Walt Brown explains, ""links are established based on the judgment of a tree-ring specialist. Sometimes 'missing' rings are added Standard statistical techniques could establish how well the dozen supposedly overlapping tree-ring sequences fit. However, tree ring specialists have refused to subject their judgments to these statistical tests and would not release their data so others can do these statistical tests"" (Walt Brown, In the Beginning, 2001, p. 246). This refusal to submit their work to close scrutiny raises a reasonable concern, especially in light of the apparent circular reasoning employed by the researchers. ""Wood specimens considered for 'long chronologies' are first radiocarbon dated. If the date is old enough (perhaps by an erroneous reading), tree-ring specialists look at ring thicknesses for a way to extend the 'long chronology'. This chronology is then used to assure the public that radiocarbon dating has been calibrated by a continuous sequence of tree rings. So I ask you now: If these matches are so good, what's wrong with releasing the data so they can be analyzed statistically to ensure that everything is on the up and up and that they're not just fabricating what they need to make things work out as they want? Sorry if this seems tedious to you, but I want my science to be clear, unbiased, and reproducible. Finally, as I have said before, evolution is unfalsifiable. Let's look at the theory of natural selection. It is supposed that those animals who are fittest will tend to survive and produce more offspring. The question is: Which ones are the fittest? To test this let's suppose that we take an island with certain finches and release a breeding pair of domestic housecats on that island. What will happen? Well, perhaps the cats will fail to get enough food and will die without breeding. Perhaps the finches will be completely wiped out. Perhaps the cats will reach a certain equilibrium state where they eat some finches but some finches survive. Perhaps finches with certain features will survive. The problem is this: No matter what outcome is determined, pro-evolutionist apologists will claim that their theory has been 'confirmed.' No matter what happens the results will be judged as perfectly in line with the theory of natural selection. This is because the theory of natural selection makes no predictions ahead of time; rather it is a method for rationalizing the results after they have been found. Finally, I must completely misunderstand what you mean in terms of a child having two sets of the genome. They do not, of course, they have one set - half from each parent. Accordingly there is no way of knowing from a child's DNA more than half of what his parents' DNA was comprised of, and this will be no more than 25 percent of what his grandparents' DNA was like.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","10:23 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","266"

There are thousands of ERVs that have been identified so far and I've no doubt more are discovered every day. A simple look at Human Retroviruses - Medical Microbiology - NCBI Bookshelf reveals the claim that ""The human genome contains between 1001,000 copies of such viruses and many of them have become pseudogenes or have various defects."" Now in English when we put ""es"" on the end of the word ""virus"" this signifies the plural. In other words, we are not talking about one virus but rather many. Now you claim that humans have ERV-K in their genome but this just illustrates how little you truly understand about what you are talking about. All ERVs in humans are called HERVs (human endogenous retroviruses). A look at HERV-K: the biolo... [J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol. 1996] - PubMed - NCBI reveals the claim, ""The human genome contains a wide variety of endogenous retrovirus-like sequences. The human endogenous retrovirus type K (HERV-K) family comprises 30-50 members per haploid genome in humans and is highly conserved in Old World monkeys and apes."" A look at http://vir.sgmjournals.org/content/89/2/567.full.pdf shows information about HERV-K113 which is just one of 30 in the human genome. What does this mean, if anything? In my opinion, finding HERV-K doesn't mean much at all for several reasons. First of all, evolutionary theory never predicted finding HERV-K in humans and similar copies in apes so there is no way that this can be counted as confirmation for the theory of evolution. It is, rather, a sign that the theory of evolution is flexible enough to admit almost any evidence that is found. But what does this really prove? No more than that any event can be viewed through the paradigm of Darwinism. Now in your most-recent post you have indicated that you think that I believe that humans don't have ERV-K (as though there were only one and not many). May I be so bold as to suggest that you stop regurgitating evolutionary propoganda willy nilly without understanding it and instead actually do some reading and try to understand what you are spouting instead of just calling people who disagree with you liars? As I pointed out at http://vir.sgmjournals.org/content/89/2/567.full.pdf there is a (supposedly human) HERV-K provirus that is found in chimps, bonobos, and gorillas but not humans. This finding is not consistent with the theory of common descent as you find it in textbooks today. Undaunted our researchers have an ad hoc hypothesis to explain it all away. You see, the researcher argues, this finding makes perfect sense if at first humans and chimps diverged and later that chimp ancestor further diverged to create gorillas, bonobos, and chimps. This is not the only ad hoc hypothesis floating around. If you were smart and knew how to use Google instead of just babbling incoherently about how I must be a closet Christian, you would have found http://ervs-viruses-or-design.wikisp...but+not+humans in the which the author of the paper concludes, ""In other words, common ERVs testify to common ancestors, while the absence of a common ERV does not falsify common ancestry."" Now if you had a brain you would be able to make arguments like this. That would let this ""debate"" (if we can call it that) actually become interesting and intellectually stimulating and then I would be satisfied with this forum.

"01-22-2013","21431",19,"Zosimus","469322","Databed, What does ERV mean? ERV simply means endogenous retrovirus. Any creature could have an ERV in it. There are thousands of ERVs that have been identified so far and I've no doubt more are discovered every day. A simple look at Human Retroviruses - Medical Microbiology - NCBI Bookshelf reveals the claim that ""The human genome contains between 1001,000 copies of such viruses and many of them have become pseudogenes or have various defects."" Now in English when we put ""es"" on the end of the word ""virus"" this signifies the plural. In other words, we are not talking about one virus but rather many. Now you claim that humans have ERV-K in their genome but this just illustrates how little you truly understand about what you are talking about. All ERVs in humans are called HERVs (human endogenous retroviruses). A look at HERV-K: the biolo... [J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol. 1996] - PubMed - NCBI reveals the claim, ""The human genome contains a wide variety of endogenous retrovirus-like sequences. The human endogenous retrovirus type K (HERV-K) family comprises 30-50 members per haploid genome in humans and is highly conserved in Old World monkeys and apes."" A look at http://vir.sgmjournals.org/content/89/2/567.full.pdf shows information about HERV-K113 which is just one of 30 in the human genome. What does this mean, if anything? In my opinion, finding HERV-K doesn't mean much at all for several reasons. First of all, evolutionary theory never predicted finding HERV-K in humans and similar copies in apes so there is no way that this can be counted as confirmation for the theory of evolution. It is, rather, a sign that the theory of evolution is flexible enough to admit almost any evidence that is found. But what does this really prove? No more than that any event can be viewed through the paradigm of Darwinism. Now in your most-recent post you have indicated that you think that I believe that humans don't have ERV-K (as though there were only one and not many). May I be so bold as to suggest that you stop regurgitating evolutionary propoganda willy nilly without understanding it and instead actually do some reading and try to understand what you are spouting instead of just calling people who disagree with you liars? As I pointed out at http://vir.sgmjournals.org/content/89/2/567.full.pdf there is a (supposedly human) HERV-K provirus that is found in chimps, bonobos, and gorillas but not humans. This finding is not consistent with the theory of common descent as you find it in textbooks today. Undaunted our researchers have an ad hoc hypothesis to explain it all away. You see, the researcher argues, this finding makes perfect sense if at first humans and chimps diverged and later that chimp ancestor further diverged to create gorillas, bonobos, and chimps. This is not the only ad hoc hypothesis floating around. If you were smart and knew how to use Google instead of just babbling incoherently about how I must be a closet Christian, you would have found http://ervs-viruses-or-design.wikisp...but+not+humans in the which the author of the paper concludes, ""In other words, common ERVs testify to common ancestors, while the absence of a common ERV does not falsify common ancestry."" Now if you had a brain you would be able to make arguments like this. That would let this ""debate"" (if we can call it that) actually become interesting and intellectually stimulating and then I would be satisfied with this forum. Instead it seems like I must hold up both ends of the debate myself! This is really pathetic that I must search for and make your best arguments for you.

So now that you have done a little reading and are no longer claiming that humans do not have ERVK within their genome, we can move on.

ERVK, as I have pointed out previously, is not a point marker that is either present or not present, as you have implied, but rather, it is spread out, duplicated and modified. Each branch of the evolutionary tree since old world monkeys, apes and hominids diverged has its own distinct versions of what is clearly originated from an insertion event within an ancestor common to all three groups. The article you presented, which originated our discussion on specifically ERVK, discussed the scientific finding that human genomes, including that of Neandertal, have been purging ERVK whereas old world monkeys have highly preserved ERVK within their genome. That is it. Nothing inconsistent with evolution there. However, you are using this in an attempt to cast doubt on evolution as if we expect all bearers of ERVK to have exactly the same amount of modification to a genetic pattern and in the exact same way. This is ludicrous because obviously old world monkeys and humans have traversed very different evolutionary paths and you would expect, based on evolution, for them to demonstrate different patterns of genetic change within their genomes. However, evolution also says that since we are cousins, there should be more similarities between our genomes and that of an old world monkey than our genomes and that of a humpback whale. Obviously, this is strong support for evolution because this is in fact what we find. You are right. We have seen enough verification for evolution within scientific findings over our lifetimes. We do not feel the need to confirm evolution any further. In fact, we find people that do need more scientifically dimwitted. No, its like us having seen millions of ravens and each of them is black. Based on this, it is relatively safe to say that all ravens are black. However, since we have seen that all of many species are consistent in color to a very high degree, but sometime demonstrate anomalous coloring based on genetic mutation, we conclude that it cannot be ruled out that a raven could come along that is not black. If a Christian is going to argue that the Bible is infallible, then yes, I will use its obvious contradictions with their argument against them. The difference is that you claim science is not a good method to obtain truth yet you attempt to use it all the time to refute evolution.

Yes, Databed, thats exactly what Im saying. Science is a good tool for detecting bad theories but not for detecting good ones! Thats what falsification means trying to falsify a theory experimentally. If Bill Gates owns Fort Knox, he will be rich. He is rich, therefore he owns Fort Knox. This is a logical fallacy. But if I say If my neighbor owns Fort Knox, he will be rich. He isnt rich, therefore he doesnt own Fort Knox then I am not committing a logical fallacy. This is the essence of Karl Poppers contribution to the philosophy of science. Thats why now everyone says (see Scientific Method ) Scientific theories must be falsifiable . In fact, this concept (falsifiability) is why Einsteins theory of relativity is accepted and Newtons law of gravity is no longer accepted. Newtons theory didnt predict gravitational lensing. Einsteins did and when gravitational lensing was observed Newtons Laws of Gravity were falsified . Now that doesnt mean that Einsteins theory of relativity is known to be right. Not at all! Rather we now know that Newtons Law of Gravity is wrong and that is how science progresses. Unfortunately you just dont seem to get it. You said, having seen millions of ravens and each of them is black. Based on this, it is relatively safe to say that all ravens are black. Well, you may think that all ravens are black but a simple look at http://www.vancouverislandbirds.com/...7ravens061.jpg shows you that millions of confirmations for your theory of all ravens being black didnt prove anything at all . With one single photo of a white raven your bad theory got falsified and thats how science really works. So you can say, The fact is, your religious world view is incompatible with my scientific world view and our ways of thinking are totally different all you want but the only thing I have ever done on this forum was to cite the best understanding and arguments of scientific philosophers like Karl Popper and Imre Lakatos. Then, when they dont agree with you, you fall back on personal attacks and strawman arguments like claiming that I said humans dont have ERV-K in them. Humans have some 30 HERVs. So what? What does that prove? Nothing at all. In fact, a simple look at Sir Karl Popper ""Science as Falsification,"" 1963 shows that Popper said, It is easy to obtain confirmations, or verifications, for nearly every theory if we look for confirmations.Confirming evidence should not count except when it is the result of a genuine test of the theory ; and this means that it can be presented as a serious but unsuccessful attempt to falsify the theory. Now maybe you dont like that idea. Maybe you think Karl Popper was a crackpot, but how do you explain that his essay is featured prominently on the website of a (deceased) evolutionary biologist and one of the most respected popular science writers of our time who spent most of his career teaching at Harvard University? Im sorry that youre so ignorant of what science really is and how it really works, but if you spent more time learning about science and less time putting blind faith in it you wouldnt keep getting pwned so badly in forums like this. Now if you will kindly direct your attention to A HERV-K provirus in chimpanzees, bonobos and gori... [Curr Biol. 2001] - PubMed - NCBI you will read the words: A HERV-K provirus in chimpanzees, bonobos and gorillas, but not humans. Now I realize that you are English-language challenged, but if you think about it for awhile you will come to the right conclusion: Not all of the ERV-Ks found in chimps and gorillas are in humans. This finding casts serious doubts on the claim that ERV-Ks in common among simians is a result of sharing a common ancestor. In short, this finding threatens to falsify the theory of common descent. Of course it is always possible that you (and the scientific world in general) will come up with ad hoc hypotheses in order to escape falsification. Once you start doing so, however, your theory is no better than the theory of astrology that sees numerous confirmations of their theory every day and conveniently ignores or explains away any finding that might falsify it. And this is the category into which I put your claim: obviously old world monkeys and humans have traversed very different evolutionary paths and you would expect, based on evolution, for them to demonstrate different patterns of genetic change within their genomes. However, evolution also says that since we are cousins, there should be more similarities between our genomes and that of an old world monkey than our genomes and that of a humpback whale. Obviously, this is strong support for evolution because this is in fact what we find. You may think that this is strong support for evolution but unless this was a legitimate attempt to falsify the theory of evolution experimentally then nothing found means anything at all. Finally, I mention that at At ""Dendrochronology: Tool of Truth or Deception?"" by Stewart Pollens we have the experience of one Stewart Pollens, violin expert, and his frustration with dendrochronology. In this experience he used a popular software and a book to measure the tree rings on his violin (believed to be aged somewhere between 1540 and 1609). His results came back with an excellent match at 1572 (G index 65.7%). Was this a smashing success for dendrochronology? Not quite his software also showed excellent wiggle matches at 1445, 1463, and 1758 with greater than 99 percent certainty! So if we assume that 1572 is the real date (uncertain) that is 440 years before present (BP). A date of 1758 of 254BP is 57.7 percent off and the 1445 date is 28.9 percent off. Is this the best we can expect from dendrochronology? Apparently so and so youll forgive me if I yawn with boredom instead of swooning with delight. Anyone with half a brain can see that you cannot have 4 dates with 99% certainty the numbers just dont add up. But the fun doesnt stop there! He later tried to match his violin up against another dendrochronology (the LADE Siebenlist Obergurgler) and found the best match in the 1830s!! Then he tried to match up his violin against PCAB Schweingruber Obersaxen and found the best match in 1953. Then he tried to match up his violin against Media 46 and found his best match at 1657. In short, the results were all over the place. So in light of his experiences you will excuse me while I remain skeptical in regard to dendrochronology and, by extension, 14 C dating.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","04:00 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","276"

Plato defined knowledge as ""justified true belief"" that is: 1. P is true. 2. Person S believes P. 3. Person S has good reason to believe P (or is justified in believing it). This is the theory of knowledge = justified true belief. This concept came under attack with the Gettier problems. For example, suppose that Farmer Bill has a cow (Daisy) who is commonly in a certain field eating sedately. Farmer Bill has a bad premonition about his cow and rushes out to the field where he sees a black and white paper in the distance that appears to be a cow eating. Relieved Farmer Bill goes back to the house ""knowing"" that his cow is safe and in the field. In reality his cow is safe and in the field, sleeping well out of sight of Farmer Bill. In this case all three of the above conditions are met, but most of us would feel that Farmer Bill doesn't really know that his cow is safe. He thinks she is because of a false observation that happens to lead him to the right answer. Most people who have thought about it therefore have tacked on an additional requirement, namely that the justifications must also be true and justifiable. In the case of the cow, Farmer Bill's observation of the cow grazing was not true (even though he thought it was) so his belief is not really justifiable and he didn't really know that the cow was safe (although she was).","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","10:20 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","282"

Maybe you could explain how?","Zosimus","469620","Most of what you said in your previous post was nothing more than strawmen arguments. Accordingly I have selected the only crucial sections to reply to. Let us start by summarizing the pro-evolution explanation of HERVs. It is as follows: 1. Chimps and Humans share certain ERVs. 2. The ERVs are located in the same locations. 3. The ERVs entered into the DNA using the reverse transcriptase enzyme. 4. ERVs can enter DNA at any point. Their placement is purely random. 5. Therefore common ERVs between humans and chimps can only be explained by the theory of common descent because the probability that they entered at the exact same place in the DNA merely by chance is astronomically small. As you remember P(H|E) = (P(E|H) * P(H)) / P(E) so by arguing that it is highly unlikely that common ERV locations could have occurred due to chance the pro-evolution camp is arguing that P(E) is quite low and that because of this, P(H|E) will be quite high. The problem with this reasoning is two-fold. First, let's analyze the situation assuming that what they claim is true, to wit: 1. ERVs in the same location is proof of common descent. adding to this we note that: 2. There are certain ERVs shared by gorillas and chimps but not humans. 3. Therefore gorillas and chimps share a common ancestor that humans do not share. Accordingly gorillas, chimps, and humans do not have an ancestor in common. So if we just run by pro-evolutionist assumptions the discovery at A HERV-K provirus in chimpanzees, bonobos and gori... [Curr Biol. 2001] - PubMed - NCBI destroys the theory of common descent. The second problem is that in reality, the assumptions used by pro-evolutionists in the above argument are known to be false. At ScienceDirect.com - FEBS Letters - Perpetually mobile footprints of ancient infections in human genome we read: ""There were identified `hot spots' containing integration sites used up to 280 times more frequently than predicted mathematically.... A recent study of the de novo retroviral integration demonstrated also preference for scaffold- or matrix-attachment regions (S/MARs) flanked by DNA with high bending potential."" So no, the placement of ERVs in DNA is not ""purely random"" as claimed. There are certain locations that the virus is considerably more likely to select. Accordingly the pro-evolutionary calculation of P(E) as low is not consistent with the data. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Regarding dendrochronology, and the article previously posted, the author obviously thought that PCAB Giertz Obergurgler was the master chronology most appropriate for his violin for two reasons: 1. Since it was strongly suspected that his Brescian viola was made by Gasparo da Salo, who died in 1609, he wanted to use a master chronology that started early enough to select a potential date during his lifetime; and 2. The wood that the violin makers were using is believed to have been drawn from the region that the PCAB Giertz Obergurgler covers. At any rate your ad hoc objections to the claim could not possibly apply against the Media 46 master chronology as it is ""a composite derived from over thirty chronologies, including the other three that I used"" and accordingly it will most certainly cover the Italian Alps directly north of Brescia. The author of the article also ruled out statistical problems with the software he used because ""...determining Gleichlufigkeit is fairly straightforward, and it is often the only measurement cited in dendrochronological reports, including those of Peter Klein."" The obvious problem is that it is not possible to have 52 matches of greater than 95 percent probability. Simple math will tell you that at least 50 percent of those matches must have a probability less than 1.92 percent as 1/52 is 1.92 percent. Really the Gleichlufigkeit that was highest (75.3 percent) shows a date of 1805 which is an impossible date since A) violas of that size were no longer being made in the 19th century and B) the varnish pattern closely matches that of other varnishes used in and around the early 18th century (see the varnish pictures on the right hand side of the link). In conclusion although you may think that dendrochronology is a wonderful thing that makes 14 C dating magically accurate, people who have actually tried to use the technique and had experts use it for them, such as the author of the article say, ""I would strongly advise violin historians, authenticators, appraisers, and purchasers to be wary of the dates that are being published in auction catalogs, certificates, and scholarly journals."" Taking his advice to heart I will say that I am also wary of the dates being supplied in scholarly journals such as the ones your supposed ancient DNA relies on.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","10:02 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","284"

Regarding dendrochronology, and the article previously posted, the author obviously thought that PCAB Giertz Obergurgler was the master chronology most appropriate for his violin for two reasons: 1. Since it was strongly suspected that his Brescian viola was made by Gasparo da Salo, who died in 1609, he wanted to use a master chronology that started early enough to select a potential date during his lifetime; and 2. The wood that the violin makers were using is believed to have been drawn from the region that the PCAB Giertz Obergurgler covers. At any rate your ad hoc objections to the claim could not possibly apply against the Media 46 master chronology as it is ""a composite derived from over thirty chronologies, including the other three that I used"" and accordingly it will most certainly cover the Italian Alps directly north of Brescia. The author of the article also ruled out statistical problems with the software he used because ""...determining Gleichlufigkeit is fairly straightforward, and it is often the only measurement cited in dendrochronological reports, including those of Peter Klein."" The obvious problem is that it is not possible to have 52 matches of greater than 95 percent probability. Simple math will tell you that at least 50 percent of those matches must have a probability less than 1.92 percent as 1/52 is 1.92 percent. Really the Gleichlufigkeit that was highest (75.3 percent) shows a date of 1805 which is an impossible date since A) violas of that size were no longer being made in the 19th century and B) the varnish pattern closely matches that of other varnishes used in and around the early 18th century (see the varnish pictures on the right hand side of the link). In conclusion although you may think that dendrochronology is a wonderful thing that makes 14 C dating magically accurate, people who have actually tried to use the technique and had experts use it for them, such as the author of the article say, ""I would strongly advise violin historians, authenticators, appraisers, and purchasers to be wary of the dates that are being published in auction catalogs, certificates, and scholarly journals."" Taking his advice to heart I will say that I am also wary of the dates being supplied in scholarly journals such as the ones your supposed ancient DNA relies on.","Databed","469622","One of my cousins and I share a grandmother.

Plato defined knowledge as ""justified true belief"" that is: 1. P is true. 2. Person S believes P. 3. Person S has good reason to believe P (or is justified in believing it). This is the theory of knowledge = justified true belief. This concept came under attack with the Gettier problems. For example, suppose that Farmer Bill has a cow (Daisy) who is commonly in a certain field eating sedately. Farmer Bill has a bad premonition about his cow and rushes out to the field where he sees a black and white paper in the distance that appears to be a cow eating. Relieved Farmer Bill goes back to the house ""knowing"" that his cow is safe and in the field. In reality his cow is safe and in the field, sleeping well out of sight of Farmer Bill. In this case all three of the above conditions are met, but most of us would feel that Farmer Bill doesn't really know that his cow is safe. He thinks she is because of a false observation that happens to lead him to the right answer. Most people who have thought about it therefore have tacked on an additional requirement, namely that the justifications must also be true and justifiable. In the case of the cow, Farmer Bill's observation of the cow grazing was not true (even though he thought it was) so his belief is not really justifiable and he didn't really know that the cow was safe (although she was).","Accipiter","469632","Suppose that Farmer Bill?

In other words, they are unable to say that the violin was not constructed in 1930 or even more recently. This is because the tree-source of the wood that the violin is made from could have continued to grow well after the most recent growth ring that is represented in the violin was formed. Also, though they do not mention it, the wood could have been stockpiled somewhere before it was used. In addition, the correlations that are given in the first article you posted are made using a particular software and only one set of measurements. The second article you linked to uses multiple measurement made by different people and multiple software titles. Also, the experiment seems to have been carried out in a much more professional and careful manner than that of the first.

[Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006] - PubMed - NCBI shows that ""We report here in vivo and in vitro experiments finding that the envelope of a particular class of ERVs of sheep, endogenous Jaagsiekte sheep retroviruses (enJSRVs), regulates trophectoderm growth and differentiation in the periimplantation conceptus (embryo/fetus and associated extraembryonic membranes). The enJSRV envelope gene is expressed in the trophectoderm of the elongating ovine conceptus after day 12 of pregnancy. Loss-of-function experiments were conducted in utero by injecting morpholino antisense oligonucleotides on day 8 of pregnancy that blocked enJSRV envelope protein production in the conceptus trophectoderm. This approach retarded trophectoderm outgrowth during conceptus elongation and inhibited trophoblast giant binucleate cell differentiation as observed on day 16. Pregnancy loss was observed by day 20 in sheep receiving morpholino antisense oligonucleotides. In vitro inhibition of the enJSRV envelope reduced the proliferation of mononuclear trophectoderm cells isolated from day 15 conceptuses. Consequently, these results demonstrate that the enJSRV envelope regulates trophectoderm growth and differentiation in the periimplantation ovine conceptus."" ---------------------- So first of all, not everyone even agrees that ERVs are retroviruses. Some of them have known functionality and the host cannot survive when the ERV is blocked. A look at http://www.pnas.org/content/101/30/11117.full.pdf shows that ""...some avian and murine ERVs can block infection of related exogenous retroviruses at entry by receptor interference; mouse Fv-1 blocks infection at a preintegration step, also can be viewed as an ERV..."" ---------------------- As for the claim that 280 times isn't enough to overcome the long odds, perhaps you could explain away these long odds: ""If these sites were truly orthologous and, thus, ancestral in the human/ape ancestor, it would require that at least six of these sites were deleted in the human lineage. Moreover, the same exact six sites would also have had to have been deleted in the orangutan lineage if the generally accepted phylogeny is correct. Such a series of independent deletion events at the same precise locations in the genome is unlikely..."" (see Lineage-Specific Expansions of Retroviral Insertions within the Genomes of African Great Apes but Not Humans and Orangutans ). How exactly can you explain that gorillas, chimps, bonobos, etc., have these ERVs whereas humans and orangutans don't? Supposedly humans are not as closely related to orangutans as they are to chimps. The bottom line is simple: ERVs, when examined closely, do not support common descent. ---------------------------- Dendrochronology is explained at Dendrochronology It is not true that only the outer rings are compared. Any rings that (wiggle) match up are counted. This image: ...shows the theory behind it. Supposedly tree 1 can match to tree 2, which matches to tree 3 because the rings are the same. The method of deciding that ring 7 of tree 1 is the same as ring 43 of tree 2 is called 'wiggle matching.' As I have already shown in the former article the biggest problem of 'wiggle matching' is finding multiple matches that supposedly have very high statistical probability. In 1986 D. K.

"02-01-2013","21431",21,"Zosimus","469790","Sorry I haven't responded in awhile. It has been claimed that HERVs are inactive retroviruses that have lost functionality due to mutations. A simple look at Endogenous retroviruses regulate pe... [Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006] - PubMed - NCBI shows that ""We report here in vivo and in vitro experiments finding that the envelope of a particular class of ERVs of sheep, endogenous Jaagsiekte sheep retroviruses (enJSRVs), regulates trophectoderm growth and differentiation in the periimplantation conceptus (embryo/fetus and associated extraembryonic membranes). The enJSRV envelope gene is expressed in the trophectoderm of the elongating ovine conceptus after day 12 of pregnancy. Loss-of-function experiments were conducted in utero by injecting morpholino antisense oligonucleotides on day 8 of pregnancy that blocked enJSRV envelope protein production in the conceptus trophectoderm. This approach retarded trophectoderm outgrowth during conceptus elongation and inhibited trophoblast giant binucleate cell differentiation as observed on day 16. Pregnancy loss was observed by day 20 in sheep receiving morpholino antisense oligonucleotides. In vitro inhibition of the enJSRV envelope reduced the proliferation of mononuclear trophectoderm cells isolated from day 15 conceptuses. Consequently, these results demonstrate that the enJSRV envelope regulates trophectoderm growth and differentiation in the periimplantation ovine conceptus."" ---------------------- So first of all, not everyone even agrees that ERVs are retroviruses. Some of them have known functionality and the host cannot survive when the ERV is blocked. A look at http://www.pnas.org/content/101/30/11117.full.pdf shows that ""...some avian and murine ERVs can block infection of related exogenous retroviruses at entry by receptor interference; mouse Fv-1 blocks infection at a preintegration step, also can be viewed as an ERV..."" ---------------------- As for the claim that 280 times isn't enough to overcome the long odds, perhaps you could explain away these long odds: ""If these sites were truly orthologous and, thus, ancestral in the human/ape ancestor, it would require that at least six of these sites were deleted in the human lineage. Moreover, the same exact six sites would also have had to have been deleted in the orangutan lineage if the generally accepted phylogeny is correct. Such a series of independent deletion events at the same precise locations in the genome is unlikely..."" (see Lineage-Specific Expansions of Retroviral Insertions within the Genomes of African Great Apes but Not Humans and Orangutans ). How exactly can you explain that gorillas, chimps, bonobos, etc., have these ERVs whereas humans and orangutans don't? Supposedly humans are not as closely related to orangutans as they are to chimps. The bottom line is simple: ERVs, when examined closely, do not support common descent. ---------------------------- Dendrochronology is explained at Dendrochronology It is not true that only the outer rings are compared. Any rings that (wiggle) match up are counted. This image: ...shows the theory behind it. Supposedly tree 1 can match to tree 2, which matches to tree 3 because the rings are the same. The method of deciding that ring 7 of tree 1 is the same as ring 43 of tree 2 is called 'wiggle matching.' As I have already shown in the former article the biggest problem of 'wiggle matching' is finding multiple matches that supposedly have very high statistical probability. In 1986 D. K.

These t-values are considerably lower than those obtained for some of the historically incorrect dates produced by Yamaguchi's experiment."" The paper has links to his sources for this information. One of those links is http://www.informath.org/ATSU04a.pdf which states: Quote: The most commonly-used method for statistically matching tree rings relies on what are called t-scores. (The t-score is detailed in most introductory statistics texts; it is closely related to the coefficient of correlation.) In principle, a t-score is just a way of giving a confidence level assuming the following: 3 the ring width in one year is independent of ring widths in other years, and ring widths have the same normal (i.e. bell-shaped) probability distribution. The first assumption is well known to be false (because the environment in one growing season affects the tree not only in that growing season but also in the next). Experience with the t-score method indicates that it can nonetheless work well, provided that it is used in a manner appropriate for tree rings. Broadly speaking, a t-score above 3.5 is considered to indicate a tree-ring match. A t-score above 5.0 would be considered as implying a certain match by most tree-ring specialists. (These levels for t-scores are conventional; for critical discussion of how good those conventions are, see Section 5.) Another statistical method used in tree-ring matching relies on what I will call gscores. (The g-score is commonly called gleichlufigkeit [Schweingruber, 1989] or trend.) The g-score is the proportion (or percentage) of years in which two trees ring widths increased or decreased together (i.e. increased or decreased from the prior year). This method thus ignores the size of the increase or decrease. Because it ignores so much information, the g-score method might be expected to be less reliable than the tscore method. Experience at Hohenheim, Germany, where g-scores were previously used, seems to support this: matches were thrice found to be in error, each time after strong assertions of reliability [Baillie, 1995: ch.2; Spurk et al., 1998]. Early trials in Ireland also indicated problems, and the method was abandoned there A third statistical method used in tree-ring matching is the linear time series method. Very briefly, this method is similar to the t-score method, except that the first assumption of t-scores (ring widths are independent of each other) is replaced by this: the ring width in one year is linearly-dependent on ring widths of prior years. This assumption is much more realistic than the first t-score assumption, though still not fully accurate (because the growth mechanism of tree rings is more complicated). 1 Among the three methods, then, the linear time series method is the best. That method, however, is not widely used in tree-ring studies. The reason for this is unclear (perhaps it is convention). The linear time series method was developed, in the 1970s, as a general tool for statistical analyses. Research papers applying it to tree rings appeared in the 1980s [Monserud, 1986; Yamaguchi, 1986; Biondi & Swetnam, 1987]. And the method is nowadays taught in first-year graduate courses at what is often considered to be the worlds leading institution for tree-ring studies, the University of Arizona Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research.

A theory seeks to explain not only what happens but why it happens. The standard theory of capacitors is that they are composed of metal and that atoms naturally seek to have a full (usually an octet) of electrons in their shells. Since metals have (it is theorized) either +1 or +2 electrons over filling their suborbital (either p or d) these electrons have the tendency to move around quite freely forming a full suborbital on one and later on another in kind of a random fashion. Now the theory of capacitors is that as a direct current voltage is applied to the capacitor that initially a large number of electrons will rush onto the plates initially than smaller and smaller numbers as the plate becomes more and more saturated with electrons and there is greater and greater resistance to storing more electrons there. This is what is called ""electron flow theory."" However, when I was in college they didn't teach us that, rather we learned what was called ""conventional flow theory."" That is we learned that the positive side could be compared to a glass of water with some holes so that it flowed out at a certain rate. This is far easier to visualize (something flowing from a high point to a low point) and has the additional advantage that the symbols for diodes show an arrow pointing the way that the current can flow (provided, of course, that you use conventional flow - not electron flow). Our teachers freely told us that what they were teaching us wasn't in accordance with the latest theories of how electronics worked and then told us to learn their method anyway. Really it doesn't matter - both methods lead you (usually) to correct conclusions about the circuit in question. Nevertheless, I must admit that there were times when we were in the lab and things didn't go according to what was represented in our books. Sometimes our amplifiers didn't amplify and our oscillators didn't oscillate. Even though we were sure we were biasing our class A amplifiers at midpoint they saturated before they cut off. What can I tell you? I very quickly learned that you did the best you could and when your circuit didn't work out you faked your numbers, turned it in, and still got good grades. Now I cannot tell you why the circuits didn't always work out. Were the circuits shown in our books simply badly designed? Were our resistors or FETs out of tolerance? Did our breadboards lack conductivity in certain spots? No one knows and no one cares - they use class B amplifiers in car stereos anyway and if it's not perfectly biased no one's going to know the difference plus you can always blame it on poor manufacturing processes in China and still pick up your paycheck. But I do want to talk about what is called the ""God of the Gaps"" logical fallacy. There are some people who say, ""Since you cannot think of an explanation for (x) you must agree with me when I claim that God did (x)."" This is a special form of the argumentum ad ignorantiam logical fallacy. Yet really what you are doing is basically the same thing. Let's suppose that tomorrow you come up with some other (non-electronic) argument and I cannot provide an alternate theory that explains why something occurs. This does not mean that your theory is the only one. There may be other people in the world who have alternate theories or, even if there aren't, someone may come up with an alternate theory tomorrow or a hundred years in the future that ends up being accepted as the real explanation long after we're dead. When Newton launched his Law of Universal Gravitation no one had thought that maybe space was curved or that atomic particles contained gravitons. It wasn't until after Einstein was born and Max Planck did his experiments that these ideas became popular. A simple look at Spokane Daily Chronicle - Google News Archive Search shows that in 1937 people still thought that radio waves travelled through an ""ether"" and praised Marconi for figuring out a way to make a radio to transmit waves through this ether. No one believes in luminiferous ether any more, but Marconi's radio worked just fine regardless of the theory used to explain it.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","01:36 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","330"

But let's play this out and see how it goes. I'm Peruvian but I was born in California and have dual citizenship. I lived in Los Angeles for 31 years before coming to Peru and I'm still here. I had planned to get a job working in a mine (I have a B.S.E.E. from Harvey Mudd) but I didn't realize until I got here that they want you to have several years of experience working in mines and the mining industry so I found it hard to get interviews. Almost immediately after arriving I got picked up by Business Links E.I.R.L. as an English Teacher and got trained by them on how to do it. They were paying $9-$12 and at the time the dollar/sol exchange rate was 3.5 so I lived quite well. Really, though, I knew nothing about teaching languages except what they'd taught me in a two-week 20-hour crash course. Still, I believed that I had been taught the best method available. One of my trainers had a CELTA and the other one had a TESOL. These are highly-recognized qualifications issued by top universities in the UK. So I figured, ""These guys are not slouches."" But one day I was contacted by a marketing guy. He had convinced a group of occupational therapists to sign up to get English language lessons from him but didn't have a teacher. He offered me S/.45 to teach them, which at that time and exchange rate was about double what Business Links was paying so I immediately accepted. Then he dropped the bombshell on me: He wanted me to use the ""natural approach."" I knew nothing about it, but I googled it and I found out it was invented in the 1970s. So here I was committed to teaching people using a method 40 years out of date!! All the guy did was go to the Voice of America website, download some audio and I had to get them to listen to it 2-3 times, explain the words they didn't know (in English) and then move on to the next audio. We didn't teach any grammar, all vocabulary was incidental, no pronunciation, no speaking, no writing - nothing! I really thought it would be a total crash-and-burn scenario. All my fellow teachers told me it wouldn't work and that I was a glutton for punishment but the money was good and my wife was pregnant with our second child so I figured that I should ""get while the gettin' 's good"" and I did exactly what he told me to do. Do you know what happened? They learned - that's what happened. From what I could see the very best, Oxford-blessed standard method was fundamentally no better than the natural approach. It also turned out that the communicative language approach was also popularized in the 1970s. I started to delve into it and a simple read of http://seas3.elte.hu/coursematerial/...olna/Swan2.pdf was rather sobering. So then I thought, ""Since this is my new profession, I need to learn to do it right. Let's do this scientifically"" (that was back when I believed in science). So I googled ""L2 language acquisition studies"" and found about 2.5 million hits and I started with the first link and worked my way down the list. Yet the more I read the less I knew. One study showed that the best way was to use extensive reading to add vocabulary (see http://www.ic.nanzan-u.ac.jp/tandai/...125_Harris.pdf ) ""The study is conclusive evidence that extensive reading increases readers sight vocabulary and improves the rate of readers schemata acquisition."" So I highlighted that and went on but the following studies like http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~kims/assi...sjkling550.pdf said things like, ""...the researchers did not measure whether a gain of two correct nadsat vocabulary answers was statistically significant"" and concluded ""One way to summarize this research is to conclude that unintentionally acquired words arrive in modest and unpredictable increments."" Cheerful. So that must mean the other way is the right way to do it, right? So then I learned about the Involvement Load Hypothesis only to find at the end: ""Interestingly, when participant scores were normalized to reflect time on task, there were no statistically significant differences in vocabulary learned per minute between the groups."" Well, isn't that great? We have two teams arguing back and forth about the best way to teach people something but when you put their studies side by side and take a serious look you see that fundamentally there's no difference anyway. "" So then when I complained to a friend he suggested that I take a look at PLOS Medicine: Why Most Published Research Findings Are False where I find out that most published research findings are false anyway!

There is similarly no such thing as dark matter or dark energy. 2. The solar system did not form in the way most people think. Had it really happened the way I was told in high school then Mercury wouldn't have a magnetic field, Venus wouldn't have a retrograde motion, and the Earth and Venus would not be tidally locked. 3. Comets are not big balls of ice that melt as they get near the sun creating a long tail. A simple look at Comet Lovejoy Survives Fiery Plunge Through Sun, NASA Says | Comet Lovejoy (C/2011 W3) | Kreutz Sungrazing Comets | Space.com shows that. 4. The sun is not primarily fusion powered. The solar neutrino problem has made that obvious for decades. No standard model of the sun can explain why the sun goes through an 11-year sunspot cycle that also coincides with its power output, nor can it explain why the corona is hotter than the surface of the sun nor why when we see sunspots we see a darker (cooler) interior of the sun. That's not even touching on Birkeland Currents being observed in the corona. 5. There's no such thing as man-made global warming. The Earth is cooling and that's a very bad thing. I wish there were global warming - it would mean less dead children in Puno this year. Anyone who thinks that human beings, through their production of carbon dioxide can warm the whole planet are severely deluded. Insects produce more carbon dioxide than all human activities combined and anyway if carbon dioxide were a problem there already is a simple solution: Stop recycling paper. Every scrap of paper buried in a landfill is less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Yet every environmental whacko fully supports recycling. It sounds completely crazy until you realize that environmentalism is a religion. The earth is sacred and worthy of worship, humans sin just by breathing, recycling is an atoning ritual, and environmentalism even has holy days, food restrictions, and end-of-the-earth doomsday scenarios just like Christianity or Judaism. If you don't call it a religion, what are you going to call it? 6. No one can explain why the ocean is salty. It's true that the Earth's crust contains sodium, but not much chlorine. The vast majority of sodium flowing into the ocean is in the form of sodium carbonates at 80 percent with less than 7 percent being chlorides. Yet the ocean is composed of 89 percent chlorides and only 0.2 percent carbonates. The above plus neo-Darwinism and English language teaching theories are just subsets of my main theory of life and science: Science is wrong about almost everything and this is not a secret. A simple web search can show that every major scientific theory is not only wrong but known to be wrong.

That's not even touching on Birkeland Currents being observed in the corona. 5. There's no such thing as man-made global warming. The Earth is cooling and that's a very bad thing. I wish there were global warming - it would mean less dead children in Puno this year. Anyone who thinks that human beings, through their production of carbon dioxide can warm the whole planet are severely deluded. Insects produce more carbon dioxide than all human activities combined and anyway if carbon dioxide were a problem there already is a simple solution: Stop recycling paper. Every scrap of paper buried in a landfill is less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Yet every environmental whacko fully supports recycling. It sounds completely crazy until you realize that environmentalism is a religion. The earth is sacred and worthy of worship, humans sin just by breathing, recycling is an atoning ritual, and environmentalism even has holy days, food restrictions, and end-of-the-earth doomsday scenarios just like Christianity or Judaism. If you don't call it a religion, what are you going to call it? 6. No one can explain why the ocean is salty. It's true that the Earth's crust contains sodium, but not much chlorine. The vast majority of sodium flowing into the ocean is in the form of sodium carbonates at 80 percent with less than 7 percent being chlorides. Yet the ocean is composed of 89 percent chlorides and only 0.2 percent carbonates. The above plus neo-Darwinism and English language teaching theories are just subsets of my main theory of life and science: Science is wrong about almost everything and this is not a secret.

There is similarly no such thing as dark matter or dark energy. 2. The solar system did not form in the way most people think. Had it really happened the way I was told in high school then Mercury wouldn't have a magnetic field, Venus wouldn't have a retrograde motion, and the Earth and Venus would not be tidally locked. 3. Comets are not big balls of ice that melt as they get near the sun creating a long tail. A simple look at Comet Lovejoy Survives Fiery Plunge Through Sun, NASA Says | Comet Lovejoy (C/2011 W3) | Kreutz Sungrazing Comets | Space.com shows that. 4. The sun is not primarily fusion powered.

The naivety in this statement is laughable. I would really like to hear your reasoning because with this statement alone it is clear you have no idea what dark matter and dark energy even refers to. That being said, please elaborate-I can't wait. You think that our models of solar system formation are not consistent with Mercury having a magnetic field and observed retrograde motion of Venus? What do you mean by Earth and Venus being tidally locked? Further, your back story totally rules out you being taught current solar system formation theories in high school. If you mean theories of star evolution, destruction and rebirth, maybe, but you've already dated yourself. Whatever the case, I would like to know why current theories are inconsistent with observations and what you think current theory is. It has long been known that comets likely have a rocky nucleus. The particular comet was thought to have formed in a way that makes it having a rocky nucleus unlikely. It is not a typical comet being a particular class of sungrazer, that is why astronomers were surprised to see it emerge from its close encounter with the sun in the way it did. The solar neutrino problem was figured out over a decade ago. Further, it was figured out way before that, but the solution was only proven in 2002. Are you really that far behind? As for solar cycles, so what? Scientists have never claimed to know everything. We have theories and a level of confidence associated with our theories. As for the sun not being primarily fusion powered, you are an idiot. Sounds just like typical creationist bs-always accusing people who aren't god fearers, those who base their opinions on what can be shown to be true, to only do so because they have faith in no religion. Um, well the oceans have salt, so there you have it. Not really concerned with what's locked up in the crust. Are you of the opinion that all salt originated from rocks and must maintain the same concentrations in water as that found in rocks? What do you base this on? And about making airplanes fly, placing astronauts on the moon, making your computer work, giving you almost instant communication to any spot on earth, building bridges that span thousands of feet and thousand foot buildings that can survive a >8 magnitude earthquake, making engines that can go more than 50 miles to a gallon of gasoline, making your tube tv picture clear, making cell phone technology work, guiding missiles around the earth, giving you instant coordinates of where you are on the planet anywhere on the planet, curing diseases, building the periodic table, powering entire cities with a single nuclear power plant, etc etc. oh, I bet you have no problem whatsoever with this science. Oh yeah, only the sciences that infringe on either your creation story or your religious philosophy is wrong now I bet. Only, modern cosmology, evolution and pretty much anything that seeks to explain what science hasn't already explained. Those sciences are ALL wrong. You really make me sick.

Miller, Jr., MD Second, you have questions about what I've posted. Let's start there. Supposedly in 1929 Edwin Hubble determined that the universe is expanding. From The Expanding Universe we read: ""In 1929 Edwin Hubble, working at the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, California, measured the redshifts of a number of distant galaxies. He also measured their relative distances by measuring the apparent brightness of a class of variable stars called Cepheids in each galaxy. When he plotted redshift against relative distance, he found that the redshift of distant galaxies increased as a linear function of their distance. The only explanation for this observation is that the universe was expanding. ""Once scientists understood that the universe was expanding, they immediately realized that it would have been smaller in the past. At some point in the past, the entire universe would have been a single point. This point, later called the big bang, was the beginning of the universe as we understand it today."" The problem with this theory is a galaxy known as NGC 7319. As you can see below: We have a high redshift quasar (z=2.11) visible in the middle of the NGC 7319 galaxy (z=0.0225). Now according to the Big Bang theory this is simply not possible because the quasar must have been ejected from the Big Bang first and must be travelling at a very high relativistic speed in order to generate that much red shift. As such it must be far beyond the low redshift galaxy yet it is clearly visible. Some comment about the photo can be found at Observation of a high redshift quasar in the low redshift galaxy NGC 7319 could refute black hole theory The explanation for what we see is unknown. The person who took the photo (Halton Arp) is actually a very accomplished astronomer with a Ph.D. from CalTech. Thanks to his Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies we know a lot more about what's going on out there than we would without him. However, science is never happy when you discover things that aren't on the approved discovery list so he has been denied any further access to telescopes in the US but has found a home in exile at the Max Planck Institute in Germany. Of course, anyone who knows much about science realizes that this is standard operating procedure for science. Just take a look at Ohm, Doppler, or Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. Finally Venus is tidally locked with the Earth. If you don't know what that means, let me explain: Venus's 583.92-day interval between successive close approaches to the Earth is equal to 5.001444 Venusian solar days, making the same face visible from Earth at each close approach and that's what I mean when I say ""tidally locked."" If you need to know more, try Tidal locking - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia which also explains how this happens. Now anyone who knows much about tidal locking will tell you that this happens when two planets are very close (as close as a moon and a planet) and gravity causes this lock to happen in the same way that our own moon is tidally locked. However science denies that Venus ever made close passes on the Earth and those people who suggest that it may have happened get their own ""Velikovsky affair"" wherein scientists exerted such extreme pressure on his publisher (Macmillan) through threatening to stop buying their textbooks unless they censored him. They even went to far as to have Carl Sagan supposedly debate him, but in reality Sagan simply launched an attack on his ideas and when Velikovsky showed up Sagan made himself scarce so no debate actually happened.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","12:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","353"

Why do you always feel the need for the remedial lecture on such basic concepts? First off, I want to point out that NGC 7319 is part of its own local group. Comparing red shift between the group, objects within the group, objects within a galaxy or objects within our own galaxy does not follow Hubble's law as these are gravitationally bound bodies. Therefore, they can influence each other and relative red shifts will not be inherited from the original Big Bang event. I want to point this out because you seem to be implying that all objects in the universe must follow Hubble's law. Another lesson for you: galaxies, though they appear solid, are extremely diffuse. Think about how tiny our sun is compared to vast distance to the next closest star. The numbers are actually astronomically in favor of the Sun, given the eventual collision of the Milky Way and Andromeda, surviving unscathed. It's not just likely that the Sun will survive, it's just about guaranteed. That being said, why would it be surprising to see a quasar, an immensely energetic celestial object that can be seen from clear across the universe, peeking from behind another galaxy? The answer is that it is not at all surprising and actually, not sure why you would choose this particular instance, but it happens all the time. Halton Arp was active in astronomy decades ago. While his ideas may have carried some promise in the sixties, trust me, we now understand what quasars are. If quasars really did still exist locally, we would know it 100%. Believe me, they don't. Halton Arp's theory of red shift relies on quasars being completely mischaracterized today. Yes! You are right! Science often starts off with much doubt in theories that later come to be accepted. Unlike your religious beliefs, scientific theories have to fight, survive, struggle and eventually be right in order to come out on top. There are many that don't make it. Halton Arp falls in this category. Wow, you would bring up Velikovsky, a man who's life mission was to discredit scientific explanation of pretty much anything that didn't agree with biblical history. What's more, of course, he's a very religious man who claimed that Venus is actually a comet ejected by Jupiter. I wasn't aware of a debate with Sagan, but trust me, if Sagan turned down the opportunity it was because Veikovsky was not worth his time. I know what tidal locking is. I would like to start by saying that you can't see the face of Venus and I can find no source that says Venus always faces Earth in the same way on each close encounter. There is an 8 year cycle between Venus and Earth due to the peculiar fact that 8 Earth years is almost exactly equal to 13 Venusian years, give or take a day or two. Not sure why this is, but it certainly doesn't discredit our theories on how solar systems are formed. I'd like to clear something up, unless you specifically state ""theories of OUR solar system formation,"" anyone who knows anything is going to take that to mean in the general sense. That is, how solar systems are formed in general . Arguing over the specifics of how our solar system was formed is pointless to our line of discussion and does nothing to change how we think about the evolution of the universe, the theories explaining it or the laws governing it. I think you might want to choose a different angle of attack here. I promise that if this is the best you got, recycling something you've grabbed off of the website of some philosopher who has some kind of crazy electrical fetish, it is just not going to cut it here.

Maybe you should do a little research into what tidal locking actually is. Even a quick read of the wiki link you seemed to think that I needed in order to understand what tidal locking is would serve you well? Secondly, the fact that Venus shows us roughly the same face at every closest approach is merely a coincidence. Maybe if you did a little research you into the actual numbers (please don't use a bunch of whole numbers as these are not precise enough for this) you would find that you are in fact wrong. Venus rotates very slowly and every time we do come to our closest approach, it has rotated a little further compared to the previous approach. So, you are, yet again, wrong. Both reasons are laughable. To say ""the dust in this part of the galaxy is so dense"" without being able to see it is never done, especially for an object located so far from the galactic center. I can't see any dust in that picture in that area - I can see some near that area, but not where the quasar is. No astronomer who knows anything would ever make this statement or agree with the conclusion drawn from it. I do see the trail of dust referenced, but it terminates before it gets to the quasar. It points to it, but it doesn't even seem to reach it. Further, there are trails of dust all over galaxies and they are clearly visible. Just because a quasar, which there are literally millions visible, happens to fall near the end of one of them, some quack from the 60's and 70's is going to jump on this and start claiming that comets get ejected by gas giants and that high red shift quasars are spit out of local galactic centers. Then, all it takes is for some conspiracy theorist to dig this stuff up and then a bunch of other dumb shits to buy into it on the basis it helps them feel better about an evil way of thinking that contradicts their beliefs necessary to get to heaven or 47 virgins or whatever.

You think the quasar would outshine the entire galaxy if it were part of it. However your logic to reach this conclusion is severely lacking. Let's expand that logic. Quasars are extremely bright. How do you know they are bright? Because they are extremely far away and we wouldn't be able to see them if they weren't so bright. How do you know they are extremely far away? We know that because of the high redshift. But what about this galaxy that has a quasar in front of it? That quasar can't be in front of that galaxy.

Never has there been an observed standard candle luminosity that did not agree with its red shift measurement. This is why we know quasars are far away, not because we know what their luminosity is. It really is this simple. So, if you want to refute Hubble's Law, you need to start here. This should be simple if the law is wrong. Find a single standard candle in the night sky that is not consistent with the law. You should also be able to do a better job of finding associated celestial objects that exhibit variable red shift, not using a few quasars which are well understood in terms of scale and mechanics, and then claiming that, ""See! There is a trail of dust there leading right to it!"" - all while ignoring the fact that there are trails of dust in many places with no quasars and many quasars that are not at the end of a trail of dust! The only thing that you have to use against Hubble's law is a few quasars that happen to fall behind galaxies. What about all the quasars that are high redshift and nowhere near any galaxy let alone a low red-shift one? If you really want to agree with Arp's argument and say that high red shift is associated with the young age of a quasar, then where did these other young quasars come from? Wouldn't you expect there to be a higher probability of finding one behind its parent galaxy rather than alone in space? How do they get away from their parent galaxies in this seeming defiance of gravity? How are they ejected in the first place? How does being young cause high red shift? The answer is, none of this makes sense and you have no answers for these questions. The only thing you have is a grudge against the Big Bang theory because it goes against your religious belief and you have a crush on some guy who's electrical fetish agrees with your beef against mainstream science. Give me a break, you look like a fool to everyone in here supporting things like comets being ejected by Jupiter. By the way, I noticed, just like many other subjects, you have abandoned your claim that Earth and Venus are tidally locked. What's wrong - you just get tired of looking like a fool? You don't want to continue to claim they are locked? Too funny! You would think that for someone to claim to know so much, with so much certainty, you would at least be able to be consistent with the definitions of what you are claiming to know so much about. You can't even get that right, let alone the minute mechanics of the subject required to win a debate.

"04-17-2013","21431",25,"None","None","None","Peeling","472430","Here's why I believe evolution from a common ancestor is the truth: Imagine a friend tells you about this lady he knows, who's the smartest person on the planet by a mile. Smarter than you, smarter than him, smarter than anyone. One day you pay her a visit, expecting to be impressed. Outside her house you see a white car - only let's imagine you've never seen a car before. So there's this white box-thing with wheels and windows and mirrors and such. Inside you can see well-worn seats, pedals, a map book and a couple of empty crisp-packets. On the window the seats are facing away from are stickers depicting various attractions from around the country. The lady has a gravel driveway, and you can clearly see ruts leading from the wheels back down the drive and out of sight. Curious, you lift the flap at the front and see all kinds of complicated stuff connected to the wheels. Stepping back, you also notice that the bright sunlight is reflecting off the top of the thing through the leaded front window of the house and is making quite a fetching pattern on the ceiling. The lady comes out of the house. After exchanging pleasantries and feeling a little intimidated, you ask her what this white thing is. She replies: ""That's a thing for making pretty patterns of light on the ceiling of my front room."" Part of you feels obligated to believe her. Your friend, whom you trust, told you she's ten times smarter and a hundred times more knowledgable than anyone else, and the thing unquestionably does create quite a pleasing effect on the ceiling of her front room when it reflects the sunlight. But believing her would mean leaving so much else - all those features that only, say, some sort of passenger-bearing vehicle would have a reason to possess - unexplained. You would have to dismiss them as coincidence, believe that somehow, in building a thing to reflect light through a window, its maker had inadvertently created a stupendously detailed and consistent - yet wrong - impression of a highly specific and quite different function. Then a neighbour, overhearing your discussion, comes over. She explains to you all about different cars, about how the roads they travel on (and how those roads have changed over the years), aerodynamics, load-bearing, fuel efficiency and performance requirements impose constraints on their shape, size and weight - and how the attractiveness of a car to buyers can fight against those considerations sometimes. She shows you her collection of old cars - she doesn't have one of every model ever made, and the oldest are more rust than anything else, but you can clearly see how they've developed over time from the earliest to the latest. ""No,"" says the first lady, ""Don't listen to her. That's all just a theory. Nobody has ever seen one of these 'cars' move."" You're walking back from the neighbour's house at this point, and she has to raise her voice a little to be heard over the traffic. ""All the things she says make it look like a vehicle are just her biased interpretation. After all, I'm looking at the exact same facts and I see something for reflecting light through my window. And I've got these two books, and the first book says someone will do something one day, and in the second book it says a character who read the first book did the thing the first book said someone would do, and that proves the first book is magic and everything in it must be true, and one of the things it says is that the thing outside my house is for reflecting light through windows. Disprove that , if you can."" That's why I believe evolution from a common ancestor happened.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","06:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","363"
