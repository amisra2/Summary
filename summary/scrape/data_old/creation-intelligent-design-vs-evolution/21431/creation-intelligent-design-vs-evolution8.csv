How can any being you create down to the tiniest detail be anything other than a pre-programmed robot to you.... who knows every facet of it's function and nature? 2. If God can't do something that is contradictory than God can't do anything, he is bound by what we would call truth or reality. If God is so bound there can be no divine mysteries. I know that is a catholic doctrine but seeing as they thought the whole thing out I'll just tell you that when they came across a contradiction in scripture (which practically everyone here keeps bringing to your attention at various times) they call it a divine mystery and Aquinas tells us we need to have faith because only the mind of God can understand. Are we to have faith that God can't do something now just as we had faith he did?","Easyrider","467732","Do you have free will to choose or reject Christ? Yes or no? I guess, if you'd like, you can say he programmed man with free will. If there is a God, and I have great confidence there is, then I have no doubt he has a higher mindset than we have, and there would be many things he would understand than would we. He'd also choose not to engage in certain practices (things ""God cannot do""), like taking on the form of a man to engage in illicit homosexual behaviors, for instance. As for all the alleged Biblical ""contradictions"", the vast majority of these are over rated, arguments from silence, or pure bs. There's no shortage of websites that take these on and answer them.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","08:07 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","106"

That makes me a good deal less free than a slave who can refuse his master only if he wants to get whipped. 2. If he programmed me with a fault in thinking that prevented me from accepting the truth I am flawed, don't call it free will to comfort yourself. Conversely thinking outside your little box if God made man rational why would he do everything accept appeal to our reason to save us? Lol, because on the cosmic scale of things God can see how bad that would be Look if it's unnatural it's only because God choose to create nature a certain way right? The problem with basing your ethical theories on the whim of some unknowable mind is that you can never explain the reasoning behind his/her moral dictates. I'm not talking about the petty timeline confusion 2 days vs 3 days. I am talking about much more fundamental contradictions, especially in interpretation. Why would God demand faith when men will believe in evidence? He has all the power in the world so he should be able to show everyone the way without the slightest impediment. Do not say it is free will because in the Bible he repeatedly used miracles to prove his identity to people.

He provided the Gospels and the NT, and any number of Christians to discuss it with you. There's more people in the U.S. who have seen the wisdom of it than have turned it down. And still, to this day, no one has presented anything other than an unfounded theory to falsify the resurrection. There's plenty of scientists and others who see the wisdom and reason in the Bible too. We're hardly without insight on how God views things. Just read the Bible for enlightenment on that. Let me see your best 1 (one) example from the NT (cite the scripture reference)? I'll be glad to look at it. Why not today? The web is full of reported miracles. I've seen a few myself. I've heard the voice of God, and so has my nephew and a few others I've known. I'd tell you about it but you wouldn't believe it anyway. But if you don't go to a spirit-filled church you probably won't see any miracles, or experience God.

You're the one on his way to eternal perdition, and it's totally unnecessary. Then talk to him and seek him with all your heart and you will find him (Jeremiah 29:13). See above. Pray to him to reveal Christ to you, and don't quit until he has. THEN you will know and can be saved. That's an unbiblical viewpoint, that God is forever merciful. He's merciful to a point, and will normally give people and nations time before he brings judgment (Genesis 15:16). But in the end, if people don't repent of their sin and evil, there will be a price to pay. He took his justice out on Christ at the cross, for those who will repent of their sins and ask forgiveness in Christ. I don't know how many times I need to say this, but if you spend some quality time to seek him, you won't be asking that question anymore. And you don't have to let anyone here know.

But if you and he do exist, please let me know and reveal Jesus to me. Thank you."" Keep doing that for awhile and in due time, if you're sincere in asking, you're going to get a real revelation.

Why isn't a slave free since he can choose to run away, get caught and whipped? My heart is here, let him come take it. He is everywhere right? I have prayed, nothing happened in the 500+ masses I attended as a child. If he is all knowing he heard the first one. If he's all powerful he doesn't need me to do anything before he speaks to me. He can just appear and speak. If he warns people before they are going to be punished then he will warn me. He hasn't so I must be on the straight and narrow path even though I don't believe in him. Under what perverted vision of justice can the tortured sacrificial murder of the one being in all the universe with no sin count as reparations for the sins of everyone else? Why are we held responsible for the sins of our ancestors, shouldn't we be in the garden until we eat the fruit? I don't know how many times I need to say this but this is a well known psychological phenomenon called self-talk. You keep talking to an imaginary man you're going to start believing he exists. That doesn't mean you hear him, or see him. Two hypothesis then, one is that God exists. The other is that you are constructing your own delusion. In the first case God is all powerful and all knowing so he would be able to manifest after the first prayer (in fact he wouldn't need you to pray first). He could manifest to your senses not as an odd stimulation of your emotional lobes. You could record him, other people could see him. He would have more to offer you than a comforting feeling, he could speak to you and explain everything you needed to know in order to live as he intended. In this case no faith is needed, only reason. In the second case you would not see anything, you would not hear anything; and you wouldn't get results unless you desperately wanted him to answer and even when you finally had a 'revelation' it would be nothing more than the peace of abandoning the shackles of reason. Look at how the Bible advices you to commune with God and tell me which hypothesis it implies.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","02:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","112"

Easy doesn't understand the problems of his view point, namely that Pascal's Wager is essentially a retard's game that ignores the potential for multiple Gods. Despite the ranting lunacy of Creationists in threatening fire and brimstone, they are in the same boat with atheists and every other religious person when it comes to their Eternal Soul. No one knows if God or Gods exists, and if they do, which one punish you the most. Sure the Christian God might exist. But Shiva will torture you for eternity for not believing in the Hindu Gods. Where does someone like Easyrider end up in that scenario?

If God was real and wanted to save me he wouldn't wait for me to do what I am obviously incapable of doing without incontrovertible evidence. I don't, you're not God and there is no reason he would speak through you, a book, or prophets..... Everything about it is perverted. Your religion creates a man so perfect he could only be God and then has him voluntarily kill himself horribly before disappearing and leaving us only the command to have faith in the various sayings of his followers. If God was willing to save man by coming to earth he should have stayed here because apparently we still need saving. Then let him manifest himself to me... to all of us.","Easyrider","467773","There's nothing irrational about my beliefs. I have the independent, historical records on my side. You have denial. How do you know what God will or will not do? You don't even know him. Once again, you don't know God. And he often does speak through his servants, prophets, etc. When you can bust the resurrection then you can call Christianity perverted. Until then you don't have a leg to stand on. God is on earth in the person of the Holy Spirit, who indwells believers and equips them to tell the good news of Christ's salvation to people like you. He already did reveal himself 2,000 years ago.

I mean honestly, I can't think of why anyone who genuinely claims that themselves as agnostic that would not like an answer to the question of whether or not god exists. But again, so far...nothing.
