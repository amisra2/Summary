I know for a fact that without supernatural intervention, people don't magically come back to life after 3 days. It is a fact. ""But what about the bible?"" you say. Well, for me to believe the bible is the word of god, I would first have to believe that there is a god. As I said earlier in this thread, I have seen no evidence that god exists. And again, if god really does exist, I would absolutely love for god to make his existence known to me. I have felt this way for years and still am in the exact same place. I refuse to believe that a god exists and the bible is his word simply based on the chance that I may spend eternity in a firey place of torture. To me, that would be a very shallow belief. I may not get on me knees every day and recite a pre-scripted prayer, but my desire to know of the existence or non-existence of god is real. As of yet, nothing. You can quote all the scripture you want to me, and we can argue about whether or not there are inconsistencies and contradictions in the biblical text, but in the end, it means nothing to me since I have no feeling one way or another that a ""god"" even exists, let alone the biblical god. In a very limited way, I believe that there must be some sort of higher power, given the fact that even if the big bang happened, something had to make that possible. Does that mean that I believe some socialist hippy arose from his grave 3 days after he was executed...no. Take that how you want it. I don't say that to be offensive, I say it because it is how I really feel. I would hope that you could accept that.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","01:14 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","168"

"12-26-2012","21431",12,"Freedom","467713","Well here is where the terminology is causing some confusion. When I say sexual selection I mean what pandion means and not what is really natural from the term. I do not mean any trait selected for by the opposite gender or competing within the same gender. I mean specifically those traits which have no bearing on survival. As databed said this is counter-intuitive because obviously sexual selection is an attempt to predict the quality of genes with respect to objective values and any difference between the outcome of mate selection and survival should be chocked up to errors or inefficiency in evaluating the genes of potential mates. You're right it's not tied to intelligence alone and I shouldn't have implied that, but it is tied to an attempt to evaluate genes before mating; something I don't think organisms with the ecological niche like the fruit fly would do. Their lives are short and fast and there is little room for being picky. Higher intelligence does correlate to sexual selection however because more complex evaluations are possible and complex processes are more prone to error than simple ones. You posted a link which you purported failed to find any sexual selection. I pointed out why this does not refute the possibility of sexual selection. Well before he got banned you could have asked accipiter and he would have told you I don't use references. Not quite true, but I don't use them in place of arguments certainly. I don't need a study demonstrating sexual selection when I can derive it's existence from well established facts. Do reproductive ratios depend on who can find a mate and how often they reproduce? Yes. Do animals display selectivity in reproduction? Yes. Are animals infallible? No. Therefore at least some of the time reproductive ratios are affected by animals selecting useless traits in mates. It's an axiom which means it can appear to be circular logic, but it's an axiom so it's inescapable as well. We cannot think except by assuming the existence of truth. If it's true that the universe has mechanics than those mechanics govern the future just as surely as they have governed the past. Without mechanics no consistent phenomenon are possible, yet we observe consistent phenomenon. Therefore, even if we don't understand it at the time we can only assume there are mechanics relating all future events to the current state of things and the current state of things to the past state of things. because all I said is that spanish is not and cannot be non-spanish and that if you can identify that everyone you know is speaking spanish you could have done it five minutes ago and predicted they would still be speaking spanish if you understood the reasons people speak any language. Obviously it changes during an organisms lifetime, it could not operate any other way. However I still don't buy this could truly be considered heritable since it is a dynamic system. It would be more accurate to say the parent and child have the same ability to adapt to vitamin D dosages.","Zosimus","467942","In your post you said, ""I pointed out why this does not refute the possibility of sexual selection...."" I think, however, that you are on the wrong track. We are not here to argue whether or not sexual selection is possible but whether sexual selection is a justified true belief. Now merely saying that A is possible does not mean that A is known to have occurred. You can only claim to know A if the following conditions are met: 1) A is true 2) You believe A 3) You have good reason to believe A 4) Your belief in A is not coincidental and 5) You would believe not A if there were good reason to do so. My goal here is not to disprove Darwinism but rather to raise enough doubt to point out that most believers in evolution are lacking point 5: They would not disbelieve evolution regardless the evidence found. You said, ""I don't need a study demonstrating sexual selection when I can derive it's existence from well established facts. Do reproductive ratios depend on who can find a mate and how often they reproduce? Yes. Do animals display selectivity in reproduction? Yes. Are animals infallible? No. Therefore at least some of the time reproductive ratios are affected by animals selecting useless traits in mates."" This is proof of nothing. I could easily find a dozen Christians who could construct a similar justification for God. Romans 1:20 jumps immediately to mind and I'm sure there are enough thumpers around here to aid me should I need to make that point. You said, ""If it's true that the universe has mechanics than those mechanics govern the future just as surely as they have governed the past. Without mechanics no consistent phenomenon are possible, yet we observe consistent phenomenon."" Yet this argument doesn't stand up to Platinga's argument that science is incompatible with evolution. If we suppose that our bodies and brains evolved in such a way as to recognize patterns of danger and to respond accordingly (under the theory that running from imaginary danger is better than not running from real danger) then why do we think ourselves truly capable of recognizing real patterns (as opposed to just seeing patterns in everything, although they don't really exist)? Why should an evolutionist believe that humans are capable of understanding the universe? Platinga claims that only the belief that one is formed in the image of God makes one capable of arguing that a human can comprehend the universe. Finally, I don't think you understand the Spanish-speaking argument. I can easily go out of my house and find a host of Spanish-speaking people. In fact, I would be hard pressed to find people who don't speak Spanish. In reality, however, this is because I live in Peru and not because the universe speaks Spanish exclusively. My entire sample base is chosen from people around me. There is no chance that I will stumble across a person in Constantinople or Beijing because I am only drawing samples from my own location (and time period). For me to claim that everyone in the universe speaks Spanish (and it has always been that way) is known to be wrong. A thousand years ago no one here spoke Spanish at all - Spanish didn't arrive until the Spanish conquistadores forced it down our throats. The same argument could be applied against almost anything science claims. How do we know that gravity works the same in distant universes as it works here? As a point in fact, we can pretty much see that there are problems with the theory of gravitation in that galaxies don't rotate the right way according to the theory of gravity (unless, of course, you postulate that undetectable ""dark"" matter can be sprinkled wherever you please to make the numbers work out). Our entire experience with gravity is drawn almost exclusively from the solar system we live in and the planet where we live and work. Why should we assume that what we see here can be applied universally to the rest of the universe at large?","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","11:37 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","174"
"12-26-2012","21431",12,"Easyrider","467803","Sure it is. Nothing you wrote above would disqualify a person from doing some sort of sin or evil in their entire life. We don't know what existed before this universe, only that this universe had a beginning. You're not recounting what I believe, but what you choose to believe. I hope this gets better. Is this around the same time as when your forefathers magically emerged as swamp slime? You need a lot of help with your theology. And you STILL have not provided a decent answer on how you, as God, would create man with free will and at the same time not allow him to do evil if he so chooses. So try again!","Zosimus","467943","It's very simple. If you create something and give it behavioral options there are only two possibilities: 1. You create it to behave randomly. 2. You create it to take actions according to a certain algorithm. In neither case does the created being have free will. Accordingly it is not possible that God created humans ex nihilo to have free will. Additionally, I note that you talked about swamp slime in your post. Apparently you felt so threatened and overwhelmed by the argument employed that you had to engage in wrong-headed personal attacks against me because you couldn't find a coherent reply. To sum up: I have been the one in this thread constantly attacking belief in Darwinism. For you to claim that my forefathers magically emerged as swamp slime makes no sense in light of the thread.

"12-26-2012","21431",12,"Databed","467840","Ok Zosimus, I just lost all of my response to your philosophical garbage in your last post. So instead, let me direct you to an old post. I issue you yet another challenge I am sure you will ignore. Explain to me why ERV's are not good enough to support evolution. PLEASE, don't talk any more about clinical studies. I wish you would understand that the evidence for evolution is nothing like the statistical evidence used in trials studies. Get real and stop trying to sell that garbage in here. http://www.4forums.com/political/cre...d-ape-dna.html","Zosimus","467945","Well, Databed, if you don't like philosophical arguments then you picked the wrong user to argue with because that's my entire argument in a nutshell: Science is philosophically flawed, evolution with it, and this explains why 80 percent of published studies are wrong. Popperian falsification is far superior to Bayesian statistics and it can be proved that most claimed research findings are false. The high rate of nonreplication (lack of confirmation) of research discoveries is a consequence of the convenient, yet ill-founded strategy of claiming conclusive research findings solely on the basis of a single study assessed by formal statistical significance, typically for a p-value less than 0.05. However, it appears you'd rather talk about ERVs and nested hierarchies. Specifically you have theory (E) that predicts findings (F). When you locate said findings you think the theory has been confirmed. Really, however, the only thing you have done is engaged in a classic logical fallacy - to wit: E=>F, F, therefore E. This is a classic example of the ""affirming the consequent"" fallacy. Well, let's pretend that your theory is scientific and think for a few moments on what things might be found that might disprove your theory. Imagine, for example, that we found an ERV in humans and another ape (not chimpanzee) that were very similar. Yet when we checked in chimps they did not have the same ERV. If that were found, we would easily be able to seriously question the theory that similar ERVs are the result of sharing a common ancestor. Can such a thing be found? Certainly - all we have to do is to go to Spread Of Endogenous Retrovirus K Is Similar In The DNA Of Humans And Rhesus Monkeys where we find that humans and rhesus monkeys share a very similar ERV that cannot be found in chimpanzees. As you can read in the article, Rhesus monkeys supposedly seperated from chimpanzees some 25 million years ago and chimps and humans supposedly seperated some 5-7 million years ago. Yet this finding throws a spanner in the works. Why don't chimps have the same ERV that we share with rhesus monkeys? Well, of course, Darwinism is never to be foiled. Suddenly we'll find that we're not descended from chimps at all, but rather we are descended from rhesus monkeys. Or there will be two theories claiming to be Darwin's true path - both refuting each other, but united in insisting that evolution is unquestionably correct. Darwinism will never be seriously questioned because it's not a scientific theory - it's an article of faith for true believers (like you). All this finding shows to me is what I've already said - evolution relies on constant ad hoc hypotheses to avoid falsification and therefore cannot lay claim to being an evidence-based theory of life. It is, rather, an a priori philosophical bias in the minds of atheists who reject the possibility of a designer in knee-jerk fashion.

"12-26-2012","21431",12,"None","None","None","Zosimus","467946","To All There has been a lot of argument here on the age of the earth, young earth creationists, who is one, who isn't, etc. I don't know why. In reality there is no way to know the age of the earth. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that I am a standard Bible-thumper literalist. How could you possibly convince me that the earth is older than 6,000 years of age? Radioactive dating is usually the argument employed. Half life of uranium, blah, blah, extrapolate... 4.5 billion years (give or take). Yet this argument presupposes that uranium has been radioactive for 4.5 billion years and that the rate of decay has been constant. Couldn't a Bible thumper easily point to the Bible and say, ""Read right here. Before Adam and Eve ate the fruit, things didn't break down or decay. Death, entropy, radioactivity, and everything you assume has existed for billions of years all originated at that exact moment."" After thoughtful reflection (something unlikely to be found in debate forums) you would have no admit that you have no refutation to that argument. Arguments that prove the Bible wrong using the initial assumption that the Bible is wrong are nothing more than circular. Nothing is proved except that you need a remedial logic class. In order to refute the Bible you must start by assuming that the Bible is right and then proceed to show how that leads to inescapable contradictions.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","11:48 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","178"
