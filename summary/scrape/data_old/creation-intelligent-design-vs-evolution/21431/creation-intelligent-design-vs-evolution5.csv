Crick is an atheist. Yet observing the complexity of DNA led him to the following conclusion: An honest man, armed with all the knowledge available to us now, could only state that in some sense, the origin of life appears at the moment to be almost a miracle, so many are the conditions which would have to be satisfied to get it going.[6] Crick estimates the odds that intelligent life exists on the Earth as the result of non-directed chance to be around 1:102,000,000,000.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","10:04 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","61"
"12-11-2012","21431",5,"Easyrider","467413","Looks like you never got ""born again"" in the Holy Spirit (John chapter 3). That's the evidence of salvation, because the Holy Spirit then leads you to read and enjoy the Bible and starts changing your life. Just saying a few words of a prayer may not save you. There's a difference between intellectual faith and heart-felt salvation and surrender to Christ and the Holy Spirit. If you had received the Holy Spirit you would have known it and there wouldn't have been any doubt in your mind. I doubt you're saved. Which means you need to rethink that before you die and save yourself some grief. As for the ""six days"" of creation, a thorough study of Genesis should convince the unbiased reader that the ""days"" are probably untold ages of time. In fact, one of the definitions of the Hebrew word for day (yom) is an (undetermined) space of time. You can look at the events that occurred during day three of creation and it doesn't make sense trying to cram it all into a 24 hour period. Regarding evil, tell me how you would create man with free will and at the same time prohibit the free will so man cannot do evil? I will note that man's ""free will"" is occasionally subject to the will / judgment / etc., of the Creator.","Zosimus","467440","So basically you're saying that God can create an obedient Moses with free will but can't create an obedient Judas with free will? I thought God could do anything. There was a certain man named Blaise Pascal, who invented probability and game theory. He is famous for ""Pascal's Wager"" which is the claim that man should believe in God because even if the odds are extremely low the payoff is high so that's the right bet to make. Now let's assume, for the sake of argument, that there is a God and Jesus is God and the only other gods are the Holy Spirit and God the Father and that they're all one. This implies that a person should belong to one of the many Christian churches in existence. Now let's compare the Christian churches in light of Pascal's observations, shall we? It seems to me that the chances of Evangelical Christianity being right are about the same as Jehovah's Witnesses' chances of being right, or Mormons being right. The difference, however, is that if you're an evangelical Christian and you die you get to spend all of eternity playing a harp and singing praises to God. While this may excite some, it sounds rather boring to me. On the other hand if you're Mormon and you're right then you become God and you can have as many wives as you want and spend all of eternity having sex with them. Better yet, they're all perfect so they're not even jealous of one another. Plus you can have kids, if you want, or not, and you never have to worry about paying for them because you can just materalize resources out of nothing. In fact, considering that all your wives will be perfect, I think it's pretty clear that perfect women are bisexual by mere definition, which would permit you to have as many threesomes as you'd like throughout eternity. It should be clear from this analysis that if you're going to be Christian, you should be Mormon as they have a much better afterlife. In fact, I would consider it to be infinitely better than playing a harp and singing praises to God on cloud 9. Finally, if you really analyze Genesis, you'll find that the word commonly translated as ""create"" (bara) actually means ""to fatten up"" which strongly implies that God didn't create the Earth out of nothing, but rather that there was pre-existing matter that he organized into its current form. Maybe God can't create something out of nothing at all.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","03:23 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","62"
"12-11-2012","21431",5,"Freedom","467415","It allows the theory to survive peahens being observed to not care. In my experience when someone gets something wrong in any field of study is probably because they didn't consider the full dynamics through time. Time adds another dimension to thought and is easily overlooked.","Zosimus","467441","Let's imagine that we take a simple theory (the theory of gravity, for example) and we decide to test it. So we take a rock and a vacuum and we drop said rock and we find that it works. So then we take a leaf and that works too. So we take a glass and that works too. How do we know that the next object selected will also work? In short, how do we know that the past is a good guide to the future? The response often given by people who haven't seriously thought about it is to say, ""Well, it's always worked in the past."" Unfortunately, however, this is circular logic. You cannot assume that the past is a good guide to the future because it worked in the past and will, therefore, work in the future because you are assuming what you are setting out to prove. This problem, known as the problem of induction, cannot be justified logically. You cannot use induction to prove induction because that's begging the question. In order to prove it deductively you must supply the missing postulate, which is this: All objects share the same properties and that's why a rock and a glass fall at the same rate. This postulate, however, is clearly false as a glass has properties that a rock doesn't. There are currently two proposed solutions to this problem: 1) Popperian falsification and 2) Bayesian statistics. Now I've already posted several times the mathematical proof that Bayesian statistics results in published results being wrong more often than right and the only serious objection I've heard to it is ""That guy is quoting from medical studies."" So what? The second solution is called falsificationism. This postulates that theories are theories - working assumptions, and that true science is spent in trying two theories against one another to try to falsify the one or the other (see Falsifiability - Karl Popper's Basic Scientific Principle ). Now in order for falsificationism to work you must have a theory that is, at least theoretically, falsifiable. There should be something I could observe that would disprove, for example, the theory of gravity. In fact, there are things that could be observed. For example in 1919 during a solar eclipse gravitational lensing was first observed and Newton's Law of Gravity was disproved whereas Einstein's theories were accepted. Now let's say that we are working under a theory of natural (sexual) selection and we go and visit three islands. On the first island the girls are strictly monogamous and jealous of their men. Why? ""Well,"" the Darwinist explains, ""it's sexual selection. Men prefer monogamous women because he knows that those babies are really his."" On the second island the girls are bisexual. Why? ""Sexual selection again,"" says the Darwinist. ""Guys like girls who are into sex and so they prefer women who are bisexual."" On the third island the girls are heterosexual but promiscuous. Why? ""Sexual selection again,"" says the Darwinist. ""The more guys the girl has sex with, the more likely she is to get pregnant. She won't have to worry as much about her man being sterile. Plus if the men kill babies that aren't theirs, by sleeping with a lot of men, he won't be sure the baby isn't his."" So what does this really mean? Everything can be explained by sexual selection - monogamy, bisexuality, and promiscuity. But what does that really prove? Nothing except that the theory can fit any data that is fed into it. This theory is worthless because it forbids nothing. It makes no predictions and therefore is unfalsifiable, untestable, and worthless. So don't bother telling me about how our species has sexual selection in it. It means nothing and anyway most of that natural selection is in the mind of the researchers. Don't believe me? Try reading Hundreds of Natural-Selection Studies Could be Wrong, Study Demonstrates in which we see that hundreds of studies have been done with a faulty statistical model that doesn't work at all. Here's a quote: To demonstrate how small sample sizes can lead to incorrect results, the team used computer simulations to examine the evolution of genes in three primates: humans, chimpanzees, and macaques. The scientists mimicked the procedures used by the authors of a 2007 paper, which applied the branch-site method to 14,000 orthologous genes -- genes that are genealogically identical among different species -- and which found that the method predicted selection in 32 of the genes. Nei and his team also studied selection using Fisher's exact test, but this test did not detect any selection. ""The results indicate that the number of nucleotide substitutions that occurred were too small to detect any selection; therefore, all of the 32 cases obtained by the branch-site method must be false positives,"" said Nozawa.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","03:26 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","63"
"12-11-2012","21431",5,"Databed","467427","Scientists have used the idea of evolution to seek out countless intermediate forms. They both predict the strata the fossils would be found in and the overall appearance of the unknown specimen. This has happened many times. Scientists have predicted relationships between living species based on morphology found in fossil record, geographical distribution and similarities in modern forms. These assumptions and conclusions were well established before DNA was first sequenced. The vast majority of the phylogeny based on pre-DNA analysis was confirmed with DNA studies. Some of the tree was wrong and corrected. Never has there been any anomaly that comes even close to casting doubt on the theory. There are many ways the DNA sequencing could have sunk evolution if it were the wrong theory. Instead it supports evolution. Evolution suggest that species will evolve to fill an available niche. Paleontologists have studied many ancient ecosystems and concluded that some species are yet to found. They have predicted the findings of many species that were later confirmed. (Mostly large carnivores) Evolution explains many seemingly poorly designed structures in modern animals. Only through the lense of accepting that life has evolved through many previous iterations and forms do many of these structures make sense. Only a blind process can result I many of these forms. Genetic signatures found in the genomes of different species can be tracked to the point in the family tree where all the species who share the signature also last shared a common ancestor. Thousands of these markers are common to many species and are the result of a single event of retroviral insertion within the egg, sperm or zygote that led to the last common ancestor. No theory other than evolution can explain this and it even predicts it. It means you are likely to find ERVs (endogenous retroviral insertions) placed precisely along the family tree of all monkeys, apes and humans. In fact, these ERVs are well documented. We can even match much of the code to the modern day versions of the viruses that originally created them. Evolution predicts the viral code to be different in the modern day versions and indeed they are. Evolution predicts that many mutations will occur in species that are bad for the organism. This happens all the time. Evolution predicts that structures that are useless to an organism will disappear, but that the DNA for them may remain. Indeed we find countless examples of vestigial structures and DNA sequences so that chickens may grow teeth, whales have pelvises and even vestigial leg bones, and genetic code that once coded for some useful function now causes genetic disease when triggered. Evolution predicts that humans will share many primal urges with animals. Obviously, they do.","Zosimus","467442","My good friend, Databed, you have no idea what you're talking about and it makes me sad. You see, you have a theory of evolution (E) that makes certain predictions (P) so we can say: If E then P (or E=>P) Later you find P and you think that the theory has been confirmed. In reality, however, you have merely engaged in a logical fallacy known as ""affirming the consequent."" None of these findings mean anything at all because one solitary time that the theory doesn't match up with predictions then the theory is falsified. The only time any of these findings might have any meaning at all would be if they met a 95-percent statistical confidence level. Even under those circumstances the results are most likely wrong. Maybe you don't understand why. Let me explain. Let's imagine that I'm a geneticist who is doing research on 1000 different genes in 1000 different studies. None of these genes have anything to do with anything but still we expect that 5 percent of those studies will show a 95-percent confidence level just by chance alone . So that means out of those 1000 genes, 50 of them will show as false positives. Assuming that I submit all of my studies for publication, chances are good that most of the negative results won't get published. Who cares that I studied a gene and didn't find a relationship, right? Yet all of the false positives are likely to be published. That means that even though I'm 100 percent unbiased and doing everything perfectly, 100 percent of my published studies will be wrong. As I have previously pointed out by referring you to PLOS Medicine: Why Most Published Research Findings Are False the numbers get even worse when bias is involved. As much as you might want to believe that simply reaching a p=0.05 or less in one solitary study means that real scientific progress has been made, both experience and mathematics are solidly against you. Let's imagine that there are 10,000 genes being studied by 10 teams, each team doing 1,000 and I am just one member of one team. Of those 10,000 genes only 0.3% of them actually correlate with what we are studying. Assuming that we are using an excellent method that is 95 percent accurate, that still means we expect to find 50 false positives and 3 real positives. That means after the study the chance that any one of the genes that I studied actually being a real find is a mere 5.66 percent. Now that's quite a jump from 0.3% to 5.66% but it's still far below 50 percent. Additionally there's no way of knowing that the method I'm using really is 95 percent accurate. In order to know that, I'd need to have a method that's 100 percent accurate and to be able to match my results against that method. On the other hand, if there was a 100 percent accurate method, then we wouldn't be screwing around with my method that's only 95 percent, would we? I'm glad that you have faith in science and evolution and all that, but it's all a house of cards built on assumptions that don't stand up to solid investigation. As you can see at Convergent evolution of Darwin's finches caused by... [Evolution. 2004] - PubMed - NCBI in Darwin's finches (the ones that started this whole business) the differences in beak robustness cannot be explained by natural selection and investigations have shown flow of genes from G. fortis to G. scandens. Now maybe you're not aware of this, but supposedly different species don't breed and so genes don't supposedly flow from one species into another. Obviously that is not the case here, which raises the question: Why bother to think that they're different species at all? The reason why you believe that has nothing to do with the evidence (or lack of same) but rather because you have made up your mind previously due to your own emotions, and the facts you spout are just rationalizations for what you have already decided to believe. Not that there's much fact in your post. Where are your links to supporting studies? Why do I post links and no one else does? The reason is simple: Because the facts are on my side.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","03:28 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","64"

Thats simple induction at work and so they typically sacrificed to their god in December to rejuvenate him and held a massive (yuletide) celebration around December 25 when it worked.

This explanation perfectly explains Darwins finches without the need for multiplying factors. How does 'natural selection' account for the epigenesis study?
