"12-08-2012","21431",4,"Freedom","467348","Now if I said something like that (the evidence doesn't matter) I can just imagine what you would say to it.... It hasn't occurred to you that the sexual selection could be gone? What if it existed for a time and then was eliminated in the females. The male genes could be several hundred thousand years behind modern female appetite. For all we know it was even more ridiculous in the past and is on the decline now. I think you put too many 9's on the end of that. and there ya go. Do you guard your beliefs because you aren't confessing to needing evolution to make sense of the universe without god? I'm not guarded at all , I post all my real beliefs even the ones I am fully aware are shared by sometimes less than 2% of the general population. Why do you think there is no one here (or perhaps in the world) who agrees with everything I say? If I only stuck with one position I would find plenty of ""allies"", I've seen it on other forums (because they were dedicated topics).","Databed","467363","No, I said the evidence does nothing to cast any doubt on TOE. It matters, just not in the way the OP thinks it does. It did occur to me, along with a whole host of other possibilities. I don't plan on debating each one because they are all speculation and I tend to get in deeper than I mean to when I use speculation to counter one's argument of absolute impossibility. Might have been a little exaggerated, yes. My point was made. He asked me to stop inferring from his stance his religious views. So, I can't come right out and ask? Not sure exactly what this means because I absolutely admit that I need evolution to make sense of the universe (life, at least) without God. I have to admit that you don't make friends on here readily and that it is because of your very unorthodox ideas. But, you have to admit that you have never come right out in our arguments and said what you actually believe. Any time I have made an assertion as to your religious bias, you basically indicate that I am wrong, but you have never corrected me.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","03:36 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","49"

It seems to me the simplest, in any case that sexual selection contradicts fitness selection sexual selection must eventually yield because you can't select for the traits of dead individuals When I do things like that I'm told it's because I'm utterly uneducated. He asked you to stop going off on tangents, coming right out and asking is just as irrelevant as 'inferring' it (although it does look more like a red herring than a strawman if that's what you're going for). Is your need causing you to ignore the truth? Yes I have, many times. There is only one answer you are looking for ""praise Jesus hallelujah"" just like you're fishing around to get Zosimus to ""come out of the closet"". I don't know what he believes but I know it is irrelevant . If you understood logic you would know it's irrelevant and you wouldn't ask. It is my standing policy to identify irrelevancies as irrelevant not indulge in them. Failure to do so leads to far more problems than not. It implies they are relevant to answer them, and it's also is educational to my opponents since the only thing they could possibly do with irrelevant information is post fallacies. You go back and look at our exchanges, any time you accused me of secretly being religious I have ignored you and pointed out the irrelevancy. Answering would be like giving a dog a treat for urinating on the carpet. When you have asked me how I explain the advancement of life, I have answered clearly and consistently ""I don't."" I am not hiding anything, you want to talk about my views on religion I'll be more than happy to when religion is the subject. In fact if you had added a preamble about how you are changing the subject you would have gotten answers. You and I both know why such a preamble wouldn't work for your purposes. Wrong to commit fallacies, and that is the correction. I have made my views on the subject at hand perfectly clear in all cases.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","04:15 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","50"

"12-10-2012","21431",4,"None","None","None","Zosimus","467409","An undirected response When I was 12 I was approached by some evangelical Christians who invited me to accept Jesus and go to their church. I said the prayer, became Christian and then went to their church where they spent their time babbling, frothing and rolling around on the floor. I thought, These guys are crazy, and I never went back. Now despite having told me before that I was saved (forever, and that nothing could separate me from the love of God) they later told me I was going to hell. Does that make me Christian? You decide. I do not believe that God created the entire universe out of nothing in six days time. Even if God had done such a thing, that would make him responsible for all the evil in the world since by that act of creation he would be responsible for the acts of all things he created unless someone is implying that God tried to create everything perfectly, but failed. Now that we have that out of the way, lets get down to science. From my point of view science is easy and clear to understand. First you get a theory and then you try to disprove the theory. Theories that are not disprovable (like the idea that God created the universe exactly as we see it) are not scientific. That doesnt mean theyre wrong, theyre just untestable. Now there exists a theory of evolution (Darwin style) and it should be testable. Now by that I mean that there should be some concrete observation that I could make that would prove the theory wrong. Now most Darwin apologists when confronted with this claim that finding a perfectly preserved rabbit fossil in the Precambrian would effectively disprove Darwinism. However, as you can see from a simple look at Precambrian rabbit - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia most people dont agree that such a finding would indeed disprove evolution including noted expert on the Philosophy of Science Peter Godfrey-Smith. Evolution, like all other scientific theories, is just that: A THEORY. Its unproven and indeed unprovable. It makes certain claims and some of these claims can be tested. Now it doesnt matter how many claims are tested and come out correctly if some testable claims turn out to be wrong. As Einstein is reported to have said, No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong. The difference between the theory of relativity and the theory of evolution is that observations that go against the theory of relativity are taken seriously whereas observations that go against the theory of evolution are explained away using ad hoc hypotheses. Now the authors of the peacock study I quoted were not shy about speculating that maybe the train had been formed using sexual selection, but now female tastes have changed. The problem with making that ad hoc hypothesis is that it effectively renders natural selection untestable because no finding no matter how inconsistent with what is predicted ever results in the theory being called into question. It is beyond question an article of faith for its adherents. Anyone who calls it into question gets labeled a Christian and has to spend all of his time fielding questions about beliefs he doesnt have along with people trying to pull him out of the closet a stealth Christian. Be honest now what would you think if a Christian came on here and claimed the Bible was completely true 100 percent inerrant. Now when this Christian was challenged on the Bible says PI = 3 (round table, 10 cubits diameter, 30 cubits circumference) he said, Well, PI was 3 at that time but has since changed to the number we now use. What would you think of that argument? Wouldnt you laugh at him and consider the argument invalid? Well thats exactly how I feel about people who say that peahens must have used to prefer long-tailed peacocks but now dont. Its absurd because with this argument you can justify anything at all. Every time I come onto forums like this I hear people saying they believe in evolution because the facts and the studies back it up. Where are these studies? What are the facts? One of the landmark studies about sexual selection was the 1948 fruit fly study performed by Angus John Bateman. Now as we have already learned from Ioannidis article there is a strong risk that solitary studies that rely solely on a 95-percent statistical confidence level are wrong. Until very recently this study was never reproduced it was merely accepted as gospel. Why? Because Bateman was preaching to the choir. Only now some 60+ years later has the experiment been redone. (See Biologists reveal potential 'fatal flaw' in iconic sexual selection study ). What do we find? Bateman's 1948 study is the most-cited experimental paper in sexual selection todayOur team repeated Bateman's experiment and foundthat Bateman's paper should never have been published, so says said Patricia Adair Gowaty, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCLA. What was wrong? His methodology resulted in more offspring being assigned to fathers than mothers, something that is impossible when each child must have both a father and a mother, Gowaty said. But Gowaty and her colleagues, by performing the same experiment, found that the data were decidedly inconclusive. In their repetition -- and possibly in Bateman's original study -- the data failed to match a fundamental assumption of genetic parentage assignments. Specifically, the markers used to identify individual subjects were influencing the parameters being measured (the number of mates and the number of offspring). When offspring die from inherited marker mutations, the results become biased, indicating that the method is unable to reliably address the relationship between the number of mates and the number of offspring, said Gowaty. Nonetheless, Bateman's figures are featured in numerous biology textbooks, and the paper has been cited in nearly 2,000 other scientific studies. Repeating key studies is a tenet of science, which is why Bateman's methodology should have been retried as soon as it became important in the 1970s, she said. Those who blindly accept that females are choosy while males are promiscuous might be missing a big piece of the puzzle. ""Our worldviews constrain our imaginations,"" Gowaty said. ""For some people, Bateman's result was so comforting that it wasn't worth challenging. I think people just accepted it."" P.S. Ayn Rand was an idiot.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","01:34 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","57"

That's the evidence of salvation, because the Holy Spirit then leads you to read and enjoy the Bible and starts changing your life. Just saying a few words of a prayer may not save you. There's a difference between intellectual faith and heart-felt salvation and surrender to Christ and the Holy Spirit. If you had received the Holy Spirit you would have known it and there wouldn't have been any doubt in your mind. I doubt you're saved. Which means you need to rethink that before you die and save yourself some grief. As for the ""six days"" of creation, a thorough study of Genesis should convince the unbiased reader that the ""days"" are probably untold ages of time. In fact, one of the definitions of the Hebrew word for day (yom) is an (undetermined) space of time. You can look at the events that occurred during day three of creation and it doesn't make sense trying to cram it all into a 24 hour period. Regarding evil, tell me how you would create man with free will and at the same time prohibit the free will so man cannot do evil? I will note that man's ""free will"" is occasionally subject to the will / judgment / etc., of the Creator.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","02:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","58"

The method, the facts (observations), and even the conceptual explanations (theories) are all provable. In many cases the words and analogies are different but so long as one considers the theory the absolute relationship (usually expressed in math) that is irrelevant. It's happened already. I would think the bible rounded. It allows the theory to survive peahens being observed to not care. In my experience when someone gets something wrong in any field of study is probably because they didn't consider the full dynamics through time. Time adds another dimension to thought and is easily overlooked. Ignoring the relationship between different points in time is the only way to think evolution can form novel systems so you aren't the only one, but you can't just dismiss the possibility because you don't have evidence for it. Sexual selection surely exists, if it doesn't exist in peahens right now that only means peahens won't be contributing to the body of observation on sexual selection in modern times. They mean the fossil record showing a pattern of common descent. In general that does seem to be the case. If I were to pick a species that would not be that way it would be fruit flies. Look Zosimus our own species has examples of sexual selection in it. What force prevents it from existing in any other species or being disconnected from objective benefit to some degree? I'd be happy to debate that.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","02:24 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","59"
