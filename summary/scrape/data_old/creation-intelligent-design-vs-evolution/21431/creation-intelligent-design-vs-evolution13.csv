Furthermore if one has to assume that something like the Bible is an absolute authority before considering it, that is the original example of circular logic. Failure to disprove is not proof and therefore the ability to imagine a hypothesis with no practical method of disproof is not the identification of knowledge.","Zosimus","467955","Oh you sad pathetic man. How you get through the world without killing yourself in the process is truly amazing. You really have zero concept of logic, don't you? Below I will prove that the square root of 2 is an irrational number. Well, actually, I will cut and paste a proof that the square root of 2 is an irrational number. Here's how the proof works. First we start by assuming that the square root of 2 is rational and then we prove that this leads to inescapable contradictions. Then we realize that our initial assumption was false. The proof that square root of 2 is irrational: Let's suppose 2 were a rational number. Then we can write it 2 = a/b where a,b are whole numbers, b not zero. We additionally assume that this a/b is simplified to the lowest terms, since that can obviously be done with any fraction. Notice that in order for a/b to be in its simplest terms, both a andb must be not be even. One or both must be odd. Otherwise, you could simplify. From the equality 2 = a/b it follows that 2 = a 2 /b 2 , or a 2 = 2 * b 2 . So the square of a is an even number since it is two times something. From this we can know that a itself is also an even number. Why? Because it can't be odd; if a itself was odd, then a * a would be odd too. Odd number times odd number is always odd. Check if you don't believe that! Okay, if a itself is an even number, then a is 2 times some other whole number, or a = 2k where k is this other number. We don't need to know exactly what k is; it won't matter. Soon is coming the contradiction: If we substitute a = 2k into the original equation 2 = a 2 /b 2 , this is what we get: 2 = (2k) 2 /b 2 2 = 4k 2 /b 2 2*b 2 = 4k 2 b 2 = 2k 2 . This means b 2 is even, from which follows again that b itself is an even number!!! WHY is that a contradiction? Because we started the whole process saying that a/b is simplified to the lowest terms, and now it turns out that a and b would both be even. So 2 cannot be rational. ----------------------------------------------- The above is a simple proof found in basically any college textbook that shows how to prove something using contradiction. Just because you didn't go to college (or partied your way through it) is no excuse for not knowing this. There is no way to prove that the square root of 2 is irrational by starting with the assumption that it is irrational. Attempting to do so only results in you using circular logic. I don't offer remedial math classes, but I know several people who do.

There is no way to prove it's irrational by assuming it's rational. What you are thinking of is a conditional statement. /If sqrt(2) is rational then it can be expressed as a/b (with said conditions) /It cannot be expressed as a/b //Therefore it is not rational The conditional can work in the other way just as easily. /If and only if sqrt(2) is irrational can it be impossible to express as a/b (wc)(we get to say this because that the definition of rational is that you can write a fraction of whole numbers) /It cannot be expressed as a/b //Therefore it is irrational Where's the assumption of rationality?

"12-27-2012","21431",13,"None","None","None","Easyrider","467980","The fascinating story of how DNA studies confirm an ancient Biblical tradition The Cohanim - DNA Connection From the article: Jewish tradition, based on the Torah, is that all Cohanim are direct descendants of Aaron, the brother of Moses. The Cohen line is patrilineal -- passed from father to son without interruption for 3,300 years, or more than 100 generations. Dr. Skorecki considered a hypothesis: if the Cohanim are descendants of one man, they should have a common set of genetic markers -- a common haplotype -- that of their common ancestor. In our case, Aaron HaCohen. A study was undertaken to test the hypothesis. If there were a common ancestor, the Cohanim should have common genetic markers at a higher frequency than the general Jewish population. In the first study, as reported in the prestigious British science journal, Nature (January 2, 1997), 188 Jewish males were asked to contribute some cheek cells from which their DNA was extracted for study. Participants from Israel, England and North America were asked to identify whether they were a Cohen, Levi or Israelite, and to identify their family background. The results of the analysis of the Y chromosome markers of the Cohanim and non-Cohanim were indeed significant. A particular marker, (YAP-) was detected in 98.5 percent of the Cohanim, and in a significantly lower percentage of non-Cohanim.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","07:48 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","187"

""Now we uncovered three cultic rooms, with various cultic paraphernalia, but not even one human or animal figurine was found.

"12-27-2012","21431",13,"Zosimus","467945","Well, Databed, if you don't like philosophical arguments then you picked the wrong user to argue with because that's my entire argument in a nutshell: Science is philosophically flawed, evolution with it, and this explains why 80 percent of published studies are wrong. Popperian falsification is far superior to Bayesian statistics and it can be proved that most claimed research findings are false. The high rate of nonreplication (lack of confirmation) of research discoveries is a consequence of the convenient, yet ill-founded strategy of claiming conclusive research findings solely on the basis of a single study assessed by formal statistical significance, typically for a p-value less than 0.05. However, it appears you'd rather talk about ERVs and nested hierarchies. Specifically you have theory (E) that predicts findings (F). When you locate said findings you think the theory has been confirmed. Really, however, the only thing you have done is engaged in a classic logical fallacy - to wit: E=>F, F, therefore E. This is a classic example of the ""affirming the consequent"" fallacy. Well, let's pretend that your theory is scientific and think for a few moments on what things might be found that might disprove your theory. Imagine, for example, that we found an ERV in humans and another ape (not chimpanzee) that were very similar. Yet when we checked in chimps they did not have the same ERV. If that were found, we would easily be able to seriously question the theory that similar ERVs are the result of sharing a common ancestor. Can such a thing be found? Certainly - all we have to do is to go to Spread Of Endogenous Retrovirus K Is Similar In The DNA Of Humans And Rhesus Monkeys where we find that humans and rhesus monkeys share a very similar ERV that cannot be found in chimpanzees. As you can read in the article, Rhesus monkeys supposedly seperated from chimpanzees some 25 million years ago and chimps and humans supposedly seperated some 5-7 million years ago. Yet this finding throws a spanner in the works. Why don't chimps have the same ERV that we share with rhesus monkeys? Well, of course, Darwinism is never to be foiled. Suddenly we'll find that we're not descended from chimps at all, but rather we are descended from rhesus monkeys. Or there will be two theories claiming to be Darwin's true path - both refuting each other, but united in insisting that evolution is unquestionably correct. Darwinism will never be seriously questioned because it's not a scientific theory - it's an article of faith for true believers (like you). All this finding shows to me is what I've already said - evolution relies on constant ad hoc hypotheses to avoid falsification and therefore cannot lay claim to being an evidence-based theory of life. It is, rather, an a priori philosophical bias in the minds of atheists who reject the possibility of a designer in knee-jerk fashion. Cheers.","Databed","468002","So, are you asserting that 80% of our scientific knowledge is wrong? You are an idiot. There is no research into whether or not evolution occurs. This is why you found no false positives in which the said positive was confirming evolution. Stop talking about stupid p-value and statistics. Like I said earlier when you attacked my knowledge of forensics, this is not the same kind of evidence we use to verify evolution. Stop your irrelevant, dimwitted attempt at being profound - as if you are blowing our minds here. Minds...not blown, or if they are, only by your total lack of any ability to understand anything that wasn't concocted in your own stupid brain. I believe Freedom already addressed this. You are misusing your 100 level logic terms again. Why would we do that, you think 80% of science is completely false. No, you would either come to the conclusion that the two species either didn't share a common ancestor after the insertion event or that the genome had been purged of the insertion. I though you understood this... Again, there is no wrong conclusion in the paper - the bias is in the reader. Their conclusion is that the retroviral insertion has been partially purged from one species. What's more, there are STILL remnants of that insertion within the genome of all three species. You read one tiny article on the subject and this makes you an expert? You really need to do more research before you come in here and make yourself look stupid. They do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They do!!!!! read dumbass...read, read, read Idiotic, stupid, ignorant. You honestly believe we descended from chimps???! Holy XXXX, who am I arguing with? Such an old, tired argument. What it shows to you is obviously very different from what it actually shows.
