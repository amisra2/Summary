"12-17-2012","21431",7,"Freedom","467528","To live and compete life must be efficient. To be efficient is to waste little resources and gain resources with little effort or risk. Females normally invest more resources, that is a fact. Therefore for females to be efficient with their resources they would need to be careful what they invest in. No I was certainly not referring to fruit flies. I think any creature with that little intelligence and such a fast life style would show little to no sexual selection. The danger in the life of any fruit fly is that it dies before mating not that it wastes resources producing eggs which are tiny even compared to itself. I would expect to see no choosiness in insects beyond ""whatever male survives getting to me wins."" but you didn't disprove my claims, you just admitted that I didn't claim to be referring to the Bateman study. You seem to be versed in logical terminology so you should know that an invalid argument does not prove it's conclusion false. I did not claim that, this is a strawman fallacy. Red Herring Perhaps I get it from observed consistency in every conceivable objective analysis of reality. Logic and therefore human thought itself is predicated on the absence of contradiction in the universe. It is an axiom that none of us can escape except by ceasing to think at all. A is never non-A. The universe exists, and so too does everything in it. Imperfection in knowledge is not mysticism in reality as countless examples throughout history and in each individuals own life teach us. When you find something or see something that you did not expect, that contradicts what you thought; you change your beliefs because the universe sure as hell isn't going to change for you. Depends on which things you are talking about Yes, induction. If we're at the end of a cycle then there is a cycle; which by definition is a pattern. @Databed, this is the kind of things I have thought about you but not cluttered our exchanges with because it's irrelevant. This is the same mistake Darwin made about inheritable traits, it's hardly new. More importantly this Lipton guy is a nutcase: Mysticism from a lab coat is still mysticism. If genes don't turn themselves on or off what could? Inside a cell nucleus the only candidates for changing the expression of genes are proteins which are being constructed as expressions of genes. What the hypothesis here, that your thoughts are emitting radiation just right or are they causing the correct molecules to appear out of the void? If it's some system whereby the state of your thoughts is monitored by the biology and determines gene expression that is still the genes turning themselves on or off. More importantly though gene expression is not the same thing as gene inheritance. Are you suggesting that gene expression is inherited as well as genes?","Zosimus","467634","I find your argument quite confusing. You claim that low intelligence corresponds with low sexual selection. Nevertheless sexual selection is supposedly engrained in the genes and the instinct of an animal. If an animal prefers a specific mating scent, for example, supposedly those males that produce said scent will be favored in breeding regardless of intelligence or lack of same. The arguments you are making (or at least appear to be making) are those contained at Mate choice - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia which claim that R.A. Fischer in 1915 claimed runaway selection resulted in making things like long peacock tails. Yet I have already posted links refuting this claim. Later in the article we see that Bateman supposedly presented experimental evidence using Drosophila for supposed sexual selection, yet this study, when redone, was inconclusive and had methodological flaws. So kindly refer me to the study you are referring to and ensure that this study does not reference the now-refuted Bateman study. Next you claim that you are not using induction to support induction. But later you say ""Perhaps I get it from observed consistency in every conceivable objective analysis of reality."" So basically you are claiming that what you have seen so far is a valid sample of the universe as a whole - in a sense that you can use your past experiences to predict your future experiences. But how do you know that the past is a good guide to the future? Just because it worked in the past? Isn't that circular logic? Let's take this premise and run with it. Let's assume that my experiences are representative of the entire universe. I can, therefore, claim that the entire universe speaks Spanish. After all, my wife speaks Spanish, my friends speak Spanish, my students speak Spanish, the administrative staff here speaks Spanish. All the bus drivers and bus riders speak Spanish. Therefore the entire UNIVERSE speaks Spanish. Do you think this is a valid logical chain? No? Then why is your chain of reasoning more valid? Finally as for gene expression, YES, I am suggesting that gene expression is inherited as well as genes (see Inherited variation in gene expr... [Annu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. 2009] - PubMed - NCBI ) nor am I suggesting that gene expression is controlled by psychic impulses. Rather I am suggesting that things like diet can affect it (see Up-regulation of the tumor suppressor... [Anticancer Res. 1998 May-Jun] - PubMed - NCBI ) or exposure to sun (see Vitamin D found to influence over 200 genes, highlighting links to disease ). Quote: ""The vitamin D receptor is a protein activated by vitamin D, which attaches itself to DNA and thus influences what proteins are made from our genetic code"" (emphasis added).","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","02:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","92"
"12-17-2012","21431",7,"Databed","467547","First off, you have yet to supply a ""false positive"" that is relevant to your claims in post #64. I am still waiting. Secondly, your newly referenced study is that of epigenetics. Just because you were duped into believing by the article you provided that epigenetics is at all at odds with evolution does not mean that I should have to waste my time explaining to you what epigenetics actually is. Why don't you go read up on it and stop bringing down the average intelligence of the members of this forum.","Zosimus","467635","As I have already pointed out at Hundreds Of Natural-selection Studies Could Be Wrong, Study Demonstrates there are known problems with the statistical methods used to highlight supposed incidences of natural selection. As you would know, had you bothered to read the article: ""The scientists mimicked the procedures used by the authors of a 2007 paper, which applied the branch-site method to 14,000 orthologous genes -- genes that are genealogically identical among different species -- and which found that the method predicted selection in 32 of the genes."" Now maybe you don't understand. If one theorizes that chimps and humans share a common ancestor and that certain DNA sections are found to be identical, and if one theorizes that natural selection can and does occur, then one must conclude that there was no natural selection in the identical section (since they are identical, supposedly remaining that way in the absence of natural selection). Yet we read that the statistical method indicates that 32 of the genes had indeed been naturally selected for. ""...therefore, all of the 32 cases obtained by the branch-site method must be false positives,"" said Nozawa. So you cannot claim that there are no false positives considering that false positives have been detected as recently as March 2009. Additionally as you can read at JAMA Network | JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association | Contradicted and Initially Stronger Effects in Highly Cited Clinical Research we find that 45 highly-cited studies were reexamined by John Ioannidis and his findings were as follows: Eleven had never been retested. Seven had been refuted and seven had been found to be exaggerated whereas 20 were replicated. Accordingly 41.2 percent of the highly-cited research was known to be wrong yet was still being highly cited as though it were authoritative. He went on to point out that 5 out of 6 non-randomized studies were refuted. At least in medical studies you have the possibility of randomized and double-blind studies, but when was the last time you saw a randomized, double-blind evolutionary study? Such things are simply not done. Accordingly it should be no surprise that I can go with a Google browser and quickly find studies refuting almost all cases of supposed natural selection. I just go to Sexual selection - RationalWiki and find what has supposedly been sexually selected for and then do a Google search finding that it's wrong (giraffes, for example, see Sexual selection is not the origin of long necks in giraffes - Mitchell - 2009 - Journal of Zoology - Wiley Online Library ). ------------------- Now as referring to your later comment that you think that I think that all these studies are wrong because of bias or some kind of conspiracy theory. If you had bothered to read the article you are criticizing, you would see that bias is only one of the reasons why things can go wrong. Let's take the example of a person who is undergoing a test for a serious disease. The person tests positive for the disease using a test that is known to be 95 percent accurate - that it produces wrong results only 5 percent of the time. Does that mean we can be 95 percent sure the person has that disease? Absolutely not! First you need to consider the odds prior to the test that the person had the disease. Let's say this disease is quite rare and only 1 percent of the population has this disease. As such the a priori probability that the person has the disease is only 1 percent. Accordingly if we take a population of 10,000 people with 100 of them having the disease we will find that 95 percent of the people that are positive for the disease will test positive (95 people) whereas of the 9,900 people who do not have the disease 5 percent of them will falsely test positive for the disease (495 false positives). As such the after-test probability that the person really has the diease is 95/(95+495) = 95/590 = 16 percent. Yes, that's right! A test that is 95 percent accurate can produce only a 16 percent probability that the person really has the disease! In short almost 84 percent of the people who test positive for the disease do not have it at all! This is why the author of the paper criticizes ""...the convenient, yet ill-founded strategy of claiming conclusive research findings solely on the basis of a single study assessed by formal statistical significance, typically for a p-value less than 0.05."" Yet I can come onto forums like these and hear people say things like, ""I do not believe in evolution in the same way that I do not believe in gravity. It is a known fact."" Yet they ""know"" it's a fact thanks to Bayesian (or subjective) statistics(!) (see What is Subjective (Bayesian) Probability? - YouTube ) - a method for measuring the subjective probability of something that starts off by making a guess. Now perhaps you can argue, as Bayes did, that with enough tests the starting (guessed) probability will eventually converge on the true probability, but I don't know how you can claim that on the basis of one single study . Going back to the disease example above, let's suppose that the doctors do not know the percentage of the population that has the disease being tested for. What will they do? They will guess and hope for the best. I'm glad that all of you are comfortable with scientists guessing their results, but quite frankly, I am not comfortable with it at all. What I want to see is multiple randomized double-blind studies that agree with one another. And what I don't want to see is a lot of regurgitation of refuted studies and a lot of atheistic shouting that neo-Darwin evolution is unconditionally true and unquestionable.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","02:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","93"
"12-17-2012","21431",7,"Zosimus","467631","You're right. I meant Rev. 4:8 not 18. In this we find that in heaven everyone stands round the throne of God praising him. While that may sound like great fun to you, it's not up my alley. You didn't like the link for bara. Fine. Try Old Testament Word Studies in which we find that bara means ""create, cut, shape, perforate, and strengthen, make well, make grow"" Now in Genesis 1:27 we see that God created man (also with the word bara) yet we see that man was formed out of the dust of the ground - so again, you cannot claim that bara means to create out of nothing when used to refer to the acts of divine beings. But let's say, for the sake of argument, that before he was born Jesus (aka Jehovah) really did create the entire universe out of nothing. If that is the case, then he has surely also created evil. Now perhaps you will argue that every being has free will, yet surely God in his omniscience could have said, ""I'm about to create Cain... but I see that he will team up with Satan and kill Abel and that will be bad... so maybe I'll skip making him."" But he did no such thing, so while you may be eager to let God wash his hands of the responsibility, we can still easily see that if the standard Christian story of creation is true, then God has created and is directly responsible for evil and that he knew ahead of time what he was doing. Now as for your links proving Mormonism wrong, logically, the only thing that is proved therein is that the author has no understanding of Mormon theology. Mormons believe, for example, that Jesus achieved exaltation after his earth life. Yet, you may ask, who exalted Jesus? Who saved him? Surely you and Mormons agree that Jesus saved himself - that he needed no expiacin (which for some unfathomable reason you call at-one-ment) and so the supposed infinite regression problem exists only in the mind of the author of the paper. So again, I challenge you to solve the two problems I have set for you: 1. How do you account for the existence of evil? This is the prime philosophical challenge for Christianity. 2. How do you account for your lack of belief in Mormonism, considering that their theology generates a greater present value calculation than that of your own faith? P.S. Quoting the Bible may make you feel good, but it's pointless. Not only does everyone's interpretation of said document vary, but you cannot hope to convince someone of Christianity by the Bible since, if they accept the Bible as true, they are already Christians.","Easyrider","467636","4:8 only mentions the four beasts. It doesn't mention ""everyone"" or even anyone. I vote for ""create,"" based on the totality of scripture in which God / Christ are seen repeatedly as the creators. Yeah, God created the dirt first, no problem. But if the universe had always existed total entropy would have already occurred by now. So the universe had a beginning (IMO). One of the descriptors for evil in the OT is calamity. Generally speaking, God created rewards for good behavior, and punishments for bad behavior (note Deuteronomy chapter 28). Yes, God knew there would be evil, and sin, which is why he ordained the sacrifice of Christ from the foundation of the world (Revelation 13:8). Free will is the only way unless you want to create pre-programmed robots. Jesus existed as God BEFORE his incarnation (Philippians 2:5-7, John 1, etc.). It's necessary for free will. It also serves to contrast the goodness of God, and as a warning to those who think it might be fun to try it. And if you sow evil, you will reap evil. That tends to put at least a little damper on it. And in the end, the unrepentant and unsaved evildoers will be cast into the Lake of Fire forever, and then only goodness reigns in heaven. I don't see the value in Mormonism, considering the wealth of negatives and refutations concerning it that I provided in my previous post. I disagree. I've had fellowship with hundreds of Christians who, with few exceptions, agree with me on what the Bible says. It's also spiritually discerned (1 Corinthians 2:14), which is why so many non born-again folks have so much trouble understanding it. And people have been convinced by the Bible for ages.

Yet they ""know"" it's a fact thanks to Bayesian (or subjective) statistics(!) (see What is Subjective (Bayesian) Probability? - YouTube ) - a method for measuring the subjective probability of something that starts off by making a guess. Now perhaps you can argue, as Bayes did, that with enough tests the starting (guessed) probability will eventually converge on the true probability, but I don't know how you can claim that on the basis of one single study . Going back to the disease example above, let's suppose that the doctors do not know the percentage of the population that has the disease being tested for. What will they do? They will guess and hope for the best. I'm glad that all of you are comfortable with scientists guessing their results, but quite frankly, I am not comfortable with it at all. What I want to see is multiple randomized double-blind studies that agree with one another. And what I don't want to see is a lot of regurgitation of refuted studies and a lot of atheistic shouting that neo-Darwin evolution is unconditionally true and unquestionable.","Databed","467707","Are you really going to insult me with this again? The false positive he refers to is not one which confirms evolution or natural selection actually occur!!!! Please, you need a reality check. The article explains that the statistical method they were using to analyze gene sequences is flawed. In this case, the bias is not in the study, not in the article and not in the information. It's in the reader. You want so badly to find something debunking evolution, so the first article you find that says in the title ""natural selection"" and ""wrong"" you take to mean you've actually got some ammunition in this argument. The fact is, you have nothing because you decided to completely ignore the fact that the title says ""natural selection studies"" and not just ""natural selection."" I never claimed that there were no false positives. These are clinical studies. What is wrong with you? And I am not concerned with whether the giraffe's long neck is the result of sexual selection or not. That has no bearing on whether evolution is correct or incorrect. You have a hard time staying relevant, don't you? Irrelevant to evolution. You just wasted your time writing all of this. You are taking a few examples from clinical studies of bad test methods as they apply to medical diagnosis and blanketing it across all of science as if one example of poor reasoning casts doubt on all reasoning. I hope you are capable of realizing how dumb that is. As far as the type of evidence for evolution, look at it this way. In a crime investigation, labs use tire impressions to prove that a particular tire was at a particular place within a particular time interval. Happens all the time. Now, say you have one thousand beat up, worn tires, each with distinctive cuts, gravel in the tread, wear patterns, etc. In order to prove a theory, you need to prove that any combination of one or more tires was at a particular place at a particular time, etc etc. So you set out to prove that any one of the tires was there and to your amazement, you prove that ALL the tires were there. That's the kind of evidence that we have for evolution. Now, evolution is a simple theory that explains a LOT of things we see in biology. You are going to find lots of studies related to evolution. However, there are no studies in modern times that serve to confirm or refute that evolution occurs as the process of descent from a single organism through natural selection. The studies you are looking for don't exist or if they do, they failed and never got submitted.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","09:25 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","103"
"12-19-2012","21431",7,"Zosimus","467634","I find your argument quite confusing. You claim that low intelligence corresponds with low sexual selection. Nevertheless sexual selection is supposedly engrained in the genes and the instinct of an animal. If an animal prefers a specific mating scent, for example, supposedly those males that produce said scent will be favored in breeding regardless of intelligence or lack of same. The arguments you are making (or at least appear to be making) are those contained at Mate choice - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia which claim that R.A. Fischer in 1915 claimed runaway selection resulted in making things like long peacock tails. Yet I have already posted links refuting this claim. Later in the article we see that Bateman supposedly presented experimental evidence using Drosophila for supposed sexual selection, yet this study, when redone, was inconclusive and had methodological flaws. So kindly refer me to the study you are referring to and ensure that this study does not reference the now-refuted Bateman study. Next you claim that you are not using induction to support induction. But later you say ""Perhaps I get it from observed consistency in every conceivable objective analysis of reality."" So basically you are claiming that what you have seen so far is a valid sample of the universe as a whole - in a sense that you can use your past experiences to predict your future experiences. But how do you know that the past is a good guide to the future? Just because it worked in the past? Isn't that circular logic? Let's take this premise and run with it. Let's assume that my experiences are representative of the entire universe. I can, therefore, claim that the entire universe speaks Spanish. After all, my wife speaks Spanish, my friends speak Spanish, my students speak Spanish, the administrative staff here speaks Spanish. All the bus drivers and bus riders speak Spanish. Therefore the entire UNIVERSE speaks Spanish. Do you think this is a valid logical chain? No? Then why is your chain of reasoning more valid? Finally as for gene expression, YES, I am suggesting that gene expression is inherited as well as genes (see Inherited variation in gene expr... [Annu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. 2009] - PubMed - NCBI ) nor am I suggesting that gene expression is controlled by psychic impulses. Rather I am suggesting that things like diet can affect it (see Up-regulation of the tumor suppressor... [Anticancer Res. 1998 May-Jun] - PubMed - NCBI ) or exposure to sun (see Vitamin D found to influence over 200 genes, highlighting links to disease ). Quote: ""The vitamin D receptor is a protein activated by vitamin D, which attaches itself to DNA and thus influences what proteins are made from our genetic code"" (emphasis added).","Freedom","467713","Well here is where the terminology is causing some confusion. When I say sexual selection I mean what pandion means and not what is really natural from the term. I do not mean any trait selected for by the opposite gender or competing within the same gender. I mean specifically those traits which have no bearing on survival. As databed said this is counter-intuitive because obviously sexual selection is an attempt to predict the quality of genes with respect to objective values and any difference between the outcome of mate selection and survival should be chocked up to errors or inefficiency in evaluating the genes of potential mates. You're right it's not tied to intelligence alone and I shouldn't have implied that, but it is tied to an attempt to evaluate genes before mating; something I don't think organisms with the ecological niche like the fruit fly would do. Their lives are short and fast and there is little room for being picky. Higher intelligence does correlate to sexual selection however because more complex evaluations are possible and complex processes are more prone to error than simple ones. You posted a link which you purported failed to find any sexual selection. I pointed out why this does not refute the possibility of sexual selection. Well before he got banned you could have asked accipiter and he would have told you I don't use references. Not quite true, but I don't use them in place of arguments certainly. I don't need a study demonstrating sexual selection when I can derive it's existence from well established facts. Do reproductive ratios depend on who can find a mate and how often they reproduce? Yes. Do animals display selectivity in reproduction? Yes. Are animals infallible? No. Therefore at least some of the time reproductive ratios are affected by animals selecting useless traits in mates. It's an axiom which means it can appear to be circular logic, but it's an axiom so it's inescapable as well. We cannot think except by assuming the existence of truth. If it's true that the universe has mechanics than those mechanics govern the future just as surely as they have governed the past. Without mechanics no consistent phenomenon are possible, yet we observe consistent phenomenon. Therefore, even if we don't understand it at the time we can only assume there are mechanics relating all future events to the current state of things and the current state of things to the past state of things. because all I said is that spanish is not and cannot be non-spanish and that if you can identify that everyone you know is speaking spanish you could have done it five minutes ago and predicted they would still be speaking spanish if you understood the reasons people speak any language. Obviously it changes during an organisms lifetime, it could not operate any other way. However I still don't buy this could truly be considered heritable since it is a dynamic system. It would be more accurate to say the parent and child have the same ability to adapt to vitamin D dosages.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","12:23 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","104"

How can any being you create down to the tiniest detail be anything other than a pre-programmed robot to you.... who knows every facet of it's function and nature? 2. If God can't do something that is contradictory than God can't do anything, he is bound by what we would call truth or reality. If God is so bound there can be no divine mysteries. I know that is a catholic doctrine but seeing as they thought the whole thing out I'll just tell you that when they came across a contradiction in scripture (which practically everyone here keeps bringing to your attention at various times) they call it a divine mystery and Aquinas tells us we need to have faith because only the mind of God can understand.
