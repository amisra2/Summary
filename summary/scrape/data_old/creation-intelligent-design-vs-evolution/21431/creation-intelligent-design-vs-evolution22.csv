"02-04-2013","21431",22,"Databed","469795","It has long been known that a huge portion of our genes originated by viral insertion. This is not news and it does not cast doubt on ERVs common to related species. An ERV is identified because it is unique to a common phylogenetic branch and in evolutionary terms it is not old enough to have undergone so much mutation as to make it untraceable between species far enough advanced from a common ancestor. I never said only outer rings are counted, not really sure where you got that. If a particular Douglass fir can be matched in 113 places then it is not a valid candidate for dendrochronilogy and only an idiot would claim that each of the matches carry a near 100 percent certainty. Clearly you are wrong when you say it does. You are going to have to do better than this. Picking one occasion where the science did not work and is not even applicable to the science does not cast doubt on the science itself. Finding one ERV that has changed between species over the last 2 million years is not surprising and does not cast doubt on the other hundreds of markers that have been preserved. If you can devise a theory that better explains why there ARE so many facts that support evolution, then we can have a conversation. Until then, you're out of gas and you lose. By the way, I knew you would have nothing to say about the OTHER forms of radiometric dating.","Zosimus","469935","(sigh) Databed, nothing positive is known. Nothing positive can be known.

These t-values are considerably lower than those obtained for some of the historically incorrect dates produced by Yamaguchi's experiment."" The paper has links to his sources for this information. One of those links is http://www.informath.org/ATSU04a.pdf which states: Quote: The most commonly-used method for statistically matching tree rings relies on what are called t-scores. (The t-score is detailed in most introductory statistics texts; it is closely related to the coefficient of correlation.) In principle, a t-score is just a way of giving a confidence level assuming the following: 3 the ring width in one year is independent of ring widths in other years, and ring widths have the same normal (i.e. bell-shaped) probability distribution. The first assumption is well known to be false (because the environment in one growing season affects the tree not only in that growing season but also in the next). Experience with the t-score method indicates that it can nonetheless work well, provided that it is used in a manner appropriate for tree rings. Broadly speaking, a t-score above 3.5 is considered to indicate a tree-ring match. A t-score above 5.0 would be considered as implying a certain match by most tree-ring specialists. (These levels for t-scores are conventional; for critical discussion of how good those conventions are, see Section 5.) Another statistical method used in tree-ring matching relies on what I will call gscores. (The g-score is commonly called gleichlufigkeit [Schweingruber, 1989] or trend.) The g-score is the proportion (or percentage) of years in which two trees ring widths increased or decreased together (i.e. increased or decreased from the prior year). This method thus ignores the size of the increase or decrease. Because it ignores so much information, the g-score method might be expected to be less reliable than the tscore method. Experience at Hohenheim, Germany, where g-scores were previously used, seems to support this: matches were thrice found to be in error, each time after strong assertions of reliability [Baillie, 1995: ch.2; Spurk et al., 1998]. Early trials in Ireland also indicated problems, and the method was abandoned there A third statistical method used in tree-ring matching is the linear time series method. Very briefly, this method is similar to the t-score method, except that the first assumption of t-scores (ring widths are independent of each other) is replaced by this: the ring width in one year is linearly-dependent on ring widths of prior years. This assumption is much more realistic than the first t-score assumption, though still not fully accurate (because the growth mechanism of tree rings is more complicated). 1 Among the three methods, then, the linear time series method is the best. That method, however, is not widely used in tree-ring studies. The reason for this is unclear (perhaps it is convention). The linear time series method was developed, in the 1970s, as a general tool for statistical analyses. Research papers applying it to tree rings appeared in the 1980s [Monserud, 1986; Yamaguchi, 1986; Biondi & Swetnam, 1987]. And the method is nowadays taught in first-year graduate courses at what is often considered to be the worlds leading institution for tree-ring studies, the University of Arizona Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research.

A reasonable explanation can be found at Hypothetico-deductive model . The first thing you may think when you read about it is, ""Oh yeah, that's the scientific method"" but really there is no scientific method . Real scientists may use any method they choose to try to arrive at truth. First of all we take a look at the world around us, note some things, and wonder about them. Then we develop a hypothesis that explains what we see. Once we have that hypothesis we deduce what we will see in the real world if that hypothesis is true. If we find that the hypothesis does not permit us to clearly deduce what will and, more importantly, what will not happen then the hypothesis is unscientific. Only falsifiable hypotheses (those that can be proven false by experimental data) are testable and therefore scientific. Once we have specific predictions about what will happen under certain circumstances we can perform an experiment . Only experiments that have a real non-zero chance of falsifying the hypothesis are valid. If what we find is inconsistent with the hypothesis then the hypothesis is falsified and we must return to the hypothesis building stage. If what we find is consistent with the hypothesis then it may be tempting to consider that the hypothesis is true. This, however, is a logical error. This formal fallacy is called Affirming the consequent . Since no one has proved that nature is uniform this method also runs afoul of the Problem of induction . One suggested solution is to use Bayesian analysis to try to measure the subjective level of belief in the hypothesis in a consistent mathematical way. Corroborating evidence is philosophically problematic. The classic example, which I have already raised, is the Raven paradox in which two men arguing about the color of ravens find that green apples are corroborating evidence for the hypothesis that all ravens are black. Hempel, the originator of the paradox, describes it in this way: 1. Hypothesis: All ravens are black. 2. Therefore everything that is not black is not a raven. 3. Nevermore, my pet raven, is black. This is evidence supporting the hypothesis. 4. This green (and therefore not black) thing is an apple (and thus not a raven) and this is also evidence supporting the theory that all ravens are black.

So, how could the experiment work if my hypothesis was wrong?","Zosimus","470215","Ok, first of all, Freedom, what you have ""hypothesized"" is not a theory. A theory seeks to explain not only what happens but why it happens. The standard theory of capacitors is that they are composed of metal and that atoms naturally seek to have a full (usually an octet) of electrons in their shells. Since metals have (it is theorized) either +1 or +2 electrons over filling their suborbital (either p or d) these electrons have the tendency to move around quite freely forming a full suborbital on one and later on another in kind of a random fashion. Now the theory of capacitors is that as a direct current voltage is applied to the capacitor that initially a large number of electrons will rush onto the plates initially than smaller and smaller numbers as the plate becomes more and more saturated with electrons and there is greater and greater resistance to storing more electrons there. This is what is called ""electron flow theory."" However, when I was in college they didn't teach us that, rather we learned what was called ""conventional flow theory."" That is we learned that the positive side could be compared to a glass of water with some holes so that it flowed out at a certain rate. This is far easier to visualize (something flowing from a high point to a low point) and has the additional advantage that the symbols for diodes show an arrow pointing the way that the current can flow (provided, of course, that you use conventional flow - not electron flow). Our teachers freely told us that what they were teaching us wasn't in accordance with the latest theories of how electronics worked and then told us to learn their method anyway. Really it doesn't matter - both methods lead you (usually) to correct conclusions about the circuit in question. Nevertheless, I must admit that there were times when we were in the lab and things didn't go according to what was represented in our books. Sometimes our amplifiers didn't amplify and our oscillators didn't oscillate. Even though we were sure we were biasing our class A amplifiers at midpoint they saturated before they cut off. What can I tell you? I very quickly learned that you did the best you could and when your circuit didn't work out you faked your numbers, turned it in, and still got good grades. Now I cannot tell you why the circuits didn't always work out. Were the circuits shown in our books simply badly designed? Were our resistors or FETs out of tolerance? Did our breadboards lack conductivity in certain spots? No one knows and no one cares - they use class B amplifiers in car stereos anyway and if it's not perfectly biased no one's going to know the difference plus you can always blame it on poor manufacturing processes in China and still pick up your paycheck. But I do want to talk about what is called the ""God of the Gaps"" logical fallacy. There are some people who say, ""Since you cannot think of an explanation for (x) you must agree with me when I claim that God did (x)."" This is a special form of the argumentum ad ignorantiam logical fallacy. Yet really what you are doing is basically the same thing. Let's suppose that tomorrow you come up with some other (non-electronic) argument and I cannot provide an alternate theory that explains why something occurs. This does not mean that your theory is the only one. There may be other people in the world who have alternate theories or, even if there aren't, someone may come up with an alternate theory tomorrow or a hundred years in the future that ends up being accepted as the real explanation long after we're dead. When Newton launched his Law of Universal Gravitation no one had thought that maybe space was curved or that atomic particles contained gravitons. It wasn't until after Einstein was born and Max Planck did his experiments that these ideas became popular. A simple look at Spokane Daily Chronicle - Google News Archive Search shows that in 1937 people still thought that radio waves travelled through an ""ether"" and praised Marconi for figuring out a way to make a radio to transmit waves through this ether. No one believes in luminiferous ether any more, but Marconi's radio worked just fine regardless of the theory used to explain it.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","01:36 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","330"
