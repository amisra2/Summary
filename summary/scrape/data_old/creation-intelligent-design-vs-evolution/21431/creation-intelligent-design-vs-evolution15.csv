What you are thinking of is a conditional statement. /If sqrt(2) is rational then it can be expressed as a/b (with said conditions) /It cannot be expressed as a/b //Therefore it is not rational The conditional can work in the other way just as easily. /If and only if sqrt(2) is irrational can it be impossible to express as a/b (wc)(we get to say this because that the definition of rational is that you can write a fraction of whole numbers) /It cannot be expressed as a/b //Therefore it is irrational Where's the assumption of rationality? Where is the circular logic?","Zosimus","468156","Ok, you say that you know the square root of 2 is irrational because it can't be expressed as a rational (a/b) number. Yet it took me less than a minute to write a simple computer program that calculates rational numbers that might be the square root of 2. For example the program suggested that 1368369/967583 might very well work. Well if you calculate it out carefully you find that it's pretty close but not exactly the square root of 2. So what should we do? Should we let one program run constantly finding new possibilities while another program runs discarding them in the hopes that one day we will eventually find the rational number that is the exact square root of 2? No - there's no need. Why? Because there exists a logical proof (which I have already posted) that demonstrates that it will never be possible to find a rational number that is the square root of 2. How did that proof start? Well, it started by positing that the square root of 2 was a rational number and going from that to find contradictions. You cannot merely say that the square root of 2 is an irrational number by simply asserting that it is so.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","12:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","215"
"01-02-2013","21431",15,"Easyrider","467980","The fascinating story of how DNA studies confirm an ancient Biblical tradition The Cohanim - DNA Connection From the article: Jewish tradition, based on the Torah, is that all Cohanim are direct descendants of Aaron, the brother of Moses. The Cohen line is patrilineal -- passed from father to son without interruption for 3,300 years, or more than 100 generations. Dr. Skorecki considered a hypothesis: if the Cohanim are descendants of one man, they should have a common set of genetic markers -- a common haplotype -- that of their common ancestor. In our case, Aaron HaCohen. A study was undertaken to test the hypothesis. If there were a common ancestor, the Cohanim should have common genetic markers at a higher frequency than the general Jewish population. In the first study, as reported in the prestigious British science journal, Nature (January 2, 1997), 188 Jewish males were asked to contribute some cheek cells from which their DNA was extracted for study. Participants from Israel, England and North America were asked to identify whether they were a Cohen, Levi or Israelite, and to identify their family background. The results of the analysis of the Y chromosome markers of the Cohanim and non-Cohanim were indeed significant. A particular marker, (YAP-) was detected in 98.5 percent of the Cohanim, and in a significantly lower percentage of non-Cohanim.","Zosimus","468157","The article is absurd as well as your conclusions. The article claims that this special YAP- marker which has been preserved for some 3300 years. This marker is not found in Levites. Yet Aaron was the great-grandson of Levi. As such he received his Y chromosome from Levi the same as all other Levites. Why should we believe that Aaron's offspring were able to keep it intact for 3300 years but Levi couldn't keep it for a paltry 3 generations. Later we read that they find a CMH marker that correctly identified 97 of 106 Cohens tested. That's about 91.5 percent - yet real studies are based on reaching a 95 statistical confidence level. The CMH test is 3.5 percent short. Later we read that the test works on ""over 80 percent"" of self-identified Cohens. This is, again, well short of the 95 percent level. Then the doctor claims: ""For more than 90 percent of the Cohens to share the same genetic markers after such a period of time is a testament to the devotion of the wives of the Cohens over the years. Even a low rate of infidelity would have dramatically lowered the percentage."" Again, this is not true. It's entirely possible that women who married Cohens cheated a lot, but merely got it on with their husband's brother or cousin who had the same Y chromosome.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","12:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","216"
"01-02-2013","21431",15,"Databed","468002","So, are you asserting that 80% of our scientific knowledge is wrong? You are an idiot. There is no research into whether or not evolution occurs. This is why you found no false positives in which the said positive was confirming evolution. Stop talking about stupid p-value and statistics. Like I said earlier when you attacked my knowledge of forensics, this is not the same kind of evidence we use to verify evolution. Stop your irrelevant, dimwitted attempt at being profound - as if you are blowing our minds here. Minds...not blown, or if they are, only by your total lack of any ability to understand anything that wasn't concocted in your own stupid brain. I believe Freedom already addressed this. You are misusing your 100 level logic terms again. Why would we do that, you think 80% of science is completely false. No, you would either come to the conclusion that the two species either didn't share a common ancestor after the insertion event or that the genome had been purged of the insertion. I though you understood this... Again, there is no wrong conclusion in the paper - the bias is in the reader. Their conclusion is that the retroviral insertion has been partially purged from one species. What's more, there are STILL remnants of that insertion within the genome of all three species. You read one tiny article on the subject and this makes you an expert? You really need to do more research before you come in here and make yourself look stupid. They do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They do!!!!! read dumbass...read, read, read Idiotic, stupid, ignorant. You honestly believe we descended from chimps???! Holy XXXX, who am I arguing with? Such an old, tired argument. What it shows to you is obviously very different from what it actually shows. You need to do better than this...","Zosimus","468158","You seem to like to shoot the messenger. No, I am not claiming that scientific knowledge is 80 percent wrong; rather that is the conclusion of several studies. For example at Lies, Damned Lies, and Medical Science - David H. Freedman - The Atlantic we find, ""80 percent of non-randomized studies (by far the most common type)...were later convincingly refuted."" At Cancer industry total fraud exposed: Nearly all 'scientific' studies fail to be replicated we read that 47 of 53 studies could not be replicated. That's more than 88 percent wrong. Now I know what you want to say - you want to say that this is just concentrated in the medical industry. Are you really that naive? I say again: It can be proved that the majority of published research findings are false. This is a direct quote from PLOS Medicine: Why Most Published Research Findings Are False So don't shoot the messenger. Learn to live with the truth, instead. Now back to Spread Of Endogenous Retrovirus K Is Similar In The DNA Of Humans And Rhesus Monkeys wherein we read: ""...a surprising pattern was observed."" Now since you seem to be too much of a simpleton to understand clear English let me explain it to you: When something found is surprising that means that it was not previously predicted by theories. If it had been predicted, then the findings would not have been surprising. Now the researchers say, ""The data suggested that the humans and rhesus have been purging ERV-K copies from their genomes..."" This is speculation. The only way to know that humans have been purging ERV-K copies from their genomes is to get DNA from humans some 5,000 years ago and compare it to DNA from humans today. Needless to say 5,000 year old DNA is not something you can just pick up at WalMart. Instead we are seeing conclusions drawn from a questionable premise: That humans, chimps, and rheuses monkeys share a common ancestor. These surprising findings do not support that conclusion. That's when ad hoc hypothesizing comes into play. This is why Imre Lakatos said, ""...nobody to date has yet found a demarcation criterion according to which Darwin can be described as scientific."" One final note: You said, ""...this is not the same kind of evidence we use to verify evolution."" This sentence smacks of Verificationism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia the refuted logical positivist philosophy that claimed that statements are only legitimate if they can be verified to be either true or false (empirically). However, as almost everyone has pointed out, the statement that unverifiable statements are illegitimate is itself unverifiable (and therefore illegitimate according to its own reasoning).","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","12:43 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","217"
"01-02-2013","21431",15,"None","None","None","Zosimus","468161","The Truth Wears Off In 1991, the Danish zoologist Anders Mller, at Uppsala University, in Sweden, made a remarkable discovery about sex, barn swallows, and symmetry. It had long been known that the asymmetrical appearance of a creature was directly linked to the amount of mutation in its genome, so that more mutations led to more fluctuating asymmetry. (An easy way to measure asymmetry in humans is to compare the length of the fingers on each hand.) What Mller discovered is that female barn swallows were far more likely to mate with male birds that had long, symmetrical feathers. This suggested that the picky females were using symmetry as a proxy for the quality of male genes. Mllers paper, which was published in Nature, set off a frenzy of research. Here was an easily measured, widely applicable indicator of genetic quality, and females could be shown to gravitate toward it. Aesthetics was really about genetics. In the three years following, there were ten independent tests of the role of fluctuating asymmetry in sexual selection, and nine of them found a relationship between symmetry and male reproductive success. It didnt matter if scientists were looking at the hairs on fruit flies or replicating the swallow studiesfemales seemed to prefer males with mirrored halves. Before long, the theory was applied to humans. Researchers found, for instance, that women preferred the smell of symmetrical men, but only during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle. Other studies claimed that females had more orgasms when their partners were symmetrical, while a paper by anthropologists at Rutgers analyzed forty Jamaican dance routines and discovered that symmetrical men were consistently rated as better dancers. Then the theory started to fall apart. In 1994, there were fourteen published tests of symmetry and sexual selection, and only eight found a correlation. In 1995, there were eight papers on the subject, and only four got a positive result. By 1998, when there were twelve additional investigations of fluctuating asymmetry, only a third of them confirmed the theory. Worse still, even the studies that yielded some positive result showed a steadily declining effect size. Between 1992 and 1997, the average effect size shrank by eighty per cent. And its not just fluctuating asymmetry. In 2001, Michael Jennions, a biologist at the Australian National University, set out to analyze temporal trends across a wide range of subjects in ecology and evolutionary biology. He looked at hundreds of papers and forty-four meta-analyses (that is, statistical syntheses of related studies), and discovered a consistent decline effect over time, as many of the theories seemed to fade into irrelevance. In fact, even when numerous variables were controlled forJennions knew, for instance, that the same author might publish several critical papers, which could distort his analysisthere was still a significant decrease in the validity of the hypothesis, often within a year of publication. Jennions admits that his findings are troubling, but expresses a reluctance to talk about them publicly. This is a very sensitive issue for scientists, he says. You know, were supposed to be dealing with hard facts, the stuff thats supposed to stand the test of time. But when you see these trends you become a little more skeptical of things. What happened? Leigh Simmons, a biologist at the University of Western Australia, suggested one explanation when he told me about his initial enthusiasm for the theory: I was really excited by fluctuating asymmetry. The early studies made the effect look very robust. He decided to conduct a few experiments of his own, investigating symmetry in male horned beetles. Unfortunately, I couldnt find the effect, he said. But the worst part was that when I submitted these null results I had difficulty getting them published. The journals only wanted confirming data. It was too exciting an idea to disprove, at least back then. For Simmons, the steep rise and slow fall of fluctuating asymmetry is a clear example of a scientific paradigm, one of those intellectual fads that both guide and constrain research: after a new paradigm is proposed, the peer-review process is tilted toward positive results. But then, after a few years, the academic incentives shiftthe paradigm has become entrenchedso that the most notable results are now those that disprove the theory. Jennions, similarly, argues that the decline effect is largely a product of publication bias, or the tendency of scientists and scientific journals to prefer positive data over null results, which is what happens when no effect is found. The bias was first identified by the statistician Theodore Sterling, in 1959, after he noticed that ninety-seven per cent of all published psychological studies with statistically significant data found the effect they were looking for. A significant result is defined as any data point that would be produced by chance less than five per cent of the time. This ubiquitous test was invented in 1922 by the English mathematician Ronald Fisher, who picked five per cent as the boundary line, somewhat arbitrarily, because it made pencil and slide-rule calculations easier. Sterling saw that if ninety-seven per cent of psychology studies were proving their hypotheses, either psychologists were extraordinarily lucky or they published only the outcomes of successful experiments. In recent years, publication bias has mostly been seen as a problem for clinical trials, since pharmaceutical companies are less interested in publishing results that arent favorable. But its becoming increasingly clear that publication bias also produces major distortions in fields without large corporate incentives, such as psychology and ecology.

As for copying, do you have any evidence of significant errors in the manuscripts? Strongs 3117 yowm (yom) (day) d. days, lifetime (pl.) e. time, period (general) Yowm - Old Testament Hebrew Lexicon - New American Standard In my personal Strongs Concordance, on page 48 of the definitions, it also has or fig. (figuratively) a space of time defined by an associated term (and context). You apparently didn't dig deeper into context, etc. For instance, on the third ""day,"" God formed the land out of the seas. There is no time frame given for the formation of the land and seas. Some time after the land was formed, God created the plants: Then God said, ""Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with seed in them, on the earth""; and it was so. (Genesis 1:11) And the earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with seed in them, after their kind; and God saw that it was good. (Genesis 1:12) The text clearly states that the earth ""sprouted"" the plants (the Hebrew word deshe, Strong's #H1877, usually refers to grasses). The Hebrew word dasha, (Strong's #H1876) indicates that the plants grew from either seeds or small seedlings in order to have ""sprouted."" In addition, these plants produced seeds. The Hebrew word here is zera (Strong's #H2233), which is most often translated ""descendants."" This makes matters very difficult for the 24-hour interpretation. Not only do the plants sprout and grow to maturity, but produce seed or descendants. There are no plants capable of doing this within a 24-hour period of time. Things actually get worse for this interpretation. Genesis 1:12 clearly states that God allowed the earth to bring forth trees that bore fruit. The process by which the earth brings forth trees to the point of bearing fruit takes several years, at minimum. God did not create the trees already bearing fruit. The text states clearly that He allowed the earth to accomplish the process of fruit bearing through natural means. Because the process of the third day requires a minimum period of time of more than 24 hours, the Genesis text for the third day clearly falsifies the interpretation that the days of Genesis one are 24-hour periods of time. Genesis Clearly Teaches that the Days Were NOT 24 Hours But wait, it gets even worse for you in thinking the Genesis account stipulates 24 hour days. Genesis 2:4 literally reads, ""in the day (yom) of the Lord God making (made) the earth and heavens."" Right away, Moses, the author of Genesis, who also wrote of the 'days' of creation, describes those 'days' as one day, or one time period. It's the same Hebrew word. The implication is clear - Moses' day (yom) in Genesis 2:4 refers not to a 24-hour day but, rather, to a much longer period of timein this case, the entire span of creation events.

Some he's active with and some he's not because, like you, they don't work on a relationship. Once again, the earliest churches did not refer to themselves as Catholic or otherwise. They were just ""Christian."" The Catholics would have you believe they were the first but that's bs. You don't see the word Catholic anywhere in the NT either, and numerous churches were up and running by the end of the first century. Significant means major events or doctrines of Biblical Christianity (the virgin birth, the resurrection, salvation in Christ, etc.). And until you can show me where any translation fault impacted those in a meaningful way, you have nothing of any real significance. Do you have anything major that blows any of those out of the water or not??? I just showed you examples of when it doesn't mean a 24 hour day. In Genesis 2:4 a day comprised the entire time of creation events (all 7 days). Are you trying to tell me that's a 24 hour day? Come on. In other places later in the Bible it does mean a 24 hour day. You have to look at it in CONTEXT . You can have three people in a family who are ""human."" Why are three persons united (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) as God that perplexing to you?

The truth is not defined as the opinion of John P. A. Ioannidis Indeed it is speculation, but databed was correct that the article indicated that all of our species share fragments from the ERV in question. Or you could realize that ERV sequences aren't inserted in fragmented partial sequences so if there is enough to recognize it at any point in time it can be said that at some point it was inserted.","Zosimus","468194","In your post you claim that you have proved that the square root of 2 is irrational starting with the assumption that it is rational. I disagree that you have done any such thing. Suppose I wish to prove that God exists. I start by assuming that God exists, from which I deduce that the Bible is true, and since the Bible proclaims that God exists, I conclude that I have proved God's existence. Do you agree? No? Then why do you think you can prove that the square root of 2 is irrational by starting with the assumption that it is, indeed, irrational? Second, although it is true that John Ioannidis' opinion is not truth, per se, the fact that he prepared a mathematical proof that the majority of research findings are false should make things simple for you. If you wish to destroy his proof all you need is a little mathematical ability - I encourage you to have at it and post your mathematical counter-proof right here. You might want to start at ""ASSESSING THE UNRELIABILITY OF THE MEDICAL LITERATURE: A RESPONSE TO "" by Steven Goodman and Sander Greenland to get you off on the right foot, but be aware that this critique has been counter-critiqued at Why Most Published Research Findings Are False: Author's Reply to Goodman and Greenland Personally I'd welcome a real debate here. I could have sworn this was a debate forum but real debate seems to be lacking. Now, finally, for ERV-K copies. First of all in the study one supposes that the ERV-K was partially found by the team doing the study. As I've already pointed out, the vast majority of research findings are false with non-replication rates between 67-88 percent. As such, I doubt that this study in question supposedly finding partially-purged ERV-K copies could be replicated. Additionally I cite the follow-up post I made about replicated studies also eventually being impossible to demonstrate despite concerted effort. Another point to note would be this: Even if this study had found exact ERV-K copies in chimps, this would mean nothing at all because confirmations do not strengthen a hypothesis. Perhaps you doubt this. To illustrate the point, let's turn to Hempel's Paradox. Imagine that we have two men living on the same island who are in disagreement about the color of ravens. The first man insists that all ravens are black, whereas the second man is equally insistent that he once owned a white raven, has seen a white raven on the island so at least some ravens are white. They have come to me for help in proving that all ravens are black (or white) as they cannot leave the island. As I have never seen a raven, I merely collect all the birds I can find and bring them back to the island. I have green parrots, gray pigeons, white doves, brown sparrows, etc., in copious quantities. After seeing the evidence Man 1 argues as follows: All ravens are black is the same as saying that all non-black things are not ravens. Here we have a large number of non-black things, none of which are ravens. Accordingly my hypothesis has been confirmed not once but several times. You will also note, he argues, that we have some white birds. Any one of those could have been a raven, but none of them are. Accordingly your claim that some ravens are white has been badly damaged by all of this evidence. Naturally Man 2 disagrees saying that all of the evidence collected has no bearing on whether or not ravens are black, white, or any other color. Who do you agree with, and why? Be specific. Personally I feel (regarding ERV-K copies) that any finding that is not predicted is harmful to the theory and any finding that is predicted is merely neutral to the theory in question. Now perhaps you and other people think that statistics holds the key to resolving these problems in the philosophy of science. I am skeptical about that, as well. As Popper noted, if we imagine a hypothesis (H) and Evidence (E). Part of this hypothesis may be deductively entailed from the evidence. To cater for this possibility we break H into A and B and E into B and C. In this way the B part of the evidence supports the B part of the hypothesis. A, B, and C are probabilistically independent. Accordingly the probability of (A and B) is equal to the P(A) times the P(B). Now in order for us to say that the hypothesis is confirmed by the evidence we must say that the probability of the hypothesis (given the evidence) i.e. P(H|E) is greater than P(H) on its own. Now since we have divided E into A and B we can see that the extent to which the evidence supports the hypothesis is the same as the deductive support we can draw from the B portion. In other words the probability of A given the evidence i.e. P(A|E) is the same as P(A). So there's no way, according to this logic, that inductive findings can give probabilistic support to a theory. Although if you have a differing point of view, I'll be glad to hear you out. P.S. The above argument was merely copied from Ravens Paradox in Wikipedia.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","12:03 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","225"
