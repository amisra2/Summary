"12-06-2012","21431",2,"Zosimus","467160","Well, if you really wanted we could talk about the evolution of the automobile or Peruvian commercial law. However, these things are things that ""evolved"" due to the interaction and efforts of intelligent actors. Unless you're an intelligent design advocate, I doubt that would be profitable for either of us. I noted the tone of your response as rather insulting and so I hope you won't feel offended when I take the same tone. What comes around goes around, you know. What reason do you or does anyone have for thinking that chimps and humans share a common ancestor? You gave no reason, but you didn't object to Freedom mentioning that there is an apparent similarity between chimp and human DNA. Usually people tell me that it's 99 percent, but as you'll see if you look at (the url had to be deleted as my post count is less than 5) the latest numbers are closer to 96 percent. A deeper reading tells us that all of this information comes from one single male chimp named Clint who lived in Atlanta. Now I could easily go from there into questions as to why anyone would think that this one chimp is representative of all chimps(and I probably will, but in future posts, not this one. Rather in this post I will work around to my point by starting with this allegory: My wife believes (as do a great many Peruvians) that when a child is sick or uncomfortable that this problem can be cured by passing an egg over them and that this egg will draw out of them the fright or illness as it hovers over their body. Later the egg can be cracked open and inspected to see exactly what problem there is with the child. My wife routinely does this with my children and she is quite confident that it works. However, I'm not a believer and I believe I have good reasons not to be. I shall generalize the theory as follows: If I pass the egg over the child (hereinafter ""P"") then the child will feel better (hereinafter ""Q"") so the situation can be represented symbolically as P=>Q (P implies Q or if P then Q). Later the child feels better (Q) and we therefore determine that P has been confirmed. Unfortunately this is a classic example of the ""affirming the consequent"" logical fallacy. Nothing has been proved at all. Rather it seems likely to me (and perhaps to you too) that the child was likely to get better all on his own and so passing the egg over him had no bearing at all on the final outcome. I assume that we agree so far. The problem is that the chimpanzee-human-DNA-similarity argument follows fundamentally the same logical pattern. If humans and chimps share a common ancestor (P) then their DNA will be quite similar (Q). We find that their DNA is quite similar (Q) therefore P is confirmed. In reality the only thing that has been confirmed is that you are sorely in need of a remedial logic class. But wait, you may exclaim, yes it's true that nothing is proved per se but really it should be analyzed statistically. What are the chances that out of the 3 billion or so genes that 96 percent of them would be similar just by chance ? Really the odds are quite staggering, don't you think? Here we have the second logical fallacy: The strawman argument. You see, those people who oppose your claim do not believe that chimp and human DNA are similar just by chance but rather as a result of intelligent (often divine) design. In short, your argument has not accomplished anything at all except to reinforce the belief that you already had. Which leads me back to my original conclusion: You believe in evolution not because the facts support it but rather because of an a priori philosophical bias in favor of evolution due to your atheistic beliefs. You see, the only way that you could hope to prove that chimps and humans share a common ancestor is to prove that there was one (and only one) incident of spontaneous generation of life in the past. If that could be proved, then humans and chimps sharing a common ancestor would be fait accompli - however, evolution apologists normally back away from all discussion of abiogenesis as ""having nothing to do with evolution."" Now I don't know whether these people are dishonest, ignorant, or both, but the claim is demonstrably false. The (Neo-Darwin) theory of evolution has everything to do with abiogenesis. It seems to me that either the chance of life arising spontaneously for no reason is either so extremely remote that it could never happen even given an infinite stretch of time or that it is common enough that it did happen and that being the case, why not believe that it has happened not once but several times ? Either way the nail is in the coffin of the theory of common descent. But before I close I wanted to note your passing reference to the theory of natural selection. This theory has serious problems and a simple look at the peacock makes them glaringly evident. According to the theory of natural selection the peacock did not originally start with a long, ornate tail but rather it developed the same over generations of natural selection. Unfortunately for you, this is so ridiculous that it almost makes one laugh aloud. Who could seriously advance the idea that having a long and cumbersome tail like that makes the bird better at finding food or evading predators? Of course it does nothing of the sort, rather it makes the bird easier to be converted into some carnivore's lunch. This is, of course, why the theory is usually presented in such a way as to be tautological. ""Strange as it may seem,"" we are told, ""the peacock actually was the fittest, which we know because it survived."" Surival of the fittest where the ""fittest"" are those who have survived. So we have the remarkable theory of the survival of those who have survived. So while it may be hard to argue that this theory is false , we can at least argue that the theory is supremely unuseful as it provides no predictive value. It's untestable, unfalsifiable, and can hardly be considered scientific. Of course we usually have evolutionary apologists retreating to the tacking paradox. ""Evolution is falsifiable,"" they claim. ""All you have to do is find a rabbit fossil in the Cambrian period and voila !"" Of course they don't accept the same logic when Christians employ it. If someone were to say, ""We believe in Jesus the Christ, a god of order who has created an orderly universe. All you have to do to disprove our religion is to prove that the universe is disorderly and voila !"" then I seriously doubt that a good number of atheists would suddenly accept that Christianity is testable, falsifiable, and should be taught in science classes in public schools whereas they do think the theory of evolution should be taught. It's rather hypocritical, don't you think?","Databed","467254","I am out of town writing with an iPhone. I will respond in full this weekend. I just wanted to comment on your peacock example.

Also, I managed to get ahold of a laptop so thankfully no more writing with the cellphone. That is not fun. That was kind of my point. Please do not be one of those people who likes to argue semantics. In this forum I think it is clear what one means when he says, ""evolution."" I have already read the entirety of your response and if you think I find any of it insulting then you definitely misunderstand my stance. I could only find any of your response insulting if I had a personal stake in what I write. Unlike you, I have nothing at stake. I don't rely on my heart in giving me direction as I feel what my heart tells me is very misleading. I still have the same feeling as you, but I have been able to escape from early childhood brainwashing and come to conclusions based on unbiased reason. I do realize that you will no doubt try to find bias in what I say, but you will only be able to come upwith misled speculation. You do realize that Clint shares 99.99999999% of his DNA with other chimps, right? Besides, I highly doubt that Clint is the only Chimp that has had his DNA sequenced. In addition, DNA has been sequenced from both genomic and mitochondrial DNA from Neandertals. It not only shows that we are even more closely related to this other human species, we actually interbred with them. So, unless you carry the pure homo sapiens genome only found within a couple of tribes in Africa, you are related to Neandertal. In addition, every experiment ever performed in the field of genetics has supported the theory of evolution. Not just some of them, ALL of them. So, DNA does in fact carry information that backs up the story of evolution; however, im sure you are armed and ready to throw out the common designer argument. To that, I show you endogenious retroviral insertions. I wont go into this other than to say, if you want to argue that similarities exist between our genome and that of other species because of a common designer, this basically proves that that designer is trying to deceive us. He is representative of all chimps because he is a chimp. It really is that simple. If he were diseased, have some kind of anomalous genetic pattern, that would one thing. But...I seriously doubt that and as I stated above, I seriously doubt he is the ONLY chimp to have had his DNA sequenced. Please know that if you need to be able to reference your liberal arts philosophy class teachings to be able to spot bad logic, you have intelligence issues. And whats more, you have committed the most common of creationist falacies: your beloved scarcrow argument. You have constructed some elaborate, dumbed down representation of what genetic evolutionists are telling us and refuted it with nothing more than your own cry of logical falacy. Of course its wrong - you have a total lack of understanding of what you are refuting! Your example here is actually a strawman, but not as you think. As I said in my original post, you would claim that it was all ""just by chance."" Creationists are the ones who say this, not evolutionists. You are so far out of your league it makes me want to spark some in depth arguments about genetic scaffolding and the landscape of a series of genetic mutations with Freedom. In contrast, I believe in evolution because it is obvious! It takes the grown up brain of a brainwashed child to miss it. The claim is demonstrably true. If you want to argue abiogenesis, we can. However, evolution is a theory. Theories explain how something happens. It just so happens that evolution says nothing of abiogenesis. I will give you that most of the people smart enough to truly understand evolution DO believe that abiogenesis occured at some point and at some place. In fact, abiogenesis probably DID happen more than once. It probably has happened MANY times. However, life on Earth is so far advanced, there is no way to detect such a small event and there is no chance any self replicating molecule could compete with the complex chemical processes that are a part of the processes of life today. However, there are forms of life that most likely did result from a type of abiogenesis. Look at prions. Proteins by themselves cannot replicate. However, deformed proteins known as prions have found a way to do so and cause very devestating diseases. The peacock I have already adressed. As far as your claim that Christianity is not proven false, I beg to differ. Your belief system if not even internally consistent. You have to twist meanings around, simply ignore discrepencies, and totally ignore the conflict with what was written down by independent authors of the day. Your belief system is screwed up that it takes a complete disregard for that very same logic that you are no doubt going to continue to misuse in the coming days.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","06:52 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","28"
