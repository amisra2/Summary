[Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006] - PubMed - NCBI shows that ""We report here in vivo and in vitro experiments finding that the envelope of a particular class of ERVs of sheep, endogenous Jaagsiekte sheep retroviruses (enJSRVs), regulates trophectoderm growth and differentiation in the periimplantation conceptus (embryo/fetus and associated extraembryonic membranes). The enJSRV envelope gene is expressed in the trophectoderm of the elongating ovine conceptus after day 12 of pregnancy. Loss-of-function experiments were conducted in utero by injecting morpholino antisense oligonucleotides on day 8 of pregnancy that blocked enJSRV envelope protein production in the conceptus trophectoderm. This approach retarded trophectoderm outgrowth during conceptus elongation and inhibited trophoblast giant binucleate cell differentiation as observed on day 16. Pregnancy loss was observed by day 20 in sheep receiving morpholino antisense oligonucleotides. In vitro inhibition of the enJSRV envelope reduced the proliferation of mononuclear trophectoderm cells isolated from day 15 conceptuses. Consequently, these results demonstrate that the enJSRV envelope regulates trophectoderm growth and differentiation in the periimplantation ovine conceptus."" ---------------------- So first of all, not everyone even agrees that ERVs are retroviruses.

(see Lineage-Specific Expansions of Retroviral Insertions within the Genomes of African Great Apes but Not Humans and Orangutans ). How exactly can you explain that gorillas, chimps, bonobos, etc., have these ERVs whereas humans and orangutans don't? Supposedly humans are not as closely related to orangutans as they are to chimps.

The method of deciding that ring 7 of tree 1 is the same as ring 43 of tree 2 is called 'wiggle matching.' As I have already shown in the former article the biggest problem of 'wiggle matching' is finding multiple matches that supposedly have very high statistical probability. In 1986 D. K.

This is not news and it does not cast doubt on ERVs common to related species. An ERV is identified because it is unique to a common phylogenetic branch and in evolutionary terms it is not old enough to have undergone so much mutation as to make it untraceable between species far enough advanced from a common ancestor. I never said only outer rings are counted, not really sure where you got that. If a particular Douglass fir can be matched in 113 places then it is not a valid candidate for dendrochronilogy and only an idiot would claim that each of the matches carry a near 100 percent certainty. Clearly you are wrong when you say it does. You are going to have to do better than this. Picking one occasion where the science did not work and is not even applicable to the science does not cast doubt on the science itself. Finding one ERV that has changed between species over the last 2 million years is not surprising and does not cast doubt on the other hundreds of markers that have been preserved. If you can devise a theory that better explains why there ARE so many facts that support evolution, then we can have a conversation. Until then, you're out of gas and you lose. By the way, I knew you would have nothing to say about the OTHER forms of radiometric dating.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","12:03 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","305"
"02-01-2013","21431",21,"Freedom","469819","There are many facts which support common descent and common descent is consistent with evolution (both irrational and rational). You repeatedly confuse this relationship.","Databed","469825","Common descent is not a theory. It is an aspect of evolution but it does not explain anything. I realize that you don't accept evolution as an explanation for the diversity of life and that you have no theory to explain it. I do accept it, it makes perfect sense to me and nobody has brought anything to my attention that is both true and inconsistent with the theory. Zosimus has been digging and digging for something to stump me with but he has continuously either been misinformed, misunderstood the concept or has been completely off topic. I'm the only one in this particular thread who has always had the facts on my side. So to try and claim that I need faith to accept evolution, to deny his own hypocrisy, and to offer nothing as a better explanation, Zosimus is clearly done. He has no argument left. His attempt to deny the facts based on a religious mindset that true knowledge is unattainable by anyone with a mere human brain and based on nothing more than the writings of a single man who was tired of the games that pharmaceutical companies play during medical trials was both uninteresting and completely off the mark.
