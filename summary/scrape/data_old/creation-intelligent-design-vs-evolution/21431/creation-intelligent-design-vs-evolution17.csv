I would like support for the claim that we have sequenced the entire Neanderthal genome. He hasn't expressed any religious viewpoints nor would I care if he did. He did not originate these ideas, cynical little fools calling themselves 'philosophers' have been attacking the very foundations of human knowledge for hundreds of years. What I find ironic is that in the same universities that teach science and engineering there is inevitably a philosophy professor who will assure you (just as Zosimus is doing) that nothing can ever really be known as they spew corrupting platitudes like ""all you can really know is how little you know."" If you throw out reason then science is dead; It's corpse just another religion, and to the degree that faulty philosophy is taught and believed many who call themselves men of science are men of faith... explaining why they have no trouble being religious at the same time. You think you're free form this because you have more trust in scientist than Zosimus but you aren't. If you think our knowledge now is subject to destruction at the hands of future evidence you essentially accept Zosimus position and more. He does not care about confirmed predictions because they are not proof (deductive arguments). So what, only religious people can be wrong about anything?

For one thing, see above for posts indicating that we do in fact have human genomes much older than 5,000 years. Secondly, 5,000 years is NOT enough time to see any purging of ERV-K from our genome. Thirdly, what are you trying to prove here? I have already told you that we DO possess ERV-K in our genome. There are several different variants of the same ERV in fact due to duplications, insertions, etc. You simply do not understand the relevance of this, and also, you refuse to accept the timescales involved. I don't know what I have to do to get you to see that your arguments indicate a total lack of understanding of the implications of ERV's within our genome and that of our primate cousins. Here is a link that discusses the same study you originally posted that explained of the purging of ERV-K PLOS ONE: Demographic Histories of ERV-K in Humans, Chimpanzees and Rhesus Monkeys This article is basically explaining why there is a difference within the sequences of ERV-K within several genomes of primates. Please understand the timescales that are involved here. To be sitting here arguing about 5,000 years is stupid. We know ancient humans had ERV-K because WE have ERV-K and so do chimps, monkeys etc etc. End of argument. So what? Do you think that they mention ERV-K in this article? BTW, to sit here and claim that a partial genome is worthless is stupid. There is much information that can be gleamed from such a small genomic fragment. In addition, you seem to think that an ERV is like a point marker. Again, you are under the wrong impression. ERV-K is spread out across our genome through transpositioning, insertions, duplications, etc. Therefore, it would not be too big of a surprise to find part of it in a fragmental sequence. Again, irrelevant as we have >5,000 year human genome and also because we already know the ERV is there because we possess it in our own genome. Dendrochronology is used to calibrate carbon dating, yes. It is not necessary, it just makes for more accurate dating. Without it, you will still get a date - it will be a range, but it will indicated as such. Carbon dating may be employed in identifying approximate locations of growth rings found in ancient timbers so that the growth rings may be matched up. As you can imagine, its not easy to just look at a tree and know immediately where it belongs. But if you think that these scientists doing this are just complete XXXXXX who can't match their shapes, your just simply wrong.

These things are worthless. Rather than that post something like http://genetics.med.harvard.edu/reic...enisovaSeq.pdf which is the actual study summary because that lets me (and everyone else) read what is really being said instead of what the newspapers choose to tell us. The first thing I read was the big bold part, which says: ""We present a DNA library preparation method that has allowed us to reconstruct a high coverage (30X) genome sequence of a Denisovan, an extinct relative of Neandertals. The quality of this genome allows a direct estimation of Denisovan heterozygosity indicating that genetic diversity in these archaic hominins was extremely low. It also allows tentative dating of the specimen on the basis of missing evolution in its genome, detailed measurements of Denisovan and Neandertal admixture into present-day human populations, and the generation of a near-complete catalog of genetic changes that swept to high frequency in modern humans since their divergence from Denisovans."" Now I'm sure the authors of the study are very well meaning, intelligent, well read, unbiased, etc., etc., but when their dating method of the sequence is due to ""missing evolution in its genome"" then I think you can see how this quickly turns into a circular argument. I also laughed aloud when I saw that they were able to determine the level of genetic diversity of the entire sub-population due to a partial sample from one person. That's rich, man... really. Anyway we are to believe that they have a new, high-tech and very accurate method of recovering and reconstructing very old DNA. Now I ask you this: How do we know that it is very accurate? Did we take known DNA from today, put it in a time machine and warp it back several thousand years, bury it in a place where we could find it, dig it out, and run it through the system so we could know it worked well? Or what? I also laughed when I saw that these ancient humans branched off from modern humans some 800,000 years ago. Why just yesterday I read 'Most Recent Common Ancestor' Of All Living Humans Surprisingly Recent which indicates that the most recent common ancestor of all humans lived a mere 3,000 years ago. That sure makes it hard for them to have diverged 800,000 years ago. But after all the laughs and wiping the tears out of the eyes, let's just remember one thing: It can be proved that most claimed research findings are false.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","10:26 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","253"

I do understand their relevance: They have none. You see, you have a theory (T) that predicts findings (F). Then when you find those things (F) you think that confirms T. This is a classic example of the ""affirming the consequent"" logical fallacy. Now maybe you are of the opinion that one logical fallacy proves nothing but several thousand of them can prove Darwinism. I, however, am of the opinion that large numbers of logical fallacies prove the exact same thing that one logical fallacy does, namely, nothing. But while we're on the subject of carbon 14, let's take a look at New Research Documents Extremely High Atmospheric Carbon 14 During Last Ice Age | UANews wherein we find that all evidence points to carbon 14 having been higher in the past. Now maybe you're shrugging your shoulders and saying, ""So what?"" Here's the point: The half-life of carbon 14 is believed to be around 5730 years. For simplicity sake, let's assume that we have a piece of wood that has a small amount of carbon 14. Now we start by saying, ""We believe this wood to be 9,000 years old."" So they go to ice core samples or dendrochronology work and tell us what the 14 C levels were estimated to be 9,000 years ago. Now I seriously doubt that they can really know that, but let's ignore that argument for the moment to hone in on the one I want to make. Let's imagine that they say that 9,000 years ago the 14 C levels were x and based on that the wood turns out to be 8,600 years old (plus or minus). Victory is proclaimed and everyone goes home. In reality, however, it is entirely possible that the wood is really only 2,870 years old. Why do I say that? Well, if 14 C levels were ""x"" 8,600 years ago and 0.5x 2,870 years ago then both samples will have the exact same amount of 14 C in them today (because of the half-life). Now the math here is simplified just to make a point but the point is this: As long as 14 C was higher in the past than it is now there will always be multiple possible dates for each fragment of wood tested. The date that is selected will always be the one that confirms what scientists already believe.

Now I'm sure the authors of the study are very well meaning, intelligent, well read, unbiased, etc., etc., but when their dating method of the sequence is due to ""missing evolution in its genome"" then I think you can see how this quickly turns into a circular argument. I also laughed aloud when I saw that they were able to determine the level of genetic diversity of the entire sub-population due to a partial sample from one person. That's rich, man... really. Anyway we are to believe that they have a new, high-tech and very accurate method of recovering and reconstructing very old DNA. Now I ask you this: How do we know that it is very accurate? Did we take known DNA from today, put it in a time machine and warp it back several thousand years, bury it in a place where we could find it, dig it out, and run it through the system so we could know it worked well? Or what? I also laughed when I saw that these ancient humans branched off from modern humans some 800,000 years ago. Why just yesterday I read 'Most Recent Common Ancestor' Of All Living Humans Surprisingly Recent which indicates that the most recent common ancestor of all humans lived a mere 3,000 years ago. That sure makes it hard for them to have diverged 800,000 years ago.","Freedom","468938","This is often true when the language used is ambigous or sensationalist but when you state something like ""the genome was sequenced"" either you are flat out lying or it was sequenced. The dating is frankly irrelevant. If it's a 100 years old that means we had a common ancestor a 100 years ago. The chances that similarities in the DNA exist by chance are too low to be considered a possibility. Why did you laugh, a species is very similar to itself genetically. Can you compare a jeep and a civic from two examples? Of course within the tolerance of diversity within the jeep or civic population. I'm sure they were testing it out on degraded modern DNA. If you want to speculate that modern degraded DNA is different in an important way than ancient degraded DNA be my guest. 3,000 years ago could be the latest time any living human can trace their ancestery and connect it to the rest of living humanity. If the humans who broke off from 'modern' humans are all dead these two reports are not contradictory.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","04:44 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","255"
