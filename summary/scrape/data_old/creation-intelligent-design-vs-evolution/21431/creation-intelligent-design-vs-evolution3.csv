"12-07-2012","21431",3,"Databed","467283","The peacock I have already adressed....","Zosimus","467309","First of all, the peacock you have not already addressed rather you have merely alluded to it but I will save you some trouble and make your argument for you as we already know what the argument is. What you meant to say was something like this: Zosimus, you are clearly unaware of how natural selection works. While it's true that long peacock tails don't make them better at finding food or fending off predators, the fact is that peahens find these tails attractive. When peahens see long, symmetrical tails with lots of eyespots those are markers for male quality showing that he has better genes, more testosterone, and is generally a better mate than his competitors. Accordingly peahens prefer to copulate with him than the competitors. So, you see, natural selection perfectly accounts for the existence of long, ornate peacock tails. That's a well-stated argument, but unfortunately it's completely wrong. As you can see at Peacock Feathers: That's So Last Year - ScienceNOW that a seven-year study meant to confirm this theory failed miserably to reproduce anything approaching this conventional wisdom. Despite ""observing 268 matings, the team was unable to pinpoint any single male trait that females preferred."" They checked for longer tails, eyespot size, color, shape, symmetry and nothing predicted female choice. This brings me back around to two points I've already pointed up: Most published research findings are false and the reasons why this is are known and contained at PLOS Medicine: Why Most Published Research Findings Are False where John Ioannidis indicates, ""Claimed Research Findings May Often Be Simply Accurate Measures of the Prevailing Bias"" and also notes, ""Several methodologists have pointed out that the high rate of nonreplication (lack of confirmation) of research discoveries is a consequence of the convenient, yet ill-founded strategy of claiming conclusive research findings solely on the basis of a single study assessed by formal statistical significance, typically for a p-value less than 0.05."" Accordingly it should not be surprising that commonly held evolutionary beliefs are false and emperically falsifiable. What is surprising to me, however, is that this research into peacocks and sexual selection (which was published back in 2008) seems to have escaped your notice. I mean anyone with a web browser and google can easily determine that what you have said is known to be false. So why are you spouting refuted explanations for peacock traits as though they were gospel? The reason is simple: You don't care about the truth of matter at all. You have already made up your mind about the situation and and anything that may call this conclusion into question is to be ignored. The rest of your post is just an insipid regurgitation of things you have assumed, been told, or made up over the years. Chimps share 99.99999999% of their DNA with other chimps. And you know this ... how? You claim that ""Neandertals"" are closely related to humans. First of all, it's spelled Neanderthal. I might have forgiven you had you only misspelled it once in your post, but you misspelled it every time. Second, the mtDNA findings of Neanderthals place them well within human limits. What you refer to as ""neandertals"" are just humans that lived awhile back. So what does that prove? As far as I can tell, nothing. In reference to mtDNA, as you know (and can read on wikipedia) the ""mitochondrial eve"" (that is, the woman who contributed all of our mtDNA) is believed to have lived 200,000 years ago. This number is drawn from evolutionary assumptions based on the idea that humans and chimps diverged some 5 million years ago and the difference in mtDNA between humans and chimps. However, as you can read at http://www.dnai.org/teacherguide/pdf...e_romanovs.pdf actual investigation into the rates of mutations in mtDNA put these numbers very much into question. Pooling all studies together put the rate of mtDNA mutation closer to one mutation per 1,200 years instead of the number derived from evolutionary assumptions of one every 12,000 years - off by a factor of 10. Now in most sciences a theory that was off by a factor of 10 would find itself in the rubbish bin, but not the neo-Darwin theory of evolution. This theory is different than other theories. Why? Well that's because atheists don't care about the facts of the matter. They are simply interested in believing in evolution regardless of the evidence for or against it because it already fits in well with their a priori philosophical biases and it provides them with lots of federal grants so they can continue studying on the taxpayer's dole. Now you can believe whatever you want. It doesn't affect me in the slightest, but it would be nice that admitted that you believed it in spite of the evidence and not because of it. And stop going off on tangents about the supposed religious beliefs that you think I have but don't.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","04:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","34"

I will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you just missed my first response, but you should go back and see for yourself - Post #26. So we can't confirm in this newest study with farmed peacocks that females have any preference. However, it was confirmed before in earlier studies. You chose to completely ignore the older studies in favor of the one that fits your view. Again, quite hypocritical if you ask me. On top of that, if you believe this does anything to hurt TOE, you are sadly mistaken. There are hundreds of such examples that evolutionists can only speculate on. In fact, evolutionists differ in their point of view on how or why many features evolved in certain organisms. But no evolutionist would argue that there is no such thing as sexual selection or that just because they don't have an immediate answer for the hows and whys that evolution simply can't explain either. You pulled this essay from a medical journal! Don't you think that that the author of this essay has spent most of his time reviewing medical research? On top of that, while he doesn't come right out and limit his scope to that of the medical field, almost all of his examples are obviously pertaining to medical research. How many times does he reference study size?? You think he is talking about how many DNA specimens to collect or how many bones of a T-rex have been included? He is talking about patients and population sizes. Only a complete XXXXX would think this is even applicable to whether or not evolution is a valid theory. Because, you know, all those research studies to confirm evolution.... Wow, I guess we can't all be peacock experts. Apparently you have spent a lot of time on this subject. By the way, no one, even those responsible for the study you are sooo in to, actually believes that peacocks don't get their feathers as a result of sexual selection. All the study concluded is that the researchers were unable to pinpoint what exactly is preferable to the female. There are many other factors that could have come in to play and acting like the study included all possible grounds is simply irresponsible. What, are you going to start arguing that chimps don't share the same genome now? Did God create each one individually? Neandertals were humans, hence, Homo neanderthalensis . Wow, for someone so anxious to correct the spelling of a species of human, you would think you knew what human actually meant, right? By the way, Neandertal is acceptable. Please do better fact checking before you make such a wild accusation of poor spelling. Actual investigation over a period of years as opposed to simply looking at the divergence in species all over the planet is a better method for determining mutation rates. You have chosen your exerpt very well to prove your point, too. Why don't you summarize the conclusion of this article for us...I think it basically says that the ones doing the research have several reasons for the discrepancy in rates and in no way doubt the accepted timeline of evolutionary history. So stupid... I really hope you did not spend too much time compiling this silliness. Hopefully you will do a better next time, although I am really not sure that I am dealing with someone intelligent enough to have this discussion. You are a Christian right?
