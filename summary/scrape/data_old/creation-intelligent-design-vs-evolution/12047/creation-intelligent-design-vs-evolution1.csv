Until they were found alive. left an abundant fossil record from the Devonian to the end of the Cretaceous period, at which point they apparently suffered a nearly complete extinction. Coelacanth - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia As if this should be any surprise. The theory of evolution mindset once again contradicts observable science. left an abundant fossil record from the Devonian to the end of the Cretaceous period, at which point they apparently suffered a nearly complete extinction.","Huntard","335086","There is just one thing however. The coelacanths found are different from those in the fossil record. Further, ALL evidence pointed to them being extinct, until we found other evidence, and we changed it. And, to top it off, the article says NEARLY extinct, not COMPLETELY. Although, this article was of course written after the coelocanths were re-discovered. Of course, this has absolutely nothing to do with the theory of evolution, which explains the mechanisms responsible for the change of allele frequencies in populations over time.","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","05:26 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","2"

The living species today closely resemble the fossils. The prediction was made based on the mindset that everything evolved from a common ancestor over billions of years.

There was a gap in the fossil record, scientists looked it at it, and using the theory of evolution mindset, automatically assumed that it went extinct millions and millions of years ago. But of course, it was absolutely wrong. A prediction was made based on the theory of evolution and it was absolutely wrong.

No. They looked at the fossil records, and found fossils up until a certain point in time. After that no fossils were found, and nobody had seen the thing. Now, what conclusion can we draw from this? Or are you suggesting dinosaurs are also still alive, even though nobody's seen them? It has nothing to do with the mindset, and everything to do with the available data. Once better data became available, it was changed. Yes, but we had no way to tell until we found them again, now had we? The prediction was NOT made based on the theory of evolution, but on the fact that there were fossils up until a certain time, then there were no more fossils and nobody had seen the thing. What's so hard to understand here?","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","05:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","7"

It is because of the theory of evolution mindset that scientists determined that coelacanth went extinct MILLIONS AND MILLIONS of years ago when they have since been found in numerous sites.","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","05:58 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","8"

So, I ask you again, if you have numerous rock layers, one on top of the other, and starting from the bottom you find fossils of a certain species, you find it in the next layer, and in the next and so on for 5 layers, then they suddenly stop, and are not found again ever in the remaining layers.

Evolution predicts that change will occur over time, if an organism is not suitably adapted to it's environment. It the organism is adapted to it's environment, (in body shape), then there is no reason why it will evolve further (in body shape). We've had shark-shaped beasts swimming in our seas for millennia (if memory serves, at least) - why should the coelacanth be any different? Is this a remix of 'if man came from apes, how come there are still apes around'? Also: go look at the recent other thread.","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","06:06 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","12"

I would definitely not assume that they were extinct millions of years ago, that's for sure. I wouldn't assume that just because it's not found in the fossil record anymore, that I would write them off as extinct, especially since not all of the oceans have been explored.","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","06:09 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","13"
