We are all laymen in one form or another. And tell me this tq! of what value in the end is the word of an actual scientist of a false and pseudo science? The answer is NONE AT ALL. So when truth is the ultimate goal, we are all on equal footing you sanctimonious putz. And how am I running away when I have responded to all the tripe you have posted? What is incredible is that you are so deluded that you think I'm willfully ignorant because I have the good sense not to blindly follow a man made science which is based on absolutely flawed and fictitious info, conclusions and assumptions. It is beyond you, one who thinks I am willfully ignorant, that if the numbers used that make up the equation are wrong to begin with, then you have NO HOPE AT ALL OF EVER COMING UP WITH THE RIGHT SOLUTION!!! This is a principle I learned in the first grade. That the outcome of any problem is only as good as the info it is based upon. Yet you allegedly intelligent evo mooks just merrily go along never asking truly valid questions or question the contradictions as you blindly follow this pseudo science like a religion. And then you attempt to condemn and ridicule anyone who rejects it because its defenders responds to their questions just as you have attacked my intelligence since they can't answer the questions forwarded. I mean, the lunacy of you and pandion calling me too ignorant to understand your answers when I obviously have a sufficient grasp of the subject to see the holes and ask the questions which you are unable to answer. Yet in your small mind, it is I who am ignorant. Here's the bottom line tq; these two belief systems are at total and complete odds with each other. They can't both be partially right. So one of us is being completely snowed in having faith in what we believe. My faith is in the Creator of all that is, and your faith lies in the creature, that his humanist interpretation is right which means that we came about randomly through various mutations which occurred by chance with no intelligent design at all. Those are the only two possible outcomes when all is said and done. So speak of arrogance and willful ignorance, it is you who is when you, as just a matter of fact, declare the other side wrong without ever seeing through our eyes as we have surely seen through yours before deciding that evolution is not only seriously flawed science, but false at every assumption and conclusion it is based upon. As I said above, if you must preface each and every conclusion with excuses and justifications in order to explain why the info you input to come to those conclusions doesn't quite add up as you intended them to, then your so called science is nothing more than junk science, and you are the ignorant one for believing it based on such flawed outcomes. Here's why you are as willfully ignorant as you accuse me of being. You insist that the fossil layers found within thousands of feet of diverse strata were laid gradually over hundreds of millions of years. All of your evo conclusions are based on that premise. But if as I say, the great deluge of Noah's flood happened as the bible states, then that accounts for the world wide layers of strata in which fish, mammals, birds and every other type of creatures are found side by side and on top of each other in only a 40 DAY period. You ignore that little fact as you attempt to categorize these deposits by time since one creature was found 6 inches or a foot below or above the one preceding it. It is beyond you to consider that IF THE FLOOD OCCURRED, due to the massive event which was taking place, that the bottom creature died just days before the one we found above it. That possibility would never enter your mind since you consider that possibility a myth. And what do you base that on??? You assume Radiometric Dating methods rely on assuming the rates of Decay has been a constant, that they start with no, or known daughter components, or was it an Isolated system with no external loss/addition of parent or daughter components? This is very unlikely over millions of years. Yet geologists use a standardized formula's for dating in which it is impossible to treat each rock or fossil as an individual based on its actual time, depth and location it was found in. Do you think it's smart to have a one size fits all formula for each element as they apply to different objects from different times, depths and conditions they are found at and within? Really tq? And you're calling me too ignorant to comprehend the issues for asking these questions? I submit that it is you arm chair scientists who are the ignorant ones for not asking them. So my friend,(figuratively speaking of course) it appears we are at a stand off in how we interpret the same available evidence. And since you know pandion so well, tell me his bio and qualifications in which scientific study that qualifies him to debate or understand this issue so well that he can't appreciate these inequities? Do you see now why I'm not impressed with any of you evos since none of you have the where with all to even question the problems within your so called science/religion?","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","06:48 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","47"

Perhaps you answered all of T.Q.'s posts, you didn't answer alot of others refuting your claims, or, if you did respond, did so by basically just saying ""nuh-uh"" and then went about your business. You just showed yourself to be willfully ignorant, because, in fact, the theory of evolution is supported by ALL the evidence. Fortunately for us, the number ARE correct. Yes, and since the data being fed here is empirical evidence, the outcome must also be accurate, and guess what, it is. Actyally, any good scientists questions everything all the time. I certainly don't, I just tell you where you went wrong, in the hopes you will actually look into it more, and learn the truth. Further, we answered your questions. You haven't asked any question we are unable to answer. And, sorry to say this, but you don't know enough of this. How long have you studied coelacanths? Why the do you think you know more about them then the people who actually did study them extensively? See above. Now, there's nothing wrong with being ignorant, I'm ignorant on a lot of things, but I don't go around saying my solutions to those problems are better then the solutions given by those who do know about these things. True. They aren't. Only one is right, the one supported by all the evidencde. True again. Wrong. First of all, his is not faith, as it is based on evidence, faith being a believe in spite of evidence. Second, it didn't happen with jst random mutations, natural selection is a very important part of it as well. And Humanists have nothing to do with this. Wrong, there are more then two possibilities. But all except one are not supported by the evidencde. Wrong. Evolution is supported by ALL the evidence. Again you show you are ignorant on the subject, please learn about it. And it is arrogant to claim you know better then people who have studied all this for their entire lives when you know nothing of it whatsoever. Well, since we don't have to do that, it seems the problem is solved. Wrong, there have been numerous experiments, all of which point to evolution happening. The fact it is ignored is because there is so much evidence suggesting the flood never happened, it would be foolish to include it in any theory. Here are 100 categories of evidence against the flood: EvC Forum: 100 Categories of Evidence Against Noah?s Flood All of these need to be accounted for to be able to allow the flood to have happened. And just to address the point ou made here, if the flood caused the fossils, they are absolutely sorted wrong, they would have to be mixed in with eachother, instead they are sorted exactly as evolutionary theory predicted, simpler life forms at the bottom, more complex life forms at the top. That's because there is so much evidencde against the flood, it would be foolish to consider it. On the massive amount of evidencde that points to it never having happened. In fact, all radiometric dating methods agree with eachother with such accuracy, that they can't be anything but right. Here's an article on radiometric dating, I suggest you read it and learn from it. Radiometric Dating and the Geological Time Scale No. which is why that isn't done. Well, since you are wrong about that formula thingy, I'd say yes, you are ignorant of it. We did ask them, and it turns out our questions were based on false assumptions, so we now know, and don't ask them anymore. No. you fit the evidence to your conclusion, we fit the conclusion to the evidence. We allready asked, them, they were based on false assumptions, we learned from our mistakes, and now understand why they were false. What questions are there?","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","10:22 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","48"
