"01-08-2009","12047",7,"Archangel","339431","Here are two links which truly expose your demented character child. Remember yesterday when I said I'm obviously not perfect and have made mistakes on this forum? This is one of those true examples of that in the first link. And notice how in post #24 I admitted it openly, here: http://www.4forums.com/political/cre...tml#post308961 And I invite all observers to follow the thread to see how I am attacked and excoriated by multiple posters even though I did the only right thing and admitted my error. And even now, almost a year later this philosophical coward continues to use this against me as a weapon to attack me rather than to have graciously accepted my confession of making a mistake by misinterpreting what type of creatures we were discussing. Actually, it's you and tq who are still lying about me in order to condemn what I represent. To imply that anything I said equates math to equaling atheism is just so infantile and irrational as to belie reason which once again confirms that you are truly delusional in your hatred for anything I say which opposes your shallow world view. And here is where tq piped in to support your irrational delusions. Here's what he contributed yesterday: Here's the rub which both of fail to acknowledge or appreciate. Archie isn't alone in rejecting the accuracy or the reliability of radiometric dating methods which it is accurately referred to. Only people who have no concept of what the science is refers to it as radioactive dating. That's point# 1. #2, to reject sciences ability to interpret the results of radiometric dating methods in no way reflects on ones ability to trust or rely on the quality of the science which makes Nuclear power a safe and efficient form of energy. I have debated in favor of Nuclear energy on this forum as fervently as I have debated against the reliability of radiometric dating like millions of others do and I've posted numerous links to evidence which opposes it. So to make this disagreement just about me as if I alone reject this unreliable process for dating objects is to once again show how dishonest you both are to use tunnel vision in categorizing me as a sole arbiter of these opinions. Not at all. I reject the interpretations made based on rates of decay which are impossible to absolutely verify regarding the actual conditions of whatever is being tested which may very well vary due to when and in what conditions they were originally deposited. No absolute variables have been determined by science which can verify. Even the proponents use that fact as an explanation when they get unrealistic results. They also have preconceived notions before any testing is ever done as to what the outcome should be and they continue to run tests until they reflect the desired outcome. This doesn't describe science so much as attempting to create a scenario to confirm their preconceived notions, no matter how shoddy the science is. This statement perfectly defines the irrationality of your attempts to equate a widely held rejection of radiometric dating with not appreciating the value of and safety which Nuclear Energy represents today, or the principles upon which it is based. The bolded statement reflects you ignorance because the application of the two processes seek totally different results for the same radioactive material. One uses fissionable material to create energy while the other attempts to apply rates of decay in order to date objects. For you to claim they are comparable processes just reveals your ignorance, not mine.","T.Q","339443","You did no such thing! If you're going to lie, at least don't point out the evidence which shows you lied! O_C has said that you argued that CO2 is an oxidizer (no, you didn't use those words, but that's what you were arguing in support of). And in the post you just linked, you tried to cover up your ignorance by saying ""oh, I thought we were talking about giant dinosaurs, not giant arthropods, because O_C spelt is as ""athropods"""". You then follow it up with a link to a flickr page which shows pictures of arthropods! So, in that thread you: 1) went off on a rant against O_C without reading or understanding the opening post (this is what you're claiming above); and 2) Argued that CO2 is an oxidizer (which you have yet to address or recant, despite what you said above) Jesus Archie, get real. You did no such thing. You tried to foist the responsibility for your ignorance to O_C because he misspelled arthropod. That in no way even begins to explain your argument that creatures grew to larger sizes due to higher levels of CO2! It doesn't matter what kind of creature you were discussing. You were wrong, and you still will not admit it. Now you're trying to rewrite history. Look, when someone says you're unable to do basic math, and you respond by saying you don't agree with them because of their atheistic worldview, what the hell are they supposed to take that to mean? Nothing here deserves a response as I proved you wrong above. You can repeat your drivel for ever but that wont change the fact that even the USSR never denied that the Communist Party was the ruling party for 70 years, and that according to every Country and pundit on Earth the USSR was a Communist Country. This is where it gets really funny folks: You're right, it's radiometric dating. I've worked 60 hours so far since Sunday and I'd had about 5 hours sleep when I wrote that. The correct term was eluding me. As for ""not being alone"", no, you have the full backing of other people who have no idea what they're talking about. Or, as stated above, people who are working long hours on little sleep. Yes, it does, as they are based on the same scientific principles. If one doesn't work, neither does the other. Which matters how? Millions? No, you've posted numerous links to twaddle which have been explained to you numerous times. Who says you're the only one? You are the most vocal on this board however. This has been explained to you numerous times. Huh? Mind typing that again in English? No, that would be you. And do you have proof to support your accusation that all scientists, researchers and lab techs are liars? No, they continue to run tests if they determine it wasn't done right the first time. Much the same thing you would do I imagine. That's a concise enough definition of creation ""science"" I suppose. You do realize that no one is saying you oppose nuclear energy, right? Nope, he's just not getting it folks... Fun as this is (it's not...), I think I'll step out here on Archie as well. He demonstrates his own ignorance well enough without anyone else pointing it out.","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","10:48 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","92"

We will never agree on anything so going around in circles seem a true waste of time to me. So feel free to believe what you will of me. It just confirms that I'm doing right by being opposed by the likes of you and child. Be at peace and don't allow this to give you an ulcer.","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","11:11 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","93"
"01-08-2009","12047",7,"Archangel","339431","Here is day two of the class on exposing the twisted dishonesty of how the little child debates as a SOP for her. In the first post you showed that your representations of what I represent is delusional, and now you want to affirm it with additional evidence. That is the definition of being dense. Here is what her original slanderous accusation against me was yesterday: Point made! You even admit that I never directly condemn anyone, yet you insist on accusing me of condemning people. To a rational mind it will explain my position perfectly and will also show why I'm condemned for sharing my faith by this hypocrite. And I invite all observers to follow the thread to see how I am attacked and excoriated by multiple posters even though I did the only right thing and admitted my error. And even now, almost a year later this philosophical coward continues to use this against me as a weapon to attack me rather than to have graciously accepted my confession of making a mistake by misinterpreting what type of creatures we were discussing.

I did, with your help by showing how you misrepresent everything I say in the very quotes you posted.","obvious_child","339481","Wow. You are dense. You called me a girl. I then called you dense. You still call me a girl. You wonder why we think you're an #####? And it is in fact proven today by your numerous insults to people who disagree with you. Thank you. You do in fact call everyone who disagrees with you soulless, lost, atheist who you implicitly threaten will burn in hell. Incorrect. You never explicit do so. You have many examples however of threats of implicit hell. ""You'll learn how wrong you are at the end and you'll regret it"" is a threat of Hell whether you want to admit it or not. in fact I'm just one of the few people who have pointed out that you rely or used to rely heavily upon threats. One of the quotes I provided has you futily trying to argue that you weren't making a threat but a promise (as if you understand the difference). You mean us, who think you use threats like you change underwear? You are not rational. See T.Q's post for why you are, as always wrong. You never retracted your statement. Never. Which proves your statement about me being a liar to be false, which would make you wrong. But your constantly wrongness is not news to anyone. Let's see. I gave a through logical explanation for why you argued that math = atheism [b]and all you can respond to is with flaming. No response to the logic. No response to what you actually said. You just flame. Sad. Personal attacks are all you have. You responded to a post criticizing you for your inability to do math. You then attack back by citing an atheist world view. Like I said, you won't respond, you can't respond and you don't have the brains to respond. We're lying, but you can't refute anything we say? lol. Care to cite these pundits explaining what Communism is? You really have no idea who Marx was do you? And your entire argument is appeal to authority. Fallacies and lies. All you have. Explain to me how a class society run by dictators with capitalism is Communism. lol. That's again due to your massive ignorance in understanding how radioactivity actually works. You reject the dating based on the same principles yet use the power based on the same principles. It makes no sense, but no one ever said your belief systems were consistent or even sensical. You don't understand the most basics of relationships. The same principles that underly nuclear power. Oh wait. You're not going to deal with that because 1) you don't understand the principles and 2) you have no idea what you are talking about. If only you had proof of this. And your arguments against dating are often reliant upon non-cogentic samples, more proof you have absolutely no understanding of the topics. Lol. HOW? Except that you did no such thing, cited no such quotes and essentially reinforced to everyone that you are a fundamental joke.","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","03:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","94"
