What difference will it make to them if Jesus was entirely fictional? The doctrine remains and the BIG meaning also remains for those who adopt the doctrine and adhere to it. It is the DOCTRINE which carries the BIG MEANING not the historical Jesus who may or may not have had actual existense! And its the DOCTRINE of original sin, not the fact of it which carries meaning for the adherents of the idea. In other words the fact or fiction of Jesus matters not at all.","marc9000","285499","That's your opinion, but it's not really true. If some kind of evidence were presented that Jesus didn't exist, Christians wouldn't suddenly change overnight, but they wouldn't take his teachings nearly as seriously, because they wouldn't have authority - there would be no eternal consequences for being wrong. The eternity part, the soul part. No, the BIG meaning is about eternity, spending it with or without God. It matters a lot, concerning the afterlife.","challenge-both-sides","04:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","87"

They were more like Thomas than Peter. True believers always will take their beliefs seriously facts not withstanding. They would still believe that eternal consequences were involved for being wrong. True believers and the faithful would continue to believe in all that. No change would be necessitated by mere facts. Again Peter vs Thomas. OK and how would the beliefs of the true belivers be impacted? Not at all as they are imprevious to mere facts.","challenge-both-sides","05:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","112"

College students lose their faith all the time, it only takes a small effort from an atheist college professor, with the students raging hormones and other new things in their lives entering the equation. Do you think that atheists are the same way too? Will they always believe there are NO eternal consequences, no matter what they learn in their life? Are atheists ever impervious to facts?","challenge-both-sides","05:27 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","85"

Sorry but fair weather christians are not true believers. They are just social Christians who like the social aspects of organized religion. You cannot shake a true believer with a few facts or even with well founded theories. And if its due to hormones - well creationists believe thats the design and they know who to complain to. All the atheists I know do not believe that their persons survive their own deaths. Eternal consequences there may be (who can predict the effects of ones actions even a 1000 years in the future), but the athesists I know do not anticipate that those consequences will impact them. Sure they are. Human beings are stubborn entities and many of us will fight to defend our beliefs even when facts to the contrary begin to accumulate. All the atheists I know are human. Us scientist agnostics are as bad about that as any others, but we are trained to give our beliefs up when the evidence runs to much against our ideas. For example Fred Hoyle held tightly to the steady state theory of the universe until the evidence in support of th Big Bang model became overwhelmingly more convincing - and of course the BB itself may be overwhelmed in the future. Hoyle was about the last holdout though.","challenge-both-sides","05:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","261"

It seems that evolutionists are almost always Democrats. Atheists who claim the Bible isn't important? (the Bible that suggests controlling those hormones) The question was, would new facts change their minds about that? I sure would like to know more about that training. Is it integrated into science classes, or is it a separate class? Are scientists trained to hold out longer on this ""giving up"", depending on what their pay scale is? The likelihood of their expertise obtaining research grants for universities?","challenge-both-sides","09:24 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","122"

Thats called seeing the light and being born again intellectually. If such a revelation to the student is distasteful to the parents etc they are free to refute the students new beliefs. Thus it always is. Humans all have the option of evaluating the logic and arguments they come across in life. No sane person would have it be otherwise. Yes Democrats are often more committed to reason and logic than are Republicans. I do not know why, but its observationally true. Except of course you cannot (short of say chemical castration) CONTROL those hormones they are not under voluntary control. New facts are always to be considered carefully. Precisely what new facts would you like to put on the table? The best way is to go out and get your PhD in a field like biology or chemistry or physics. Enjoy. A good scientist will NOT glue themselves to a failed hypothesis or theory. You cannot do science if you cannot let go of your pets.","challenge-both-sides","09:52 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","210"

Suppose satalites were launched in orbit around the earth, with any changes in their distances carefully recorded after hundreds, or thousands of revolutions. Progressive changes in their distances from earth, an inch today, a foot tomorrow, 500 feet the day after. Suppose all collected information clearly showed that the earth could not possibly go around the sun more than........50 million times before drifting away, or being drawn in. Do you think that would be made public? It would turn most of the scientific community on its head. You think it would - I don't think it would. I'm a patriotic American, I was 15 years old in 1969. I believed we put a man on the moon until just a few years ago. Somebody told me to watch a VHS tape that proved it false, that analyzed the documentation of those moon trips, with todays technology and a critical eye. My mind was made up not to believe it as I started watching, but when it was done I knew - it was all a scientific con game. When science has the money, it can make us believe anything it wants. I must admit, even in 1969 I was wondering why the spacemen weren't jumping 25 feet off the ground there, since gravity was supposed to be 1/6 of the earths. They would jump about 3 feet, hang there a little, (slowed down tape) and settle back down. The tape showed no star canopy from the moon. (can't see stars when there's no air, according to NASA) Also can't reproduce a perfect star canopy on a movie set, can we NASA? The shadows were a big part of the analogy. They couldn't reproduce one light source with the distance away as the sun. The shadows clearly showed it. Lost a lot of my faith in science that day. The money they spent on that farce was a drop in the bucket compared to the money they'd lose if a billions-of-years-old-earth was clearly disproved. They're simply not going to study it. If a billions-of-year-old earth was disproved, would you lose your atheism?","challenge-both-sides","09:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","438"
