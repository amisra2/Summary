However, you probably know by now that it only takes one valid fact to disprove a theory, no matter how much evidence has been given in support. What I want to know is: What evidence is there that disproves evolution (any of the six types)? What evidence is there that disproves creation?","challenge-both-sides","07:03 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","1"

In other words if the theory PREDICTS the X should be the case given all the Y circumstances and one sets up the Ys and does not observe outcomes consistent with the predicted X, AND the experiment withstands the tests of method and logic THEN one has to question (perhaps falsiify) the theory. Especially if the experimental work is repeatable and consistent. [/QUOTE] Evolution has not been falsified as of yet. Creationism has been - If nothing else the claim made of 6000 years to get from an empty earth to our current state is as faslified as its possible to get considering the multitude of counterexamples. And there are an extremely large number of lines of evidence which falsify the concept of ""kinds"", the idea that what we call complexity has not increased, the idea that an intelligent designer must be invoked to cause what we observe, the idea that intelligence is required to evolve species, and the concept that random mutation (and other effectively random but heritable variation mechanisms) combined with the crucible of natural selection CANNOT suffice to produce species from existing organisms and linages. And then you always have to consider the relevance of data. As one example the question of how life arose is not applicable to the theory of evolution, nor is the big bang, nor is an argument to ultimate causes. Nor are counterexamples relying on the gaps argument and so forth.","challenge-both-sides","08:43 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","2"

I have little fear that the hard-shell creationists will be discouraged in any case. The counterexamples are in the open literature from elementary school texts through graduate texts and on into the professional literature. I watched KHs video fell free to examine the literature.","challenge-both-sides","10:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","4"

As it is, demands that science ""disprove"" their claims are about as bright as demands that science ""disprove"" claims that there are old, bearded, white guys sitting on thrones in heaven, creating things. Or ""disprove"" there are purple unicorns on Pluto. Creationists should try make claims science can disprove, then we can take them more seriously as participants in a scientific discussion. As it is, evolution makes plenty of potentially disprovable claims... the problem for Creationists is that every time they are tested, they pass the tests. So Creationists ignore them. There is absolutely no evidence any Creationist would accept for the theory of evolution, and no evidence any Creationist would accept against the biblical account. They aren't doing science, and they don't care about disproofs; they are merely practicing religion.","challenge-both-sides","12:36 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","15"
