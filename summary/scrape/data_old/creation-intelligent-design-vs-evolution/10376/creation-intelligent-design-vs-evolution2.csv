It also is often misapplied. IT says 'things are no more complicated than they need to be'. It can be argued (not by me), that God is needed. OF course, the 6-12k creation is blown out of the water. That is due to the pure raw data. When it comes to the 'god did it' on the big bang, that starts going into 'metaphysical' proofs. While there is no evidence FOR a God, there is only word games people can play to be either for or against a god. Me, I will just have a cup of tea from Bertrand Russel's tea pot.","challenge-both-sides","10:25 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","18"

I see more teaching of hate and bigotry from most Christians. (what do you think of Gay men and lesbians?) ""saviors of sinners'.. Hardly. You can't even save yourself, much less someone else. There is no need for a 'savior'. Well, you believe you follow ""Jesus Christ"". Other people follow Harry Potter, or even Santa Claus.
