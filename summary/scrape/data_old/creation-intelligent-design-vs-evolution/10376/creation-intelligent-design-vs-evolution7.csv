"09-27-2007","10376",7,"chemist99a","285474","So even if Jesus never existed that does not change the doctrine of christians. What difference will it make to them if Jesus was entirely fictional? The doctrine remains and the BIG meaning also remains for those who adopt the doctrine and adhere to it. It is the DOCTRINE which carries the BIG MEANING not the historical Jesus who may or may not have had actual existense! And its the DOCTRINE of original sin, not the fact of it which carries meaning for the adherents of the idea. In other words the fact or fiction of Jesus matters not at all.","marc9000","285499","That's your opinion, but it's not really true. If some kind of evidence were presented that Jesus didn't exist, Christians wouldn't suddenly change overnight, but they wouldn't take his teachings nearly as seriously, because they wouldn't have authority - there would be no eternal consequences for being wrong. The eternity part, the soul part. No, the BIG meaning is about eternity, spending it with or without God. It matters a lot, concerning the afterlife.","challenge-both-sides","04:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","91"

Will that do?","marc9000","285502","No it won't, I don't know if you intentionally missed the point or not. His implication was that without scientific study of evolution, and all the billions-of-years-old and God-is-not-necessary speculation that goes along with it, we wouldn't have been able to produce products that we have today. That products would be missing if all we do is work with and rearrange materials that we have to work with.

"09-27-2007","10376",7,"chemist99a","285477","Well I disagree with UP even if genesis is falsified it will make no difference to those who believe in the DOCTRINE which arises from the Bible. After all faith is not based on fact - its based on being able to believe in spite of the facts if necessary. Christianity (a faith) cannot fall due to a factual error if its based on true faith. And by the way I am an atheist myself and a scientist (an agnostic one). But science and empirical reality cannot displace or negate faith of a true believer.","marc9000","285512","If you're an atheist, how do you have the ability to know how Christians will believe and practice their doctrine? And atheism (a faith) cannot fall due to a factual error in evolution. Gaps and problems in evolution cannot displace or negate the faith of a true atheist either. Science and evolution are all your faith has - conflicting paths of study do tend to send evolutionists into a panic.

"09-27-2007","10376",7,"marc9000","285506","Then why don't you let him do it? Do you have some fear that he will suddenly quit posting here? It is difficult, considering anywhere from 5 to 15 or even 20 ""rationalists"" will go into a posting frenzy against one creationist quite often at these forums. Can't just one do the job? So there's no difference between theistic evolutionists and atheists? A billions-of-years-old earth is not part of anyone's experience either, however keen they are to convince themselves that it is. How about unchanging scriptures that are thousands of years old, and unlike your ""billions"", my thousands is historically proven. ""Endowed by their Creator"" accomplished the foundation for the government of the United States. Experience at playing around in a lab, or experience at human behavioral history? I'm not surprised that you didn't answer the question. Can you name some things that science isn't an authority on? I can. What do you learn? Do you learn about global warming? Some say science shows that humans cause global warming. Some say science shows that humans do not cause global warming. It is important to determine who is right or who is wrong. Does science have that answer?","chemist99a","285517","I will quit posting when I quit breathing. Lez knows this full well. Yes but its like sharks when there is blood in the water. Plus I at least do this for fun and why should I not get in my own ideas and have my fun with creationists. They are getting pretty rare you know. Can't let those other rationalists keep them all to themselves. Sure there is, the theistic evolutionists still believe in a GOD or other being cranking up evolution. Atheists do not believe that any such being exists. Actual scientists have to be agnostic about the issue since GOD cannot be proven NOT to exist, nor can GOD be proven to exist. Neither is the civil war. Still I think the documents and artifacts are convincing don't you? At least as to the likelyhood that there WAS a civil war? Of course I could be wrong and so could everyone else. Come to think of it WWII also fits that bill for me personally - I was not present. On the other hand when I step out of my house I see mountains that I think are about 250 million years old on an Earth which is about 4 billion plus years old embedded in a universe which is approximately 13-14 billion years old. I am sorry you cannot share that experience and limit yourself to only 6000 years or so. How limiting is your imagination. Oh yes nobody has experienced those 6000 years either! Are you sure the world was not created last Tuesday? I did experience last Tuesday unless GOD is messing with my mind! H How about those scriptures! As to their age they are NOT 4000 years old only about 3,000 at the most, and there are older holy works than what you have in the bible. How about the ancient Egyptian works of theology for which in some cases the originals exist? Does their age impact upon the truth of what is written within? Actually no thats a bit of rhetorical flourish engaged in by Jefferson in order to incite the locals to rebel against their King who was far away and not terribly competent. The government of the US was in fact accomplished by the articles of confederation and later the US Constitution. I am not certain about the articles, but the constitution refers to the creator precisely zero times. Yep for 30 plus years. Even discovered a couple of new things and helped bring a few products to market by doing so. Great fun, great challenges. Cetainly, Science is not an authority on faith except in respect to possible genetic and biochemical mechanisms which might give rise to it. And science is not an authority on GOD. But then again why would science choose to be - it would not be science then. We learn many things. Cabbages and Kings. Yes we learn about global warming and we learn that we do not know enough to unambiguously attribute a cause debate will continue in the community till its more highly clarified, but at the moment the bulk of the community believes that GW is at least partially due to mans actions. I anticipate that the minority view that what we are currently observing (ie actual global warming) will be rendered nearly extinct. Not that it will matter, because non-scientists are not particulary interested in such conclusions - they only want to act on their faith that their actions have nothing to do with it so that they can remain comfortable and unaffected. Science can only provide the best conclusions we can reach. If leaders do not act on them so be it.","challenge-both-sides","05:28 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","99"

They are the only ones Richard Dawkins and others like him attack specifically, because they are the only ones relevant to western politics. I'm so glad you're back. ""I'm simply telling the truth, so I have different debating standards than you"".","obvious_child","285520","You doing research? Has the sky fallen? Are pigs flying? Besides chemist already provided a list. Under your parameters of winning? That's questionable. Usually people consider someone who has to keep avoiding points and relying upon made up words to stay in the debate a loser. You think the opposite. Atheist: Anyone who disagrees with Marc9000 extremely narrow point of researchless views. This is English. Not make up your own definitions language. Other religions have no problems with evolution. You are therefore, as always, wrong. How can evolution be atheistic when religions accept it? You never answered this question and always flee like a coward when addressed it. And atheists reject the notion of God. Evolution doesn't even discuss it. How can it be atheist when it neither rejects or accepts a deity? Evolution is far more accurately described as agnostic, not atheistic. STOP MAKING WORDS UP Yeah, I have standards were we don't lie, don't change definitions and don't act like a 5 year old running away from points he can't deal with.","challenge-both-sides","05:51 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","101"

Sorry but fair weather christians are not true believers. They are just social Christians who like the social aspects of organized religion. You cannot shake a true believer with a few facts or even with well founded theories. And if its due to hormones - well creationists believe thats the design and they know who to complain to. All the atheists I know do not believe that their persons survive their own deaths. Eternal consequences there may be (who can predict the effects of ones actions even a 1000 years in the future), but the athesists I know do not anticipate that those consequences will impact them. Sure they are. Human beings are stubborn entities and many of us will fight to defend our beliefs even when facts to the contrary begin to accumulate. All the atheists I know are human. Us scientist agnostics are as bad about that as any others, but we are trained to give our beliefs up when the evidence runs to much against our ideas. For example Fred Hoyle held tightly to the steady state theory of the universe until the evidence in support of th Big Bang model became overwhelmingly more convincing - and of course the BB itself may be overwhelmed in the future. Hoyle was about the last holdout though.","challenge-both-sides","05:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","102"

Read the bible its all in there. And of course since I grew up in the Bible Belt and have now retired back to the same region, I am surrounded by Christians and have ample opportunity to observe their behaviors and discuss their beliefs. Thats very true. Atheism is much much older than evolution as is not founded on Darwin or his successors. Its founded on empirical evidence and logic, however it is a BELIEF and is not subject to either proof or disproof. Science itself is agnostic. It makes no affirmations of either theology or its complement (atheism). My personal belief is that atheism is valid. My scientific work is strictly agnostic and does not invoke GOD or the non-existense of GOD. Panic? Do you think that if evolution vanished tomorrow as a viable theory that atheism would be impacted? How so? Atheism has a lot more going for it than Science (which in fact does not support either Atheism or Theism) or evolution (which is also agnostic not atheistic). Biologists would not discard evolution unless and until a more satisfactory theory was worked out. Noble prizes would be awarded, PhDs would be earned, new knowledge would be gained and good time would be had by all. Certainly not panic. And unless somehow it was found necessary to invoke GOD as an explanation of the new theory (something the rules of science strictly forbid!) the atheists would have no reason to reconsider their beliefs! [/QUOTE] This thread is proof of that.[/QUOTE] Ah ha the GUP20 thread. Unfortunately you are not seeing panic, you are merely observing the normal debate and shaking out which is applied to any scientific theory. There are severe scientific problems with the hypothesis presented by GUP20 and the responses point them out. Why should GUP20 not be informed of these problems with what he proposed?","challenge-both-sides","06:08 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","103"

Answering posts for someone else with no reference that it's being done is not completely honest. It could easily give a casual reader false impressions. It's a bullying tactic - an attempt to stifle debate. Kind of like court-blocked ID study, isn't it? ""Getting pretty rare""? On message boards maybe. Anywhere else? I remember a 19 against 1 creationist thread here a few months ago. The 19 didn't seem to exactly be having a lot of fun, with all the 4 letter words and declarations of putting the one creationist on ignore. It is a major difference. And they never seem to debate each other. Actual scientists like Richard Dawkins? His books are best sellers - books that attempt to use evolution to disprove God. If you equate our knowledge of WW2 with our knowledge of what happened billions of years ago that's your business. If you see mountains and tell me that you see 250 million years of age with no faith involved, okay. I guarantee the fun I have with this rivals the fun you have with creationists. Sources? So the Declaration was rhetorical flourish? Has this been recently discovered by evolution? That wasn't a question to you personally, or anyone personally. It was directed in general about science, to another poster. More of those products of evolutionary thought? That's a big ""except""!! Evolutionists can tell us all about those genetics and biochemical things that explain the ""disease"" of religion and what can be done about it can't they? Dawkins has done it - I'm sure there are others. Science is making itself an authority on how insignificant God is. The more they theorize about evolution, the less important God becomes. God is in their way! Non-scientists are just faithful sheep, aren't they? If only the U.S. founders were alive today, only scientists would be allowed to vote or hold office. If we can get rid of creationists, maybe we can get this changed. All scientists will someday be in agreement on global warming? How long do you think that will be?
