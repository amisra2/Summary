Somebody told me to watch a VHS tape that proved it false, that analyzed the documentation of those moon trips, with todays technology and a critical eye. My mind was made up not to believe it as I started watching, but when it was done I knew - it was all a scientific con game. When science has the money, it can make us believe anything it wants. I must admit, even in 1969 I was wondering why the spacemen weren't jumping 25 feet off the ground there, since gravity was supposed to be 1/6 of the earths. They would jump about 3 feet, hang there a little, (slowed down tape) and settle back down. The tape showed no star canopy from the moon. (can't see stars when there's no air, according to NASA) Also can't reproduce a perfect star canopy on a movie set, can we NASA? The shadows were a big part of the analogy. They couldn't reproduce one light source with the distance away as the sun. The shadows clearly showed it. Lost a lot of my faith in science that day. The money they spent on that farce was a drop in the bucket compared to the money they'd lose if a billions-of-years-old-earth was clearly disproved. They're simply not going to study it.","Waxy","285884","This is the final nail in the coffin.

He's STILL saying evolution is atheistic despite being annihilated and humiliated.

"10-01-2007","10376",12,"Peeling","285899","So your explanation for the lack of such evidence is that it's being repressed, rather than that it doesn't exist? Scientists love turning the world on its head. It's the devoutly religious such as yourself who have cenophobia. Oh dear... Here's an experiment you can do in your own home. Put on an old diving suit and pressurize it to 2 bar. Now try jumping 3 feet in the air. Ever noticed how few stars are visible on a night when the moon is full? I happen to be an amateur astrophotographer, and I know that if I want to take a picture of a starscape I have to crank the ISO up to 1600 and leave the shutter open for a couple of minutes, otherwise nothing will register. However, I can take a picture of the moon at low ISO in 1/500th second, a difference in brightness of about 480,000. It's impossible to expose both the moon and stars correctly in the same shot - I invite you to find a picture anywhere that contradicts this. Either the moon will be a white disc, or the stars will be invisible. Exposures based on the brightness of the moon's surface inevitably make the sky appear black. No marc, they didn't . Acquaint yourself with a concept known as 'perspective'. Also, the 'halo' effect sometimes mentioned is visible right here on earth. Go up in a light aircraft on a sunny day and watch the plane's shadow. As you fly higher and higher you'll notice a bright 'halo' appear around it. This happens because you can't see any shadows in that area: all shadows are hidden behind the objects casting them, be they buildings or blades of grass.","sinjin","285920","Nice.

"10-01-2007","10376",12,"chemist99a","285752","Please be specific as to what discoveries about what species you are referring to. I can hardly evaluate a nonspecific argument like you attempted there. The microscopes of the 18th and 19th centuries showed that the growth was very small, apparantly living cells. So it seemed reasonable that simple living organisms could arise spontaneously from liquids. The key to persuading people was the portrayal of cells being simple. One of the chief advocates of the theory of spontaneous generation during the middle of the 19th century was Ernst Haeckel, a great admirer of Dawkins and an eager popularizer of Darwin theory. From the limited view of cells that microscopes provided, Haeckel believed that the cell was a ""simple lump of albuminous combination of carbon"", not much different from a piece of microscopic jello. So it seemed to Haeckel that such simple life, with no internal organs, could be produced easily from inanimate material. Now of course, we know better. Yes one would think that the probability of a complex lifeform arising by chance would be smaller than the probability of a simpler lifeform arising by chance. But as I recall Dumbskis analysis the rate of probability change is factorial rather than exponential. Well I can help you since I have read Dembskis stuff. His analysis does not hold up because the individual steps in the evolutionary process are NOT independent events. Nor does he consider the mutliple paths to a functional protein (organ, appendage etc) which exist in nature. Frankly his probability analysis is a joke among professionals in statistics and probability and his analyis (an argument from improbability) is both flawed mathematically and philosophically. I have refuted Dr D previously in considerable depth. I won't get into it here its just too long. Among other things he ignores the fact that probability analyses are not applicable after the improbable event has in fact occurred. Its a long argument not suitable for a quick explanation. But basically Dr D is wrong.","marc9000","285965","You're a chemist and you have to ask me that? Okay, I'll try to present it in laymans terms so that you can understand. Up until the 1950's, the 'light' microscope could only reach down to one tenth the size of a bacterial cell. In the 50's, the new 'electron' microscope could magnify an object 500,000 times. Many new subcellular structures were discovered! The simple cell suddenly became immensely complicated. Here's an outline of it from Behe; link To keep it basic, I could have been referring to the bacterial flagellum, and the most recent discoveries of DNA. Do you think it violates separation of church and state to require students in public science classes to read ""Darwins Black Box"", while no violation happens when students are required to read ""The Blind Watchmaker""? Please try not to go only by Dembski. Go by your own knowledge of cells, as opposed to the complete lack of knowledge of them by Darwin and all his helpers. Can you put your atheism aside for just a moment? No, you can't. Neither can any scientist. We're imperfect humans. If they're not independent, if they have to work together and be in order, wouldn't they be even more improbable? How about Dawkins probability analysis in his conclusions? Are they not equal ""jokes"" since you're always telling me that science is always saying ""I don't know""? Is Dr. Dawkins equally wrong? Or do ""jokes"" generally arise from worldviews, and the source of paychecks? An ""argument from improbability"" is actually a very logical argument. Sometimes I wonder if all these ""collegiate fallacy lists"" weren't inspired by a desperate attempt to establish the ""argument from improbability"" as something to be quickly disregarded, to protect evolution from question, as more and more complexity in biology is discovered.","challenge-both-sides","07:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","176"

"10-01-2007","10376",12,"chemist99a","285753","It makes no difference to biologists! If the DI should produce credible research that design is a necessary component of living organisms they will find an avid audience for it. If they do not they will not. It does make a difference to the courts under the constitution of the United States. ID went into the DOVER case claiming that they were not presenting a religous point of view - ie Creationism. The court determined otherwise. The reasoning of the court is available online and I will not clutter this thread more by quoting it here. Its very easily found. And in addition I believe the transcripts of Dr. Ds direct examination as well as his cross exam are also online. Read em if you wish and then draw your own conclusions.","marc9000","285968","If atheist theories like abiogenesis, Tiktaalik Roseae, or similar claim that they don't represent an atheist point of view and were hauled into court and disected like ID was, do you think the verdict would have been similar?

"10-01-2007","10376",12,"chemist99a","285754","You still don't get it do you. One does not get either public money or to teach future researchers a theory unless and until one has good empirical research to support that hypothesis and reject most if not all the alternatives. First you develop a substantiated hypothesis and ONLY then can you expect either public money OR to teach it to young minds. The geocentric model of the solar system was what was taught for centuries UNTIL the heliocentric model became the clear winner with regard to evidence and logic. THEN and only then was the heliocentric model taught in the schools and universities. And perhaps you recall that not only was public funding denied to the heliocentric researchers the church actually burned one of them at the stake and silenced another for many years. Have you noticed storm troopers entering the offices of DI to shut them down - nope you have not. Do you expect to? Nope. The DI reseach program will achieve whatever it achieves, nobody is intefering with them and its a free country. They can publish their results through many channels. And if they scientific community finds their evidence convincing then it may be eventually taught as science. So far of course there is no such evidence.","marc9000","285969","If only it were a perfect world. I would agree with you if ""science"" didn't get so political when it sought to silence the concept of ID. It makes its one sided applications so noticeable, and in a free country, subject to scrutiny. Many in science don't like it, and as we can see, many on 4forums don't like it. Too bad.","challenge-both-sides","07:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","179"
"10-01-2007","10376",12,"chemist99a","285755","Most assuredly it does. Policy is made on the basis of scientific conclusions. Those conclusions will not be neutral with regard to the various political interests. For example if scientists objectively conclude that cigarettes DO cause cancer that has enormous social and political implications does it not? If scientists conclude that its possibles to build an atomic bomb then that has enormous social and political implications. If scientists conclude that a sepcific aids vaccine works in practice then that has enormous social and political implications. How many examples will it take before you become disabused of your notion of neutrality and come around to the view that science shoots for objectivity rather than neutrality.","marc9000","285970","It would take an indication from you that you know the difference between actual science (your examples above) and atheistic scientific ideology (Dawkins proclamations, Tiktaalik roseae, abiogenesis etc.)","challenge-both-sides","07:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","180"
