The direct exam starts here and by paging through the transcript you can read the whole thing. http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day10am2.html Please note the errors and non-objectivity of the ID witness when he is under cross-exam by a knowledgable attorney. Added by edit: The cross exam starts at http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day11pm.html approx halfway down the page.","challenge-both-sides","01:45 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","158"
"09-30-2007","10376",11,"chemist99a","285746","Actually it gets easier and easier as one accumulates more empirical knowledge. The probability of the GOD hypothesis being true shrinks and shrinks and shrinks. Sufficiently so that one has to BELIEVE that its actually zero - although one cannot prove that as a scientific hypothesis. Nice try but that implies that you have an actual way of measuring complexity which you clearly do not. Do you really think that the earth is more complex than the galaxy, or the local group, or the non-earth component of the entire universel? Its a most insane assumption. Its also easy to believe that we should have invaded Iraq and that we should stay there forever. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. For all either of us know the human population could start dropping and go to 100 million or so before stabilizing. And yes things are going to happen - thats what time is for to keep everything from happening at once. If indeed you need GOD to explain the world to you, then you are woefully lacking in both vision and imagination. Well you are not an atheist and I am. I by no means believe as you describe. Indeed as a scientist I understand and know that the ancients had economies, trade with each other, and even pretty decent civil engineering. Your projections about what I as an atheist believe are totally off base from what I DO think. Again you are not and expecting EVERYBODY to understand money management is just plain insane esp in view of the abundant empirical evidence to the contrary. And why would you think that human nature would change much. The romans had the gladatorial contests, we have Monday night football and pro wrestling. Bread and circuses are ever popular. Well lets see the data. What proportion of ancient Romans who carried credit cards were in arrears? What proportion had subprime loans outstanding? How many had 401Ks and how many handled their stock investments online? And I would like you to provide a specific reference in the holy texts of Christian doctrine which make the prediction that money management skills will devolve and that treatment of humans will devolve. By the way do you have data on the slave counts in ancient Rome and those in say Cleveland today? Would you like to count Roman crucifixions against legal execution rates today? Would you provide a good count of the number of Christians lit afire on the White House lawn compared to those in Neros Garden? To my eyes you are suffering from a strong positive bias toward conditions in past history which of course you did not observe or experience. Do you think the 1 st century after christ was a golden age or something? If so why? Or do you think the 14'th century in England was a golden age?","marc9000","285821","While one may accumulate slightly more empirical knowledge, he also accumulates more knowledge in other things. Science is not the only form of knowledge. (hmmm, maybe I should put that in my sig - I say it all the time and no one seems to notice) As one gets older, his own mortality and inperfection gets more and more clear. He watches children grow, goes to more funerals. Friendships, daily activities, priorities, they all can change. King Solomon, who wrote the book of Proverbs, was a very wise man. I believe older people have an easier time understanding what he wrote than do younger people. It can be compared . Nothing we see through a telescope comes close to matching the complexity of.....computers. Or something much more complex than computers - the human body. I think so. What do we see but dead rocks and energy through our telescopes? There's nothing out there complex enough to come here and say hello to us. It's real easy to believe we should have invaded Iraq. I'm glad Saddam Hussein is dead. If only we'd invaded Germany in 1940, millions of people wouldn't have been killed. I'm just trying to show an evolutionist the difference between the fast reality we can obviously see, vs. the billions of years ideology of evolution that we can't see. Logic tells me they don't both happen in the same natural environment. I plead guilty as charged - I don't have the imagination of an atheist. Well okay that's fine. As you get older, doesn't it get a little more perplexing when trying to describe how ""smart"" someone is? Very smart people are Christians - very simple people are Christians. Very smart people are atheists - very simple people are atheists. Some very simple people lead long, happy, productive lives, while some very smart people OD on recreational drugs in their twenties, or go bankrupt and kill themselves. The Bible relates to these things, does evolution? If we would utilize Biblical principes with all the communications capabilities that we have, with the labor saving devices we have, the toys many of us have to play with, we could all work one day a week and live like Kings. Increasing laziness and a decrease in human decency outlined in the Bible keep us working more hours than ever. (the ever shrinking number of us not on the public dole, that is) You're not making good comparisons. It would be better to compare Romans citizens attitudes during its buildup, its glory days, to its citizens attitudes shortly before its fall. Another good comparison would be morals and attitude in the U.S. 100 years ago vs its morals and attitudes today. Or its moral attitudes in the 60s compared to today. I was alive in the 60s. There was no MTV. You do partly have me there, I tend to nostalgize the past more than I should, and I'm glad I didn't live in the 14th century, or the 1930's for that matter. But modern technology should advance us more than it does. For just about every step forward, we take one step back it seems. Goes with Biblical predictions more than it does with evolution ""logic"".","challenge-both-sides","05:14 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","159"

Would you find his restraint praiseworthy although he had just killed of millions of other people?","marc9000","285822","If he gave me a pretty nice life in a pretty nice day and age, a pretty nice midwestern state, good health and the ability to make an average living, and the free gift of eternal life, I'd sing his praises, even if I didn't fully understand why he did what he did in the past.","challenge-both-sides","05:20 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","160"
"09-30-2007","10376",11,"chemist99a","285749","The stem cell researchers are similarly blocked by the so called Christians please note, but they continue working using private funding and they keep on publishing their research. The DI is totally privately funded and has more than adequate funds to cover their vital research without public support. Provided of course that they don't spend it all lobbying and on legal expenses!","marc9000","285825","I agree, it is a two way conflict, possibly evenly matched at times. But considering recent court decisions favoring evolution, naturalism etc, the stem cell researchers may have a bright future. I suppose what they are doing can be freely rammed down the throats of school children in science classes anytime. Quite the advantage, don't you think?","challenge-both-sides","05:26 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","161"
"09-30-2007","10376",11,"chemist99a","285751","Your logic fails. The fact that the available evidence is not favorable to the design hypothesis does not mean that the evidence is biased. Do you think the large amount of evidence that the earth is NOT flat indicates that the evidence is biased against the flat earthers? I mean its possible that the design hypothesis has no decent evidence simply because its wrong - just like the flat earth hypothesis. Heck the ID folks are not even able to provide a well developed criterion for what constitutes design as of yet, nor do they have any biological system which CANNOT be the product of evolution. You would think that after spending millions on the search for such items they would have found at least one which supports their hypothesis! But no - not one.","marc9000","285828","It depends on who's determining that it ""is not favorable"". It can be biased if the judge of it is biased. A round earth is something we can observe in the here and now. I'm really surprised the ""flat earth"" label is still tossed around by evolutionists today. It was used by evolutionists as early as the nineteenth century as a method of ridiculing Christians. The fact is, most belief in a flat earth disappeared by the fifteenth century. The fact that evolutionists still use it is an indicator of the insecurity they have in themselves. Likewise, evolutionists have squat for origins, for the simplest forms of life. You'd think that after spending billions evolutionists would be able to come up with something for a foundation for their beliefs. But no - not one.","challenge-both-sides","05:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","162"
