Only 5.2% claimed membership in a non-Christian faith, with Jews (1.4%) the leaders in that group. Only 0.6% of Americans are Muslim, 0.5% Buddhist, and 0.4% Hindu. The most rapidly growing segment in the survey involves those who say they have no religion or else identify as atheist or agnostic a group that now represents 15% of the total.

After all, it is NOT about evidence, it is about Faith. The moment we insist that we have ""evidence"" for God, or that God can be proven through events and things, then instead we see a God-of-the-gaps idea, a phenomenon so limiting of God that it blasphemously shrinking God to a primitive ""Gee, I don't understand, so it must be the gods"" idea. THAT is the lame and pathetic god that creationists promote, the god of physical observance. After all, Faith, the cornerstone of Christianity is completely disregarded by this crowd of creationists and other weak-faithed individuals. They are exactly like the Israelites in the desert, asking of a golden calf to physically evidencing God, their god (little g) is just their unimaginative impression of God (capital G). Creationists are desperately and panically seeking for their golden calf, and desperately speak against anybody who seek to have them look at their Faith instead. That really is what we are witnessing in these forum, a bunch of pathetic and weak-Faithed individuals pleading for something to build their faith (little f) on. And pathetic, weak-minded individuals clinging desperately to their warped and blasphemic God-of-the-gaps will say anything because they are driven by fear of losing their ""afterlife."" It doesn't matter what lies they have to tell us, because their concerns are solely directed at not going to their mythological version of hell (again seen by themselves as a physical location like everything else about God). And when such people of weak faith are afraid of Hell, telling falsehoods, spewing self-deluded ideas because all their worries are focused on somehow wanting to have a physical life after death, they of course show no concerns at all about bearing false witness and whatever else the faith in God (capital G) requires us to avoid. And they know it, they know that their grip on the elusive, self-deluded afterlife is slipping, so they get more desperate. Like people in a burning building who only see the door in the distance and will trample babies and their own mother to get through that door first.

Your weak faith (little f) is desperately sending you searching for ""evidence"" in a black-and-white world that doesn't exist to begin with. So your being born again looks like it dumped you into some warped and off-track world.

So you talking about being born again is frankly pathetic, as pathetic as your desperate seeking assurance of God's existence through evidence. If you TRULY were born again, you wouldn't need the evidence, Faith would simply be enough and would not be so threatened by Science or whatnot. However, for you that simply isn't enough. So I must wonder about your claim about being born again. You may have been tricked by Satan here and have been sidetracked into a world where you believe God condones False Witnessing. Perhaps you should take a look at that map of yours again, before you FURTHER sell your soul to the Devil with your endless bearing false witness.","only-one-god-does-exist-when-comes-politics-western-world","01:45 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","17"

YOU obviously are so stuck in your trying to get first in line to the afterlife (as described above) that you will fight everybody else to get in that line. AA, here is an analogy from my days in farming, an analogy that has been served up in the literature in the past as well. The example is that of little pigs at the feeding trough. There is always one that want it all for himself (or herself, but I'm going for brevity here) and try to chase all other piglets away from the trough. Unfortunately, while it chases one, all the others are still feeding, so in the end, all it got was a lot of self-righteous chasing of others away from ""his"" food, while everybody else got to eat their full. THAT piglet is the creationist movement and any self-righteous, excluding, scare- and hate-mongering theocratic ideology. You are to busy chasing off Muslims and anybody else you think that YOUR warped imagery of God are against, while the rest of us know that God loves everybody. So yes AA, Muslims are my brothers and sisters in Faith (capital F). And while all religions have their Bin Ladins and Fred Phelps, the treat to harmony comes from extremism, from fundamentalism, rather than from one Faith or another. That you don't see this and thus pathetically keep trying to find your physical god and fight to keep him/her for yourself because that is where your faith (small f) has led you, that frankly is sad.","only-one-god-does-exist-when-comes-politics-western-world","01:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","18"

The first hand personal evidence that God is real and always with us by way of his Holy Spirit comes with becoming born again, or saved as it is also referred to in the bible. Once one possesses Gods Holy Spirit, he also has that never ending personal assurance that God is, and always will be with him. That is my experience so it is much more than some dumb hope that I am right, but a fulfilled promise made by God and completed by the sacrifice Jesus made on the Cross when He died for the sins of every person who receives the free gift of salvation by submitting their lives to Him and trusting Him to guide and lead them as a Father guides and leads a child He loves.

"03-01-2008","11003",2,"Dane","304158","Combining posts for brevity and simplicity Ah, that's right, you insist on looking at the differences, just like a little kid insisting that ""mommy and daddy loves me more than you"" to their bothers and sisters. You want to be ""special"" in God's eyes. Well, AA, you very likely ARE special, but maybe not in a way you have thought of. A person like you who push so much false witnessing in ""defending"" god likely will get attention from God (capital G) Yeah, yeah. I get your simplistic, chest-beating ""Me good, them bad"" scare mongering. So that raises the question of how born again you are, with your insecure seeking approval from god (little g) through your false witnessing and insisting that God loves YOU more than God loves Muslims, f.ex.?????? Yes. So? Do you REALLY believe that God loves you less if God also love other people?","Archangel","304163","With every post you make you further prove you don't have a clue about Gods character or plan for our lives. No where did I say that my God doesn't love all moslems just as He loves all people on Earth, no matter what their religion. But that doesn't mean that He will receive moslems as they are under islamic law. God doesn't compromise Dane. And the only way to salvation is by accepting what Jesus did for us on the Cross. It is through Him that we are saved and not of ourselves at all. Jesus died for the sins of all of humanity, not just people who think they are saved because they are cultural christians. Take me for example, I was born MOSLEM. But only was I saved when I submitted my will to God through Christ who is the perfect sacrificial lamb who shed His blood so that we may live more abundant live. Nooooo... ME BAD, NEED SALVATION THROUGH LOVING MESSIAH WHO DIED FOR SINS. AND ALSO SINS OF ALL PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE FREE GIFT OF SALVATION HE OFFER TO EVERYONE. ME NOT EXTRA SPECIAL, I JUST RECEIVE GIFT. I seek to please my heavenly Father every day of my life. I worship Him, glorify Him and Magnify His Holy name for He is worthy of praise and worship. And I'm saddened that as one who claims to be a christian that you will mock me for that lifestyle. But let me be clear that no where did I ever say that God loves me more than anyone else at all. That is just your corrupted interpretation of what i said. And I challenge you to post where I said such a thing. Of course not Dane. If I didn't love you in spite of all of the hatred you have projected towards me, do you think I would have spent all of this time sharing the truth of how one must be saved with you? Wouldn't I just shut up and not even tell you how to avoid eternal separation from God? Your problem is, that you have no concept of what true love is.

He typifies the typical, isolated creationist who thinks that his beliefs are true of everyone. Over the years I have had close friends among the clergy, the closest being Lutheran, Methodist, Catholic, and Presbyterian. As a biologist, I discussed the issues of evolution and a literal reading of the Bible with all of them. One even commented that you would have to be stupid not to accept evolution. All of them saw Genesis as allegorical. As was explained to me, anyone who was a member of one of the above religions and who professed young earth creationism is not professing a fundamental tenet of those religions. However, I can't really say how those religions have changed in the last decades. Certainly we know that creationism is a relatively modern development. Young earth creationism first arose in the early part of the last century among 7th Day Adventists. This dogma was developed by George McCready Price and his flood geology. It turns out that fundamentalist christian cults were easy targets for this particular belief. Early attempts to inject science into fundamentalism, such as the Religion and Science Association (RSA), failed miserably for lack of members. The Deluge Geology Society (DGS) also suffered from a lack of membership, and well as the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA). As time passed, the ASA moved from the strict creationism of Price to progressive creationism and even theistic evolution. This happened as the scientific qualifications of the membership actually increased. It seems that those who hold strict young earth creationist views generally have few qualifications in science. That was true of the RSA, DGS, and the ASA. However, with the launch of Sputnik, Americans realized that we were seriously lagging in science education. This event prompted a revision and updating of science texts and curricula. The concepts of evolution in biology and the great age of the earth in geology caused the creationist organizations to become more vocal. The focus turned from efforts to support creationism with science, to efforts to disprove science. Organizations such as the Institute for Creation Research (ICR) arose, directly inspired by the flood geology of the 7th Day Adventist George McCready Price, although the ICR would prefer that their link to 7th Day Adventists not be known. New laws were passed in several states in efforts to force the teaching of biblical creationism as science. All such efforts have failed, the latest being the efforts to inject ID in to the schools of Dover, PA.

""In his encyclical Humani Generis (1950), my predecessor Pius XII has already affirmed that there is no conflict between evolution and the doctrine of the faith regarding man and his vocation, provided that we do not lose sight of certain fixed points.... Today, more than a half-century after the appearance of that encyclical, some new findings lead us toward the recognition of evolution as more than an hypothesis. In fact it is remarkable that this theory has had progressively greater influence on the spirit of researchers, following a series of discoveries in different scholarly disciplines. The convergence in the results of these independent studies -- which was neither planned nor sought -- constitutes in itself a significant argument in favor of the theory. "" [bold added] --Pope John Paul II, 22Oct1996 ""... While there is little consensus among scientists about how the origin of this first microscopic life is to be explained, there is general agreement among them that the first organism dwelt on this planet about 3.5 - 4 billion years ago. Since it has been demonstrated that all living organisms on earth are genetically related, it is virtually certain that all living organisms have descended from this first organism. Converging evidence from many studies in the physical and biological sciences furnishes mounting support for some theory of evolution to account for the development and diversification of life on earth, while controversy continues over the pace and mechanisms of evolution."" [bold and color added] --statement from the International Theological Commission, endorsed by Cardinal Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI), July 2004 ""We cannot say: creation or evolution, inasmuch as these two things respond to two different realities. The story of the dust of the earth and the breath of God, which we just heard, does not in fact explain how human persons come to be but rather what they are. It explains their inmost origin and casts light on the project that they are. And, vice versa, the theory of evolution seeks to understand and describe biological developments. But in so doing it cannot explain where the 'project' of human persons comes from, nor their inner origin, nor their particular nature. To that extent we are faced here with two complementary -- rather than mutually exclusive -- realities."" --Cardinal Ratzinger, In the Beginning: A Catholic Understanding of the Story of Creation and the Fall [Eerdmans, 1986, 1995] And I explained to you that it has a chapter entitled ""Living in the GODLESS universe"".

For example, if a book has ""how science shows that God does not exist"" on it's cover, it doesn't make sense that a reading of the book would show something different. The book would show it in more detail. Yes I did, Miller showed no knowledge of the very basics of Christianity. (you know, original sin, Biblical genealogy, things like that.) That the earth needs to be old. You've outdone me 2 to 1 in the non answer dept, as well as the proof dept. Thaaaats right, I took it out of context - you could have had a very understandable reason in bringing up the possibility of my violating chickens, chickens could very well have been the subject of that discussion. Did you learn that in college, or on the second grade playground? There's your lie, I've never complained to administration about you. It's simple all right - I honestly don't think you're an adult. More playground logic? Sure it is, according to you. You can get me in last-word battles everytime. I get bored with you fairly easily. It's the opposition thing that you're not getting.

I would. You've said repeatedly that you've read his book. Were you lying? Because his book clearly explains this. How about the Pope? Do you consider the Pope knowledgeable about Catholicism. I would. Do you pay any attention to this stuff, marc, or do you still turn the blind eye to those things you don't like so that you can continue to wallow in your willful ignorance? Here's one. ""The position of the Catholic Church on the theory of evolution has moved over the last two centuries from a large period of no official mention, to a statement of neutrality in the 1950s, to a more explicit acceptance in recent years."" That, friends, is an explicit rejection of young-earth creationism. The poofy magic of ""dust to man"" is not the accepted explanation of the actual occurrences, according to the Catholic church. Unlike you, I can read. I know that the suffix ""-less"" means. But I also know that books have text for a reason. You want to ignore the text. Why, marc, why? Why do you want to ignore the text of the book that you says uses its text to argue against all gods? Or are you saying that the text really doesn't argue all gods, but you have to lie and say that it does? Did I claim that it had ""no support""? I don't remember claiming that. There are a disgustingly large number of willfully scientifically ignorant religio-bots who throw away their money. Now, I'll say that there's no evidential support for their claims, but you know the saying: never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups. Another lie. You made a claim. I asked you to back it up. You are now REFUSING TO BACK UP YOUR CLAIM . Shameless. Pathetic. Dishonest. And you call yourself a good Christian, don't you? SUPPORT YOUR CLAIM. Just for the record, you'll find above where I supported my statements that you challenged. It's one thing for me to present a claim without evidence because I really don't think that you're clueless enough to deny its factual basis; it's another thing to just make stuff up. When you challenge, I support. When I challenge, you never support. I'd make a ratio out of that, but since you can't divide by zero without calculus, you probably won't understand that I support my points infinitely more often than do you. Above. That's just f***ing amazing. marc is actually arguing that we don't need to read the text of a book. Clearly, Kenneth Miller's book entitled Finding Darwin's God is about how Dr. Miller counted to 100, searched all over, and then finally saw God hiding behind a tree. No, Miller just showed no adherence to many of the beliefs that you have. Of course, that qualifies him as a closet atheist to you, but that's another issue that you seriously should seek professional help with. Really? You mean all of the evolution we've seen since 1850 hasn't really happened? The sun needs to be shining and the water cycle needs to proceed and DNA base pairs needs to bond, so is chemistry really a perversion of ""Darwinism""? Did Lavoisier have the secret backhanded intent of proving evolutionary theory with his chemistry research decades before Darwin was even born? Our understanding of first-order reaction rate laws clearly have been fudged in order to make radiometric dating give the dates we want, right marc? Even though the very same applications accurately describe every other first-order reaction? Gee, marc, why didn't you answer my other questions? Why does ""Darwinism"" rely upon cosmology? Why does ""Darwinism"" rely upon astronomy? WHY, MARC? Why won't you answer these questions, marc? Why won't you support your lies, marc? Another lie and another evasion. Even if it were true that I never once backed up a single point, it doesn't excuse you from the same standard of evidence. Why won't you answer these questions, marc? Why won't you support your lies, marc? Post the entire passage, marc. Go ahead. With a link so that everybody can see. Do it. I dare you. If you are right, then you should have no trouble showing that I seriously tried to make the case that you violate chickens. We're waiting. Where's the passage? Where's the link, marc? Where's the evidence? Where's the proof that you aren't a quote mining, slanderous liar? Why can't you prove that you're not a quote mining, slanderous liar? I learned to parody in my college logic course. I've told you about it many times. It's mentioned in my Introduction to Philosophy textbook as well. Say, did you enroll in a logic course like I asked you to? Did you ever get your hands on a logic book like I recommended? Not a lie, but a faulty -- albeit logical -- assumption. Somebody reported several of my posts that responded to you. admin told me to stop calling you names, so I explained that I made it clear in that post what I was doing. He gave me the OK, but I stopped anyway because I'll respect his wishes when they are reasonable. I'll retract my statement that you ran crying to admin. Look, if you want to proclaim that some little kid is beating you silly with the Truth Stick of No Mercy, feel free. I really don't see how that helps you. I'd be ashamed if one of my students took me to town on a subject of which I claim mastery in the same way that I'm slaughtering your every point. Parody is valid counterargument. Apparently I have my answer about the logic course. I wouldn't enjoy being humiliated if I were in your shoes, either. So does baseball fandom and the opposition of Met fans to the Yankees. Does that make baseball a religion, or does that just deify the Mets and the Yankees? Look, a complete evasion of the fact that you pretended that I said something that I didn't. You don't even have the intellectual integrity or honesty to fess up when you lie shamelessly. Equally importantly, your statement above makes no sense. You're scrambling so frantically to come up with any response that you're saying.. hell, I don't even know how one could believe evolution as an allegory. And dumbly overlooking the fact that Tiktaalik was found precisely where it was predicted by evolutionary theory to be doesn't seem to bother you, does it? You didn't do it once in that post. You're still claiming that books don't need pages. You refuse to post the context of the chickenlover statements. Uh.. You contradict yourself, you get called on it by multiple posters, and you claim that I 've made a stupid mistake? Hello? marc? Reality calling, pick up, marc, pick up... Did I object to the fact that you responded to an emotional post? No, I object to the fact that you're shamelessly dishonest. Are these two things even remotely analogous? No. So why are you trying to make this the issue? Because you're shamelessly dishonest! 39 is nothing but deceit. You pretended (lied) that AiG addresses creationism merely as a minor point and then used that misrepresentation to tie it to denominations in support of your earlier lie. In 59 you begin by again claiming that books need only a title and don't need pages. Where? Show proof. Show proof of every one of your accusations: 1. that atheism lies 2. that atheism lies habitually 3. that atheism lies for money 4. that atheism lies for public money 5. that atheism lies under the ruse of promoting evolution You just can't come up with anything original, can you? Can't respond substantively, can't provide any counterargument. All you can do is change a word here and there and pretend that you've created a parody. (And yet you deny that parody is a valid counterargument...) The problem, marc, is that a parody needs to be based on an accurate analogy.

The purpose of our lives is to reveal God to men, he said, in St. Peters Square. And only where God is seen does life truly begin. . . . We are not some casual and meaningless product of evolution. Each of us is the result of a thought of God. Each of us is willed, each of us is loved, each of us is necessary. So what is the pope concerned about? What is the Vatican trying to do? . . . (The) church has moved from neutrality to something like acceptance of evolutionary theory, though drawing a thick bottom line that God is the ultimate creator. In 1996, Pope John Paul declared evolution more than a hypothesis, and in 2004 as Cardinal Ratzinger, Pope Benedict endorsed the scientific view that the earth is roughly four billion years old and that species changed through evolution. Indeed, there has been no credible scientific challenge to the idea that evolution, the foundation of modern biology, explains the diversity of life on earth. Given that history, scientists and church experts say they cannot imagine the study session ending with any alignment of the pope or the church with intelligent design or American-style creationism, which often posits that Earth is only about 6,000 years old. Once again, there is that infamous quote from the late Pope John Paul II, the quote that totally misses the point of this debate when seen from the point of view of Rome. Clearly, the Vatican accepts many ideas associated with the mechanisms of evolution, but, at the very least, the pope rejects the unprovable Darwinian doctrine that creation is the result of random and unguided changes. How would someone in a lab prove that changes are random? How could someone in a lab prove absolutely that they were guided and by whom? At some point, research must be interpreted. This is where science becomes philosophy and that is precisely where the Vatican debate is focused. You can tell that by reading what John Paul II actually said. Here is a section of a column I wrote on this topic for Scripps Howard News Service. I would bet the moon and the stars that this is the issue being discussed right now by the current pope and his students. Part of the problem is the 1996 papal address (by John Paul II) to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, with its familiar quotation that new knowledge leads us to recognize that the theory of evolution is more than a hypothesis. The question is whether John Paul said theory or theories. According to official translations, the pope said: Rather than the theory of evolution, we should speak of several theories of evolution. On the one hand, this plurality has to do with the different explanations advanced for the mechanism of evolution, and on the other, with the various philosophies on which it is based. The pope then rejected all theories arguing that humanity is the product of a random, unguided process of creation. Thus, he said that theories of evolution which, because of the philosophies which inspire them, regard the spirit either as emerging from the forces of living matter, or as a simple epiphenomenon of that matter, are incompatible with the truth about man. At the time John Paul II spoke these words, the National Association of Biology Teachers had officially defined evolution as an unsupervised, impersonal, unpredictable, and natural process . . . that is affected by natural selection, chance, historical contingencies and changing environments. Critics said this definition veered beyond science into theological speculation. Thus, in 1997 the associations board reversed itself and removed the words unsupervised and impersonal. This is where the debate must focus. It all comes back to that quite religious, doctrinaire statement by George Gaylord Simpson in the famous The Meaning of Evolution. That faith-based statement of naturalism is: Man is the result of a purposeless and natural process that did not have him in mind. Pope John Paul II disagreed. It appears that Benedict XVI does, too. Does that make this pope a stupid creationist? Does this put him on the wrong side of science? Stay tuned. On a side note. Isn't it interesting the the definition that the National Association of Biology Teachers had for evolution was exactly the same definition that I was just mercilessly attacked for insisting what the accepted definition was in another recent debate. Granted, the Board changed it in 97 due to political pressure within the scientific community, but that doesn't change the fact that only the words unsupervised and impersonal were removed. And here it is again. the National Association of Biology Teachers had officially defined evolution as an unsupervised, impersonal, unpredictable, and natural process . . . that is affected by natural selection.","only-one-god-does-exist-when-comes-politics-western-world","11:42 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","72"

Numbers, Ronald L. 1992. The Creationists: The Evolution of Scientific Creationism. University of California Press, Berkeley. 458 p. Dr. Numbers has a background in math/physics before he turned to the history of science. He is a former 7th Day Adventist and a former creationist. He is a few months younger than I am, so we both grew up in a time when the new religion of scientific creationism was gaining strength among the ignorant. The book is now 16 years old, but history doesn't change. But isn't it amazing that creationists still believe that their particular cult dates to the time of Christ and that they are the only true christians? More like just another bunch of heretics.","marc9000","305497","It goes hand in hand with your making no comment nor making any effort to rebut anything I said in post #39.

"03-12-2008","11003",6,"trebor","305198","You don't think aig is lying? The AIG lies , for example, about ""Radiometric Dating'"". It LIES about Whale evolution. Read the article from Jonathan Safari about cetacean evolution at the AIG site, and I can show you were it is repeatedly misinforming the public about what is known... (and he has been called on it a number of times). This website shows how much money the AIG kentucky is making http://lippard.blogspot.com/2006/12/...clines-by.html Of course, the 'money declinging' is due to the error of the person reviewing the 990 (a mistake he admits, since he is not an accountant), but it does show that AIG is whoring it's lies for money. The entire creation museum is built on lies. It misrepresents science from square one, and it presents itself AS science. This page here shows that the motivation is for 'the glory of God' http://blogs.answersingenesis.org/mu...reation-museum So, it has the guise of Christianity. It lies in the name of Christianity, It whores itself out sucking money from the Christians in the U.S. that are less educated ,making them think they are contributing to the 'glory of God'. This link here shows how they lie, and whore themselves out in the name of Christianity. You might want to hand wave it away as 'oh, just someone's opinion, but read up on it. It shows dishonesty on the part of AIG, for altering essays that refute them, taking out links to sources of information they find inconvinent http://www.noanswersingenesis.org.au...risy_henke.htm Now, those claims about the AIG have been documented. Let's see you document your claims.","Archangel","305500","This is documentation of nothing Trebor. In your first link, some blogger posts AIG's financial statement, which you admit he made a mistake in, and from that, you claim they lie.? The second link is the Creation Museums page for buying tickets to see the exhibits and from that for evidence, you claim they lie? Your third link is a blogger who claims a young-Earth creationist, Dr. Jerry Bergman wrote a response to Dr. Henke's original version of the essay and allegedly distorted the outcome. And that proves that AIG is lying because this one guy say's this other guy was dishonest?

Is he the end all and be all of scriptural knowledge by any reliable standard at all? I agree that some parts of the bible are metaphorical, some are allegorical, and some are literal. There is nothing about the Creation account in Genesis that implies that it's anything but literal. God doesn't say things like and it was like the light was separating from the darkness, but that it happened. To deny the Genesis account of creation is to deny God Himself. At least that's how he will see it. He say's after all that we are either for Him or against Him; we either love Him or hate Him. You can't deny His word and claim to accept Him too.

"03-13-2008","11003",6,"marc9000","305488","Mentioning it and demonstrating it are two different things. There's no detail about Catholisicm [sic] in his book ""Finding Darwin's God"". His book that I took a lot of time to read shows no references to it. I couldn't say. You've made it clear in the past that you don't believe any of it - why do you take an interest in it? Unless of course, to downgrade it. Dawkins? Stenger? Talkorigins? Does the Pope agree with them all? Are you an American, does George W Bush speak for you? As an evolutionist, does Richard Dawkins speak for you? No, but outlines of Protestant beliefs about Biblical authority were in post #39, the one you ignored. How about Exodus, I wonder? Deuteronomy 34:7 says that Moses died at the age of 120 years, yet his eyes were not weak nor his strengh [sic] gone. I'm sure modern science can toss that out, does the Catholic church disregard that too? How about Genesis, 9:29 - ""Altogether, Noah lived 950 years, and then he died"". Does the Catholic church toss that one out? I'll bet Richard Dawkins, or electrolyte, could prove it false. Then there's this one, from Matthew 28:2; ""There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it. His appearance was like lightening, and his clothes were as white as snow"". Yes or no, what does the Catholic church think about that one? I'd just like to know where they draw the line - when to agree with atheists and when not to. Did Cardinal Ratzinger say that? Is there a passage in the Bible that says; ""thou shalt be embarrassed if thine atheist brethren mock thee?""","pandion","305524","No, they're not. Publicly professing one's faith is one way to demonstrate it. He also practices his faith openly, although he doesn't try to impose it on others against their wills like you do. The fact that there is no specific mention of Catholicism in his book is because the whole book is a reconciliation of his profession with his religion. He is an evolutionary biologist and he is a Roman Catholic. He has no perspective as a Protestant or a creationist. What he says about science and faith are from his perspective as a Roman Catholic. But since you have no idea of the tenets of Catholicism, you couldn't possible know that Miller is talking about his religious beliefs. He certainly isn't arguing for a literal Biblical interpretation or young earth creationism. He actually does a very good job of presenting the view of the Catholic Church in the matter, a view that is mainstream Christian and diametrically opposed to what AIG claims. And, of course, Miller also made it clear that he doesn't believe in any of it either. What I don't believe is your sort of claptrap. What I don't believe is that you are the purveyor of the one true faith. I attempt to downgrade attempts to present religious claptrap presented as if it were scientifically valid, or even reasonable. If you can't say, then how can you claim that you know more than Miller about Catholicism? That implies that you know more than I do. In fact, I probably know a bit more than Miller. Just how is it, do you think, that I came to have so many friends in the clergy of various religions? On some issues, certainly. One of those issues is the insanity of claiming that the earth is no more than 10,000 years old, that the report of the Garden of Eden or Noah's flood is anything more than an allegory, that the stories of Jonah or Job are more than mythological moral lessons. It just didn't happen. Certainly not. Does he speak for you? He is so stupid that he believes that the earth is about 6,000 years old and that there is no evidence for evolution. I agree with most American who feel that we are not as well off as we were 8 years ago. But 8 years ago, I was much better off than I was 16 years ago. Certainly not. Although he is an excellent author and has added new perspective to evolutionary biology, especially with his exchanges with Gould, I'm not all that into some of his ideas. The exchanges sharpened the ideas of both men and they had great respect for each other. But, of course, you are again being disingenuous. You are moving the goal posts. The question was whether Cardinal Ratzinger is the spokesman for the Catholic Church. Yes, he is. You can't escape you ignorance by pretending that the question was whether he spoke for me. By his position, Pope, he is by definition the spokesman for the Catholic Church. I am not the Catholic Church. Actually, I didn't see that post #39 needed a response since you posted my objections and then failed to answer any of them. Probably allegorical. Exodus certainly isn't historical, although there may be some basis in history. There doesn't seem to be any trace of Israelite slaves in Egypt nor any signs that a population as large as that claimed by the Bible ever wandered in the Sinai. Probably myth. Humans don't live that long. I bet they couldn't. There isn't any evidence one way or the other. It is common knowledge that the ages of ancient leaders were exaggerated to enhance their wisdom and authority. The Bible and Hebrew mythology isn't the only holy book where that took place. What does that have to do with the topic? Why do you keep moving to goal posts. Is it that you believe that if one word of the Bible is true, then it is all true? Is it that you believe that if one word if false then it is all false? So you don't know what allegories and morality stories are? Actually, the Catholic Church pretty much agrees with Matt 28:2. However, that isn't relevant to the whether any other book, chapter, verse, or phrase is literally true. The Catholic Church actually recognizes that Genesis represents the oral traditions of the Hebrews. That's why there are two creation stories. That's why there is some question about 2 pairs or 7 of any species. And, of course, the idea of clean v. unclean was defined in Leviticus, so it is reasonable to assume that Genesis was actually written after Leviticus and recounts older oral traditions. What does atheism have to do with this discussion? Why do you assume that science is the same as atheism? Actually, it is a matter of agreement with certain christian cults that hold that the Bible is all the truth that matters, religiously and scientifically. The line is actually drawn at reasonable and rational. You accept without evidence moral truths and ethics, and you accept reality that is supported by observation and testing. No. Actually it was his predecessor, John Paul II who admitted the error of the Catholic Church in claiming that the earth is the center of the universe. Took a few years, didn't it? But that is the nature of religion. Never admit an error even if you look foolish in not doing so. And John Paul II even said that evolution is more than a theory since it has been supported by observation, hypothesis, prediction, and testing to such an extent that it is no longer in doubt. Actually, that's pretty much what St. Augustin said about ignorant faith in the face of reality. But of course, St Augustin was a Roman Catholic and can be safely disregarded by more recent cults.","only-one-god-does-exist-when-comes-politics-western-world","12:50 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","86"
