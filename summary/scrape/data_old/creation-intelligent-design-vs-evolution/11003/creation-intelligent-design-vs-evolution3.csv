"03-02-2008","11003",3,"Dane","304132","I think that listening to AA, Marc etc gives people a weird and warped image of Christianity. After all, it is NOT about evidence, it is about Faith. The moment we insist that we have ""evidence"" for God, or that God can be proven through events and things, then instead we see a God-of-the-gaps idea, a phenomenon so limiting of God that it blasphemously shrinking God to a primitive ""Gee, I don't understand, so it must be the gods"" idea. THAT is the lame and pathetic god that creationists promote, the god of physical observance. After all, Faith, the cornerstone of Christianity is completely disregarded by this crowd of creationists and other weak-faithed individuals. They are exactly like the Israelites in the desert, asking of a golden calf to physically evidencing God, their god (little g) is just their unimaginative impression of God (capital G). Creationists are desperately and panically seeking for their golden calf, and desperately speak against anybody who seek to have them look at their Faith instead. That really is what we are witnessing in these forum, a bunch of pathetic and weak-Faithed individuals pleading for something to build their faith (little f) on. And pathetic, weak-minded individuals clinging desperately to their warped and blasphemic God-of-the-gaps will say anything because they are driven by fear of losing their ""afterlife."" It doesn't matter what lies they have to tell us, because their concerns are solely directed at not going to their mythological version of hell (again seen by themselves as a physical location like everything else about God). And when such people of weak faith are afraid of Hell, telling falsehoods, spewing self-deluded ideas because all their worries are focused on somehow wanting to have a physical life after death, they of course show no concerns at all about bearing false witness and whatever else the faith in God (capital G) requires us to avoid. And they know it, they know that their grip on the elusive, self-deluded afterlife is slipping, so they get more desperate. Like people in a burning building who only see the door in the distance and will trample babies and their own mother to get through that door first. Now, does ANYBODY here think that such self-deluded, panicked creationists ever will show any concern to honesty and truth rather than whatever sophistry they believe will get them first in line?","unkerpaulie","304268","i have much respect for your position because this was also my belief when i was a christian. i started posting on a few discussion boards a few years ago, armed and ready to dismantle the folly of evolution. i almost immediately realized that what i thought was evolution, and therefore what i was arguing against, was based on a false view of what evolutin really was humbled, i backed off the attacking and started to observe. i realized that there were quite a number of posters like marc and jyoshu, who believe in the bible as the word of God, but who also subscribe to facts, evidence and science to support their belief. many of them end up in the logically irreconcilable position of ""creation-scientist"". how someone can believe the bible is true, yet simultaneously discredit genesis to an allegory is beyond me. furthermore, any attempts to extract a moral from taking genesis as an allegory, or some sort of meaning that this allegory is based on, always turns up void i would caution you. if you open-mindedly participate in a forum like this, you will eventually lose your Faith. there is something about truth that find those that seek it. most people's goals on forums like these doesnt include educating themselves. if you are one of those people, then you have nothing to worry about. but if you are like me, and you seek truth, then be prepared for change. i'm writing in a cautionary tone not because i dont want you to find truth, but because change is usually uncomfortable....","only-one-god-does-exist-when-comes-politics-western-world","11:47 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","35"

As a Christian, I agree with you. Mainstream Christian organizations such as Answers In Genesis agree with you. Militant atheists like Richard Dawkins agree with you. Another atheist, Francis Crick, puts it this way; The ones who don't agree with us seem to be most militant atheists who post on this board, and most theistic evolutionists. I would dearly love to see some civilized debate on this subject, not to participate myself, but to read and learn. That is ""can Genesis be discredited to an allegory, to an acceptable medium between evolution and Christianity?"" Or, is evolution atheistic? When an attempt is made to explore it, it quickly turns into RAGE. Examples are here , here , and here . If by open-mindedly, you mean placing scripture on equal terms with science only, youre probably right. But if scripture is placed on equal terms with a combination of science, history, philosophy (good, evil, love, hate etc.) then Im not so sure. There sure is something about truth that find those that seek it. ""Christianity is not cheapened if Genesis is an allegory / Christianity IS cheapened if Genesis is an allegory. ""Science does not address the existance of God"" / ""Science proves that God does not exist."" Both these two sets of opposites clash. Why is it that (in the second one particularly) atheists are the ones that get angry if they're discussed? We always seem to imply that speech should be free, that it goes without saying. Do the links I showed above make it clear that atheists really believe that?","only-one-god-does-exist-when-comes-politics-western-world","10:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","36"

""Mainstream"" would indicate that AIG represented the beliefs of the majority of Christian denominations. That isn't even close to the truth. The essential tenets of Lutheranism, Methodistism, Catholicism, Anglicanism, and Prebyterianism are not in agreement with the mythology proffered by AIG. Historically, not even Baptist theology had anything in common with AIG theology. It's just another example of the evolution of christian truth. The cult expressed by AIG is less than 20 years old and depends on previous ideas from 7th day Adventists.

What people are getting upset about if you and AA's constant use of personal insults, ignoring points, fabrication, revision of history and general massive dishonesty. No one is getting angry about the topics. It is about behavior about how one side goes about discussing the topics and its treatment of the opposition. Where atheist means anyone you disagree with.... If one spends the time to go through the forum, they will see exactly what I have said and nothing of what you have. T.Q is currently on the rampage not because of the topics, but because of AA's lack of any moral character and how it manifests itself in his posts. You won't find any posts where the opposition to your beliefs are upset because of the specific issue. It is all about dishonest behavior. I started this thread because of your dishonest narrowing of the topic in the first place. Your behavior is the problem. Instead of simply admitting that in the context of Gods, your arguments fall apart like a card house on a windy day, you IGNORE that entirely.","only-one-god-does-exist-when-comes-politics-western-world","04:37 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","43"

Something always niggles at me when statements like this are made. Hard to put into words as it is, I'll try. I get the feeling that science is perceived as persecuting religions by unearthing facts that disagree with them, like it's somehow science's fault those facts are there. The subtext of statements like the one above, and of the posts that contain them, often seems to be that science should be judged - and potentially found wanting in some vaguely moralistic sense - for bringing to our collective attention the ways in which some religious texts fail to jibe with reality. If we abandoned science here and now, and eradicated all its works, would that suddenly make Genesis accurate? No - so why shoot the messenger? Are we supposed to be angry with science for making it harder to be a Christian? Why? Shouldn't we be angry with the bible for making it harder to be a Christian by containing factual inaccuracies? Surely the lesson there is that if you're going to proclaim yourself the bearer of the unadulterated word of god, you'd better be damn sure you can read his handwriting first.","only-one-god-does-exist-when-comes-politics-western-world","09:50 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","44"
