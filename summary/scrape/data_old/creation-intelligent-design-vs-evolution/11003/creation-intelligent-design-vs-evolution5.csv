He typifies the typical, isolated creationist who thinks that his beliefs are true of everyone. Over the years I have had close friends among the clergy, the closest being Lutheran, Methodist, Catholic, and Presbyterian. As a biologist, I discussed the issues of evolution and a literal reading of the Bible with all of them. One even commented that you would have to be stupid not to accept evolution. All of them saw Genesis as allegorical. As was explained to me, anyone who was a member of one of the above religions and who professed young earth creationism is not professing a fundamental tenet of those religions. However, I can't really say how those religions have changed in the last decades. Certainly we know that creationism is a relatively modern development. Young earth creationism first arose in the early part of the last century among 7th Day Adventists. This dogma was developed by George McCready Price and his flood geology. It turns out that fundamentalist christian cults were easy targets for this particular belief. Early attempts to inject science into fundamentalism, such as the Religion and Science Association (RSA), failed miserably for lack of members. The Deluge Geology Society (DGS) also suffered from a lack of membership, and well as the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA). As time passed, the ASA moved from the strict creationism of Price to progressive creationism and even theistic evolution. This happened as the scientific qualifications of the membership actually increased. It seems that those who hold strict young earth creationist views generally have few qualifications in science. That was true of the RSA, DGS, and the ASA. However, with the launch of Sputnik, Americans realized that we were seriously lagging in science education. This event prompted a revision and updating of science texts and curricula. The concepts of evolution in biology and the great age of the earth in geology caused the creationist organizations to become more vocal. The focus turned from efforts to support creationism with science, to efforts to disprove science. Organizations such as the Institute for Creation Research (ICR) arose, directly inspired by the flood geology of the 7th Day Adventist George McCready Price, although the ICR would prefer that their link to 7th Day Adventists not be known. New laws were passed in several states in efforts to force the teaching of biblical creationism as science. All such efforts have failed, the latest being the efforts to inject ID in to the schools of Dover, PA. At any rate, if the AIG is mainstream christian, then it only shows how much the basic tenets of christianity can change over the years. It seems that truth among christians is a matter of what is popular.","only-one-god-does-exist-when-comes-politics-western-world","12:29 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","61"

"03-09-2008","11003",5,"marc9000","304963","I don't consider you to be knowledgable in Catholicism. ""Outright rejects it"". Any links at all? ""In his encyclical Humani Generis (1950), my predecessor Pius XII has already affirmed that there is no conflict between evolution and the doctrine of the faith regarding man and his vocation, provided that we do not lose sight of certain fixed points.... Today, more than a half-century after the appearance of that encyclical, some new findings lead us toward the recognition of evolution as more than an hypothesis. In fact it is remarkable that this theory has had progressively greater influence on the spirit of researchers, following a series of discoveries in different scholarly disciplines. The convergence in the results of these independent studies -- which was neither planned nor sought -- constitutes in itself a significant argument in favor of the theory. "" [bold added] --Pope John Paul II, 22Oct1996 ""... While there is little consensus among scientists about how the origin of this first microscopic life is to be explained, there is general agreement among them that the first organism dwelt on this planet about 3.5 - 4 billion years ago. Since it has been demonstrated that all living organisms on earth are genetically related, it is virtually certain that all living organisms have descended from this first organism. Converging evidence from many studies in the physical and biological sciences furnishes mounting support for some theory of evolution to account for the development and diversification of life on earth, while controversy continues over the pace and mechanisms of evolution."" [bold and color added] --statement from the International Theological Commission, endorsed by Cardinal Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI), July 2004 ""We cannot say: creation or evolution, inasmuch as these two things respond to two different realities. The story of the dust of the earth and the breath of God, which we just heard, does not in fact explain how human persons come to be but rather what they are. It explains their inmost origin and casts light on the project that they are. And, vice versa, the theory of evolution seeks to understand and describe biological developments. But in so doing it cannot explain where the 'project' of human persons comes from, nor their inner origin, nor their particular nature. To that extent we are faced here with two complementary -- rather than mutually exclusive -- realities."" --Cardinal Ratzinger, In the Beginning: A Catholic Understanding of the Story of Creation and the Fall [Eerdmans, 1986, 1995] And I explained to you that it has a chapter entitled ""Living in the GODLESS universe"". I explained to you before what the suffix ""less"" means, but you missed it. Neither one. Attendance in this case means that the museum does have support, that atheists claim it doesn't have. You're outdoing me about 2 to 1, in the dataless claims department. Reputable link? A properly titled book is summarized by it's cover. For example, if a book has ""how science shows that God does not exist"" on it's cover, it doesn't make sense that a reading of the book would show something different. The book would show it in more detail. Yes I did, Miller showed no knowledge of the very basics of Christianity. (you know, original sin, Biblical genealogy, things like that.) That the earth needs to be old. You've outdone me 2 to 1 in the non answer dept, as well as the proof dept. Thaaaats right, I took it out of context - you could have had a very understandable reason in bringing up the possibility of my violating chickens, chickens could very well have been the subject of that discussion. Did you learn that in college, or on the second grade playground? There's your lie, I've never complained to administration about you. It's simple all right - I honestly don't think you're an adult. More playground logic? Sure it is, according to you. You can get me in last-word battles everytime. I get bored with you fairly easily. It's the opposition thing that you're not getting. Opposition to religion has many of the characteristics of religion. I do the same with evolution. I believe it, but only as an allegory. It didn't really happen, but study of it is very important. The search for Tiikaliik rosae was very satisfying for those who went on the expedition. If it made them happy, I'm all for it. I do it all the time - that's why you're so angry. You made a stupid mistake. Appealing to your gang isn't going to save you. If you don't want me responding to your emotional posts, don't make emotional posts. You'd have to read my posts 36, 39, and 58 to see just how much you just lied about the content of my posts. I can say that atheism lies. Habitually. For money, PUBLIC money. Under the ruse of promoting evolution. Militant evolutionists are whoring themselves out under the guise of being evolutionists.","electrolyte","304980","Do you consider Kenneth Miller -- a Catholic -- to be knowledgeable in Catholicism? I would. You've said repeatedly that you've read his book. Were you lying? Because his book clearly explains this. How about the Pope? Do you consider the Pope knowledgeable about Catholicism. I would. Do you pay any attention to this stuff, marc, or do you still turn the blind eye to those things you don't like so that you can continue to wallow in your willful ignorance? Here's one. ""The position of the Catholic Church on the theory of evolution has moved over the last two centuries from a large period of no official mention, to a statement of neutrality in the 1950s, to a more explicit acceptance in recent years."" That, friends, is an explicit rejection of young-earth creationism. The poofy magic of ""dust to man"" is not the accepted explanation of the actual occurrences, according to the Catholic church. Unlike you, I can read. I know that the suffix ""-less"" means. But I also know that books have text for a reason. You want to ignore the text. Why, marc, why? Why do you want to ignore the text of the book that you says uses its text to argue against all gods? Or are you saying that the text really doesn't argue all gods, but you have to lie and say that it does? Did I claim that it had ""no support""? I don't remember claiming that. There are a disgustingly large number of willfully scientifically ignorant religio-bots who throw away their money. Now, I'll say that there's no evidential support for their claims, but you know the saying: never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups. Another lie. You made a claim. I asked you to back it up. You are now REFUSING TO BACK UP YOUR CLAIM . Shameless. Pathetic. Dishonest. And you call yourself a good Christian, don't you? SUPPORT YOUR CLAIM. Just for the record, you'll find above where I supported my statements that you challenged. It's one thing for me to present a claim without evidence because I really don't think that you're clueless enough to deny its factual basis; it's another thing to just make stuff up. When you challenge, I support. When I challenge, you never support. I'd make a ratio out of that, but since you can't divide by zero without calculus, you probably won't understand that I support my points infinitely more often than do you. Above. That's just f***ing amazing. marc is actually arguing that we don't need to read the text of a book. Clearly, Kenneth Miller's book entitled Finding Darwin's God is about how Dr. Miller counted to 100, searched all over, and then finally saw God hiding behind a tree. No, Miller just showed no adherence to many of the beliefs that you have. Of course, that qualifies him as a closet atheist to you, but that's another issue that you seriously should seek professional help with. Really? You mean all of the evolution we've seen since 1850 hasn't really happened? The sun needs to be shining and the water cycle needs to proceed and DNA base pairs needs to bond, so is chemistry really a perversion of ""Darwinism""? Did Lavoisier have the secret backhanded intent of proving evolutionary theory with his chemistry research decades before Darwin was even born? Our understanding of first-order reaction rate laws clearly have been fudged in order to make radiometric dating give the dates we want, right marc? Even though the very same applications accurately describe every other first-order reaction? Gee, marc, why didn't you answer my other questions? Why does ""Darwinism"" rely upon cosmology? Why does ""Darwinism"" rely upon astronomy? WHY, MARC? Why won't you answer these questions, marc? Why won't you support your lies, marc? Another lie and another evasion. Even if it were true that I never once backed up a single point, it doesn't excuse you from the same standard of evidence. Why won't you answer these questions, marc? Why won't you support your lies, marc? Post the entire passage, marc. Go ahead. With a link so that everybody can see. Do it. I dare you. If you are right, then you should have no trouble showing that I seriously tried to make the case that you violate chickens. We're waiting. Where's the passage? Where's the link, marc? Where's the evidence? Where's the proof that you aren't a quote mining, slanderous liar? Why can't you prove that you're not a quote mining, slanderous liar? I learned to parody in my college logic course. I've told you about it many times. It's mentioned in my Introduction to Philosophy textbook as well. Say, did you enroll in a logic course like I asked you to? Did you ever get your hands on a logic book like I recommended? Not a lie, but a faulty -- albeit logical -- assumption. Somebody reported several of my posts that responded to you. admin told me to stop calling you names, so I explained that I made it clear in that post what I was doing. He gave me the OK, but I stopped anyway because I'll respect his wishes when they are reasonable. I'll retract my statement that you ran crying to admin. Look, if you want to proclaim that some little kid is beating you silly with the Truth Stick of No Mercy, feel free. I really don't see how that helps you. I'd be ashamed if one of my students took me to town on a subject of which I claim mastery in the same way that I'm slaughtering your every point. Parody is valid counterargument. Apparently I have my answer about the logic course. I wouldn't enjoy being humiliated if I were in your shoes, either. So does baseball fandom and the opposition of Met fans to the Yankees. Does that make baseball a religion, or does that just deify the Mets and the Yankees? Look, a complete evasion of the fact that you pretended that I said something that I didn't. You don't even have the intellectual integrity or honesty to fess up when you lie shamelessly. Equally importantly, your statement above makes no sense. You're scrambling so frantically to come up with any response that you're saying.. hell, I don't even know how one could believe evolution as an allegory. And dumbly overlooking the fact that Tiktaalik was found precisely where it was predicted by evolutionary theory to be doesn't seem to bother you, does it? You didn't do it once in that post. You're still claiming that books don't need pages. You refuse to post the context of the chickenlover statements. Uh.. You contradict yourself, you get called on it by multiple posters, and you claim that I 've made a stupid mistake? Hello? marc? Reality calling, pick up, marc, pick up... Did I object to the fact that you responded to an emotional post? No, I object to the fact that you're shamelessly dishonest. Are these two things even remotely analogous? No. So why are you trying to make this the issue? Because you're shamelessly dishonest! 39 is nothing but deceit. You pretended (lied) that AiG addresses creationism merely as a minor point and then used that misrepresentation to tie it to denominations in support of your earlier lie. In 59 you begin by again claiming that books need only a title and don't need pages. Where? Show proof. Show proof of every one of your accusations: 1. that atheism lies 2. that atheism lies habitually 3. that atheism lies for money 4. that atheism lies for public money 5. that atheism lies under the ruse of promoting evolution You just can't come up with anything original, can you? Can't respond substantively, can't provide any counterargument. All you can do is change a word here and there and pretend that you've created a parody. (And yet you deny that parody is a valid counterargument...) The problem, marc, is that a parody needs to be based on an accurate analogy. Unless you can show that ""atheism"" lies in these ways, the analogy doesn't exist.","only-one-god-does-exist-when-comes-politics-western-world","07:47 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","65"

You were asked to support this assertion. This is your response? I'd say you're holding your own. The main things 'lyte didn't provide links for are those he, and most others, would consider common sense; such as the rejection of YEC by Catholicism and the majority of other Christian denominations. Or, he could have, y'know, explained that it was a parody of your method of argument and that he was using it to demonstrate the absurdity of your approach. Wait, he did do that. Both in the original thread, and in the post above. Do you read what's posted at all Marc? What? Does this make sense to anyone at all besides Marc? OK, please explain the allegorical nature of evolution to us Marc. I'm waiting.

They also in no way address the points brought up, and any refutations or questions about your presented points are generally outright ignored. This does not ""drive us into a frenzy"", it makes us bang our heads in despair about the state of education in the US. Case in point. Here we have you stating that a large number of people, whom you have never met, are all habitual liars who are part of a vast conspiracy to bilk the world public out of large sums of money. You say this with a straight face, with absolutely no backing evidence. Let me reiterate: You claim a vast worldwide conspiracy to defraud the global public, a conspiracy which has been ongoing for the last 200 years and involves some of the brightest minds in the history of civilization. A conspiracy which involves people from all political and religious persuasions, and from all nationalities, and in the entire history of this conspiracy, there has been no actual ""leaks"" to confirm the existence of said conspirators.

"03-10-2008","11003",5,"None","None","None","Archangel","305161","Actually, anyones claim that Catholicism accepts Darwinism as it claims to accept evolution would be mistaken in their assumption according to this breakdown of the Popes speech. http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu4uF99....org/%3fp=1863 Here is an excerpt with the link: Pope Benedict XVI, dumb creationist? The purpose of our lives is to reveal God to men, he said, in St. Peters Square. And only where God is seen does life truly begin. . . . We are not some casual and meaningless product of evolution. Each of us is the result of a thought of God. Each of us is willed, each of us is loved, each of us is necessary. So what is the pope concerned about? What is the Vatican trying to do? . . . (The) church has moved from neutrality to something like acceptance of evolutionary theory, though drawing a thick bottom line that God is the ultimate creator. In 1996, Pope John Paul declared evolution more than a hypothesis, and in 2004 as Cardinal Ratzinger, Pope Benedict endorsed the scientific view that the earth is roughly four billion years old and that species changed through evolution. Indeed, there has been no credible scientific challenge to the idea that evolution, the foundation of modern biology, explains the diversity of life on earth. Given that history, scientists and church experts say they cannot imagine the study session ending with any alignment of the pope or the church with intelligent design or American-style creationism, which often posits that Earth is only about 6,000 years old. Once again, there is that infamous quote from the late Pope John Paul II, the quote that totally misses the point of this debate when seen from the point of view of Rome. Clearly, the Vatican accepts many ideas associated with the mechanisms of evolution, but, at the very least, the pope rejects the unprovable Darwinian doctrine that creation is the result of random and unguided changes. How would someone in a lab prove that changes are random? How could someone in a lab prove absolutely that they were guided and by whom? At some point, research must be interpreted. This is where science becomes philosophy and that is precisely where the Vatican debate is focused. You can tell that by reading what John Paul II actually said. Here is a section of a column I wrote on this topic for Scripps Howard News Service. I would bet the moon and the stars that this is the issue being discussed right now by the current pope and his students. Part of the problem is the 1996 papal address (by John Paul II) to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, with its familiar quotation that new knowledge leads us to recognize that the theory of evolution is more than a hypothesis. The question is whether John Paul said theory or theories. According to official translations, the pope said: Rather than the theory of evolution, we should speak of several theories of evolution. On the one hand, this plurality has to do with the different explanations advanced for the mechanism of evolution, and on the other, with the various philosophies on which it is based. The pope then rejected all theories arguing that humanity is the product of a random, unguided process of creation. Thus, he said that theories of evolution which, because of the philosophies which inspire them, regard the spirit either as emerging from the forces of living matter, or as a simple epiphenomenon of that matter, are incompatible with the truth about man. At the time John Paul II spoke these words, the National Association of Biology Teachers had officially defined evolution as an unsupervised, impersonal, unpredictable, and natural process . . . that is affected by natural selection, chance, historical contingencies and changing environments. Critics said this definition veered beyond science into theological speculation. Thus, in 1997 the associations board reversed itself and removed the words unsupervised and impersonal. This is where the debate must focus. It all comes back to that quite religious, doctrinaire statement by George Gaylord Simpson in the famous The Meaning of Evolution. That faith-based statement of naturalism is: Man is the result of a purposeless and natural process that did not have him in mind. Pope John Paul II disagreed. It appears that Benedict XVI does, too. Does that make this pope a stupid creationist? Does this put him on the wrong side of science? Stay tuned. On a side note. Isn't it interesting the the definition that the National Association of Biology Teachers had for evolution was exactly the same definition that I was just mercilessly attacked for insisting what the accepted definition was in another recent debate. Granted, the Board changed it in 97 due to political pressure within the scientific community, but that doesn't change the fact that only the words unsupervised and impersonal were removed. And here it is again. the National Association of Biology Teachers had officially defined evolution as an unsupervised, impersonal, unpredictable, and natural process . . . that is affected by natural selection.","only-one-god-does-exist-when-comes-politics-western-world","11:42 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","72"

Given your poor understanding of the topic, I am not surprised that you believe that scientism is the same as science. Scientism is a particular philosophy to which I do not ascribe. In fact, I don't recall ever having met a single scientist who did. Read carefully and you should be able to understand that the Pope was presenting the view of science held by the philosophy of scientism. That is not the view of science held by most scientists that I have known or read. Yes. In fact he is. But you aren't a spokesman for Protestantism. Further, the Catholic Church teaches that parts of the Bible are not historical. Some examples are Genesis, Job, Jonah, Psalms and others. The Catholic Church was embarrassed by taking literal positions about the Bible in the past - the earth is not immovable nor is it the center of the universe. The Catholic Church prefers to stick to positions about faith and morals today.
