And don't forget about exogenesis. Life did not necessarily start on Earth. How do you know that UV rays would have destroyed any organic matter? Do you know what molecules comprised the first reproducing molecules? Also, escaping UV rays is easy, you just have to go under a rock, beneath enough water, underground, etc. And also, since when does oxygen destroy organic matter? We breath oxygen and were just fine, right? And who told you oxygen was even present in primitive oceans? This one is beyond me. ATP is a molecule used to store energy the cell can use to metabolize. What's this about protons? And it doesn't do well in soup? And again, who told you the first reproducing, metabolizing life was in the form of cells? Necessary for a modern functional cell. You don't know what life looked like 3.5 billion years ago. It eventually became dominated by cells, but certainly didn't start with the cell. No theory of abiogenesis claims that it did. If anything, abiogenesis is dependent on evolution. Evolution explains the diversity of life. It does suggest abiogenesis, just as an expanding universe suggests the Big Bang, but it does not require it. That is not scientific and your logic is not sound. Even if your premises were correct, not based on a misunderstanding of what life is and what it most likely was in the past, even if you had a lick of chemistry supporting your other claims, your logic still would not follow.","origin-life","09:58 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","3"

"02-25-2013","22372",1,"TeaAddict","470768","One big problem with exogenesis is that it would have the same problems with this version of abiogenesis. Because thats what UV rays do. We use UV to sterilize, killing bacteria. UV from the sun burns our skin, giving us greater risk of skin cancer. UV is destructive to organic matter. But whatever life cam about, had to be complex enough to survive and reproduce. These things, in themselves, are complex, and The reason we can breathe the air is because we have antioxidants in our bodies. Antioxidants are molecules that prevent our cells from being destroyed by the oxidation process. Without antioxidants, our cells would be destroyed by the oxygen in the air and water, much the same way as metal rusts. So the primordial soup is stuck between a rock and a hard space, as it were: If there was oxygen in the atmosphere, the earliest organic matter would have been destroyed (because a pile of amino acids wouldnt have antioxidants). But if there was no oxygen in the atmosphere, there would have been no ozone layer protecting the surface of the earth from the suns UV. Our skin cells are susceptible to cancer when exposed to long term UV WITH an Ozone layer. What would it be like for the primordial cells WITHOUT one? If there was no oxygen in earths oceans, then they wouldnt have been water. Because water molecules have 1 oxygen atom. Thats why metal rusts in water. Going underwater wouldnt work, for the reason stated above. Under a rock doesnt make much sense either. That rock would have to remain steady for hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of years. Earthquakes, erosion, etc. would threaten to destroy/knock down the rock, and possibly expose the soup. We must also consider the possibility that, depending on where the soup was, the environment could have been very hot even if the sun wasnt shining directly on the soup. The liquid could have evaporated before anything could have formed. A million years is a looooooong time for a puddle of goo to sit around, safe from the environment.","Databed","470777","Yes, except that it doesn't occur on Earth. So all the below supposed problems go away. You don't know what UV rays did to the first life on Earth because you don't even know what it is composed of. Nobody does. It was most likely a precursor to modern RNA or DNA, but much more simple and much less susceptible to damage. It is possible and quite probable that the first lifeforms to see the Sun were dependent on its UV radiation, just as many organisms, including ourselves, are today. You want to complete your thought here? You have no idea what role oxidation played in the first life since you don't know what the first life was. Oxidation at some point became necessary for life just as it is in every oxygen dependent life form on Earth today. Oxidation keeps us alive. Yes, we have antioxidants to keep the process in check, but antioxidants do not entirely prevent oxidation in our bodies. If they did, we would die. Just as last time, your logic is flawed. You have assumed that life was in the past just as it is today. That's not what evolution says. It says life changes with changing environment. Just because you have devised an environment lethal to today's life (although bacteria and simple lifeforms would quickly re-adapt), doesn't mean you have devised a scenario lethal to all iterations of life. Well, since single celled organisms by definition don't develop cancer, it would be a non-issue. Metal requires water and oxygen to rust. Just water won't do. Go back to the books - look at basic corrosion. Also, when I say oxygen in this context, just as anyone else who knows ANYTHING, I am referring to free oxygen. Not oxygen locked up in water molecules. You do not have a grasp on this science at all. Let's say that one photon kills a bacterium. Bacteria would STILL thrive on this planet. Lets says one photon, or being exposed to a certain non-zero concentration of free oxygen kills a bacterium. Same result. There are so many ways to metabolize and so many environments to exist in, your scenario just can't account for it all. So basically, by this logic, there shouldn't be any fish on the planet. Really there shouldn't even be water except in the form of vapor.","origin-life","09:15 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","12"

Not only is that the obvious counter, but then you go on to say life was dependent on UV radiation. No, sorry he is right that if radiation of the correct wave length penetrates to the nucleus of a cell without being canceled it destroys DNA.

Not only is this easy to counter due to the ease at which you can escape the radiation, at some point life began to use this radiation as an energy source to convert low energy molecules to a higher state. It is not unreasonable to postulate that this happened very early. I'm not claiming that it did, I'm just using this to counter his claim that UV radiation is necessarily damaging to any theory of abiogenesis. The first life had nothing to do with cells. There is no theory of abiogenesis that postulates that a cell was first. I am not sure why we keep bringing up cells. The fact is, we do not know what the first life was composed of, but there is a good chance that it was a simple self replicating molecule that we would not even recognize as life to day. How you can sit here and claim that such a molecule (because you know so much about it) could not exist on Earth due to UV radiation is beyond me. What else do you expect me to do? There were no surveillance devices back there that I can just go and dig up. These molecules and early life forms are long decomposed and there are no remnants of them left, and we would not expect there to be. You are the one that is using the lack of evidence for as proof against . An appeal to ignorance on my part is only to counter your claim of absolute certainty based on this same lack of knowledge. YOU are the one being unreasonable. No, self replicating and capable of evolving - that's all it takes. And what is this 'without chemistry?' You just made that up. No, they couldn't. Spaghetti monsters do not make sense. What does make sense is that they were precursors to RNA or DNA and self replicating. Maybe a strand of proto-RNA formed that coded for the enzyme that would sometimes help to roughly duplicate it. The process could get its energy from chemosynthesis, which back then would have been as simple as breaking down a loosely bonded molecule ejected by thermal vents deep in the ocean, away from any chance of oxidation or UV degradation. As soon as that one molecule just happened to form, both the enzyme and the proto-RNA would explode in population. Soon, due to all the errors since this was a primitive version, many new versions would appear. Every once in a while a better version would appear. The process becomes more efficient and more precise as the iterations continue. Clearly, abiogenesis is more dependent on evolution than evolution is dependent on abiogenesis as every possible abiogenesis story will necessarily involve descent with improvement. Now, all this being said, can you find anything in the previous paragraph that is impossible?? No you can't. Therefore, when you say abiogenesis is impossible, and this is why, you are wrong because my story could be true. Okay, Einstein - show me where I said there was no free oxygen in the oceans. What I did ask is how Tea Addict knew there was oxygen in the primordial atmosphere. The fact is, since oxygen does oxidize so readily, it took early life to free that oxygen. You are claiming that life had to exist within the top few feet of a pool of crystal clear water that must be easily penetrable by UV radiation and that there must be an extremely high concentration of oxygen dissolved in that water - enough to melt away any organic molecule immediately. I do realize that you did not bring up chemosynthesis in hopes that I would not either. The fact is, I didn't think I would need to, but if you are going to claim that my previous paragraph must follow based on your omniscient view of the way things had to unfold on primordial Earth, I will just remove the Sun and free oxygen from the equation completely.","origin-life","10:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","15"

It is also possible that we are the result of some alien poop that traveled here on a rogue asteroid, but there is also no evidence for that.

I will assume that you cannot, and are just intellectually dishonest. It would have been so easy just to admit it. Anyway, back to your little game. I do accept that it is possible that aliens may be, purposefully or accidentally, our creators. I have already explained why, but I will repeat myself for your benefit. We know that there is life on this planet (in as far as we can know anything). This can be regarded as evidence. This planet has an unusual set of conditions, size, orbit, type of star etc, that happens to be fairly good at supporting life (at least life as we know it). This can be regarded as evidence. We also know that there are many other planets in this galaxy that have similar size, orbit, star etc, so there is a reasonable possibility that they may also be inhabited. The existence of these planets may also be regarded as evidence. So I believe that it is possible that there is life on these planets. However, it would be silly to say that I believe that there is life on these planets, until actual evidence of this life is observed. It is conceivable that the life on one of these other planets seeded the life on our own. However, it would be wrong to believe it to be true until actual evidence for it is observed. I also do accept that god may be our creator. There is no evidence of this, but it is 'possible'. So, you are wrong when you claim that there is no physical evidence for or against either of the theories. So, it would also be fair to say of you that you do not want to believe in Allah, because you don't want to follow any rules. And by rules I mean those laid down in the Quran. I would also hazard a guess that there are plenty of rules laid down in the bible to which you choose not to adhere. So, we are probably fairly even on that score. Why do I have to come up with something to believe when it comes to my origins? Is it not enough to say that I do not yet know, but will continue to search for an answer? Theist viewpoint? I don't know everything, but I feel I must have an answer, so I will believe in something that I cannot possibly truly comprehend. Anything I don't know can be laid at his door, and I will need look know further as I can claim that I already know the truth. Simple, but stupid. Atheist viewpoint? I do not know everything, but I am quite prepared to admit that I don't know some things rather than inventing a non-answer to assuage my fear of the unknown. However, I will continue to investigate that which I don't yet know. So far there is no evidence for a god, so I do not believe in it. If I find evidence for god then would be the time to start believing, with further investigation, of course.

First you postulate that a being existed and created everything that we see round us ex nihilo and then that things didn't work out the way he had planned because he had created some of his angels badly enough that they rebelled against him becoming Satan and his devils. Then he created man, placed him in the garden, and put a tree there for him to eat knowing full well that he would eat of it. Obviously had God simply wanted Adam to stay in the garden and not eat the tree, he could have never created the tree, created it on another planet, or half-way round the world. So God obviously planned for the tree to be eaten of, and so then the Fall came into being, he having pre-prepared a way to save man from the sin of his fathers namely that God himself would be born and live a mortal life and be crucified on a cross in order to pay for the sins of another. This is clearly contrary to anything because if someone does wrong the only justice is that the person who has done wrong is punished. Punishing someone else never alleviates the wrongdoing of another. And then God chooses to save only some people, and not others, when he created the spirit that dwells within us in the form that it is so clearly if someone sins and fails to repent the fault is with God for not having created a more contrite spirit. Then you go on insisting that God is a spirit when the Bible clearly indicates that God was born into a physical body, died, and regained that physical body complete with flesh and bones (Luke 24:39).

We cannot fully understand him, and that we cannot interpret him, or existence, perfectly. So we go astray, and make mistakes. But when we try, we can understand him a little better, and it makes more sense. Its free will, not negatively inclined will! Free will means you can choose to take the wrong path or the right one. God gave us a free will, giving us the choice.","Apostle","471185","If men were made imperfect, then they should not be trusted with a choice as heaven or hell. We are not responsible enough to handle a choice that has everlasting consequences, especially in an existence as uncertain as this, and especially as fallible as we are. The consequences seem to presuppose that human beings are perfectly well reasoned and infinitely knowledgeable, that their decisions are so perfectly well made that the repercussions can be suitably infinite in nature. If there is one man who regrets his eternal ""decision"", then it wasn't a perfectly made choice suitable of the consequence. It was a mistake. Sorry, didn't mean to tangent. In any case, God's hackjob of mankind would directly make Himself imperfect, but I guess that leads into the this particular defense... What else is a ""will"" if not an inclination? Either positive or negative? Left or right? Right or wrong? I can't simply accept the word ""choice"" and then just leave the questions at that. An explanation of why perfectly free agents are making wrong decisions over right decisions is required, in a way that doesn't trace its reasoning back to God Himself. A perfectly free will, as I understand it, is an inclination that is completely free of physical and mental constraints. An inclination that is perfectly free to do what is in its nature to do. If that's the case, as I understand it, then that must mean that the free will, or inclination, of some people are indeed negative in their nature.

The complexity of life, the complexity of the universe, the complexity of the Human mind ,and other things, dont suggest a randomly forming existence. You dont look at your computer, with its hardware and software, and think this must have evolved on its own from random processes, it obviously has been created. Yes, it is easier to just mumble I dont know when you dont like the answer, isnt it? It has nothing to do with how God created them. They made a choice. They had/have free will, and they chose to rebel. This is a remarkably silly argument. Jesus CHOSE to die for our sins, because he loved us. And note: God does not force this salvation on us. We can choose to accept his gift, or not to. If we choose not to accept Jesuss taking our punishment, we must take our punishment ourselves.","Dani","471202",". You surprise me because every Christian I have ever know, both in life and on forums seems to know everything about this mysterious 'god'. They know what he likes and doesn't like, what he means and doesn't mean, what he is/isn't thinking, who he is going to save or not save and what he is going to do and when he is going to do it. So you are pretty much saying that because you don't understand these things, the only answer is that 'god must have done it'. Ah yes...that old Christian favourite ""The Watchmaker Analogy"". The reason we know that computers and their components are created is because we know that computer and their components do not occur naturally...unlike seas, mountains, trees, flowers etc...which DO all occur naturally. It's intellectually honest to mumble ' I don't know' when you don't know. It has everything to do with how your god created them (assuming that he did for the sake of the discussion of course). He created them knowing that they would fall...it was 'programmed' into them from the start. If your god had not wanted them to fall then he would have made it so they could not fall but he didn't. The only logical conclusion is that he wanted them to fall and planned for them to fall. They did EXACTLY what your god wanted and planned for them to do. We need evidence for the existence of your Jesus The Christ. Existence is primary. What he did or did not do is secondary. If that is the case then it isn't a ""gift"" is it? A gift is something that is FREELY given and has no conditions attached to it. If I give you $10 with no conditions attached, that is a gift. If I offer you $10 but say that you have wash my car for in order to get it, I'm not giving you a gift...I'm offering you a transaction. In the same way, if your god offers us 'eternal life' whether we believe in him or not then that would be a gift.

But you try to reason that Zeus and Yahweh are mutually exclusive so they can't both exist. This is not true. It is entirely possible (pretty likely even) that God could exist and be unknown and imcomprehensible by even his most devout followers. Really how many Christians on debate boards like this do you think actually sat down and even had a chat with Jesus for 15 minutes about anything - even the weather. Since they haven't, how could they possibly know what he thought about anything? Even Paul, the guy who ran around convincing everyone to be Christian and whose letters make up the greater part of the Bible only saw Jesus once and the only thing Jesus said to him was, ""Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks."" What logic are you using out of that to reason that Yahweh is inconsistent with Zeus? Pricks referring to the other gods, I suppose, and it being difficult implying that rejection was mandated or something? I guess if you torture a saying long enough it will reveal whatever you want it to say. Personally, though, I'm not convinced. Now maybe if I was walking along and saw a burning bush that was not being consumed I might change my mind, after I cleaned the XXXX out of my shorts and took my shoes off.

Plus if you want to use this tortured logic to try to justify anything why not apply it to your own situation? Since evolution is just one theory out of hundreds of possible creators of the world (Yahweh, Brahma, Woden, etc.) then if we assume that there are 999 identifiable religions then the chance of evolution having occurred is 1/1000 so pretty stinking unlikely.

You might say, ""Well, the eye has 6 muscles and only 3 are needed so that proves the eye wasn't designed."" Really, however, this proves nothing at all. You might as well say that a Ferrari wasn't designed since it has 12 cylinders and a car can run just fine on 3 or 4 of them. Does this prove the car wasn't designed? No, it doesn't prove anything at all. Now it's time for a remedial philosophy class. Let's get an introduction to Hempel's (Raven) paradox. From Logical Paradoxes Hempels Ravens If two statements are logically equivalent, if they assert exactly the same thing, then any evidence for one is evidence for the other. This principle appears to be truism. Consider the two statements Terry and Judith are my parents and I am Terry and Judiths child. These statements are logically equivalent, they say the same thing. There is no evidence that would support one of them without supporting the other. The Hempels Ravens paradox uses the principle to prove the absurd conclusion that an observation of a green parrot is evidence that ravens are black. The only way of avoiding this clearly unacceptable conclusion is to reject the principle above. The paradox goes like this: Consider the two statements: (1) All ravens are black. (2) Everything that isnt black, isnt a raven. These two statements say exactly the same thing. The first statement says that everything of a particular kind has a certain property. The second statement says that everything that lacks that property isnt of that kind. The two statements are therefore logically equivalent; they are true and false in exactly the same circumstances. If there is anything that is a raven but isnt black then both (1) and (2) are false; oherwise, they are both true. As the two statements are logically equivalent, any observation that supports one will also support the other. Suppose, then, that I observe a green parrot. This observation confirms (2), Everything that isnt black isnt a raven. A green parrot isnt black and isnt a raven. The observation is evidence that (2) is true. Given what has been said so far, my observation of a green parrot must also confirm (1). (1) and (2) are logically equivalent, so any evidence for one is evidence for the other. My observation of a green parrot, then, is evidence for the statement, All ravens are black. In fact, any observation of something that isnt black and isnt a raven is evidence that ravens are black. --------------------- In conclusion: As long as you think that finding black ravens makes it more likely that all ravens are black you must also accept that finding green parrots similarly increases the probability.","origin-life","12:00 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","92"
"03-11-2013","22372",7,"TeaAddict","471171","It is possible that the tree of life HAD to be in the Garden of Eden. Who knows, without it, it might not have even been Eden. This is a remarkably silly argument. Jesus CHOSE to die for our sins, because he loved us. Jesus wasnt forced into it, he references several times in the Gospels that he was doing it for us because he didnt want us to be punished. He would rather take the punishment. And note: God does not force this salvation on us. We can choose to accept his gift, or not to. If we choose not to accept Jesuss taking our punishment, we must take our punishment ourselves. Again, another silly argument. What makes you think God is choosing who is saved and who isnt? The choice is OURS, and ours entirely. Why would you expect God to force salvation on us if we didnt want it? Apparently, you dont know a thing about God or what the Bible says about him. You should research a subject a little more before you try debate about it. Jesus, who is one-third of God, came down to earth, became flesh, and remained that way. The whole of God is not flesh and bone, but Jesus is.","Zosimus","471260","So basically you are saying that an all-powerful God was incapable of creating Eden without putting a specific bad tree into it? That sounds suspiciously like you're saying God isn't omnipotent. So since Jesus died for your sins, what's to stop me from doing the same for my kids? Screw belief in Jesus, kids, I'm gonna get nailed to a tree on your behalf and I'll let you into heaven whether you have faith in me or not! So now you say that Jesus is one-third God. Does that mean he's only 33% infallible? Or do you mean to say that Jesus is one God of three? Or do you want to say that Jesus is entirely God but in some paradoxical way is also entirely man?

"03-11-2013","22372",7,"Dani","471199","Clearly not as poor as yours. Of course they could but it wouldn't make it true unless they could provide verifiable evidence to support their claim. I could just as easily say ""We exist, but we were not created. We have always existed but before we were humans, we existed as invisible pink fairies."" Do you think my claim should stand as true? No I didn't. I said that I THINK it highly unlikely. That is my belief. I trust you understand the difference between giving one's beliefs and making a statement? The 'Negative Evidence Principle' Do you think that the likelihood of mermaids, pixies, leprechauns, Zeus, Apollo, Mithra and a thousand other gods that people do or have believed in is also 50%? That's right. If I don't know I say 'I don't know but I believe it to be true based on the available evidence'. I find it far more intellectually honest that making up stories, claiming the stories are true and threatening anyone that does not accept that my stories are true. I deride my opponents for putting forward belief as truth without being able to show that it is true.","Zosimus","471262","The negative evidence principle argues that not having evidence for a claim is a reason to believe that the claim is false. You have put forward no evidence in support of the negative evidence principle therefore in accordance with the same principle, I conclude that it is false and, indeed, self-refuting. Yes, I do think that the likelihood of mermaids, pixies, leprechauns, Zeus, Apollo, Mithria, and a thousand other gods is also 50 percent. So then, when people ask me, I say ""I don't know."" I think that's a much better solution than pretending that I know when I don't. You say that you think it's unlikely. So basically you're saying that your belief is arational? What makes you even think that there is a way to show that a proposition is true? If theory T predicts evidence E why do you think that finding evidence E confirms the theory?

"03-11-2013","22372",7,"Zosimus","471258","Yes, now you're getting it! That's what being agnostic is all about. I can't say that Abraham's God doesn't exist, or Zeus, or Thor, or Vishnu. Since I don't know I comfortably and confidently say so. But you try to reason that Zeus and Yahweh are mutually exclusive so they can't both exist. This is not true. It is entirely possible (pretty likely even) that God could exist and be unknown and imcomprehensible by even his most devout followers. Really how many Christians on debate boards like this do you think actually sat down and even had a chat with Jesus for 15 minutes about anything - even the weather. Since they haven't, how could they possibly know what he thought about anything? Even Paul, the guy who ran around convincing everyone to be Christian and whose letters make up the greater part of the Bible only saw Jesus once and the only thing Jesus said to him was, ""Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks."" What logic are you using out of that to reason that Yahweh is inconsistent with Zeus? Pricks referring to the other gods, I suppose, and it being difficult implying that rejection was mandated or something? I guess if you torture a saying long enough it will reveal whatever you want it to say. Personally, though, I'm not convinced. Now maybe if I was walking along and saw a burning bush that was not being consumed I might change my mind, after I cleaned the XXXX out of my shorts and took my shoes off. Hell I might even take a stick into Egypt as long as he let me take one of my relatives as a mouthpiece but not before. No thank you - I'm not into false dichotomies. Plus if you want to use this tortured logic to try to justify anything why not apply it to your own situation? Since evolution is just one theory out of hundreds of possible creators of the world (Yahweh, Brahma, Woden, etc.) then if we assume that there are 999 identifiable religions then the chance of evolution having occurred is 1/1000 so pretty stinking unlikely. So it's funny that you use your logic on others, but squawk when it gets applied back to you. Are you saying that not accepting an assertion with no evidence is an extreme position? But anyway, let's say for the moment that the chance of Yahweh existing is 50/50. Would you agree that the same can be said for Zeus? If so, we have to ask ourselves if it is possible for both Zues and Yahweh to exist, or are they mutually exclusive. If they could both exist then we are still stuck at 50/50 for both of them, but if they are mutually exclusive, then we have 3 possibilities, Yahweh, Zeus, or neither. Now we have knocked the probability down to 1/3, with no further examination. Next we can consider Zoroaster. If this god has a 50/50 chance of existence, we should then ask if his existence would preclude one or both of the other two. So what probability would he have? After we have considered the same for all the Norse, Roman, Greek, Celtic, Japanese, Chinese, Hawaiian, Polynesian, Slavic, Native American, Native Australian gods (my apologies for any gods excluded or duplicated), what would the probability for each be? And even if we manage to work out the probability what would that tell us about the veracity of each one? And would it be reasonable to believe in all, some or one of them with zero actual evidence to back up our belief?","smiley","471271","I will make this brief You, yet again, seem unable to honestly report what I actually said. I did not reason that Yahweh and Zeus were mutually exclusive. Try reading it again. I will highlight the relevant part to assist you.

There is no process, aside from biological metabolism, to free the oxygen that so readily combines with other elements and molecules to the scale that you would need to begin destroying organic matter. It took life to come about to provide for the free oxygen that you claim is so detrimental to organic matter. This means that life had to take hold first, thus there would necessarily from the very beginning have been a natural balance, or at least a limit for life to overcome that kept oxidation in check. It is easily conceivable that evolution can find a solution for an ever increasing oxygen rich environment, most likely a very slow process that is kept in check by it's own dependence on the life which it has an affinity to destroy. This is what I am trying to get at. Oxygen can't just magically free itself from the bonds it so readily seeks, the process which is crucial to your argument. Therefore, you can't have it both ways at the point of abiogenesis. You can't necessarily have an extremely delicate first version of life that has to survive in an oxidizing environment and the total lack of any process to lead to an oxidizing environment at the same time. It took time to develop, and this would easily have been enough time for life to find a way. As for your UV radiation paradox, this I don't even need to deal with.

Peter Higgs, the now 83-year-old physicist who first theorized the boson's existence 48 years ago, actually frowns upon the term.

Unfortunately though i haven't won the lottery, married Mila Kunis, won the Nobel prize in Medicine for developing a cure for Cancer & Aids at the same time or discovered the first Earth like extra-solar planet. If only wishing made it true. We have to deal with the facts, and the lack of current knowledge doesn't presuppose a gods intervention. We have never witnessed life's creation, it may well be all over the universe and extremely common. We may look back in a hundred years and wonder why we missed it, being so simple. I can appreciate the poetry, the stories and the intended lessons. I cant appreciate the outdated explanations and obviously wildly inaccurate statements which have no bearing to what we know. In reference to the spontaneity of it, the clustering of organic compounds and amino acids is well documented. the actions of life we can test. but many of the complex questions. Such as the the moment a proto-cell starts to reproduce, the construction of the cell wall matrix, the acquisition of mitochondria into the cell (itself a separate organism) are the points up for debate. If the odds of life in the universe are high then it makes more sense that life was seeded by comet or meteorite, at least in probability factors. It may well be that we are arguing about a defunct point, that life was seeded here by comet and it never spontaneously erupted in the first place. Though this would lead irrevocably to the next argument. How did life start on that planet then? Perhaps different elements, higher levels of organic compound, different environmental and atmospheric conditions, Obviously all theory. For the moment at least. That life started here 4.1 billion years ago shows it can exist, if it exists here then the odds of it existing elsewhere are monumental.

It doesn't answer anything it is just speculation What is the point ? The point is: this reductionist science has been unable to fill the gap between matter and living matter. Where is the property of ""life"" ? and better don't ask where is the property of intelligence, consciousness et cetera. So my question to Peeling is show me where in matter is the property or properties that transform matter into a living organism? where is the formula? what are the ingredients? what is the recipe? what is the oven? metaphorically speaking that is. is life a property of matter or not? and if yes then show me what it is and where it resides.

Of course I know that. It was an analogy not a literal example and you know it. Your 'analogy' is misleading and evasive. I am not asking if and how life evolved. I am asking you how can atoms whose properties we know, came to form living matter. Where is the organizing property in them? and if it is not in them where is it? And once they organized into living things they replicated again and again and also evolved. But, forget the evolution of life. I am just focusing in that little difference, that little gap between living matter and non-living matter and that little gap is still unfilled. So please fill it. You are simply saying that if you shake the box long enough the particles will become alive. But the shaking enables something that must be intrinsic in them.

You can't isolate the property of 'being like a wheel' by breaking a wheel apart and looking at the bits. 'Being like a wheel' is a name for the physical behaviour that naturally emerges when matter is in a particular shape. Similarly, it makes no sense to ask whether we'll find the spark of life by taking something that is 'being alive' and breaking it apart, because there is no spark .

Again, reporting is not explaining The replicating system actually involves two enzymes, each composed of two subunits and each functioning as a catalyst that assembles the other. The replication process is cyclic, in that the first enzyme binds the two subunits that comprise the second enzyme and joins them to make a new copy of the second enzyme; while the second enzyme similarly binds and joins the two subunits that comprise the first enzyme. In this way the two enzymes assemble each otherwhat is termed cross-replication. To make the process proceed indefinitely requires only a small starting amount of the two enzymes and a steady supply of the subunits. conditions do not create.

You have proven to me this: you are arrogant in your ignorance and you are dishonest in your arguing.","Peeling","473619","It's really not Look: We inspect an object. We label it 'round'. We see a solid/gas boundary that is non-perpendicular to the local gravity and we label it a 'slope'. We watch what happens when physical forces act upon the 'round' object resting on the 'slope', and we label that 'rolling'. Now, can we take the 'round' object apart, look at the atoms and find some essence of 'rolling' in there? Of course not. The individual atoms are not rolling. When we say 'that ball is rolling down a slope' it's shorthand for ""Atom 1 is moving in this direction, atom 2 is moving in that direction..."" and so on. I've written a few physics simulations (for fun and profit) that use points connected by springs. The points have no concept of rotation, only of position and velocity. Nor do the springs - they only care about distance. Yet if I set up a circular pattern of points and connect them with springs, it'll happily roll down a slope, because 'rolling' is a behaviour that emerges from the underlying forces. I didn't need to 'program in' rolling. It's exactly the same with life. When you zoom way, way in and look at what individual molecules are doing, they're each just obeying the same laws of physics as everything else: moving, bonding and so forth. The aggregate effect of those motions, we've labelled 'life'. Ok, let's start with a quote from an article about one lab experiment: The first thing to get our heads around is what a catalyst does. When I was at school I was given the simple version: catalysts speed up reactions. The more accurate and interesting way to think about catalysts is that they make individual molecular reactions more likely , and they do so in a surprisingly straightforward and mechanical way. Remember when I talked about how the molecules in your cells are flying around smacking into each other billions of times a second? Well, in the experiment quoted above, you've got a solution containing billions of copies of four different molecules (call them A, B, C and D), and those molecules are whizzing around banging into each other. Now, if A and B happen to bang into each other in just the right way, they'll bond to form a larger molecule AB. Just chemistry; nothing unusual. The same is true for molecules C and D, making CD. But at low energies (temperatures), it's hugely unlikely these reactions will occur. Ok so far? The interesting part is that this particular molecule AB attracts passing C and D molecules. And just as two magnets will orient themselves and clamp together when they get close, AB's shape and chemical bonds pull in and spin C and D molecules such that they line up in precisely the right way to 'click together' and form CD. And as they click together, they detach from AB, leaving AB free to pull in and bond more C and D molecules. So AB 'manufactures' CD out of a mixed solution of C and D. Again, this is perfectly straightforward chemistry and physics; the sort of thing we make use of all the time in manufacturing. But CD also performs the reverse: it pulls in, orients and 'clicks together' A and B molecules. So in this case the two molecules replicate each other - not strictly 'self replication' but the end result is the same: AB/CD makes more AB/CD. Obviously to get the ball rolling you need a first molecule of AB or CD. But the formation of AB without CD's assistance isn't impossible , it might just take an unusual jolt of energy (eg an electric spark) to make it likely. And once you've got AB, you're away. In the experiment the scientists deliberately seeded the solution with some AB/CD, but that's just for experimental convenience. The upshot is, there are two things we don't know with regards to organic chemistry: 1. We don't know what the first replicating molecules actually were, in terms of their detailed chemical structure. We know amino acids are naturally occurring, we can make some educated guesses about the kind of molecules involved (eg RNA), but it's entirely possible the specific molecules (which after all had a test tube the size of the universe and hundreds of millions of years in which to jostle) may never be known. 2. We're still working on understanding why the basic laws of physics are what they are. But that's the same mystery we see when we look at the sun, or a black hole, or anything else. But there is no mystery at all as to how or why 'living' molecules behave as they do: they behave just like any other molecule: whizzing around, encountering other molecules and catalysing reactions. It just so happens that the reactions they catalyse are circular : they feed back upon themselves. In the lab example above it's a simple back-and-forth tick-tock: AB makes CD, CD makes AB, and they do so by just banging into raw materials drifting in solution. In you and I, we see the result of a two-billion-year arms race, where molecules that are more successful at gathering raw materials and closing the loop of their chemical reactions have prospered. My personal chemical reaction took 32 years to cycle - that's when my daughter was born Does that help? You're quite right; that was a slip. I should have said: ""And then there are just a few starting conditions from which the laws of physics derive complex non-repeating patterns - life"" Well, here's what you said: ""so matter just became alive? where in matter is this property found, maybe if we keep splitting and splittng matter will find it one day ? "" Suppose I asked you: ""So that shape just began to roll? Where in matter is this 'rolling' property found? Maybe if we keep splitting and splitting matter we'll find it one day."" You would quite rightly tell me it was a silly question. Why? Because 'rolling' is not a fundamental property of matter. It's a label for the aggregate motion of many molecules, something which by definition cannot be found by inspecting them individually. Similarly, life is not a fundamental property - of matter or anything else. It is an emergent behaviour - and if I can forestall your objection, 'emergent behaviour' isn't just another way of saying 'it appears from nowhere with no explanation."" Emergent describes behaviour implicit in a set of rules rather than explicit ; something that happens when the rules are applied which one could not predict by inspection of the rules themselves. (As an aside, it is mathematically demonstrable that the outcome of many iterative processes cannot be predicted - not in the sense that their outcome is uncertain or different each time, but in that there is no equation into which you can plug a time T and yield a result - the only way to find out what happens at time T is to actually simulate the iterations of the process up to that point. It is impossible, for instance, to deduce the beautiful complexity of the Mandlebrot Set by simple inspection of the function which generates it.) In my physics simulations, rolling behaviour was implicit in the entirely linear rule-set of forces. I didn't realise this when I wrote the first one (I think I was maybe 12 at the time), and spent ages vainly trying to code in 'spinning'. It was only when I gave up, took the mess of equations out, and just gave my springy cube a linear nudge at one of it's corners that I noticed it span perfectly well all on its own. I'm disappointed you think that. I have certainly not been dishonest - if I have come across as arrogant I apologise.

I understand that Abiogenesis is a separate field from evolution, but considering everything (including life) must have an origin, and Abiogenesis is a theory attempting to explain the origin of life, I think it deserves to be discussed. So one theory of Abiogenesis states that the Earth's atmosphere, approximately 3.5 billion years ago, produced organic compounds when exposed to energy. These organic molecules accumulated into a pool, and eventually formed more complex organic compounds, which eventually formed life. There are several problems which are pretty lethal to this theory. 1: The Ultraviolet rays from the sun would have destroyed any organic matter. Considering there was no oxygen in the atmosphere at the time, and therefore no ozone, there would have been no protection. Some have suggested that the spark of life started in the ocean, but this would seem impossible considering the oxygen in the water would have destroyed any organic matter. 2: The production of Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the molecules that fuel cells, requires protons to be densely packed and separated out. This could not happen in a ""soup"" mixture. 3: It is highly improbable that random organic molecules could have formed sufficient DNA, RNA, Proteins, etc. that would be necessary for a functional cell. Although evolution is a separate study from Abiogenesis, evolution is dependent on Abiogenesis: if life cant start, it cant evolve. Therefore, is Abiogenesis is so unlikely, the Theory of Evolution is also unlikely.
