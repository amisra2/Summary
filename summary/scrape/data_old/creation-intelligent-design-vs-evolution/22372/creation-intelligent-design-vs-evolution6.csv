We cannot fully understand him, and that we cannot interpret him, or existence, perfectly. So we go astray, and make mistakes. But when we try, we can understand him a little better, and it makes more sense. Its free will, not negatively inclined will! Free will means you can choose to take the wrong path or the right one. God gave us a free will, giving us the choice.","Apostle","471185","If men were made imperfect, then they should not be trusted with a choice as heaven or hell. We are not responsible enough to handle a choice that has everlasting consequences, especially in an existence as uncertain as this, and especially as fallible as we are. The consequences seem to presuppose that human beings are perfectly well reasoned and infinitely knowledgeable, that their decisions are so perfectly well made that the repercussions can be suitably infinite in nature. If there is one man who regrets his eternal ""decision"", then it wasn't a perfectly made choice suitable of the consequence. It was a mistake. Sorry, didn't mean to tangent. In any case, God's hackjob of mankind would directly make Himself imperfect, but I guess that leads into the this particular defense... What else is a ""will"" if not an inclination? Either positive or negative? Left or right? Right or wrong? I can't simply accept the word ""choice"" and then just leave the questions at that. An explanation of why perfectly free agents are making wrong decisions over right decisions is required, in a way that doesn't trace its reasoning back to God Himself. A perfectly free will, as I understand it, is an inclination that is completely free of physical and mental constraints. An inclination that is perfectly free to do what is in its nature to do. If that's the case, as I understand it, then that must mean that the free will, or inclination, of some people are indeed negative in their nature. Free, yes, but free to be negative, as they are designed. What other explanation is there? I think I'll open up a new thread about this sometime. This a pretty critical point to explore.","origin-life","01:11 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","76"
"03-09-2013","22372",6,"Apostle","471137","Originally Posted by Easyrider Tell us, how do you obtain a perfect universe when you create man with free will so he can be a free moral agent to sin or not sin? Why does one ""free agent"" make one choice while another ""free agent"" makes a wrong one? Free agent A God, the right path, yet free agent B chooses sin, the wrong path. Why? Was B simply given a free will that was negatively inclined? In any case, I don't think I understand the original question...","Easyrider","471186","My point was that you can't have the perfect universe you think God should be manifesting unless you create pre-programmed robots who can only do good.

"03-09-2013","22372",6,"Zosimus","471107","Your argument is poor. First of all anyone could simply say, ""We exist, therefore we were created."" Second, you claim that it is highly unlikely that God exists. I would like to know how you have calculated the possibility of God's (any version) existence. Since no evidence can be mustered either way it seems to me that the chance of God existing is stuck firmly at 50 percent. Finally, I assume you believe in a Big Bang (despite the theory having been refuted). Yet you do not know what caused the big bang or the singularity that it supposedly came from. Yet you deride your opponents for saying that God exists and not knowing where he (it) came from.","Dani","471199","Clearly not as poor as yours. Of course they could but it wouldn't make it true unless they could provide verifiable evidence to support their claim. I could just as easily say ""We exist, but we were not created. We have always existed but before we were humans, we existed as invisible pink fairies."" Do you think my claim should stand as true? No I didn't. I said that I THINK it highly unlikely. That is my belief. I trust you understand the difference between giving one's beliefs and making a statement? The 'Negative Evidence Principle' Do you think that the likelihood of mermaids, pixies, leprechauns, Zeus, Apollo, Mithra and a thousand other gods that people do or have believed in is also 50%? That's right. If I don't know I say 'I don't know but I believe it to be true based on the available evidence'. I find it far more intellectually honest that making up stories, claiming the stories are true and threatening anyone that does not accept that my stories are true. I deride my opponents for putting forward belief as truth without being able to show that it is true.","origin-life","12:08 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","82"
"03-09-2013","22372",6,"TeaAddict","471171","Its not that God himself needs a defense, its the fact that we are imperfect beings. We cannot fully understand him, and that we cannot interpret him, .... The complexity of life, the complexity of the universe, the complexity of the Human mind ,and other things, dont suggest a randomly forming existence. You dont look at your computer, with its hardware and software, and think this must have evolved on its own from random processes, it obviously has been created. Yes, it is easier to just mumble I dont know when you dont like the answer, isnt it? It has nothing to do with how God created them. They made a choice. They had/have free will, and they chose to rebel. This is a remarkably silly argument. Jesus CHOSE to die for our sins, because he loved us. And note: God does not force this salvation on us. We can choose to accept his gift, or not to. If we choose not to accept Jesuss taking our punishment, we must take our punishment ourselves.","Dani","471202",". You surprise me because every Christian I have ever know, both in life and on forums seems to know everything about this mysterious 'god'. They know what he likes and doesn't like, what he means and doesn't mean, what he is/isn't thinking, who he is going to save or not save and what he is going to do and when he is going to do it. So you are pretty much saying that because you don't understand these things, the only answer is that 'god must have done it'. Ah yes...that old Christian favourite ""The Watchmaker Analogy"". The reason we know that computers and their components are created is because we know that computer and their components do not occur naturally...unlike seas, mountains, trees, flowers etc...which DO all occur naturally. It's intellectually honest to mumble ' I don't know' when you don't know. It has everything to do with how your god created them (assuming that he did for the sake of the discussion of course). He created them knowing that they would fall...it was 'programmed' into them from the start. If your god had not wanted them to fall then he would have made it so they could not fall but he didn't. The only logical conclusion is that he wanted them to fall and planned for them to fall. They did EXACTLY what your god wanted and planned for them to do. We need evidence for the existence of your Jesus The Christ. Existence is primary. What he did or did not do is secondary. If that is the case then it isn't a ""gift"" is it? A gift is something that is FREELY given and has no conditions attached to it. If I give you $10 with no conditions attached, that is a gift. If I offer you $10 but say that you have wash my car for in order to get it, I'm not giving you a gift...I'm offering you a transaction. In the same way, if your god offers us 'eternal life' whether we believe in him or not then that would be a gift. If however he offers us eternal life on condition that we obey and worship him...he is offering a transaction not a gift.","origin-life","12:52 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","83"

But why is allowing us to do evil, through a will that is somehow free, something that makes a perfect world possible? Wouldn't a perfect world be a place where evil never happened? Is the point that good and evil being a matter of free choice makes good and evil more meaningful?
