I understand that Abiogenesis is a separate field from evolution, but considering everything (including life) must have an origin, and Abiogenesis is a theory attempting to explain the origin of life, I think it deserves to be discussed. So one theory of Abiogenesis states that the Earth's atmosphere, approximately 3.5 billion years ago, produced organic compounds when exposed to energy. These organic molecules accumulated into a pool, and eventually formed more complex organic compounds, which eventually formed life. There are several problems which are pretty lethal to this theory. 1: The Ultraviolet rays from the sun would have destroyed any organic matter. Considering there was no oxygen in the atmosphere at the time, and therefore no ozone, there would have been no protection. Some have suggested that the spark of life started in the ocean, but this would seem impossible considering the oxygen in the water would have destroyed any organic matter. 2: The production of Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the molecules that fuel cells, requires protons to be densely packed and separated out. This could not happen in a ""soup"" mixture. 3: It is highly improbable that random organic molecules could have formed sufficient DNA, RNA, Proteins, etc. that would be necessary for a functional cell. Although evolution is a separate study from Abiogenesis, evolution is dependent on Abiogenesis: if life cant start, it cant evolve. Therefore, is Abiogenesis is so unlikely, the Theory of Evolution is also unlikely. Intelligent design (a creator God) is the most logical, plausible, scientific explanation for life.","origin-life","12:50 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","1"

The existence of a cavity between the ovary and the fallopian tube could indicate a flawed design in the female reproductive system. Prior to modern surgery, ectopic pregnancy invariably caused the deaths of both mother and baby. Even in modern times, in almost all cases, the pregnancy must be aborted to save the life of the mother. In the human female, the birth canal passes through the pelvis. The prenatal skull will deform to a surprising extent. However, if the babys head is significantly larger than the pelvic opening, the baby cannot be born naturally. Prior to the development of modern surgery (caesarean section), such a complication would lead to the death of the mother, the baby or both. Other birthing complications such as breech birth are worsened by this position of the birth canal. In the human male, testes develop initially within the abdomen. Later during gestation, they migrate through the abdominal wall into the scrotum. This causes two weak points in the abdominal wall where hernias can later form. Prior to modern surgical techniques, complications from hernias, including intestinal blockage, gangrene, etc., usually resulted in death. Other examples of ""poor design"" include: Barely used nerves and muscles, such as the plantaris muscle of the foot,[5] that are missing in part of the human population and are routinely harvested as spare parts if needed during operations. Another example is the muscles that move the ears, which some people can learn to control to a degree, but serve no purpose in any case. The common malformation of the human spinal column, leading to scoliosis, sciatica and congenital misalignment of the vertebrae.

The structure of humans' eyes (as well as those of all mammals). The retina is 'inside out'. The nerves and blood vessels lie on the surface of the retina instead of behind it as is the case in many invertebrate species. This arrangement forces a number of complex adaptations and gives mammals a blind spot. Six muscles move the eye when three would suffice.

And don't forget about exogenesis. Life did not necessarily start on Earth. How do you know that UV rays would have destroyed any organic matter? Do you know what molecules comprised the first reproducing molecules? Also, escaping UV rays is easy, you just have to go under a rock, beneath enough water, underground, etc. And also, since when does oxygen destroy organic matter? We breath oxygen and were just fine, right? And who told you oxygen was even present in primitive oceans? This one is beyond me. ATP is a molecule used to store energy the cell can use to metabolize. What's this about protons? And it doesn't do well in soup? And again, who told you the first reproducing, metabolizing life was in the form of cells? Necessary for a modern functional cell. You don't know what life looked like 3.5 billion years ago. It eventually became dominated by cells, but certainly didn't start with the cell. No theory of abiogenesis claims that it did. If anything, abiogenesis is dependent on evolution. Evolution explains the diversity of life. It does suggest abiogenesis, just as an expanding universe suggests the Big Bang, but it does not require it. That is not scientific and your logic is not sound. Even if your premises were correct, not based on a misunderstanding of what life is and what it most likely was in the past, even if you had a lick of chemistry supporting your other claims, your logic still would not follow.","origin-life","09:58 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","3"

"02-25-2013","22372",1,"TeaAddict","470768","One big problem with exogenesis is that it would have the same problems with this version of abiogenesis. Because thats what UV rays do. We use UV to sterilize, killing bacteria. UV from the sun burns our skin, giving us greater risk of skin cancer. UV is destructive to organic matter. But whatever life cam about, had to be complex enough to survive and reproduce. These things, in themselves, are complex, and The reason we can breathe the air is because we have antioxidants in our bodies. Antioxidants are molecules that prevent our cells from being destroyed by the oxidation process. Without antioxidants, our cells would be destroyed by the oxygen in the air and water, much the same way as metal rusts. So the primordial soup is stuck between a rock and a hard space, as it were: If there was oxygen in the atmosphere, the earliest organic matter would have been destroyed (because a pile of amino acids wouldnt have antioxidants). But if there was no oxygen in the atmosphere, there would have been no ozone layer protecting the surface of the earth from the suns UV. Our skin cells are susceptible to cancer when exposed to long term UV WITH an Ozone layer. What would it be like for the primordial cells WITHOUT one? If there was no oxygen in earths oceans, then they wouldnt have been water. Because water molecules have 1 oxygen atom. Thats why metal rusts in water. Going underwater wouldnt work, for the reason stated above. Under a rock doesnt make much sense either. That rock would have to remain steady for hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of years. Earthquakes, erosion, etc. would threaten to destroy/knock down the rock, and possibly expose the soup. We must also consider the possibility that, depending on where the soup was, the environment could have been very hot even if the sun wasnt shining directly on the soup. The liquid could have evaporated before anything could have formed. A million years is a looooooong time for a puddle of goo to sit around, safe from the environment.","Databed","470777","Yes, except that it doesn't occur on Earth. So all the below supposed problems go away. You don't know what UV rays did to the first life on Earth because you don't even know what it is composed of. Nobody does. It was most likely a precursor to modern RNA or DNA, but much more simple and much less susceptible to damage. It is possible and quite probable that the first lifeforms to see the Sun were dependent on its UV radiation, just as many organisms, including ourselves, are today. You want to complete your thought here? You have no idea what role oxidation played in the first life since you don't know what the first life was. Oxidation at some point became necessary for life just as it is in every oxygen dependent life form on Earth today. Oxidation keeps us alive. Yes, we have antioxidants to keep the process in check, but antioxidants do not entirely prevent oxidation in our bodies. If they did, we would die. Just as last time, your logic is flawed. You have assumed that life was in the past just as it is today. That's not what evolution says. It says life changes with changing environment. Just because you have devised an environment lethal to today's life (although bacteria and simple lifeforms would quickly re-adapt), doesn't mean you have devised a scenario lethal to all iterations of life. Well, since single celled organisms by definition don't develop cancer, it would be a non-issue. Metal requires water and oxygen to rust. Just water won't do. Go back to the books - look at basic corrosion. Also, when I say oxygen in this context, just as anyone else who knows ANYTHING, I am referring to free oxygen. Not oxygen locked up in water molecules. You do not have a grasp on this science at all. Let's say that one photon kills a bacterium. Bacteria would STILL thrive on this planet. Lets says one photon, or being exposed to a certain non-zero concentration of free oxygen kills a bacterium. Same result. There are so many ways to metabolize and so many environments to exist in, your scenario just can't account for it all. So basically, by this logic, there shouldn't be any fish on the planet. Really there shouldn't even be water except in the form of vapor.","origin-life","09:15 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","12"

Not only is that the obvious counter, but then you go on to say life was dependent on UV radiation. No, sorry he is right that if radiation of the correct wave length penetrates to the nucleus of a cell without being canceled it destroys DNA. You need special pigments if you are going to cancel UV radiation at the cell membrane so it's a chicken out of the egg just like every other biological feature in existence. That something this trivial sent you scurrying back to an appeal to ignorance (Yes that is what postulating the existence of magical unknown life matter which doesn't have to follow any rules since it's undefined is) reminds of of certain pro-religious characters around here. I just love it how this 'first life' got on without chemistry. It's all disposable, to the abiogenesis proponent an enzyme constitutes life. By professing ignorance of the early iterations of life you except them from any constraints at all. They could be spaghetti monsters for all you know.

Not only is this easy to counter due to the ease at which you can escape the radiation, at some point life began to use this radiation as an energy source to convert low energy molecules to a higher state. It is not unreasonable to postulate that this happened very early. I'm not claiming that it did, I'm just using this to counter his claim that UV radiation is necessarily damaging to any theory of abiogenesis. The first life had nothing to do with cells. There is no theory of abiogenesis that postulates that a cell was first. I am not sure why we keep bringing up cells. The fact is, we do not know what the first life was composed of, but there is a good chance that it was a simple self replicating molecule that we would not even recognize as life to day. How you can sit here and claim that such a molecule (because you know so much about it) could not exist on Earth due to UV radiation is beyond me. What else do you expect me to do? There were no surveillance devices back there that I can just go and dig up. These molecules and early life forms are long decomposed and there are no remnants of them left, and we would not expect there to be. You are the one that is using the lack of evidence for as proof against . An appeal to ignorance on my part is only to counter your claim of absolute certainty based on this same lack of knowledge. YOU are the one being unreasonable. No, self replicating and capable of evolving - that's all it takes. And what is this 'without chemistry?' You just made that up. No, they couldn't. Spaghetti monsters do not make sense. What does make sense is that they were precursors to RNA or DNA and self replicating. Maybe a strand of proto-RNA formed that coded for the enzyme that would sometimes help to roughly duplicate it. The process could get its energy from chemosynthesis, which back then would have been as simple as breaking down a loosely bonded molecule ejected by thermal vents deep in the ocean, away from any chance of oxidation or UV degradation. As soon as that one molecule just happened to form, both the enzyme and the proto-RNA would explode in population. Soon, due to all the errors since this was a primitive version, many new versions would appear. Every once in a while a better version would appear. The process becomes more efficient and more precise as the iterations continue. Clearly, abiogenesis is more dependent on evolution than evolution is dependent on abiogenesis as every possible abiogenesis story will necessarily involve descent with improvement. Now, all this being said, can you find anything in the previous paragraph that is impossible?? No you can't. Therefore, when you say abiogenesis is impossible, and this is why, you are wrong because my story could be true. Okay, Einstein - show me where I said there was no free oxygen in the oceans. What I did ask is how Tea Addict knew there was oxygen in the primordial atmosphere. The fact is, since oxygen does oxidize so readily, it took early life to free that oxygen. You are claiming that life had to exist within the top few feet of a pool of crystal clear water that must be easily penetrable by UV radiation and that there must be an extremely high concentration of oxygen dissolved in that water - enough to melt away any organic molecule immediately. I do realize that you did not bring up chemosynthesis in hopes that I would not either. The fact is, I didn't think I would need to, but if you are going to claim that my previous paragraph must follow based on your omniscient view of the way things had to unfold on primordial Earth, I will just remove the Sun and free oxygen from the equation completely.","origin-life","10:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","15"
