I understand that Abiogenesis is a separate field from evolution, but considering everything (including life) must have an origin, and Abiogenesis is a theory attempting to explain the origin of life, I think it deserves to be discussed. So one theory of Abiogenesis states that the Earth's atmosphere, approximately 3.5 billion years ago, produced organic compounds when exposed to energy. These organic molecules accumulated into a pool, and eventually formed more complex organic compounds, which eventually formed life. There are several problems which are pretty lethal to this theory. 1: The Ultraviolet rays from the sun would have destroyed any organic matter. Considering there was no oxygen in the atmosphere at the time, and therefore no ozone, there would have been no protection. Some have suggested that the spark of life started in the ocean, but this would seem impossible considering the oxygen in the water would have destroyed any organic matter. 2: The production of Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the molecules that fuel cells, requires protons to be densely packed and separated out. This could not happen in a ""soup"" mixture. 3: It is highly improbable that random organic molecules could have formed sufficient DNA, RNA, Proteins, etc. that would be necessary for a functional cell. Although evolution is a separate study from Abiogenesis, evolution is dependent on Abiogenesis: if life cant start, it cant evolve. Therefore, is Abiogenesis is so unlikely, the Theory of Evolution is also unlikely. Intelligent design (a creator God) is the most logical, plausible, scientific explanation for life.","Accipiter","470904","What if an advanced alien race created us?

"03-04-2013","22372",2,"TeaAddict","470963","It does? Why? You have no scientific evidence that aliens exist, just as there is no scientific evidence that God exists. Now Im not saying that there isnt reason to believe God exists, because there is. But we have no scientific, that is to say, geological/biological/cosmological proof that God exists. But what evidence have you that ALIENS exist? What evidence have you that they would be intelligent enough to create us? What evidence have you that our planet is within an intelligent aliens range?","Accipiter","470969","So your point here is that your argument is just as meritless as mine?","origin-life","12:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","26"

But think about it: Say aliens from the Andromeda galaxy came to our galaxy and dropped off some living cells which evolved into what we see today. Were did these aliens come from? Did aliens create those aliens? if so, where did THEY come from?? And the fact is that it is impossible for life to form randomly. The chances are zero. The planet has to be not-too-close, and not-too-far from it's sun, an atmosphere must be present on the planet, the atmosphere much be able to support organic life, organic compounds must be present, the compounds must come together in the right way to form some kind of life, this life must be able to survive and reproduce, the life must evolve, the life must not be destroyed by some natural disaster, etc etc etc... Then once a civilization forms, it must not destroy itself with its newly discovered technology, it must survive long enough to develop the technology to travel to other worlds, (and find a world with the parameters above).... In a nutshell, its impossible. But a being who is outside of time, (and therefore wouldn't have and wouldn't need an origin), would be inorganic so would not be susceptible to biological dangers, would be omnipotent, so it wouldn't need technology, and would be infinitely intelligent. Be honest with yourself, don't you think this makes more sense? My point was that there is no physical evidence for either side, but an omnipotent God is the more plausible conclusion.","origin-life","04:07 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","27"

Special pleading - Everything must have an origin. Oh, apart from my god.","origin-life","04:15 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","28"
"03-04-2013","22372",2,"TeaAddict","470979","So you are willing to ignore sound explanations just because you don't like them? Wishful thinking - I don't want to believe that God exists, so I'm gonna believe that aliens created us, even though it makes less sense. Everything in a physical universe that is bound by time must have an origin. Something that is not bound by time doesn't have to have and origin. God is outside of time, therefore he doesn't have to have an origin. Do you see any problems with these assessments?","smiley","470984","You did not give a sound explanation. Your assertion that life forming randomly is impossible is rubbish. It may be extremely improbable, but that does not mean impossible. Just because you can't cope with big numbers does not mean that we have to insert the biggest non-answer (god) into the equation. We know for certain that there is life on this planet. We also know that there are other planets throughout this galaxy (not to mention the billions of other galaxies) that have similar orbits around similar stars to our own. So it is no big stretch to at least think it possible that there is life somewhere else in the universe. I do not believe that life on this planet was seeded by some alien who stopped off here to perform some science experiment, but it is a possibility. It is also possible that we are the result of some alien poop that traveled here on a rogue asteroid, but there is also no evidence for that. So, we have evidence that life can exist on planets that are like our own, but we have zero evidence that there is some superior being that exists outside of time and space. No-one has ever been outside of time and space to witness this beast. Who says that everything in the physical universe has to have an origin? Why do we have to invent something outside of 'time and space' just because we don't completely understand 'time and space'? It is certainly possible that such a being exists, but until we have actual evidence of such a being, believing in it is just plain stupid.","origin-life","11:12 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","30"
