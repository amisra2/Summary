You will keep asking 'how, why' until we have no more answers to your 'but why dad, why' and then you will claim 'See, you don't know and if you don't know, the only answer must be that God did it and not only that..it was the particular god that I believe in'. You will then puff out your chest, declare victory and walk away...very much like Easyrider does. He has given you answers. That you would rather believe in superstition is, IMO, your problem.","Easyrider","473559","You're the dumb one.

Again, reporting is not explaining The replicating system actually involves two enzymes, each composed of two subunits and each functioning as a catalyst that assembles the other. The replication process is cyclic, in that the first enzyme binds the two subunits that comprise the second enzyme and joins them to make a new copy of the second enzyme; while the second enzyme similarly binds and joins the two subunits that comprise the first enzyme. In this way the two enzymes assemble each otherwhat is termed cross-replication. To make the process proceed indefinitely requires only a small starting amount of the two enzymes and a steady supply of the subunits. conditions do not create. I wonder if you realised your slip : ""create"". I see, the questions you don't have an answer for are 'silly questions"". I thought you were an intelligent person. You aren't. You have proven to me this: you are arrogant in your ignorance and you are dishonest in your arguing.","Peeling","473619","It's really not Look: We inspect an object. We label it 'round'. We see a solid/gas boundary that is non-perpendicular to the local gravity and we label it a 'slope'. We watch what happens when physical forces act upon the 'round' object resting on the 'slope', and we label that 'rolling'. Now, can we take the 'round' object apart, look at the atoms and find some essence of 'rolling' in there? Of course not. The individual atoms are not rolling. When we say 'that ball is rolling down a slope' it's shorthand for ""Atom 1 is moving in this direction, atom 2 is moving in that direction..."" and so on. I've written a few physics simulations (for fun and profit) that use points connected by springs. The points have no concept of rotation, only of position and velocity. Nor do the springs - they only care about distance. Yet if I set up a circular pattern of points and connect them with springs, it'll happily roll down a slope, because 'rolling' is a behaviour that emerges from the underlying forces. I didn't need to 'program in' rolling. It's exactly the same with life. When you zoom way, way in and look at what individual molecules are doing, they're each just obeying the same laws of physics as everything else: moving, bonding and so forth. The aggregate effect of those motions, we've labelled 'life'. Ok, let's start with a quote from an article about one lab experiment: The first thing to get our heads around is what a catalyst does. When I was at school I was given the simple version: catalysts speed up reactions. The more accurate and interesting way to think about catalysts is that they make individual molecular reactions more likely , and they do so in a surprisingly straightforward and mechanical way. Remember when I talked about how the molecules in your cells are flying around smacking into each other billions of times a second? Well, in the experiment quoted above, you've got a solution containing billions of copies of four different molecules (call them A, B, C and D), and those molecules are whizzing around banging into each other. Now, if A and B happen to bang into each other in just the right way, they'll bond to form a larger molecule AB. Just chemistry; nothing unusual. The same is true for molecules C and D, making CD. But at low energies (temperatures), it's hugely unlikely these reactions will occur. Ok so far? The interesting part is that this particular molecule AB attracts passing C and D molecules. And just as two magnets will orient themselves and clamp together when they get close, AB's shape and chemical bonds pull in and spin C and D molecules such that they line up in precisely the right way to 'click together' and form CD. And as they click together, they detach from AB, leaving AB free to pull in and bond more C and D molecules. So AB 'manufactures' CD out of a mixed solution of C and D. Again, this is perfectly straightforward chemistry and physics; the sort of thing we make use of all the time in manufacturing. But CD also performs the reverse: it pulls in, orients and 'clicks together' A and B molecules. So in this case the two molecules replicate each other - not strictly 'self replication' but the end result is the same: AB/CD makes more AB/CD. Obviously to get the ball rolling you need a first molecule of AB or CD. But the formation of AB without CD's assistance isn't impossible , it might just take an unusual jolt of energy (eg an electric spark) to make it likely. And once you've got AB, you're away. In the experiment the scientists deliberately seeded the solution with some AB/CD, but that's just for experimental convenience. The upshot is, there are two things we don't know with regards to organic chemistry: 1. We don't know what the first replicating molecules actually were, in terms of their detailed chemical structure. We know amino acids are naturally occurring, we can make some educated guesses about the kind of molecules involved (eg RNA), but it's entirely possible the specific molecules (which after all had a test tube the size of the universe and hundreds of millions of years in which to jostle) may never be known. 2. We're still working on understanding why the basic laws of physics are what they are. But that's the same mystery we see when we look at the sun, or a black hole, or anything else. But there is no mystery at all as to how or why 'living' molecules behave as they do: they behave just like any other molecule: whizzing around, encountering other molecules and catalysing reactions. It just so happens that the reactions they catalyse are circular : they feed back upon themselves. In the lab example above it's a simple back-and-forth tick-tock: AB makes CD, CD makes AB, and they do so by just banging into raw materials drifting in solution. In you and I, we see the result of a two-billion-year arms race, where molecules that are more successful at gathering raw materials and closing the loop of their chemical reactions have prospered. My personal chemical reaction took 32 years to cycle - that's when my daughter was born Does that help? You're quite right; that was a slip. I should have said: ""And then there are just a few starting conditions from which the laws of physics derive complex non-repeating patterns - life"" Well, here's what you said: ""so matter just became alive? where in matter is this property found, maybe if we keep splitting and splittng matter will find it one day ? "" Suppose I asked you: ""So that shape just began to roll? Where in matter is this 'rolling' property found? Maybe if we keep splitting and splitting matter we'll find it one day."" You would quite rightly tell me it was a silly question. Why? Because 'rolling' is not a fundamental property of matter. It's a label for the aggregate motion of many molecules, something which by definition cannot be found by inspecting them individually. Similarly, life is not a fundamental property - of matter or anything else. It is an emergent behaviour - and if I can forestall your objection, 'emergent behaviour' isn't just another way of saying 'it appears from nowhere with no explanation."" Emergent describes behaviour implicit in a set of rules rather than explicit ; something that happens when the rules are applied which one could not predict by inspection of the rules themselves. (As an aside, it is mathematically demonstrable that the outcome of many iterative processes cannot be predicted - not in the sense that their outcome is uncertain or different each time, but in that there is no equation into which you can plug a time T and yield a result - the only way to find out what happens at time T is to actually simulate the iterations of the process up to that point. It is impossible, for instance, to deduce the beautiful complexity of the Mandlebrot Set by simple inspection of the function which generates it.) In my physics simulations, rolling behaviour was implicit in the entirely linear rule-set of forces. I didn't realise this when I wrote the first one (I think I was maybe 12 at the time), and spent ages vainly trying to code in 'spinning'. It was only when I gave up, took the mess of equations out, and just gave my springy cube a linear nudge at one of it's corners that I noticed it span perfectly well all on its own. I'm disappointed you think that. I have certainly not been dishonest - if I have come across as arrogant I apologise. I hope this post has gone some way to repairing my reputation with you","origin-life","08:05 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","156"

"05-28-2013","22372",11,"TeaAddict","470673","Hello! I understand that Abiogenesis is a separate field from evolution, but considering everything (including life) must have an origin, and Abiogenesis is a theory attempting to explain the origin of life, I think it deserves to be discussed. So one theory of Abiogenesis states that the Earth's atmosphere, approximately 3.5 billion years ago, produced organic compounds when exposed to energy. These organic molecules accumulated into a pool, and eventually formed more complex organic compounds, which eventually formed life. There are several problems which are pretty lethal to this theory. 1: The Ultraviolet rays from the sun would have destroyed any organic matter. Considering there was no oxygen in the atmosphere at the time, and therefore no ozone, there would have been no protection. Some have suggested that the spark of life started in the ocean, but this would seem impossible considering the oxygen in the water would have destroyed any organic matter. 2: The production of Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the molecules that fuel cells, requires protons to be densely packed and separated out. This could not happen in a ""soup"" mixture. 3: It is highly improbable that random organic molecules could have formed sufficient DNA, RNA, Proteins, etc. that would be necessary for a functional cell. Although evolution is a separate study from Abiogenesis, evolution is dependent on Abiogenesis: if life cant start, it cant evolve. Therefore, is Abiogenesis is so unlikely, the Theory of Evolution is also unlikely. Intelligent design (a creator God) is the most logical, plausible, scientific explanation for life.","BarryDesborough","473719","1. UV will not penetrate many gases, nor down to the seabed, nor through rock. 2. ATP is not proposed as a part of any origin of life hypotheses. 3. DNA, RNA & proteins in a cell are not proposed as any origin of life hypothesis.
