The first two humans, without that knowledge, were ethically retarded. To them, there was no right to following God's rule, and no wrong in disobeying it. Hence why it happened .","Easyrider","471309","Not quite. Adam and Eve did know the difference between right and wrong (they knew what they should and should not do, because God told them), but they did not know of the consequences and depth of good and evil until after their disobedience. Along those lines, you and other non-Christians have been told the truth about Jesus Christ and his salvation and have been told to repent of your sins, yet you do not do it.","origin-life","09:24 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","106"

"03-12-2013","22372",8,"TeaAddict","471171","The fact remains that UV and Oxygen would have destroyed organic matter. Period. Whether it was in a cell, or some self-replicating molecule, or spaghetti monsters. There is oxygen in the oceans now, and why would there be no oxygen in Earths oceans back then? But originally, you asked this question, then changed it to include atmosphere, not you change it back to oceans?","Databed","471319","The fact is there would have been no, or at least very little, free oxygen anywhere. There is no process, aside from biological metabolism, to free the oxygen that so readily combines with other elements and molecules to the scale that you would need to begin destroying organic matter. It took life to come about to provide for the free oxygen that you claim is so detrimental to organic matter. This means that life had to take hold first, thus there would necessarily from the very beginning have been a natural balance, or at least a limit for life to overcome that kept oxidation in check. It is easily conceivable that evolution can find a solution for an ever increasing oxygen rich environment, most likely a very slow process that is kept in check by it's own dependence on the life which it has an affinity to destroy. This is what I am trying to get at. Oxygen can't just magically free itself from the bonds it so readily seeks, the process which is crucial to your argument. Therefore, you can't have it both ways at the point of abiogenesis. You can't necessarily have an extremely delicate first version of life that has to survive in an oxidizing environment and the total lack of any process to lead to an oxidizing environment at the same time. It took time to develop, and this would easily have been enough time for life to find a way. As for your UV radiation paradox, this I don't even need to deal with. It is extremely easy to escape the effects of UV radiation. If a very diffuse, thin blanket of O3 can protect us now, think how easy it is for liquids, rocks, etc. to provide safe cover.","origin-life","12:59 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","111"

Go to a football match. Both sides will pray for victory. Half the prayers are 'answered', half are not. If you want to show evidence that prayer to your deity actually works (in that your deity responds in a measurable way), you first have to prove that your deity exists, then show a positive correlation between the prayer and the result. Good luck with that. But I seriously suggest you take a look into the studies of the effect of placebos. They are really interesting.","origin-life","02:24 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","112"

They were ethically retarded. Good or bad? Neither would have had gravity to them, so there's no meaning to either term. Might as well have told them ""Not eating the fruit will be glunk, but EATING the fruit would be pluh! "". I've heard one deeply flawed idea amongst many that are circling the world, one that, with a little thought, doesn't even begin to make sense. Have you ever stopped to think why people aren't choosing as you do? If one person winds up in heaven while another winds up in hell, it's because the former was placed at some sort of advantage in the interest of making that right choice. In his upbringing, his experiences, and/or even the biochemistry going on in his brain-goo, among other things. If we want to leave it up to this thing called ""free will"", that's fine too. I'll get to that when I make the thread, but it still follows the same principle. I just have to apply it to whatever magic makes free will work, when it leads people towards the right or wrong path. I'll get the thread up. Let's continue this discussion there.","origin-life","08:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","113"

It has never been found that there is a benefit to those who are prayed for. I'm sure you can find these and probably other methods of testing prayer as well.","origin-life","07:31 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","116"
"03-13-2013","22372",8,"Dani","471337","Not Quite! ""And the LORD God said, ""The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil....."" Gen 3:22 ...which would indicate that before eating the fruit they had no conception of what was right or wrong/good or evil. After eating they did, so clearly, telling someone not to do something when they do not understand what they are being told and then punishing them for doing that is morally unjust...but then, morality has never been something that has bothered your god is it? A mother would not put a loaded gun in the same room as a child that could not understand her words and tell him not to touch it....no matter how much she wants him to be ""free."" She knows better. She is clearly smarter than your god. See dude...your god supposedly knows the outcome of our lives before we are ever born. He will supposedly punish non-believers for all of eternity, however, he knew that they would not believe before the universe was ever created!! Do you see the problem here? If the Biblical accounts are true, and your god is all knowing, then he created people with the sole intention of punishing them!","Easyrider","471348","Horse manure. Adam and Eve knew they shouldn't eat of the tree, and they knew why. They just didn't know the full consequences of committing the sin. On your last point, the sacrifice of Jesus was ordained from the foundation of the earth (Revelation 13:8), and before Adam and Eve sinned. So God knew many people would choose Jesus and eternal life. One more thing: Foreknowledge is not determinism. All had their chance or a fair hearing at their Judgments (read Romans chapters 1 and 2 for confirmation). So your claims are horse dung. The rest of your post was equally lame.","origin-life","12:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","117"
