I'd love to see it in context just to prove how sick you really are.","chemist99a","286617","See what I mean about trauma causing amnesia. You obviously need more time to pull it together. Perhaps if you would search out your own posts and read them it would refresh your recollections.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","11:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","62"
"10-05-2007","10445",5,"chemist99a","286613","Indeed, if you want a mystical, immaterial, non-empirical explanation which is based in something other than facts, logic, reason and hypothesis testing according to scientific principles, then Science is not going to help you at all. You need to consult your local shaman or priest instead, and you are welcome to believe the explanation you obtain if that makes you feel good.","supersport","286621","chemist, science should not start out with the premise that the world and all that we see got here by way of naturalistic means. The premise should be to have an open mind, investigate the given evidence and then maybe make conclusions based on the findings. But as you just admitted, science doesn't do that. They just arbitrarily say we got here materialistically and then try to cram the facts and evidence in on that presumption. What's scientific about ruling out possibilities just because these possibilities might conflict with ones worldview? Einstein did that and at least had the honesty to admit later that it was one of the biggest mistakes of his life.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","12:24 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","63"

I recently forwarded chemist the thread http://www.4forums.com/political/sho...ghlight=planes so he could laugh at you.

Oh, as to your arguments you won, are you counting all the ones where you basically ad-hommed people into ignoring you and not paying attention to you? Because yeah, if you count those, you've won a few. Oh, are you including the evolution debates? You know, the ones where you brought up at least two frauds as evidence for yourself? You know, the ones where you used the source that had the Ica stones, and the one where you completely fell for the TV show prop and thought they had a genuine picture of a pterodactyl with some civil war soldiers?","trebor","286714","Although Easyrider is obsessed with Homesexuality, his theology is somewhat different that AA. It is hard to believe, but EZ has just the smallest amount of sense more than AA.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","03:12 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","70"
"10-05-2007","10445",5,"Archangel","286641","First of all, are you so inept as to only be able to post from page 3 of a thread rather than give the link for the actual post where I made a statement about BIRDS WITH JET ENGINES COMING OUT OF THEIR BUTTS ? Instead, you are attempting to mock me for making the simple statement that bumble bees defy the laws of flight which according to this article has been widely believed by millions and has travelled the World after being started in Switzerland. Regarding the bolded, that was the only point I was trying to make at the time. That Bumble bees defy the laws of flight. It had been a widely promoted urban myth if you will, and I plead guilty to promoting it. But you have just confirmed how disingenuous and even slanderous you are to take such an innocent and widely held belief that I stated and twisting it into me saying the birds had jet engines coming out of their butts. Which clearly explains why as the slanderous and philosophical coward and the liar that you are, that you posted page 3 of the thread and not the specific post where I made such a claim. Because you know if you posted my actual post, everyone would clearly understand that I was speaking to the fact that bees simply seem to defy the laws of flight, and nothing as extreme as you want to attribute to me. After all, your goal isn't to tell the truth but to libel me.","obvious_child","286717","Do you know what inductive reasoning is? Plus you made the comparison between birds and planes. Too bad you never bothered to research why your article was wrong. And you still can't accept that you are wrong. [INDENT]Why can bumblebees fly? Published May 20th, 2007 Science[/quote] What the hell? Your link doesn't even cite its own source! http://sciencemole.wordpress.com/2007/05/ First of, it bumblee bees defy the flight based on calculations of fixed wing. They do not defy the laws of flight period. Only someone with absolutely no education or understanding of aerodynamics would believe this. Too bad people can read the thread and see you're lying right now, Don't you hate that? Actual evidence? You should use it now and again. I, unlike you, prefer to keep a quotation in context, allowing everyone to see exactly what the discussion was about. You however, being a slanderous and philosophical coward and the liar that you are have a tendency not to do this and only cherry picking information to make your argument look valid. No they don't. If I only posted your post, I would omit numerous people citing dynamic stalling proving you beyond wrong. You're ###### off because I included refutations of you in the link. Right now, no one thinks you tell the truth. After all, you have cited at least four different known hoaxes as evidence.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","03:45 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","71"

You argued that birds can't fly because they don't have the same method of flight as jets. Hence, birds can't fly because they don't have jet engines coming out of their butts. And I see you refuse to admit you screwed up your hoaxes as well as not even bothering to use google for any referencing. And why can't you answer my question?

Let's just ignore that no organism on the planet has that much allocation (or anything even close) of body mass towards any one set of muscles. Then explain how a 747 wide body flies then. Its wings dont even flap like a birds or dragons. Have you considered that the wings might be sized in proportion to its mass ?","thelmoose","286772","The way I remember it, you claimed dragons have existed. Someone pointed out that the weight of a dragon would preclude their ability to fly. To that you replied: If you feel you have been misunderstood, tell us then, what really were you trying to say. Don't evade. Don't call anyone names. Just explain your position regarding birds, dragons and jumbo jets. Now is your chance. Either explain what you were trying to say, or let it go.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","09:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","75"
