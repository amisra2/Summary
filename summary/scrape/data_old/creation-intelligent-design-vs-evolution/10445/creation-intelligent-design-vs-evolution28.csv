You must first submit yourself to the living God and commit your life to Jesus as your Lord and Savior. If you are sincere in your commitment to Him you will receive His Holy Spirit to dwell within you forevermore and you will then become one with God and will be literally born again. Once that change occurs within you, you will be a new creature and all of the spiritual truths which you are currently blind to will become obvious to you. You will truly know the truth and the truth will truly set you free. And the great thing is smiley, you won't rely on the words of any human being at all just as I don't. But you will know God's truths because His Holy Spirit will teach them to you. Here's the spiritual promise of what I am saying. Jhn 14:23 Jesus answered and said to him, ""If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our abode with him. Jhn 14:24 ""He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father's who sent Me. Jhn 14:25 ""These things I have spoken to you while abiding with you. Jhn 14:26 ""But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you. The bolded verse says it all regarding the promise that the holy spirit will teach you all things and confirm HIS truths for you. All you must do is trust Him with your life to be born again. Can you do that smiley, cuz your eternal soul depends on it.","smiley","385422","Essentially, what you're saying is I have to dedicate myself to believing in something that I don't currently believe in.

Explain the history of meteor impacts, vulcanism, and tectonic events that we can all see-keeping in mind that the energy released in all these events would boil the oceans away and turn the earth molten if condensed into the time period you insist is fact (based on a XXXXing book of myths). While you're at it, explain how meteor craters are found in geological layers that you insist we're laid down by the flood. Just so we're all clear here, for your claim to be correct, there would have to be the flood, numerous meteors fall on the (presumably) still mobile sediments, which somehow solidify just before the meteor strikes (otherwise it wouldn't produce the characteristic crater pattern), then the brand spanking new crater is weathered to make it appear that millions of years of erosion takes place, while new sediments cover it up and also solidify (repeat a few times, otherwise we can't explain multiple impacts in similar locations), all in the span of 40 days. I guess I'll add a couple more questions-how do sediments instantaneously become rock? And why just the section where the meteor struck? Can sediments sense an incoming meteor, and while some sediment dodges, the rest solidifies to ""catch"" the meteor? Then the ""dodgy"" sediment comes back, quickly erodes the suddenly solid portions, and covers them up and itself solidifies, all in a manner that we'd expect to see on a 4.5 billion year old planet? Explain folded rock layers and how they could be produced in sudden, cataclysmic events. Explain varves, and ice cores, and how even though the have every appearance of being laid down annually over millenia (preserving annual pollen and spore samples, just as we'd expect), they were actually laid down in 40 days a few thousand years ago. Explain how the flood (and a biblical age of the earth) accounts for all that, and more, better than the theory that everyone with two brain cells to rub together accepts. Or, be the ignorant coward and XXXXX we all know you to be, and ignore the questions I asked and insult me.

Just as with your assumptions regarding the geology of the earth, I believe that the fossil record which evolutionists believe was created over hundreds of millions of years was actually deposited by the great flood quickly. Again, it is all a matter of interpretation and we will never agree on that aspect of how to interpret this evidence.","birdan","385476","That is my point: it either appears to be an embedded history of events, or it really is a history of events. If I look at an meteor crater, I say the crater was produced by a meteor impact. Either it was or it wasn't. There is no necessity for craters in a 'mature earth', a crater is evidence of an event. Do you think a meteor crater was produced by a meteor impact, or is it simply a fake stage prop? What you seem to be saying is that God not only produced a 'mature earth' but also produced an earth with an appearance of a history of events that didn't happen, and science only 'assumes' these events actually happened. Even though the evidence of these past events directly correlates to evidence we witness in the present, and even though the evidence of these past events follow and are explainable by physics and chemistry, they really didn't happen - they are really an embedded history that never occurred.

The reason you dont see as many the craters is that earth has an atmosphere where many of them burn up before they hit the ground.

Accipiter has already given the reason we don't see as many craters on earth as other bodies in the solar system. But I'll just talk about the confirmed craters as pointed out on your map, and we can compare those to Mt. St. Helens. The Mt. St. Helens eruption was the equivalent of a 24 megaton bomb going off. For reference purposes, the largest atomic bomb ever tested was a 25 megaton hydrogen bomb, and the Hiroshima bomb was a 0.01 megaton bomb. Now, if we take Isaac Newton's formula for kinetic energy (E = 1/2mv^2), we can calculate the amount of energy needed to create all those craters on your map. The result: over one billion megatons of energy. That would be the same as 40 million Mt. Saint Helens eruptions! Over a 5,000 year YEC period, that would be the equivalent of twenty 25 megaton bombs exploding every single day ! It would be the equivalent of 23 Mount St. Helens eruptions every single day ! Of course, even young earth creationists don't believe that such catastrophic events have been happening for the past 3,000 years at least, and most young earth creationist literature I've read attributes the above meteor impacts to a single ""flood year"". That would mean that during the ""flood year"" there was the equivalent of 40 million Mount St. Helens eruptions on the earth . If the earth is only thousands of years old, then those meteor impacts should have obliterated the surface of the earth and generated sufficient heat to boil away the oceans. Or the basic physics of Isaac Newton are another aspect of science that young earth creationism rejects. Or those meteor impacts never really happened. If the earth is at least several hundreds of millions of years old, then the above meteor impacts present no problem as evidence of a history of events.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","08:05 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","415"

Over millions of years, there are things known as 'erosion'. Things wear away. And, CD110: Meteor craters in deep strata Then, how do you explain a combination of folding and breaking? Epic failure on your part. CD410: Airplanes Buried in Ice You are assuming that it was at a single level, and kept on getting weaker. However, geological data shows that the magnetic field goes through periods of reversal, and we are currently entering a time that it might flip over within a thousand years or so. The magnetic field would get weaker, reverse, then get stronger again. This has been mathematically modeled , and the model actually predicted some of the anomalies we are seeing. CE011: Earth's rotation slowing The earth's rotation is slowing at a rate of about 0.005 seconds per year per year. This extrapolates to the earth having a fourteen-hour day 4.6 billion years ago, which is entirely possible. The rate at which the earth is slowing today is higher than average because the present rate of spin is in resonance with the back-and-forth movement of the oceans. Fossil rugose corals preserve daily and yearly growth patterns and show that the day was about 22 hours long 370 million years ago, in rough agreement with the 22.7 hours predicted from a constant rate of slowing (Scrutton 1964; Wells 1963). CE110: Moon Receding # The moon is receding at about 3.8 cm per year. Since the moon is 3.85 1010 cm from the earth, this is already consistent, within an order of magnitude, with an earth-moon system billions of years old. # The magnitude of tidal friction depends on the arrangement of the continents. In the past, the continents were arranged such that tidal friction, and thus the rates of earth's slowing and the moon's recession, would have been less. The earth's rotation has slowed at a rate of two seconds every 100,000 years (Eicher 1976). # The rate of earth's rotation in the distant past can be measured. Corals produce skeletons with both daily layers and yearly patterns, so we can count the number of days per year when the coral grew. Measurements of fossil corals from 180 to 400 million years ago show year lengths from 381 to 410 days, with older corals showing more days per year (Eicher 1976; Scrutton 1970; Wells 1963; 1970). Similarly, days per year can also be computed from growth patterns in mollusks (Pannella 1976; Scrutton 1978) and stromatolites (Mohr 1975; Pannella et al. 1968) and from sediment deposition patterns (Williams 1997). All such measurements are consistent with a gradual rate of earth's slowing for the last 650 million years. # The clocks based on the slowing of earth's rotation described above provide an independent method of dating geological layers over most of the fossil record.
