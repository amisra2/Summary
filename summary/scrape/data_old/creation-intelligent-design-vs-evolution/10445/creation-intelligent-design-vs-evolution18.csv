This liar must know he is perverting my beliefs but has such little respect for the truth and so little shame that he isn't even embarrassed about not only misrepresenting what I have said, but actually arguing and defending that fallacious stance after repeated denials by me, and my insistence that his interpretation of what I have said is absolutely false. Only in this generation do we have people like this mentally ill troll who will insist on telling another person what he believes after he has repeatedly told him he is wrong. I can't imagine a psychosis so severe in a person who is functioning in society that he will refuse to accept it when another person says NO, that isn't what I said or meant to say. I must assume that this lunatic is communicating from some institution and is safely being held behind locked doors and is under 24 hour watch by qualified medical personnel. So it becomes painfully obvious to me that attempting to reason with this sick and disturbed lunatic is a complete waste of my time as there is no reasoning with him. He will continue to argue such insane positions as I believe that because TQ insulted my ability to do math, and I responded by saying that I reject his atheistic and secular world view, that from that exchange, one must conclude that I then believe that anyone who relies on MATH must then be an ATHEIST. And only in his very sick and disturbed mind can my stating the FACT that scientists have studied the issue of BUMBLE BEES defying the laws of flight for decades, that in his psychosis induced mind have I argued and still believe that BEES CAN'T FLY AT ALL. Forget that I was speaking only of bumble bees in my original claim, and forget that I wasn't saying even they can't fly but was saying that they DEFY THE LAWS OF FLIGHT. To his disturbed reality, evidently that means I don't believe that any bees can fly anywhere despite a lifetime of seeing bees fly. Can you appreciate how sick such a person who makes such a claim as this obvious child is? That none of that matters to this mentally ill person is evidence that he has lost his grip on reality. And that is the most gracious conclusion I can come to here. Otherwise, if I don't conclude that he is mentally ill, the only other option is to conclude that he is a committed fabricator of facts, a false witness, a falsifier of reality, a maligner of his opponents stated beliefs, a purposeful perjurer, and an unapologetic prevaricator who prefers to lie about a persons beliefs in opposition to the stated truth of what another person insists they actually believe. So which is it? Either way what is painfully obvious is that attempting to reason with such a person is a complete waste of time. as he has proven to be beyond the capability of rational discourse. My only option if admin refuses to ban such a member, is to ignore him. So consider it done. His lies aren't worth defending against anyway since everyone can plainly see how he distorts what others say.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","10:41 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","256"

(IMHO, the creepiest aspect of this was that it appeared Archangel meant it as an insult.) I've seen Archangel, repeatedly, question the religious faith of other posters, most notably Matthew, despite being told, repeatedly, that Matthew is Christian. Do I think OC tries to make too much of some poorly written comments by Archangel? Yes. However, I see this as OC simply trying to get Archangel's goat, so to speak, and being quite effective at it. On the other hand, it is Archangel that I see, habitually, ascribe positions to others that are contrary to what they have said. IMHO, it is simply absurd to see him so ""flummoxed"" by OC. Is OC being obnoxious? YES! (IMHO) But, from what I've seen, it is in response to Archangel being an absolute creep, in just about every post he makes. I suspect OC is in his teens (pure speculation-- no offense intended if I'm way off, OC), and his behavior seems perfectly normal for his age. Archangel, on the other hand, is allegedly 56!

Women never forget and tend to bring up past mistakes, errors/sins in current arguments; just like this little child does. That is why I accused him of being not only a woman but the worst example of what a woman is. Because not all women are like this, only the most insecure and controlling of them. You see, the difference here is that I debated Matthew fairly and honestly and showed him WITH THE SCRIPTURES WE WERE DISCUSSING that he is a secular humanist who wants to be judged as a christian who knows the Lord. I showed that nothing he believes jives with the belief system of a true born again believer in Christ Jesus. I NEVER TOOK HIS ARGUMENTS, CORRUPTED THEM AND FED THEM BACK TO HIM AS I INSISTED THAT HE SAID SOMETHING HE NEVER SAID. How would you like it if in a debate you said that born again believers are brainwashed sheeple, which you probably do believe, and I continued to post months later that Tester debated and argued that all christians are devoted hatemongers who are dedicated to killing all atheists!!! Wouldn't you raise cain and insist that I quote you writing that? Wouldn't you report me and demand I retract such a lie and stop repeating it ad-infinitum? OF COURSE YOU WOULD. SO DON'T ACT SO SHOCKED THAT I AM INFURIATED BY THE DISHONESTY AND CHILDISH TACTICS WHICH THIS TROLLISH LIAR REPRESENTS. Getting my goat is one thing, but debating for pages on end and from debate to debate as he repeats lies and misrepresentations about things I have never ever said and have repeatedly said I neither said nor meant to say is a completely different type of psychosis. This jerk is crazy to continue to argue that I believe that anyone who relies on math must be an atheist when I have been calling that statement a lie for a year now, as just one example of his insanity. Only a lunatic would continue to tell another person what they believe after repeatedly being told that just isn't true. And if you're right about his motives, then he does deserve to be banned for that just for being a disruptive force on this forum who is spreading lies and misrepresenting another members arguments. This I challenge completely. Prove this statement if you can. But keep in mind that we are on a debate forum here. It is normal to disagree with others and respond with opposing views. But you better show it if you're going to imply that I twist, pervert and corrupt what others say and continue to repeat lies about their positions months and even years after debates are long dead. YOU NEED TO BACK THIS CLAIM UP TESTER!!! A CREEP? Would you quote any posts of mine which would define me as a creep, please, Rather than someone sharing their valid opinions on a debate forum? If you find my opinions creepy then you find the scriptural principles I defend creepy, and that falls on you Tester, not me, because my morals, ethics, and value, system are nothing which needs to be apologized for. I will hold my debating style up to his and many others who have debated here any day of the week. And the obnoxious child, Patrick, is a teenager. Either 19 or he just turned 20. And one could only wish he acted his age because he acts more like a 12 year old as he irrationally misrepresents what others, not just I say in debates. You have no idea how many people have just stopped posting here out of frustration from his lies about what they have said in debates. It's impossible to reason with a person who perverts the truth of what a person says in debate from post to post. This type of poster shouldn't be allowed to exist here at all since he is just a disruptive force rather than a contributing member who can be counted on for an honest and objective opinion. So I am doing a public service by standing up to him and clarifying what he is for all to plainly see so everyone recognizes him and his ilk on this and other forums. So just because you don't like the content of my responses to your secular humanism Tester, that in no way makes me a creep or dishonest. Feel free to prove your accusations about what you say I represent in debates.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","05:16 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","259"

Also I do it primarily to force Arch to either accept he was wrong or go insane ballistic. History has shown Arch never admits he's wrong or even the existence of an event where he said dumb stuff, It's somewhat hard to act my age when I'm trolling hunting.

You called me a liar on a list of things I said you made. http://www.4forums.com/political/360364-post255.html Why do you refuse to address that post? If you think I lied, why don't you say that you reject that those instances happened? I twist what you say, but you can't prove it.

Just wanted to point out that the ""Big bang"" was first proposed by Monsignor Georges H. J. . Lematre who was a Belgian Roman Catholic priest, honorary prelate, professor of physics and astronomer at the Catholic University of Leuven. He proposed what became known as the Big Bang theory of the origin of the Universe, which he called his 'hypothesis of the primeval atom'. (see: Georges Lematre on Kosmix : Reference, Videos, Images, News, Shopping and more... ) Lemaitre was not an atheist. Also, Gregor Mendel, a monk, as you probably know, started work on the field of genetics. There is a LOT of proof for evolution in genetics. Point being, not all scientists are atheists. Knowledge and wisdom are gifts from God. If God wanted us to remain ignorant, why give us intelligence? Science and faith work together for most people.
