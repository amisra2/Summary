"01-10-2010","10445",27,"birdan","385327","Light from distant stars is not an assumption, it is evidentially supported. The speed of light has been directly measured both in the laboratory, from the moon, from the other side of the sun, from the fringes of the heliosphere. Not only that, the mathematical theory behind basic physics rules out light traveling significantly faster than has been measured, and it certainly rules out light being faster in the past by a factor of a million, which is necessary for a thousands year old universe. That is a far cry from ""assumption"". If the light from distant stars is not ancient (i.e., traveling at the speed of light), then obviously either all of physics and chemistry is wrong, or the light was created on its way to earth 6,000 years ago. The problem is that this light contains a history of events in it, and consequently light created en route contains a history of events that never happened. The same is true for the earth's geology. It is not a question of a 6,000 year old earth created to ""look mature"". Rather, the earth's geology contains a history of events (meteor impacts, volcanoes, tectonic movement, sedimentary rock formation, etc.). Basic 19th century physics shows that if all these events happened in the past several thousand years, our current earth would be a molten ball because of all the heat produced by these events. Once again, either all of physics and chemistry is wrong, or the history of events in the earth's geology never happened. If the creator of this 'light en route to earth' and earth's geology could place fictitious events in the light and in the earth's rocks, then it would seem this same creator could create a holy book full of fictitious events. If you don't subscribe to the idea of a deceptive creator, then you are saying that all of physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, cosmology, geology, paleontology, genetics, etc. are wrong. In effect, you are indeed rejecting all the physical sciences.","Archangel","385353","An excellant post in describing what appears to be the observable facts regarding measuring the distance that light has traveled through time. And I totally agree with you that from our perspective what you say appears to be true and even reasonable. The problem here is that our perspective is that of an ant with its miniscule life span attempting to discern eternity. It simply can't be done. Not that the attempt is wrong, it's just that we don't have the tools to verify that our interpretations of the available observations are the correct ones. Here's an example of what I mean. Gen 1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. When was the beginning? Gen 1:2 The earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters. Gen 1:3 Then God said, ""Let there be light""; and there was light. If God placed all of the stars in space at the same time, wouldn't that give a deceptive appearance to the age of the stars and the universe based on our assumption that measuring the alleged time it took for the light to travel here was necessary at all? Again, it's our perspective based on assumptions that the universe must be old which is questionable, if not faulty. According to verse 1, if the beginning was mere thousands of years ago, and God called light into being as verse 3 says, and the stars are the source of all light throughout time and space, then what appears to have taken billions of years to occur to us, actually took place instantaneously. This exchange is an excellent example of why we will never agree on the observations of science though, you are willing to accept any outcome which agrees with your preconceived notions, where as I require absolute and undeniable evidence for any claims which contradict or oppose the word of God which I consider preeminent according to my world view.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","02:20 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","391"

As for his book, here is a review of it that shows his book is rather flawed. Not By Chance! Shattering The Modern Theory of Evolution. (Lee Spetner).","marc9000","385376","Of course he had to get a relgious press - any challange of 'neo-darwinism' in any way isn't going to get press in the scientific community, it will be ""expelled"" from it. We've all had that explained to us in the form of a movie. Someone from the scientific community claims his book is flawed?

"01-10-2010","10445",27,"birdan","385323","Nope. There are always examples of people irrationally dismissing a preponderance of evidence, so having ""everyone"" agreeing is not a good benchmark. There is a statistically significant portion (about 5% iirc) of the American populace that thinks the Apollo moon landings were a hoax. Given the preponderance of evidence against this position, I can dismiss their views, especially since their position seems to be based on ignorance to the existence of the mountain of evidence. You are making the implicit assumption that ""everyone"" is well informed on all topics and has weighed all the evidence and made an informed decision. Obviously that is not the case, so your criteria is flawed. Significant percentages of people will believe in something with no actual knowledge of the evidence, pro or con.","marc9000","385379","I was only referring to dismissal in the SCIENTIFIC realm, not personal opinions about historical events or worldviews. You know, open inquiry, the desire for new knowledge and the constant weighing of opposing theories against each other. There are far too many gaps in a complete, godless package of evolution for anyone to honestly claim that a concern with/debate about mathematical improbability can be disregarded.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","04:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","395"

Just as with your assumptions regarding the geology of the earth, I believe that the fossil record which evolutionists believe was created over hundreds of millions of years was actually deposited by the great flood quickly.

You must first submit yourself to the living God and commit your life to Jesus as your Lord and Savior. If you are sincere in your commitment to Him you will receive His Holy Spirit to dwell within you forevermore and you will then become one with God and will be literally born again. Once that change occurs within you, you will be a new creature and all of the spiritual truths which you are currently blind to will become obvious to you. You will truly know the truth and the truth will truly set you free. And the great thing is smiley, you won't rely on the words of any human being at all just as I don't. But you will know God's truths because His Holy Spirit will teach them to you. Here's the spiritual promise of what I am saying. Jhn 14:23 Jesus answered and said to him, ""If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our abode with him. Jhn 14:24 ""He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father's who sent Me. Jhn 14:25 ""These things I have spoken to you while abiding with you. Jhn 14:26 ""But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you. The bolded verse says it all regarding the promise that the holy spirit will teach you all things and confirm HIS truths for you. All you must do is trust Him with your life to be born again.
