Just as with your assumptions regarding the geology of the earth, I believe that the fossil record which evolutionists believe was created over hundreds of millions of years was actually deposited by the great flood quickly.

By the way the leading evolutionists think there is a problem with items found in coal and rock as they developed a theory that ~""under the right conditions and weather metal materials can pass through solid rock"" I don't remember who came up with the theory, but it had to be to address items in coal. This is from a left wing web site. Impossible Stuff Found In Coal and Rock By James Donahue It is said that coal is a by-product of decaying vegetation and that it takes from 30 to 300 million years for its natural production. Thus when ""impossible"" items like jewelry, a spoon, a metallic cube and other ""man-made"" objects are found in lumps of coal, we are inclined to perceive human history in a dramatically new light. There is a growing list of these items that made the news in their day, but then were put aside as unexplainable anomalies. When we put them all together, however, their existence challenges everything we thought we knew about the world and human history. There are many hard-line fundamentalists who would like to sweep such things under the rug so they don't confuse their archaic belief systems. Nevertheless, these things exist. We offer a list of the ones we presently know about. We are sure there are many others. The Morrisonville, Illinois Times, on June 11, 1891, said Mrs. S. W. Culp found a circular shaped eight-carat gold chain, about 10 inches long, embedded in a lump of coal after she broke it apart to put in her scuttle. The chain was described as ""antique"" and of ""quaint workmanship."" The story said only part of the chain was revealed when she first broke open the coal, and that the rest of the chain remained buried within the coal. The coal came from one of the southern Illinois mines. Yet another story found in Epoch Times told of a Colorado rancher who in the 1800s broke open a lump of coal, dug from a vein some 300 feet in the earth, and found a ""strange-looking iron thimble."" The item was dubbed the ""Thimble of Eve"" by the media. Since its discovery, however, and due to mishandling by its owners, the iron corroded and disintegrated. In 1944, when he was a boy of 10, Newton Anderson dropped a lump of coal in the basement of his home in Upshur County West Virginia. The coal, which had been mined near his home, broke open and out fell a brass bell with a long artistic handle with what is described as a ""demon-like"" figure at the end. An iron clapper was still attached within the bell. The bell has been featured in a 1992 CBS documentary titled ""Ancient Secrets of the Bible."" The bell now belongs to a Genesis Park collection, which we believe may be in New Hampshire. . Within the Creation Evidence Museum at Glen Rose, Texas, can be found a cast iron pot reportedly found in a large lump of coal in 1912 by a worker feeding coal into a local electric power plant. When he split open the coal the worker said the pot fell out, leaving its impression in the coal. The coal had been mined at Wilburton, Oklahoma. The bell and pot are being used by Christians to prove the Genesis story of Tubal Cain, who reportedly forged metals prior to the flood. A large ceramic spoon or ladle was found in the ashes of a coal stove by a woman in Pennsylvania in 1937. The item was sent to The Smithsonian Institute for examination, and remained buried in the volumes of artifacts stored there until its existence was made public in 1976. The Salzburg Cube is yet another ancient puzzle found by a worker named Reidl in an Austrian foundry in 1885. Like the others, this man broke open a block of coal and found a metal cube embedded inside. The mining engineer wrote off the item as a meteorite, but more recent analysis shows that the object was a forged iron and obviously hand crafted. The item is not perfectly square, with slightly rounded sides on two ends. It measures only two and a half by one and four-fifth of an inch. There is an incision that runs around it horizontally, suggesting it may have been a machine part. Workers in stone quarries also have found impossible objects. It is said that in 1844, quarry workers at Rutherford Mills, England, found a piece of gold thread embedded in rock about eight feet in the ground. The London Times in 1851 reported that Hiram DeWitt, of Springfield, Mass, brought a piece of quartz home from a trip to California. When the stone was accidentally dropped it split open and inside was a cut-iron six-penny nail. The nail was described as perfectly straight and with its head still intact. A British publication of 1845-51 contained a report by Sir David Brewster that a nail was found in a block of stone from the Kingoodie Quarry, North Britain. The head of the nail was exposed but an inch of it was embedded in the stone. The oxidized remains of a tapered, threaded iron screw was found in a piece of feldspar removed from a mine near Treasure City, Nevada, in 1869. Then there was a ""mystery object of exquisite workmanship"" found by workers in solid pudding stone, about 15 feet in the ground, at Dorchester, Mass. A story in the June, 1851 edition of Scientific American said the artifact was a ""bell-shaped vessel"" four and a half inches high, six and a half inches wide at the base, and two and a half inches wide at the top. The sides are inlaid with images of flowers, fines or a wreath. The object appears to be a composition of metals, and inlaid with silver.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","04:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","423"
"01-11-2010","10445",29,"syeater","385527",">Explain folded rock layers and how they could be produced in sudden, cataclysmic events.< I think soft mud would best explain folded rock layers, or else they would break under the pressure.","birdan","385573","No, that doesn't explain folded rock layers. Look at the following: The first image is a trilobite fossil. But the fossil has been stretched from the upper left to the lower right. ""Soft mud"" is not going to do this. But if the trilobite is fossilized and the sediment is lithified, then slow movement under lots of pressure and heat will deform both the fossil and its surrounding rock. The second image is of a lithified pebble bed. Note that all the pebbles have been stretched. Again, ""soft mud"" will not explain this. This stretching is called ductile deformation. It is the result of rock being subjected to extreme heat and pressure, and with slow movement, the rock will deform without breaking. Rapid movement, even under extreme heat and pressure, will simply break the rock. So we have an example of a trilobite which first had to be buried, then had to fossilize, then the surrounding sediment had to turn to rock, then that rock had to be buried to a depth giving it sufficient heat and pressure, and then all of that had to be stretched very slowly. Ductile deformation is easily explanable in a timeframe of millions of years, and impossible to explain in a timeframe of a few thousand years.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","07:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","425"
"01-11-2010","10445",29,"None","None","None","syeater","385577","First let me say I am no expert or scientist and do not claim to be one. Second, I agree that my believing God created the earth 6,000 years ago is based on faith. However, I have yet seen any scientific eviendence to prove against it, but I think there is some serious mental hoops to jump through if you believe earth is billions of years old, and life have evolved over a billion years or so. >CD410: Airplanes Buried in Ice< When it is convenient the layers are annual, when not they are many layers per season. I agree with the points on the web page, I also say if ice core samples would have been taken it would have shown a much long time period. You didnt directly address my point. As late as a few thousand years ago Greenland and possibly the Antarctic were ice free. How do you determine the ice cores are hundred of thousands years old let alone millions. >You are assuming that it was at a single level, and kept on getting weaker. However, geological data shows that the magnetic field goes through periods of reversal, and we are currently entering a time that it might flip over within a thousand years or so. The magnetic field would get weaker, reverse, then get stronger again. This has been mathematically modeled , and the model actually predicted some of the anomalies we are seeing.< I think there are some serious problems with reversal of the magnetic field and is more likely the result of water rushing in and cooling the rocks which would cause a differential in magnetic strength. But even if I give you this, you still have a problem. The last reversal was the Brunhes-Matuyama reversal approximately 780,000 years ago. That does not solve the issue; approximately 25,000 years ago (Ill give you 50,000 years or even 100,000) the earths magnetic field was so strong that it would kill all living life on earth. CE011: Earth's rotation slowing >The earth's rotation is slowing at a rate of about 0.005 seconds per year. This extrapolates to the earth having a fourteen-hour day 4.6 billion years ago, which is entirely possible. The rate at which the earth is slowing today is higher than average because the present rate of spin is in resonance with the back-and-forth movement of the oceans. Fossil rugose corals preserve daily and yearly growth patterns and show that the day was about 22 hours long 370 million years ago, in rough agreement with the 22.7 hours predicted from a constant rate of slowing (Scrutton 1964; Wells 1963).< It is closer to .0002 per day, that makes a quite a difference per year and puts a limit on life on earth. Leap seconds are added to keep the atomic clocks synchronized with the Earth's rotation. This is because the Earth rotates at a slower pace over time while the atomic clocks do not slow down. The Earth is rotating slower and slower over time, while the atomic clocks are not slowing down. On one average day the difference between atomic clocks and Earth's rotation is around 0.002 seconds, or around 1 second every 1.5 years. The time to do one rotation differs from day to day and from year to year. The Earth was slower than atomic clocks by: 0.16 seconds in 2005; 0.30 seconds in 2006; 0.31 seconds in 2007; and 0.32 seconds in 2008. It was only 0.02 seconds slower in 2001 (based on data from IERS). >CE110: Moon Receding # The moon is receding at about 3.8 cm per year. Since the moon is 3.85 1010 cm from the earth, this is already consistent, within an order of magnitude, with an earth-moon system billions of years old. # The magnitude of tidal friction depends on the arrangement of the continents. In the past, the continents were arranged such that tidal friction, and thus the rates of earth's slowing and the moon's recession, would have been less. The earth's rotation has slowed at a rate of two seconds every 100,000 years (Eicher 1976). # The rate of earth's rotation in the distant past can be measured. Corals produce skeletons with both daily layers and yearly patterns, so we can count the number of days per year when the coral grew. Measurements of fossil corals from 180 to 400 million years ago show year lengths from 381 to 410 days, with older corals showing more days per year (Eicher 1976; Scrutton 1970; Wells 1963; 1970). Similarly, days per year can also be computed from growth patterns in mollusks (Pannella 1976; Scrutton 1978) and stromatolites (Mohr 1975; Pannella et al. 1968) and from sediment deposition patterns (Williams 1997). All such measurements are consistent with a gradual rate of earth's slowing for the last 650 million years. # The clocks based on the slowing of earth's rotation described above provide an independent method of dating geological layers over most of the fossil record. The data is inconsistent with a young earth< I dont understand the rational, it is receding at 3.8 cm per year (Ill take your word for it) however that is not constant, it is based on the Inverse Square law: Inverse Square Law, General Any point source which spreads its influence equally in all directions without a limit to its range will obey the inverse square law. This comes from strictly geometrical considerations. The intensity of the influence at any given radius r is the source strength divided by the area of the sphere. Being strictly geometric in its origin, the inverse square law applies to diverse phenomena. Point sources of gravitational force, electric field, light, sound or radiation obey the inverse square law. It is a subject of continuing debate with a source such as a skunk on top of a flag pole; will it's smell drop off according to the inverse square law? Gravity : Inverse Square Law, Gravity As one of the fields which obey the general inverse square law, the gravity field can be put in the form shown below, showing that the acceleration of gravity, g, is an expression of the intensity of the gravity field.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","09:21 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","426"

I should also point out that each volcano sends out a unique mixture of materials in its ash, and analysis of ash can pinpoint the specific volcano it came from - a molecular fingerprint, if you will. The main point I'm trying to make is that ice core samples can be cross referenced to other geological events, and this cross referencing does verify that the patterns in the ice core samples do correspond to years.

When I was there, the cap was in retreat. From the edge near the coast, the cap goes up and up. At its highest point the cap reaches an altitude of about 3.3 Km above sea level. When you consider that the interior of the land mass is well below sea level, that makes a lot of ice to have formed in about 4000 years (since the mythical FLUD).
