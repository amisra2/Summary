Granted that evolution theory does not invoke GOD but on the other hand it does not deny GOD either. Its agnostic just like every science you might choose to name is. Physics, Chemistry, even Math are ""GODLESS"". Which is true but that can be said for ALL fields which involve human beings. But biases can be compensated for, results confirmed, conclusions tested against logic, and knowledge is possible even in the presense of some bias. Actually what scientists have is a provisional theory that material causes are sufficient to explain material outcomes. Its provisional and subject to falsification should anyone ever find a valid counter example. So far none such has turned up oddly enough. And yes under that assumption science must be agnostic. Just because GOD cannot get a foot in the door does not imply that he cannot stand outside the door does it?","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","01:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","5"

Period.","sinjin","286112","While I disagree with your opinion I understand your suspicion towards faith based beliefs. If something relies on faith alone, how likely is it really? As it happens there is evidence for the Big Bang: Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation Perhaps the most conclusive (and certainly among the most carefully examined) piece of evidence for the Big Bang is the existence of an isotropic radiation bath that permeates the entire Universe known as the ""cosmic microwave background"" (CMB). The word ""isotropic"" means the same in all directions; the degree of anisotropy of the CMB is about one part in a thousand. In 1965, two young radio astronomers, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, almost accidentally discovered the CMB using a small, well-calibrated horn antenna. It was soon determined that the radiation was diffuse, emanated unifromly from all directions in the sky, and had a temperature of approximately 2.7 Kelvin (ie 2.7 degrees above absolute zero). Initially, they could find no satisfactory explanation for their observations, and considered the possibility that their signal may have been due to some undetermined systematic noise. They even considered the possibility that it was due to ""a white dielectric substance"" (ie pigeon droppings) in their horn! However, it soon came to their attention through Robert Dicke and Jim Peebles of Princeton that this background radiation had in fact been predicted years earlier by George Gamow as a relic of the evolution of the early Universe. This background of microwaves was in fact the cooled remnant of the primeval fireball - an echo of the Big Bang. If the universe was once very hot and dense, the photons and baryons would have formed a plasma, ie a gas of ionized matter coupled to the radiation through the constant scattering of photons off ions and electrons. As the universe expanded and cooled there came a point when the radiation (photons) decoupled from the matter - this happened about a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang. That radiation cooled and is now at 2.7 Kelvin. The fact that the spectrum (see figure) of the radiation is almost exactly that of a ""black body"" (a physicists way of describing a perfect radiator) implies that it could not have had its origin through any prosaic means. This has led to the death of the steady state theory for example. In fact the CMB spectrum is a black body to better than 1% accuracy over more than a factor of 1000 in wavelength. This is a much more accurate black body than any we can make in the laboratory! By the early 1970's it became clear that the CMB sky is hotter in one direction and cooler in the opposite direction, with the temperature difference being a few mK (or about 0.1% of the overall temperature). The pattern of this temperature variation on the sky is known as a ""dipole"", and is exactly what is expected if we are moving through the background radiation at high speed in the direction of the hot part. The inference is that our entire local group of galaxies is moving in a particular direction at about 600 km/s. In the direction we are moving the wavelengths of the radiation are squashed together (a blue-shift), making the sky appear hotter there, while in the opposite direction the wavelengths are stretched out (redshift), making the sky appear colder there. When this dipole pattern, due to our motion, is removed, the CMB sky appears incredibly isotropic. Further investigations, including more recent ones by the COBE satellite (eg Smoot et. al.), confirmed the virtual isotropy of the CMB to better than one part in ten-thousand. Given this level of isotropy, together with the accurate black-body spectrum, any attempt to interpret the origin of the CMB as due to present astrophysical phenomena (i.e. stars, dust, radio galaxies, etc.) is no longer credible. Therefore, the only satisfactory explanation for the existence of the CMB lies in the physics of the early Universe. http://www.astro.ubc.ca/people/scott/cmb_intro.html","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","01:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","9"

Of course, in searching for the source of these quotes we find that they seem to be limited to creationist web sites. Nowhere can one find a correct attribution. Moreover, what Lewontin is saying is that science is not a matter of faith. He is saying that science rejects spiritualism as an effective cause and is limited to naturalistic explanations.

Where did the energy for the explosion come from?] that started as a microscopic dot and exploded and expanded faster than the speed of light. It started out as a very hot, very dense region that was smaller than a period. [As you know, when matter is heated, it expands . For something to be hot enough to explode faster than the speed of light, it would have to be larger than our minds can comprehend.] Eventually, all of the matter in the universe will again be compressed into a infinitesimal speck. [We know that the universe is expanding outward. It cannot possibly expand from light years to something smaller than an atom.] When the universe was a dot, it spun clockwise faster and faster until it exploded. [The Law of Angular Momentum states that if an object breaks apart in a frictionless environment, then the fragments will all spin the same direction. Yet if the universe started out as a spinning speck and exploded, then how is it that the universe is filled with exceptions where moons, planets, and even whole galaxies are spinning backwards?] To sum it all up, the Big Bang Theory states that 'nothing exploded and here we are!'","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","07:56 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","17"

Because an examination of the evidence shows that a bias/ ideology/ Godless belief system is the only real evidence for evolution theory:","Peeling","286264","Well, now, here's the thing: A hypothesis of special creation of all things (such as is described in the bible) is inconsistent with the evidence we can elicit from living things today. For instance, there's the amount of non-functional DNA we share with other creatures, in particular the other apes. With shared functional DNA, now, one could make a case for economy of design, but deliberately putting the same broken genes and garbage DNA into two entirely seperate species? Then there's the fact that some creatures have far better 'designed' bits than others for no readily apparent reason. A good example is the octopus eye, whose retina is supplied with blood from the rear rather than the front, both anchoring the retina more securely (no detached retina problems) and avoiding the 'blind spot' mammalian eyes possess. There's no reason at all for a designer capable of making an octupus to use the inferior mammalian design. Then there's the issue of vestigial features. Vestigial doesn't necessarily mean 'useless', more properly it describes something that is 'overengineered' for the purpose it currently serves, and often looks very much like a crippled version of a feature possessed by some other species. Ostrich wings, for example, may be useful for balancing when running, or in mating rituals, but they don't need to be wings in order to serve those purposes. Their complex and delicate internal structure is clearly 'designed' to allow flight, but their stunted development and the practical impossibility of such a big bird achieving self-powered flight make them a vestigial structure. Again, what rationale can be made for this being the work of a designer? Then there's the fossil record. Try as one might to twist the evidence to fit a biblical flood, it just won't go. Paleontologists have found spider tracks sandwiched in sandstone layers. Imagine, if you can, the delicate impressions of a spider's footsteps surviving a deluge sufficient to suspend and deposit yards and yards of sand atop them. Hydrodynamic sorting of fossils, or burial order, doesn't fit either, since it requires that we pretend all dinosaurs were large and slow moving (they weren't) and that all mammals are small, agile and fast-moving (they aren't). On and on it goes. If we take evolution off the table completely and look at the evidence before us, we have no explanation that fits. Special creation simply doesn't add up. With all creation myths falsified, what are we supposed to do? Just pretend the history of life on earth doesn't matter, or should be ignored? Evolution isn't what you come up with when you apply atheist thinking. Evolution is what you come up with when you discount all the extant hypotheses that don't fit the facts, be they religiously inspired or otherwise. Now, you may hold your hand up and complain that we're not admitting the possibility of some kind of divine guiding hand steering or helping evolution. And that's fair enough; we generally don't, for two different reasons: First, it doesn't really add anything to the theory; it doesn't increase its power to explain what we see. So while you can of course choose to believe that's what's happening, it doesn't have any scientific value. Secondly, there's arguably some merit in the attitude that religion has had its chance and blown it. For thousands of years religions have claimed to bear upon their backs the infallible word of god. Now, if the bible had been saying all along - centuries before the technology existed to verify it - that god coaxed organisms into evolving from simpler organisms over millions of years, that would be compelling evidence that the bible was accurate and divinely inspired, since it would contain accurate predictions (which no man could have made) about what we should find when we look into our DNA or beneath the ground. But it doesn't make those predictions. So why should we now pay attention when Intelligent Design evangelists do a 6000-year-too-late handbrake turn and invent a new faith-based explanation for the evidence? After all, they have no divine mandate to do so - it's the bible that's supposedly the word of god; they're just making stuff up as they go along.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","07:44 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","24"

Science has re-estimated the age of the universe since then. Matter can be taken apart, yes. Matter can seemingly disappear, yes. Matter cannot be destroyed (as in disappear from the universe completely). Also, what does the shining sun have to do with anything? I know the answers to those questions: God. Of coarse, that is assuming that the Big Bang really did occur. Actually, the heating and the expanding would have had to happen at the same time. When an object is heated, it expands as it heats, neither can occur without the other. Thereby, the heating must have occurred at the same time of the explosion. For my final disproving statement, I need to know if evos believe that the matter had always been there or not. Do tell. Touch. Again, evo science probably has changed since KH recorded his seminars. There is no up or down in space. I only used clockwise as an example. It could have been counterclockwise. Still, that doesn't counter my example. If indeed parts of the Big Bang were spinning in opposite directions, then the friction of the parts would interfere with the explosion, causing it to implode or even just stop all together. EDIT: To sum it all up, the Big Bang Theory states that 'nothing exploded and the universe was formed!'","obvious_child","286465","By a few hundred million years. That's not really significant. In accounting, we call it immaterial. Creationists have these asinine ideas that redefining dates by immaterial amounts results in their complete lack of credibility. Notice they don't do it for the financial statements of the Fortune 500 who do this every audit just to please their anal auditors. You don't see them arguing that those FSs are fraudulent. Your ignorance. And matter can be destroyed, or more accurately converted. Fire does this very well. The net weight of the log before you burn it is far greater then the matter of the ash. Matter has been destroyed and converted into heat and light. The shining sun is a perfect example of this, taking a nuclear reaction's matter and converting it into energy. I'm assuming you've burned things in the past. How can you say matter can't be destroyed? Explain why all of the oldest light comes from a single point. Because....expansion occurs after heat is added. How can a expansion occur with a prior cause? You're saying the reaction and cause happen at the same time. Show me an example that does that. But you said that they happen at the same time, then you contradict yourself. Make up your mind. And high pressure systems can prevent expansion while raising temperature. What? You just said that expansion occurs after heating. How can you now say that they occur at the same time? Ah the life of a Creationist, can't be bothered by their own contradictions Disproving what? That you have a education? That's pretty assured. We don't know if matter has always been. That does not mean God. Your argument is nothing more then ignorance = Goddidit. I bet you have no idea how a microwave works. God makes you food hot when you push the button eh? His seminars? You mean scams. Yes it does. What? Why do you assume that space is two dimensional?

Evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin said: we have a prior commitment to materialism. It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us to accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are forced by our priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counter-intuitiveMoreover, that materialism is an absolute, for we cannot allow a divine foot in the door.","supersport","286606","that quote just about says it all. Naturalistic explanations are not the result of scientific investigations...instead, naturalism is the assumption on which all investigations are based. In otherwords, the paradigm of naturalistic/materialistic causes is taken for granted...and instead of considering how the real physical evidence bears on the paradigm itself, todays scientists only wish to investigate the evidence within the naturalistic paradigm. Problems or contradictions that may occur in these investigations in no way are interpreted as a problem with the paradigm itself...instead, any contradictory data are just said to be ""unexplained"" or ""mysterious."" Contradictions are also just hand-waved as ""different points of view.""

Your link doesn't even cite its own source! http://sciencemole.wordpress.com/2007/05/ First of, it bumblee bees defy the flight based on calculations of fixed wing. They do not defy the laws of flight period. Only someone with absolutely no education or understanding of aerodynamics would believe this. Too bad people can read the thread and see you're lying right now, Don't you hate that? Actual evidence? You should use it now and again. I, unlike you, prefer to keep a quotation in context, allowing everyone to see exactly what the discussion was about. You however, being a slanderous and philosophical coward and the liar that you are have a tendency not to do this and only cherry picking information to make your argument look valid. No they don't. If I only posted your post, I would omit numerous people citing dynamic stalling proving you beyond wrong. You're ###### off because I included refutations of you in the link. Right now, no one thinks you tell the truth. After all, you have cited at least four different known hoaxes as evidence.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","03:45 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","71"

Under that logic, saying that a argument against birds with the wing spans of hundreds of feet using the same arguments are ridiculous. Do you even understand the wing span to mass to muscle relation? I don't see how that's ridiculous. By mythological statements about their alleged sizes. Furthermore we know just how much lift and energy is required to move mass off the ground. That can be correlated to necessary wing muscle and area necessary to generate such lift. Now if you put flapping in, the muscle requirements exponentially grow. Birds that primarily soar have much less wing muscle then birds that rely on flapping to move. With that exponential muscle and corresponding wing mass, the heat loss is exponential, thus increasing the necessary food requirements. So adding up the muscle, heat loss, size and necessary food requirements, the idea of a medieval type dragon is ridiculous. Now the Asian dragon myth is even more insane as those don't have wings yet can fly and even maneuver like a insect in flight.

Rom 1:28 And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper, Rom 1:29 being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; {they are} gossips, Rom 1:30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, Rom 1:31 without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful; Rom 1:32 and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","12:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","144"

So whenever Arch claims you are an atheist or you hate God or something truly asinine (as he always does) when you disagree with his view of Christianity, just shrug it off. If anything he's a heretic given his insane views and his delusions of grandeur. And Arch doesn't worship Christ. He worships the Bible. The Bible, not Christ is his God.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","04:27 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","193"

That is why I accused him of being not only a woman but the worst example of what a woman is. Because not all women are like this, only the most insecure and controlling of them. You see, the difference here is that I debated Matthew fairly and honestly and showed him WITH THE SCRIPTURES WE WERE DISCUSSING that he is a secular humanist who wants to be judged as a christian who knows the Lord. I showed that nothing he believes jives with the belief system of a true born again believer in Christ Jesus. I NEVER TOOK HIS ARGUMENTS, CORRUPTED THEM AND FED THEM BACK TO HIM AS I INSISTED THAT HE SAID SOMETHING HE NEVER SAID. How would you like it if in a debate you said that born again believers are brainwashed sheeple, which you probably do believe, and I continued to post months later that Tester debated and argued that all christians are devoted hatemongers who are dedicated to killing all atheists!!! Wouldn't you raise cain and insist that I quote you writing that? Wouldn't you report me and demand I retract such a lie and stop repeating it ad-infinitum? OF COURSE YOU WOULD. SO DON'T ACT SO SHOCKED THAT I AM INFURIATED BY THE DISHONESTY AND CHILDISH TACTICS WHICH THIS TROLLISH LIAR REPRESENTS. Getting my goat is one thing, but debating for pages on end and from debate to debate as he repeats lies and misrepresentations about things I have never ever said and have repeatedly said I neither said nor meant to say is a completely different type of psychosis. This jerk is crazy to continue to argue that I believe that anyone who relies on math must be an atheist when I have been calling that statement a lie for a year now, as just one example of his insanity. Only a lunatic would continue to tell another person what they believe after repeatedly being told that just isn't true. And if you're right about his motives, then he does deserve to be banned for that just for being a disruptive force on this forum who is spreading lies and misrepresenting another members arguments. This I challenge completely. Prove this statement if you can. But keep in mind that we are on a debate forum here. It is normal to disagree with others and respond with opposing views. But you better show it if you're going to imply that I twist, pervert and corrupt what others say and continue to repeat lies about their positions months and even years after debates are long dead.

And one could only wish he acted his age because he acts more like a 12 year old as he irrationally misrepresents what others, not just I say in debates. You have no idea how many people have just stopped posting here out of frustration from his lies about what they have said in debates. It's impossible to reason with a person who perverts the truth of what a person says in debate from post to post. This type of poster shouldn't be allowed to exist here at all since he is just a disruptive force rather than a contributing member who can be counted on for an honest and objective opinion. So I am doing a public service by standing up to him and clarifying what he is for all to plainly see so everyone recognizes him and his ilk on this and other forums.

Lematre who was a Belgian Roman Catholic priest, honorary prelate, professor of physics and astronomer at the Catholic University of Leuven. He proposed what became known as the Big Bang theory of the origin of the Universe, which he called his 'hypothesis of the primeval atom'. (see: Georges Lematre on Kosmix : Reference, Videos, Images, News, Shopping and more... ) Lemaitre was not an atheist. Also, Gregor Mendel, a monk, as you probably know, started work on the field of genetics. There is a LOT of proof for evolution in genetics. Point being, not all scientists are atheists.

Otherwise, if I don't conclude that he is mentally ill, the only other option is to conclude that he is a committed fabricator of facts, a false witness, a falsifier of reality, a maligner of his opponents stated beliefs, a purposeful perjurer, and an unapologetic prevaricator who prefers to lie about a persons beliefs in opposition to the stated truth of what another person insists they actually believe. So which is it? Either way what is painfully obvious is that attempting to reason with such a person is a complete waste of time. as he has proven to be beyond the capability of rational discourse. My only option if admin refuses to ban such a member, is to ignore him. So consider it done.

Report my post if you must, but I hate it when I'm not taken seriously by an evolutionist because they think that all creationists have to toss in insults to defend themselves. Saying someone else is dumb does not prove them dumb or prove yourself intelligent. The same thing goes for good and evil. Evolution could have been God's device for creating the world. It does not have to be ""evil"" or ""wrong"" within the Christian or Jewish belief system. It could have taken six days. It could have taken six million years. It could have been instantly.

If you find a wormhole that takes 10 minutes to traverse 300 lightyears from earth, then you will see the earth 300 years ago from that point in space, correct? Following that thinking, if you find the origin of the universe according to The Big Bang Theory, traverse a wormhole however many lightyears you deem the universe has existed away from it (ultimately hitting the edge of the universe) and traverse to that point in space nearly instantly so that you can see nearly the beginning of the universe, would you see nothing when you look back?

I appreciate the fact that in your inability to get my handle correct that you assign to me an Indian honorific that means ""wise or learned."" Or perhaps it was by intention. I would never refer to myself as either wise or learned, although I am well educated. And your belief in the mythology of bronze age nomadic herdsmen somehow indicates common sense? Since when did magic become common sense? How is it anything but nonsense to claim certain knowledge because of something that you don't know? Perhaps if you made an effort to learn what science is and how it works you wouldn't make yourself look like such a fool by demanding ""proof."" Science doesn't offer proof. It offers natural explanations of observations of natural phenomena. The other side of the coin is that you claim truth based on mythology that isn't based on a single bit of observable evidence. Of course I don't claim proof for science. I'm neither stupid nor a fool. On the other hand, you can't claim the same. I suspect that you don't actually understand any of the scientific terms that you used. Symbiotic life forms do not form interdependent chains. You only make yourself look foolish when you speak without learning at least the basics about which you speak. Neither predator/prey nor parasite/host relationships are symbiotic. The religious claptrap of the chain of being from primitive to advanced was rejected hundreds of years ago, with the development of real, empirical science. But still, we have the uneducated fundamentalists, like you, who are living in the middle ages. Actually, no. I don't claim that life spontaneously appeared by accident 4.5 billion years ago. The earth is only about 4.5 billion years old and only a fool would assert that life arose with the formation of the earth. However, there is fossil evidence that life had arisen by about 3.8 billion years ago. I don't personally make any claims about how that happened. I don't know. I do think that it was by natural means, since there is no evidence of the magic that you claim as the cause. As I stated, life is evidence of life. Nothing more. Don't be stupid. I have watched hawks preying on doves in my back yard. How is it that you think that the dove cooperates with the hawk? As for any claims of mathematical impossibility, I wouldn't be so stupid. I leave that to creationists who seem to lack the intelligence to understand that after the fact calculations of probabilities are meaningless. Please explain to me about the concern that lions have for the animals that they eat. Pleeaasse! That's pandit pandion, to you. Or wise pandion, or learned pandion will do. But I don't ""believe"" in evolutionary biology ""by faith."" My faith is something quite different from what you think it is. But it was a nice try in trying to reduce a body of scientific theory to the level of belief in magic. What you believe in by faith is nothing more that a belief in magic and the mythology of an old book. Actually, what I accept isn't based on assumptions. I base it on lots of empirical evidence that I have studied for many years. But if you want to talk about unprovable assumptions, why don't you explain to us why any rational person should accept the idiocy of the mythology of bronze age nomadic herdsmen as true. How is that not an assumption? That's just ignorant. If your petty magic man were self evident then there wouldn't be any debate. Your god is mythological.

And you hate me because I have single handedly opposed each and every one of you since arriving here. I have punched more holes in your shallow and empty world views than can be found in a window screen. Your so called theory of evolution is a sham which you can't defend with one iota of absolute scientifically tested and repeatable evidence. You rely on the so called evidence of flawed men who come to conclusions which can't be verified in any real way at all, yet they combine various so called observation, add them together and claim these prove that certain things occurred in certain orders multiple billions of years ago. Never realizing or admitting to themselves that if even one equation is off by one decimal point the impact that has on all of the combined theories renders them useless as originally intended. And that's just one decimal point for one theory. What if multiple decimal points are off by only that much? And I'm telling you they are. This means that the calculations you have relied on are as bogus as your world view is. But hey, I'm just a christian so what do I know, right? Well you will see one day what I knew, and you will learn that all of the people you clung to as allies lied to you and deceived you with their man made philosophies which agreed with you, while this christian whom you detest was the guy who showed you true love and respect because he dared to tell you the real truth which mattered in spite of the unending barrage of insults you spewed non stop at him.

"01-08-2010","10445",24,"Terry Pratchett, Science of Discworld","None","after the fact calculations of probabilities are meaningless. LETS HEAR IT FROM THE OTHER NINE! I want to explore just how dismissive the atheist mind really is concerning realities other than ""science"". after the fact calculations of probabilities are meaningless. [A viewer from another world looks down at prehistoric Earth] The ice age was clearing up. He wondered what was happening down there, what gastropod or mammal or lizard was even now winding up it's elastic ready to propel itself towards the crown of the world. Soon, without a doubt, some creature would develop an unnecessarily large brain and be forced to do things with it. And it'd look around and probably declare how marvellous it was that the universe had been built to bring forward the inevitable development of creature-kind. Boy, was it in for a shock...","iangb","385145","Not sure if I count as one of 'the other nine'*, but here goes nothing... Take a fair coin. Toss it 10 times. The probability that you will get that precise pattern of heads and tails is 1 in 2^10, or just under a 0.1% chance. However, that doesn't mean that the fact you got that incredibly unlikely pattern in a single set of tosses is not an 'indication that God exists'. Another example, and one that demonstrates one of the most common misunderstandings about 'unlikely events': Get 23 people in a room together. There is a greater than 50% chance that two of those people will share the same birthday , despite the fact that there are many more days in a year than people in the room. Increase that number up to 57 people - less than a sixth of the number of days in a year! - and the probability shoots up to over 99%. Again, the fact that two of them share a birthday would not indicate divine providence. There are a great many such examples I could have used, from the fact that someone wins the UK lottery most weeks (at odds of 14 million to one) to the fact that you exist, with your precise genetic code (at incalculable but astronomic odds, given the mixing of your parents DNA, all the factors that led your parents to meet each other etc, plus their parents and their parents and so on). The facts remain - firstly, 'statistically impossible' events happen all the time, because if they hadn't happened that particular way, they would have happened a slightly different way instead, as per the coin toss/your genes example. See my Pratchett quote, below. Secondly, lots of trials make even vanishing possibilities of a single event much, much more likely, as per the lottery/birthday problem example One final example of probability abuse would be refuted by snowflakes. Snowflakes are created by water molecules locking in place as the water transits from liquid to solid, as I'm sure you know (with a few extra complications). If you approach snowflake formation in the same manner that I have seen most ID arguments approach probability (for example, that of amino acids forming) then you would assume that molecules can form at any angle to each other and in any pattern, calculate the probability that all the water in a snowflake had frozen in that precise geometric pattern and conclude that all snowflakes must be Intelligently Designed. However, this simply isn't the case - not only are there lots of snowflakes, but the laws governing crystalline water result in beauty. That's not God - it's described by physics, not theology. I'll leave you with the words of Terry Pratchett, discussing the natural state of intelligent life. (Rant demoted to footnote status) *which, incidentally, you are getting close to by making blanket statements about 'the atheist mind'. Oh, and ignoring the fact that Archie has ignore the only actual refutation to his arguments (mine, post #323 and #325), instead focusing only on the flak.

Beside, I haven't lied about anything and have framed my arguments against evolution so coherently that I have reduced you apologists to this irrational, raving and specious response which this diatribe of a post is. The preposterous and therefore mindless ramblings you subject us to are in and of themselves an affront to common sense and rational discourse. Yet you spout these inane criticisms so easily, one would think you actually believe your massively ignorant assumptions regarding my beliefs about science in general. But if it floats your boat, you can think anything you like about me because it has no impact on my reality at all. Nice rant, too bad its just that and nothing more. Oh, and by the way my looney and irrational simpleton, I don't believe in magic in spite of what you and other deranged crazies say. It is actually outlawed and condemned in the bible. Here's what I mean for your edification, although I'm sure it's a waste of bandwidth. Those who follow the path of the magic arts are on the wrong path - a road that leads away from God, not toward Him. In one way or another, the end will be disaster. The evil Queen Jezebel practiced witchcraft (2 Kings 9:22) bringing catastrophe on herself and all Israel. Over and over, God denounces those who conjure spells (NKJV) and those who practice witchcraft and sorcery. The Bible says that anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord (Deuteronomy 18:10-12; 2 Kings 21:6; Micah 5:12; Isaiah 47:12; Ezekiel 13:18, 20; Acts 8:11-24; Leviticus 20:27; Exodus 7:11; Revelation 9:21; 22:15). God warns of the ultimate punishment. Revelation 21:8 says of ""those who practice magic arts their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur the second death"" (NIV). Those who practice witchcraft (sorcery) will not inherit the kingdom of God (Galatians 5:20-21). So like pandion and others around here, you throw labels around based on a complete ignorance of what I and other believers in Messiah actually believe in. Yet none of you have posted absolutely any evidence at all refuting my arguments. If I am so ignorant then why is it that all you guys have are these insulting rants against me while producing none of that scientific evidence you claim is so overwhelming.

The contents of the Universe include 4% atoms (ordinary matter), 23% of an unknown type of dark matter, and 73% of a mysterious dark energy. The new measurements even shed light on the nature of the dark energy, which acts as a sort of an anti-gravity. NASA - Top Story - NEW IMAGE OF INFANT UNIVERSE REVEALS ERA OF FIRST STARS, AGE OF COSMOS, AND MORE - Feb. 11, 2003 So, what do we actually have here? Although they speak in very confident tones, we see here in the bolded that the prior theories of the Big Bang and Inflation continue to ring true, but even Nasa doesn't speak in absolute terms at all. Ringing true is in no way an absolute statement of undeniable fact, especially since fully 96% of the energy in the Universe is an unknown type of dark matter, or a mysterious dark energy. Also, they observe that the new measurements even shed light on the nature of the dark energy, which acts as a sort of an anti-gravity, is it realistic to make interpretations and conclusions based on such preliminary observations which haven't even been confirmed absolutely yet? So the question must be asked, is it impossible to answer affirmatively in absolute terms how reliable these interpretations are regarding the age of the universe or the Big Bang event itself. They openly admit that these conclusions are based on predictions other unnamed cosmic theories make, so there is absolutely nothing absolute about this evidence at all. It is all based on interpretation which I maintain is impossible to do without all of the information which is impossible to gather because we don't really know what questions to ask at this point from our distant perspective in both time and space from the actual event. Science is grasping at straws so to speak, which I respect and encourage. I respect the work cosmology is doing as a legitimate science, my only problem is the hubris involved in making assumptions that we are anywhere close to understanding the full picture required to fully and accurately assess first how the universe came into being and then, the age of it. As I have said before to the consternation of the humanist opposition and in fulfillment of TQs prediction, a misreading of this evidence and sciences preconceived belief in a universe that is billions of years old could mean that our universe is not billions of years old at all, but could be only thousands of years old. And I'm making no absolute statement of fact in that regard either, all I'm saying is that the possibility exists and nothing science has come up with is absolute evidence of anything concrete which you are placing an equal amount of faith in. Evolution and the science surrounding it is as much a religion to you as my belief and faith in my God is to me. After all, the article goes on to say this: Theories about the evolution of the Universe make specific predictions about the extent of these temperature patterns. Like a detective, the WMAP team compared the unique ""fingerprint"" of patterns imprinted on this ancient light with fingerprints predicted by various cosmic theories and found a match. I must ask another question here, what if the so called ancient light is not really so ancient? What if they never assumed the light to be ancient? How then would the predicted fingerprint match by these various cosmic theories then be interpreted? And what would that conclusion be? So let me be clear, to steal a cliche from our president, I don't question the observations we are making via the technological discoveries we are learning from, but I understand very well that interpretation is everything and even the scientists involved in these discoveries don't speak in nearly the absolute terms that you layman defenders of these observations do. So nice try, but this evidence doesn't meet the standards which I requested from iangb by any measure of an absolute result. When did I claim that I have undeniable scientific evidence that the Genesis account is provable pandion? Haven't I said here and elsewhere in debate that we both rely on faith in believing our preferred world views? It's just that my faith is in an eternal, all knowing Creator God who claims to have personally spoken this world into creation along with humanity whom He created in His image. And all of the proceeding reality such as Mans dominion over all life on earth and our superiority over that life remains true to this day. You secular humanists on the other hand rely on the very flawed observations of fallen men and their interpretations of cosmic events which we are in no position to discern since admittedly 96% of the content of the universe is made up of undefinable and as of yet indiscernible Dark Matter or Dark Energy. So what incredible hubris is required to place your faith in such unknowable conclusions which are based in such unprovable assumptions? PS, my automatic spell checker automatically corrects your name pandion to pandit every time I write it out. So I didn't misspell your name on purpose, I failed to catch its change by the computer and correct it.

While you're at it, explain how meteor craters are found in geological layers that you insist we're laid down by the flood. Just so we're all clear here, for your claim to be correct, there would have to be the flood, numerous meteors fall on the (presumably) still mobile sediments, which somehow solidify just before the meteor strikes (otherwise it wouldn't produce the characteristic crater pattern), then the brand spanking new crater is weathered to make it appear that millions of years of erosion takes place, while new sediments cover it up and also solidify (repeat a few times, otherwise we can't explain multiple impacts in similar locations), all in the span of 40 days. I guess I'll add a couple more questions-how do sediments instantaneously become rock? And why just the section where the meteor struck? Can sediments sense an incoming meteor, and while some sediment dodges, the rest solidifies to ""catch"" the meteor? Then the ""dodgy"" sediment comes back, quickly erodes the suddenly solid portions, and covers them up and itself solidifies, all in a manner that we'd expect to see on a 4.5 billion year old planet? Explain folded rock layers and how they could be produced in sudden, cataclysmic events. Explain varves, and ice cores, and how even though the have every appearance of being laid down annually over millenia (preserving annual pollen and spore samples, just as we'd expect), they were actually laid down in 40 days a few thousand years ago. Explain how the flood (and a biblical age of the earth) accounts for all that, and more, better than the theory that everyone with two brain cells to rub together accepts.

Accipiter has already given the reason we don't see as many craters on earth as other bodies in the solar system. But I'll just talk about the confirmed craters as pointed out on your map, and we can compare those to Mt. St. Helens. The Mt. St. Helens eruption was the equivalent of a 24 megaton bomb going off. For reference purposes, the largest atomic bomb ever tested was a 25 megaton hydrogen bomb, and the Hiroshima bomb was a 0.01 megaton bomb. Now, if we take Isaac Newton's formula for kinetic energy (E = 1/2mv^2), we can calculate the amount of energy needed to create all those craters on your map. The result: over one billion megatons of energy. That would be the same as 40 million Mt. Saint Helens eruptions! Over a 5,000 year YEC period, that would be the equivalent of twenty 25 megaton bombs exploding every single day ! It would be the equivalent of 23 Mount St. Helens eruptions every single day ! Of course, even young earth creationists don't believe that such catastrophic events have been happening for the past 3,000 years at least, and most young earth creationist literature I've read attributes the above meteor impacts to a single ""flood year"". That would mean that during the ""flood year"" there was the equivalent of 40 million Mount St. Helens eruptions on the earth . If the earth is only thousands of years old, then those meteor impacts should have obliterated the surface of the earth and generated sufficient heat to boil away the oceans. Or the basic physics of Isaac Newton are another aspect of science that young earth creationism rejects. Or those meteor impacts never really happened. If the earth is at least several hundreds of millions of years old, then the above meteor impacts present no problem as evidence of a history of events.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","08:05 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","415"

CE011: Earth's rotation slowing The earth's rotation is slowing at a rate of about 0.005 seconds per year per year. This extrapolates to the earth having a fourteen-hour day 4.6 billion years ago, which is entirely possible. The rate at which the earth is slowing today is higher than average because the present rate of spin is in resonance with the back-and-forth movement of the oceans. Fossil rugose corals preserve daily and yearly growth patterns and show that the day was about 22 hours long 370 million years ago, in rough agreement with the 22.7 hours predicted from a constant rate of slowing (Scrutton 1964; Wells 1963). CE110: Moon Receding # The moon is receding at about 3.8 cm per year. Since the moon is 3.85 1010 cm from the earth, this is already consistent, within an order of magnitude, with an earth-moon system billions of years old. # The magnitude of tidal friction depends on the arrangement of the continents. In the past, the continents were arranged such that tidal friction, and thus the rates of earth's slowing and the moon's recession, would have been less. The earth's rotation has slowed at a rate of two seconds every 100,000 years (Eicher 1976). # The rate of earth's rotation in the distant past can be measured. Corals produce skeletons with both daily layers and yearly patterns, so we can count the number of days per year when the coral grew. Measurements of fossil corals from 180 to 400 million years ago show year lengths from 381 to 410 days, with older corals showing more days per year (Eicher 1976; Scrutton 1970; Wells 1963; 1970). Similarly, days per year can also be computed from growth patterns in mollusks (Pannella 1976; Scrutton 1978) and stromatolites (Mohr 1975; Pannella et al. 1968) and from sediment deposition patterns (Williams 1997).

By the way the leading evolutionists think there is a problem with items found in coal and rock as they developed a theory that ~""under the right conditions and weather metal materials can pass through solid rock"" I don't remember who came up with the theory, but it had to be to address items in coal. This is from a left wing web site. Impossible Stuff Found In Coal and Rock By James Donahue It is said that coal is a by-product of decaying vegetation and that it takes from 30 to 300 million years for its natural production. Thus when ""impossible"" items like jewelry, a spoon, a metallic cube and other ""man-made"" objects are found in lumps of coal, we are inclined to perceive human history in a dramatically new light. There is a growing list of these items that made the news in their day, but then were put aside as unexplainable anomalies. When we put them all together, however, their existence challenges everything we thought we knew about the world and human history. There are many hard-line fundamentalists who would like to sweep such things under the rug so they don't confuse their archaic belief systems. Nevertheless, these things exist. We offer a list of the ones we presently know about. We are sure there are many others. The Morrisonville, Illinois Times, on June 11, 1891, said Mrs. S. W. Culp found a circular shaped eight-carat gold chain, about 10 inches long, embedded in a lump of coal after she broke it apart to put in her scuttle. The chain was described as ""antique"" and of ""quaint workmanship."" The story said only part of the chain was revealed when she first broke open the coal, and that the rest of the chain remained buried within the coal. The coal came from one of the southern Illinois mines. Yet another story found in Epoch Times told of a Colorado rancher who in the 1800s broke open a lump of coal, dug from a vein some 300 feet in the earth, and found a ""strange-looking iron thimble."" The item was dubbed the ""Thimble of Eve"" by the media. Since its discovery, however, and due to mishandling by its owners, the iron corroded and disintegrated. In 1944, when he was a boy of 10, Newton Anderson dropped a lump of coal in the basement of his home in Upshur County West Virginia. The coal, which had been mined near his home, broke open and out fell a brass bell with a long artistic handle with what is described as a ""demon-like"" figure at the end. An iron clapper was still attached within the bell. The bell has been featured in a 1992 CBS documentary titled ""Ancient Secrets of the Bible."" The bell now belongs to a Genesis Park collection, which we believe may be in New Hampshire. . Within the Creation Evidence Museum at Glen Rose, Texas, can be found a cast iron pot reportedly found in a large lump of coal in 1912 by a worker feeding coal into a local electric power plant. When he split open the coal the worker said the pot fell out, leaving its impression in the coal. The coal had been mined at Wilburton, Oklahoma. The bell and pot are being used by Christians to prove the Genesis story of Tubal Cain, who reportedly forged metals prior to the flood. A large ceramic spoon or ladle was found in the ashes of a coal stove by a woman in Pennsylvania in 1937. The item was sent to The Smithsonian Institute for examination, and remained buried in the volumes of artifacts stored there until its existence was made public in 1976. The Salzburg Cube is yet another ancient puzzle found by a worker named Reidl in an Austrian foundry in 1885. Like the others, this man broke open a block of coal and found a metal cube embedded inside. The mining engineer wrote off the item as a meteorite, but more recent analysis shows that the object was a forged iron and obviously hand crafted. The item is not perfectly square, with slightly rounded sides on two ends. It measures only two and a half by one and four-fifth of an inch. There is an incision that runs around it horizontally, suggesting it may have been a machine part. Workers in stone quarries also have found impossible objects. It is said that in 1844, quarry workers at Rutherford Mills, England, found a piece of gold thread embedded in rock about eight feet in the ground. The London Times in 1851 reported that Hiram DeWitt, of Springfield, Mass, brought a piece of quartz home from a trip to California. When the stone was accidentally dropped it split open and inside was a cut-iron six-penny nail. The nail was described as perfectly straight and with its head still intact. A British publication of 1845-51 contained a report by Sir David Brewster that a nail was found in a block of stone from the Kingoodie Quarry, North Britain. The head of the nail was exposed but an inch of it was embedded in the stone. The oxidized remains of a tapered, threaded iron screw was found in a piece of feldspar removed from a mine near Treasure City, Nevada, in 1869. Then there was a ""mystery object of exquisite workmanship"" found by workers in solid pudding stone, about 15 feet in the ground, at Dorchester, Mass. A story in the June, 1851 edition of Scientific American said the artifact was a ""bell-shaped vessel"" four and a half inches high, six and a half inches wide at the base, and two and a half inches wide at the top. The sides are inlaid with images of flowers, fines or a wreath. The object appears to be a composition of metals, and inlaid with silver.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","04:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","423"

Look at the following: The first image is a trilobite fossil. But the fossil has been stretched from the upper left to the lower right. ""Soft mud"" is not going to do this. But if the trilobite is fossilized and the sediment is lithified, then slow movement under lots of pressure and heat will deform both the fossil and its surrounding rock. The second image is of a lithified pebble bed. Note that all the pebbles have been stretched. Again, ""soft mud"" will not explain this. This stretching is called ductile deformation. It is the result of rock being subjected to extreme heat and pressure, and with slow movement, the rock will deform without breaking. Rapid movement, even under extreme heat and pressure, will simply break the rock. So we have an example of a trilobite which first had to be buried, then had to fossilize, then the surrounding sediment had to turn to rock, then that rock had to be buried to a depth giving it sufficient heat and pressure, and then all of that had to be stretched very slowly. Ductile deformation is easily explanable in a timeframe of millions of years, and impossible to explain in a timeframe of a few thousand years.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","07:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","425"

Second, I agree that my believing God created the earth 6,000 years ago is based on faith. However, I have yet seen any scientific eviendence to prove against it, but I think there is some serious mental hoops to jump through if you believe earth is billions of years old, and life have evolved over a billion years or so. >CD410: Airplanes Buried in Ice< When it is convenient the layers are annual, when not they are many layers per season. I agree with the points on the web page, I also say if ice core samples would have been taken it would have shown a much long time period. You didnt directly address my point.

But even if I give you this, you still have a problem. The last reversal was the Brunhes-Matuyama reversal approximately 780,000 years ago. That does not solve the issue; approximately 25,000 years ago (Ill give you 50,000 years or even 100,000) the earths magnetic field was so strong that it would kill all living life on earth.

Leap seconds are added to keep the atomic clocks synchronized with the Earth's rotation. This is because the Earth rotates at a slower pace over time while the atomic clocks do not slow down. The Earth is rotating slower and slower over time, while the atomic clocks are not slowing down. On one average day the difference between atomic clocks and Earth's rotation is around 0.002 seconds, or around 1 second every 1.5 years. The time to do one rotation differs from day to day and from year to year. The Earth was slower than atomic clocks by: 0.16 seconds in 2005; 0.30 seconds in 2006; 0.31 seconds in 2007; and 0.32 seconds in 2008. It was only 0.02 seconds slower in 2001 (based on data from IERS). >CE110: Moon Receding # The moon is receding at about 3.8 cm per year.

This comes from strictly geometrical considerations. The intensity of the influence at any given radius r is the source strength divided by the area of the sphere. Being strictly geometric in its origin, the inverse square law applies to diverse phenomena. Point sources of gravitational force, electric field, light, sound or radiation obey the inverse square law. It is a subject of continuing debate with a source such as a skunk on top of a flag pole; will it's smell drop off according to the inverse square law?

The glaciers have been retreating for a long time. When I spent a year in northern Greenland in the mid 60s, the land from the base to the ice cap was a series of moraines that marked the advance and retreat of the ice cap over the past several thousand years. When I was there, the cap was in retreat. From the edge near the coast, the cap goes up and up. At its highest point the cap reaches an altitude of about 3.3 Km above sea level. When you consider that the interior of the land mass is well below sea level, that makes a lot of ice to have formed in about 4000 years (since the mythical FLUD). Back when I was there the researchers working on the cap had counted over 250,000 annual layers in the ice cores. You miss the point. We know when many, many volcanic eruptions took place. In the case of historic eruptions we know when right down to the day. Those eruptions have left ash-fall in the Greenland ice cap. The Vesuvius eruption that destroyed Pompeii is clearly visible, as is Krakatoa. Those layers are right where they are expected to be.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","09:57 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","435"
"01-12-2010","10445",30,"syeater","385556","I don't have time right now to answer everything but will get back to it later. By the way the leading evolutionists think there is a problem with items found in coal and rock as they developed a theory that ~""under the right conditions and weather metal materials can pass through solid rock"" I don't remember who came up with the theory, but it had to be to address items in coal. This is from a left wing web site. Impossible Stuff Found In Coal and Rock By James Donahue It is said that coal is a by-product of decaying vegetation and that it takes from 30 to 300 million years for its natural production. Thus when ""impossible"" items like jewelry, a spoon, a metallic cube and other ""man-made"" objects are found in lumps of coal, we are inclined to perceive human history in a dramatically new light. There is a growing list of these items that made the news in their day, but then were put aside as unexplainable anomalies. When we put them all together, however, their existence challenges everything we thought we knew about the world and human history. There are many hard-line fundamentalists who would like to sweep such things under the rug so they don't confuse their archaic belief systems. Nevertheless, these things exist. We offer a list of the ones we presently know about. We are sure there are many others. The Morrisonville, Illinois Times, on June 11, 1891, said Mrs. S. W. Culp found a circular shaped eight-carat gold chain, about 10 inches long, embedded in a lump of coal after she broke it apart to put in her scuttle. The chain was described as ""antique"" and of ""quaint workmanship."" The story said only part of the chain was revealed when she first broke open the coal, and that the rest of the chain remained buried within the coal. The coal came from one of the southern Illinois mines. Yet another story found in Epoch Times told of a Colorado rancher who in the 1800s broke open a lump of coal, dug from a vein some 300 feet in the earth, and found a ""strange-looking iron thimble."" The item was dubbed the ""Thimble of Eve"" by the media. Since its discovery, however, and due to mishandling by its owners, the iron corroded and disintegrated. In 1944, when he was a boy of 10, Newton Anderson dropped a lump of coal in the basement of his home in Upshur County West Virginia. The coal, which had been mined near his home, broke open and out fell a brass bell with a long artistic handle with what is described as a ""demon-like"" figure at the end. An iron clapper was still attached within the bell. The bell has been featured in a 1992 CBS documentary titled ""Ancient Secrets of the Bible."" The bell now belongs to a Genesis Park collection, which we believe may be in New Hampshire. . Within the Creation Evidence Museum at Glen Rose, Texas, can be found a cast iron pot reportedly found in a large lump of coal in 1912 by a worker feeding coal into a local electric power plant. When he split open the coal the worker said the pot fell out, leaving its impression in the coal. The coal had been mined at Wilburton, Oklahoma. The bell and pot are being used by Christians to prove the Genesis story of Tubal Cain, who reportedly forged metals prior to the flood. A large ceramic spoon or ladle was found in the ashes of a coal stove by a woman in Pennsylvania in 1937. The item was sent to The Smithsonian Institute for examination, and remained buried in the volumes of artifacts stored there until its existence was made public in 1976. The Salzburg Cube is yet another ancient puzzle found by a worker named Reidl in an Austrian foundry in 1885. Like the others, this man broke open a block of coal and found a metal cube embedded inside. The mining engineer wrote off the item as a meteorite, but more recent analysis shows that the object was a forged iron and obviously hand crafted. The item is not perfectly square, with slightly rounded sides on two ends. It measures only two and a half by one and four-fifth of an inch. There is an incision that runs around it horizontally, suggesting it may have been a machine part. Workers in stone quarries also have found impossible objects. It is said that in 1844, quarry workers at Rutherford Mills, England, found a piece of gold thread embedded in rock about eight feet in the ground. The London Times in 1851 reported that Hiram DeWitt, of Springfield, Mass, brought a piece of quartz home from a trip to California. When the stone was accidentally dropped it split open and inside was a cut-iron six-penny nail. The nail was described as perfectly straight and with its head still intact. A British publication of 1845-51 contained a report by Sir David Brewster that a nail was found in a block of stone from the Kingoodie Quarry, North Britain. The head of the nail was exposed but an inch of it was embedded in the stone. The oxidized remains of a tapered, threaded iron screw was found in a piece of feldspar removed from a mine near Treasure City, Nevada, in 1869. Then there was a ""mystery object of exquisite workmanship"" found by workers in solid pudding stone, about 15 feet in the ground, at Dorchester, Mass. A story in the June, 1851 edition of Scientific American said the artifact was a ""bell-shaped vessel"" four and a half inches high, six and a half inches wide at the base, and two and a half inches wide at the top. The sides are inlaid with images of flowers, fines or a wreath. The object appears to be a composition of metals, and inlaid with silver.","trebor","385604","Let's see you provide actual evidence that this happened.

"01-12-2010","10445",30,"birdan","385571","We can do a 'back of the envelope' calculation to get some ballpark numbers: I read somewhere that the plate tectonic movement occurred during the flood year. Let's say the average movement of the tectonic plates was equal to the distance from New York to Los Angeles, 2777 miles. This number is way low, but I'll use conservative numbers. So, 2777 miles is equal to 7.608 miles per day, and that converts to .1417 meters / second. The mass of the continental and oceanic crusts is roughly 2.83 X 10^23 kilograms. We know (from Isaac Newton) that kinetic energy is: E = 1/2 mv^2, and plugging the above numbers into the formula yields 2.8 X 10^21 joules of energy. Since the continents are (effectively) not moving at present, the above kinetic energy had to be dissipated as heat, and that much heat would pretty much boil the oceans. If we factor in magma, volcanoes, etc. the situation becomes more dire. So, the choices are: 1. Centuries old physics is completely out to lunch. 2. Rapid tectonics did not happen in the past several thousand years 3. The wealth of evidence indicating tectonic movement is really fake, created several thousand years ago. 4. The tectonic plates have been moving very slowly over many millions of years.","gansao","385605","Thanks for taking the time to post this Birdan.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","10:00 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","437"

So far, none of the people who claim to have found man-made items in coal or other ancient rock strata have allowed their specimen to be inspected. Some are selling molds or recreations of such items but refuse to allow for inspection of the original. One source I read says that sediment and coal dust from the mining process often collects in water puddles and later hardens into a coal-like solid substance. I grew up in a coal mining town and I have seen small scale examples of this. Maybe this is what was found and that is why none of these items are being brought forward for inspection.
