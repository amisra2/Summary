"10-02-2007","10445",2,"Benjamin","286096","Evolution theory is not science at all, it is faith. Period. How can I conclude that? Because an examination of the evidence shows that a bias/ ideology/ Godless belief system is the only real evidence for evolution theory: evolutionist Stephen Jay Gould: Our ways of learning about the world are strongly influenced by the social pre-conceptions and biased modes of thinking that each scientist must apply to any problem. Evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin said: we have a prior commitment to materialism. It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us to accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are forced by our priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counter-intuitiveMoreover, that materialism is an absolute, for we cannot allow a divine foot in the door.","pandion","286180","Only because you don't understand the nature of science. How, for example, is chemistry more godly than biology? How about physics, ungodly? Astronomy? It is pretty ignorant to claim that an endeavor that offers natural explanations for natural events should somehow take the supernatural into consideration. How foolish would it be for a scientist to explain a natural event by declaring that ""POOF! God caused a miracle!"" I'm sure that Gould wouldn't have been offended because you called him an ""evolutionist"", but he was actually a geologist and paleontologist. Anyway, what does Gould's statement have to do with your objection to evolutionary biology? Obviously he was correct in your case. You seem to be a creationist and creationists are overwhelmingly anti-science, preferring the bias of blind faith in mythology over reality. Well, if there were any evidence for it you could. Of course, in searching for the source of these quotes we find that they seem to be limited to creationist web sites. Nowhere can one find a correct attribution. Moreover, what Lewontin is saying is that science is not a matter of faith. He is saying that science rejects spiritualism as an effective cause and is limited to naturalistic explanations. In other words, science doesn't operate by blind faith. I'm not even sure what point you were trying to make.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","07:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","16"

Here's how: ""20 billion years ago there was a Big Bang [what exploded: since the year 2006, scientists have claimed that nothing exploded into the universe! By one of the most famous laws of physics, matter can neither be created nor destroyed. Nothing can't explode into something. Also, where did that something come from? Where did the energy for the explosion come from?] that started as a microscopic dot and exploded and expanded faster than the speed of light. It started out as a very hot, very dense region that was smaller than a period. [As you know, when matter is heated, it expands . For something to be hot enough to explode faster than the speed of light, it would have to be larger than our minds can comprehend.] Eventually, all of the matter in the universe will again be compressed into a infinitesimal speck. [We know that the universe is expanding outward. It cannot possibly expand from light years to something smaller than an atom.] When the universe was a dot, it spun clockwise faster and faster until it exploded. [The Law of Angular Momentum states that if an object breaks apart in a frictionless environment, then the fragments will all spin the same direction. Yet if the universe started out as a spinning speck and exploded, then how is it that the universe is filled with exceptions where moons, planets, and even whole galaxies are spinning backwards?] To sum it all up, the Big Bang Theory states that 'nothing exploded and here we are!'","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","07:56 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","17"

Then again he can tell IRS that GOD will provide and they should contact Bush to get Gods cell number.

Hovind's strawman of the BB is hilarious though. Do we think he knows how badly wrong he's got it? Is he playing to the audience or is he really as dense as the BB singularity? Also, given that we have to dismiss this crazy BB theory because it's counter-intuitive, what do the fundies make of observable counter-intuitive events like the double-slit experiment?","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","05:29 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","23"

Because an examination of the evidence shows that a bias/ ideology/ Godless belief system is the only real evidence for evolution theory:","Peeling","286264","Well, now, here's the thing: A hypothesis of special creation of all things (such as is described in the bible) is inconsistent with the evidence we can elicit from living things today. For instance, there's the amount of non-functional DNA we share with other creatures, in particular the other apes. With shared functional DNA, now, one could make a case for economy of design, but deliberately putting the same broken genes and garbage DNA into two entirely seperate species? Then there's the fact that some creatures have far better 'designed' bits than others for no readily apparent reason. A good example is the octopus eye, whose retina is supplied with blood from the rear rather than the front, both anchoring the retina more securely (no detached retina problems) and avoiding the 'blind spot' mammalian eyes possess. There's no reason at all for a designer capable of making an octupus to use the inferior mammalian design. Then there's the issue of vestigial features. Vestigial doesn't necessarily mean 'useless', more properly it describes something that is 'overengineered' for the purpose it currently serves, and often looks very much like a crippled version of a feature possessed by some other species. Ostrich wings, for example, may be useful for balancing when running, or in mating rituals, but they don't need to be wings in order to serve those purposes. Their complex and delicate internal structure is clearly 'designed' to allow flight, but their stunted development and the practical impossibility of such a big bird achieving self-powered flight make them a vestigial structure. Again, what rationale can be made for this being the work of a designer? Then there's the fossil record. Try as one might to twist the evidence to fit a biblical flood, it just won't go. Paleontologists have found spider tracks sandwiched in sandstone layers. Imagine, if you can, the delicate impressions of a spider's footsteps surviving a deluge sufficient to suspend and deposit yards and yards of sand atop them. Hydrodynamic sorting of fossils, or burial order, doesn't fit either, since it requires that we pretend all dinosaurs were large and slow moving (they weren't) and that all mammals are small, agile and fast-moving (they aren't). On and on it goes. If we take evolution off the table completely and look at the evidence before us, we have no explanation that fits. Special creation simply doesn't add up. With all creation myths falsified, what are we supposed to do? Just pretend the history of life on earth doesn't matter, or should be ignored? Evolution isn't what you come up with when you apply atheist thinking. Evolution is what you come up with when you discount all the extant hypotheses that don't fit the facts, be they religiously inspired or otherwise. Now, you may hold your hand up and complain that we're not admitting the possibility of some kind of divine guiding hand steering or helping evolution. And that's fair enough; we generally don't, for two different reasons: First, it doesn't really add anything to the theory; it doesn't increase its power to explain what we see. So while you can of course choose to believe that's what's happening, it doesn't have any scientific value. Secondly, there's arguably some merit in the attitude that religion has had its chance and blown it. For thousands of years religions have claimed to bear upon their backs the infallible word of god. Now, if the bible had been saying all along - centuries before the technology existed to verify it - that god coaxed organisms into evolving from simpler organisms over millions of years, that would be compelling evidence that the bible was accurate and divinely inspired, since it would contain accurate predictions (which no man could have made) about what we should find when we look into our DNA or beneath the ground. But it doesn't make those predictions. So why should we now pay attention when Intelligent Design evangelists do a 6000-year-too-late handbrake turn and invent a new faith-based explanation for the evidence? After all, they have no divine mandate to do so - it's the bible that's supposedly the word of god; they're just making stuff up as they go along.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","07:44 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","24"
