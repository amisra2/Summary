Comparing the complexities of biology and all its associated orderly, fragile systems with things like coin tosses and daily probablilties of 365 day years is not convincing to many people, it's not really even logical.

So far, all you have given us is your superstitious belief in mythology.","Archangel","385282","Really? This is absolute evidence which can only be interpreted one way? by that I mean the way it has been interpreted? Because the interpreters of this evidence don't make such an absolute claim, although they do show excitement in the possibilities that it pegs the age of the universe @ 13.7 billion years with only a 1% margin of error. Here is what the Nasa Link says: The WMAP team found that the Big Bang and Inflation theories continue to ring true. The contents of the Universe include 4% atoms (ordinary matter), 23% of an unknown type of dark matter, and 73% of a mysterious dark energy. The new measurements even shed light on the nature of the dark energy, which acts as a sort of an anti-gravity. NASA - Top Story - NEW IMAGE OF INFANT UNIVERSE REVEALS ERA OF FIRST STARS, AGE OF COSMOS, AND MORE - Feb. 11, 2003 So, what do we actually have here? Although they speak in very confident tones, we see here in the bolded that the prior theories of the Big Bang and Inflation continue to ring true, but even Nasa doesn't speak in absolute terms at all. Ringing true is in no way an absolute statement of undeniable fact, especially since fully 96% of the energy in the Universe is an unknown type of dark matter, or a mysterious dark energy. Also, they observe that the new measurements even shed light on the nature of the dark energy, which acts as a sort of an anti-gravity, is it realistic to make interpretations and conclusions based on such preliminary observations which haven't even been confirmed absolutely yet? So the question must be asked, is it impossible to answer affirmatively in absolute terms how reliable these interpretations are regarding the age of the universe or the Big Bang event itself. They openly admit that these conclusions are based on predictions other unnamed cosmic theories make, so there is absolutely nothing absolute about this evidence at all. It is all based on interpretation which I maintain is impossible to do without all of the information which is impossible to gather because we don't really know what questions to ask at this point from our distant perspective in both time and space from the actual event. Science is grasping at straws so to speak, which I respect and encourage. I respect the work cosmology is doing as a legitimate science, my only problem is the hubris involved in making assumptions that we are anywhere close to understanding the full picture required to fully and accurately assess first how the universe came into being and then, the age of it. As I have said before to the consternation of the humanist opposition and in fulfillment of TQs prediction, a misreading of this evidence and sciences preconceived belief in a universe that is billions of years old could mean that our universe is not billions of years old at all, but could be only thousands of years old. And I'm making no absolute statement of fact in that regard either, all I'm saying is that the possibility exists and nothing science has come up with is absolute evidence of anything concrete which you are placing an equal amount of faith in. Evolution and the science surrounding it is as much a religion to you as my belief and faith in my God is to me. After all, the article goes on to say this: Theories about the evolution of the Universe make specific predictions about the extent of these temperature patterns. Like a detective, the WMAP team compared the unique ""fingerprint"" of patterns imprinted on this ancient light with fingerprints predicted by various cosmic theories and found a match. I must ask another question here, what if the so called ancient light is not really so ancient? What if they never assumed the light to be ancient? How then would the predicted fingerprint match by these various cosmic theories then be interpreted? And what would that conclusion be? So let me be clear, to steal a cliche from our president, I don't question the observations we are making via the technological discoveries we are learning from, but I understand very well that interpretation is everything and even the scientists involved in these discoveries don't speak in nearly the absolute terms that you layman defenders of these observations do. So nice try, but this evidence doesn't meet the standards which I requested from iangb by any measure of an absolute result. When did I claim that I have undeniable scientific evidence that the Genesis account is provable pandion? Haven't I said here and elsewhere in debate that we both rely on faith in believing our preferred world views? It's just that my faith is in an eternal, all knowing Creator God who claims to have personally spoken this world into creation along with humanity whom He created in His image. And all of the proceeding reality such as Mans dominion over all life on earth and our superiority over that life remains true to this day. You secular humanists on the other hand rely on the very flawed observations of fallen men and their interpretations of cosmic events which we are in no position to discern since admittedly 96% of the content of the universe is made up of undefinable and as of yet indiscernible Dark Matter or Dark Energy. So what incredible hubris is required to place your faith in such unknowable conclusions which are based in such unprovable assumptions? PS, my automatic spell checker automatically corrects your name pandion to pandit every time I write it out. So I didn't misspell your name on purpose, I failed to catch its change by the computer and correct it.

"01-10-2010","10445",26,"Promethean","385228","What a XXXXX you must be to belief that evolution is Godless. That's the certainty that con only come from absolute fund!e ignorance. The FACT is that the largest Christian denomination accepts evolution as a fact and do most moderate Christian sects, so do the Jews that gave rise to Christianity and all but your equally fundamentalist Muslims. But that's the usual level of stupid arguments we get from you retards, complaining about ""atheists"" science while at the same time enjoying all the benefits that it provides you. Again it makes you a coward and hypocrite.","Archangel","385284","Let's face it, you deluded and ignorant troll, attempting to reason with you is more than a waste of time, it's a wasted effort. Now let me explain why your reasoning is as inane as your world view. Just because Roman Catholicism is so luke warm and secularized that it accepts a version of evolution which claims that it is a tool of God, that in no way speaks to the hidden agenda which the proponents of classical evolution promote which is a far cry from the pseudo religious version which catholicism and luke warm sects of christianity accept as valid. So nice try linking the error of flawed religious thinkers to the motives and agenda of the perpetrators of this massive fraud, but it neither passes the smell test nor the reason of rational discourse.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","07:11 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","383"

I said that your reliance on the currently available observations requires a tremendous amount of faith, especially since the source for these conclusions is fallen man which possesses a perspective of time and space which is equal to that of A GNATS lifespan compared to the age of this world. That you're incapable of seeing the faith required to accept these evolutionist propositions says more about you than my faith in the reliability of the Living God and Creator of all that is to have accomplished what His word promises.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","07:24 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","384"

There are always examples of people irrationally dismissing a preponderance of evidence, so having ""everyone"" agreeing is not a good benchmark. There is a statistically significant portion (about 5% iirc) of the American populace that thinks the Apollo moon landings were a hoax. Given the preponderance of evidence against this position, I can dismiss their views, especially since their position seems to be based on ignorance to the existence of the mountain of evidence. You are making the implicit assumption that ""everyone"" is well informed on all topics and has weighed all the evidence and made an informed decision. Obviously that is not the case, so your criteria is flawed.

"01-10-2010","10445",26,"Archangel","385282","I must ask another question here, what if the so called ancient light is not really so ancient? What if they never assumed the light to be ancient? How then would the predicted fingerprint match by these various cosmic theories then be interpreted? And what would that conclusion be?","birdan","385327","Light from distant stars is not an assumption, it is evidentially supported. The speed of light has been directly measured both in the laboratory, from the moon, from the other side of the sun, from the fringes of the heliosphere. Not only that, the mathematical theory behind basic physics rules out light traveling significantly faster than has been measured, and it certainly rules out light being faster in the past by a factor of a million, which is necessary for a thousands year old universe. That is a far cry from ""assumption"". If the light from distant stars is not ancient (i.e., traveling at the speed of light), then obviously either all of physics and chemistry is wrong, or the light was created on its way to earth 6,000 years ago. The problem is that this light contains a history of events in it, and consequently light created en route contains a history of events that never happened. The same is true for the earth's geology. It is not a question of a 6,000 year old earth created to ""look mature"". Rather, the earth's geology contains a history of events (meteor impacts, volcanoes, tectonic movement, sedimentary rock formation, etc.). Basic 19th century physics shows that if all these events happened in the past several thousand years, our current earth would be a molten ball because of all the heat produced by these events. Once again, either all of physics and chemistry is wrong, or the history of events in the earth's geology never happened. If the creator of this 'light en route to earth' and earth's geology could place fictitious events in the light and in the earth's rocks, then it would seem this same creator could create a holy book full of fictitious events. If you don't subscribe to the idea of a deceptive creator, then you are saying that all of physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, cosmology, geology, paleontology, genetics, etc. are wrong. In effect, you are indeed rejecting all the physical sciences.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","12:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","389"
