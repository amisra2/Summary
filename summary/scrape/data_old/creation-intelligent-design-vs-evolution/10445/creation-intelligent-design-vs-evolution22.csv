Oh course Easy will shove your face into Genesis and say ""SEE IT'S RIGHT THERE!! THE BIBLE SAYS SO SO IT HAS TO BE TRUE RAWR!!"" OMGZ IT'S ""GOD'S"" ZILLA!!!! Btw I believe there is a God simply by faith :D","smiley","384767","That's the problem. We're back to the,""I don't know so god must have done it"", argument. Which brings me back to the, ""The more we understand, the less god has to do, so he must be getting really bored"", statement. Incidentally, I have no problem with you believeing in god (it's rubbish, but it's your choice), so long as you don't rant and rave about how someone is doing wrong because your god, for which you have no real evidence, says so. And then insult me because I happen to have noticed that you have no evidence. But then, jazy, you're not the one (or more) who is guilty of that round here.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","05:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","318"

"01-05-2010","10445",22,"pandion","384790","That life exists is evidence that life exists, nothing more. It is not evidence for your mythology based fantasy. But there is no evidence that it did not come about by natural processes. And, there is, in fact, evidence of natural processes that may have resulted in life. Just because you don't understand it doesn't make it so. That's great! For a lot of years we have been hearing about ""creation science"" and how ID creationism is science because they offer scientific evidence of the truth of a myth, and now you finally agree with what scientists have been saying all along. Your petty little god is not a subject for science because your god is not natural. Science offers natural explanations for natural events. Nice going.","Archangel","384794","Here's the problem with your chosen mythology, pandit. It lacks any semblance of common sense, and based on the bolded, even you aren't stupid enough to claim it is absolutely proven in any way, shape or form. Here's what I mean, we see before us and exist within an Earth which is a perfectly functioning and self sufficient ecosystem with an unbroken chain of symbiotic life forms which are not only interdependent to each other, but compliment each other on an environmentally balanced chemical level and food chain from the simplest single celled life forms up to the largest apex creatures in each of the species and ecosystems which inhabit this planet. To summarize your problem as simply as possible, your pseudo science claims that life spontaneously appeared by a complete accident 4.5 billion years ago in an unknown, unprovable and unverifiable environment which is completely based on theoretical but also unprovable so called observations which aren't actually real time observations at all since the event being discussed occurred this theoretical 4.5 billion years ago. And from this unprovable accident of mathematically impossible odds, you then claim that through a series of random mutations leading to a process coined by a term by proponents of this myth referred to as natural selection which teaches that each generation fights to survive with no concern for the other life forms which it shares space with. But you believe that from this chaotic struggle for improved life via evolution, that it is rationale that we ended up with this perfectly balanced and cooperating environment? Pleeaasse pandion, you embarrass yourself when you claim that what you believe in by faith is more rational than what we believe in by faith. The fact is that nothing you accept can be proven absolutely either. And it all relies on massive conclusions which are based on completely unprovable assumptions. My God is self evident in every atom and molecule which holds the matter and energy of this universe together. And you will find one day that just because you were blind to that FACT, your lack of insight did nothing to nullify or negate His place as the Master Creator of all that exists in time and space. And that is as sure a guarantee as the blood Jesus shed for your sins on that historic and blessed day 2000 years ago.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","09:28 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","321"

Or a list . Many of these animals were killed off by the biiig natural disasters (extinction event spikes, in the graph).

What is so beautiful about the chain of life is that these gaps in the broken chain at those times were filled and symbiotic life continued on interdependently. Don't try to describe my beliefs when you don't have a clue about what I believe because it just makes you look stupid. I have never said that people are supernatural beings in any way unless you consider having a spiritual dimension means we are supernatural. I don't though, so stop applying that belief to me. Natural selection is a man made myth which suggests that the most sophisticated species of evolved life form on earth, the bipedal primate was the result of the last and most recent step of evolution in the process. It defies logic and common sense that we are the most advanced life form on the planet while also being the youngest.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","04:59 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","324"

That makes no sense, on several levels. Firstly, 'advanced' is not a term used by evolutionary scientists all that often - and certainly not in the way you are using it. To talk about 'the most evolved creature' doesn't really make sense. Secondly, even if you accept your misuse of the term you would still be mistaken. It doesn't matter that we are the youngest , but that we are the newest . The internet is a lot younger than the victorian era, the roman era - and certainly than the dark/iron/bronze ages - but we are a lot more advanced now than we were then. You can't look at a species without looking at the chain that has led it to that point.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","07:40 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","325"

Archie is also incredibly stupid. For example, I get different answers to math questions than he does because I'm an atheist (apparently fundies have their own math system which makes them incapable of adding number sequences). Also, props from bad TV shows are proof of pterosaurs living in the 1800's.
