It's right here Now go ahead and lie, insult, and in other disgusting ways try and weasel out of this exact statement you made that you deny in BIG RED ####ING LETTERS ever making: ""how does a bumble bee fly ? The greatest minds in the field can't figure that one out. So obviously bumble bees flying must not truly exist right ? Scientifically it's proven to be impossible so it must be a figment of our imagination right ?""

Still pretending you never said that one eh?","pandion","358800","For some strange reason, creationists don't seem to understand the difference between hydrocarbon and carbohydrate. Mr. Kent Hovind is a prime example.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","02:17 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","124"

But that was decades ago. Seems typical of the science put forth by creationists. But, of course, scientific laws are only statements of what is observed. Once the concepts of vortex and dynamic stall were developed, it became clear that party calculations of aerodynamics were nonsense and the ""laws"" of aerodynamics were amended. Bumblebee flight does not violate any law of physics. It demonstrates the utmost ignorance for any creationist to cite this example in any debate about creationism v. evolution.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","02:36 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","125"

TQ decides to pipe in and prove that he is as dishonest as our resident liar and purveyor of untruths, the obvious child. And you posted the very link which proves you're also a deceptive troll by only posting half of what I said so as to imply I made some absolute statement of fact which I wasn't making at all. Here's the rest of my post which you failed to copy and paste in your massive bolded font, my dishonest troll. OH, AND ONE MORE THING MY LYING TROLL, THE CHILD STATED THAT I SAID THAT ""BEES"" DON'T FLY AS IF I WAS SAYING THAT ""ALL BEES"", NOT JUST BUMBLE BEES COULDN'T FLY. THIS QUOTED POST IS OBVIOUSLY DISCUSSING BUMBLE BEES SPECIFICALLY WHICH DEFY THE LAWS OF FLIGHT AND HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION BY SCIENTISTS FOR YEARS WHICH WAS THE ONLY POINT I WAS MAKING IN THE FIRST PLACE ON THAT THREAD. HERE'S THE REST OF MY STATEMENT... Oh wait, I've seen them fly with my own eyes, does that mean I'm crazy or do bumble bees simply defy what we know to the the norm. There are more things in heaven and Earth than the mind of man can even conceive of yet you speak of things you know nothing about for sure as if they are no brainers and people like me who are open to the unanswered possibilities are nothing more than fodder for your insults. You're a self righteous punk who loves to try to embarrass and belittle others who dare to look outside the box of what is accepted as the norm or disagree with your limited perspective on life. HERE'S THE LINK FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO READ THE POST IN CONTEXT: http://www.4forums.com/political/258852-post68.html YOU DIDN'T WANT TO POST THE LAST PART WHICH SHOWED THAT I WASN'T MAKING AN ABSOLUTE STATEMENT OF FACT OR BELIEF AT ALL, DID YOU LIAR!!! THAT WOULDN'T SERVE YOUR PURPOSE TO INSULT ME EVEN IF YOU HAD TO LIE, MISREPRESENT AND DISTORT MY STATEMENT AT THE TIME IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR DECEPTIVE GOAL OF IMPLYING THAT I SAID SOMETHING I NEVER SAID AT ALL, HUH!!! IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT YOU ARE SUPPORTING THE OBVIOUS CHILD, YOU'RE NO MORE HONEST THAN HE IS. BUT EVEN HE KNEW BETTER THAN TO QUOTE THIS POST BECAUSE HE KNEW I WASN'T MAKING A STATEMENT OF FACT OR BELIEF AT ALL IN THAT POST. SO MUCH FOR FINDING AN OBJECTIVE SEEKER OF TRUTH IN YOUR LITTLE CLICK OF MOCKERS, SCOFFERS AND HATERS OF ANYTHING TRUE OR HONEST AROUND HERE.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","07:32 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","127"
