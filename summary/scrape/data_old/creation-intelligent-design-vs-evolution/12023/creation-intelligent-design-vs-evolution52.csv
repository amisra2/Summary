What I am saying is that evolutionary scientists interpret the data by saying that a fish similar to this existed millions of yrs ago and evolved into an amphibian, but they lack the evidence to make that conjecture.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:51 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","769"

However I am sure an operational gill would be of great help to modern sea mammals.","Accipiter","430420","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species you can't just do anything your out of control imagination wants, i don't think it's unreasonable to assume that there are limits here in the real world. As for the development of lungs into gills i don't know if it is imposable but does not seam likely. Further their are no examples living or dead of lungs evolving into gills but plenty of examples living and dead of gills becoming lungs.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","09:32 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","771"

You can never argue evolution effectively because you don't know what it is. If you pick up a book with the non religious account of evolution you would be much more effective at arguing your case. You don't posses an understanding you are just repeating what you have read and most of that is wrong.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","09:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","772"

What are you talking about out of control imagination? We don't know what causes advancement so how can we know what it's limits are? What of having lungs and gills? That is because there is more oxygen in the atmosphere than dissolved in water. Aerobic life would have no selection pressure to abandon such a rich source of oxygen that doesn't mean it wouldn't be beneficial to also have access to dissolved oxygen.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","09:59 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","773"

If you want an example made by an evolutionist it is a fish to an amphibian. I would appreciate it if we got back on topic.","trebor","430435","Actually, there is evidence of a fish being turned into an amphbian. It just took a whole series of adaptations.

Wikipedia is not a dictionary. You sound like genesis, it doesn't matter what you think 'is needed' natural selection is not an intelligent force prompted out of slumber by the dire upcoming fate of necessity like it is painted. Fish are totally viable, and were totally viable; but that doesn't mean there was not a better form of life that would out compete other fish. Births would be less risky; they could stay underwater longer, which means deeper dives, longer hunts, and better ability to hide if needed. Now when certain amino acids are selected among others for lower nutritional cost this would be a mountain. It is not happening because the system does not exist, not because it would not be advantageous.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:10 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","778"
"05-23-2011","12023",52,"Freedom","430411","This is what scientist think it would look like if it existed: Mudskippers are members of the subfamily Oxudercinae (tribe Periophthalmini[1]), within the family Gobiidae (Gobies). They are completely amphibious fish, fish that can use their pectoral fins to walk on land.[2][3] Being amphibious, they are uniquely adapted to intertidal habitats, unlike most fish in such habitats which survive the retreat of the tide by hiding under wet seaweed or in tidal pools.[4] Mudskippers are quite active when out of water, feeding and interacting with one another, for example to defend their territories.","Stonewall","430440","Another scientific representation: Genesis... it's a living creature that is around today, not a scientifically hypothesized creature of yore.

No they don't, but boy it would sure be a tremendous advantage!
