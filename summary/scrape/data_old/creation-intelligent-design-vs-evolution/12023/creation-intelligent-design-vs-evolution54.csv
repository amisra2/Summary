That is correct. The environment is a factor, not a cause. You are saying that rain created umbrellas and I am saying umbrellas were created to defend against rain. This is very simple stuff they would teach you in any logic course. This idea that the environment is the only variable which contributes to reproductive success is one of the consistent fallacies young evolutionist are brain washed with. I suppose it is in hope of eventually turning out one of you who seem to ascribe mystical powers of generation to the environment. I have been accused of believing in a 'perfect' version of an organism or a system in an organism, yet what does it imply when you think every selection pressure is in equilibrium just because gene frequencies aren't shifting? It means you think there is nothing left that will grant reproductive success, it means you think that in the context of the current environment the species is perfect. Problem is I don't measure ridiculousness by how divergent it is from other's beliefs. Further I have not noticed a significant increase in disagreement. lol It's your perverse idea of 'discussion' that insults you.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","03:58 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","796"

Some say that when two entities can't reproduce, they are different species, but as far as taxonomy goes, that isn't the case (like horses and zebras, as Freedom said). When there are observable differences in physiology, they are retaxonomized if needed and viewed as different species. There have been a few cases where a change in physiology or behaviour has been seen in one lifetime, like with the Anolis lizards. When enough change (or microevolution) happens in which the species has distinguishable differences to it's ancestor, it's concluded that macroevolution has happened. It's a pet peeve of mine to hear people say ""I believe in microevolution, but not macroevolution"". There is no glass ceiling - if microevolution happens, macroevolution happens, because small changes build up to big changes, big enough for zoologists/botanists to have to change the classification of the plant or animal.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","02:11 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","797"

Worker bees are more closely related to their sisters than to their mothers. Among the numerous side effects of this is that suicidal defense of the hive can be advantageous: doing so allows them to help their sisters survive. At the very least, so long as there's not a selective disadvantage -- and again, those unusual genetics are at play -- the feature can persist even if it's not advantageous. It's also good to remember that just because an adaptation could be selectively advantageous, this doesn't mean it will evolve. Sometimes, creatures fail to adapt, and their species is driven to extinction. Did it occur to you that the plumage is an indicator of ""size, strength,"" or general fitness? As Amotz Zahavi has put it in his formulation of the ""handicap principle,"" the extravagant signal does make males more vulnerable -- but those who are fit enough to make desirable mates are able to survive despite their plumage. Those are the individuals that females want to mate with. Additionally, there is evidence that plumage qualities may indicate capacity to resist parasites and pathogens. Mangy peacocks don't do well with the peahens. No according to evolution, adaptations come about through a combination of variation and natural selection . Variations includes mutations, and they're random in the sense that it they're not necessarily advantageous to the individuals that possess them. If such random variation were all that evolution involved, adaptation would never happen. But natural selection is not a random process . What Darwin first explained (along with Wallace, really), and what subsequent research has shown time and again, is that the non-random survival and reproduction of random variants is quite enough to explain the diversification of life over time. Note further that the science of evolution does not claim that intelligence is not involved with the process. It just does not claim that intelligence is involved with the process, either. What the evidence supports is the process itself. It doesn't support any metaphysical claims about whether the process is or isn't the product of a designer's intentions. Theism and atheism can both be consistent with evolution. In sum, I would suggest that you have misunderstood evolution on a number of fronts. You don't seem to understand what evolution actually says, either in terms of general principles or specific problems. You don't seem familiar with evidence in favor of it, insofar as you emptily declare that it all amounts to nothing without specific references to experiments or their failings. And you don't seem to have considered the relationship of evolution to religion in much depth at all.

It is more beneficial to the drone bees' genes to die protecting its relatives (sister bees, etc.) than to continue living itself. Social insects are very interesting... It's sexual selection, first of all. Maybe originally a larger tail was a sign of verility or something, and since the hens would choose the one with the longer tail, this trait spread and the tails got bigger... But aside from that, the tail also gives the appearance of a bigger animal when spread, and has what looks like eyes all over it that would scare off some predators. A better question would be this: How would a trait that hurts an animal's survival chances be evidence that God created it? Wouldn't he make an animal that was perfectly suited for its environment?

What I am saying is that evolutionary scientists interpret the data by saying that a fish similar to this existed millions of yrs ago and evolved into an amphibian, but they lack the evidence to make that conjecture.","Matthew","432401","This is balderdash. The fossil record of the fish/tetrapod transition is amazing, and growing all the time. Acanthostega, Icthyostega, Tiktaalik, to name but three important fossils. There's a ton of evidence. It needs ""interpretation,"" I suppose. But that seems to me an unhelpfully broad use of ""interpretation."" The ages and sequences of the fossils work, and what one winds up with upon full consideration is not empty speculation, as you seem to think, but an inference about what did in fact happen. Check out Carl Zimmer's book At the Water's Edge . It looks at the huge quantity of evidence for a group of fish becoming amphibians - and also for a lineage of land mammals returning to the sea and becoming cetaceans. If you think there's no evidence, you're in for a surprise! You had mentioned trusting scientists or God. But keep in mind that on matters of evolution, creationists are relying on the authority of some of the interpreters of God's will and word, not on God himself. And those interpreters simply have no idea what they're talking about when the topic is science. They seem to, but only if one doesn't look at what non-creationist scientists actually say. Then their arguments fall apart in short order. The fact that they never change the failed arguments is quite indicative of their intellectual honesty.

"06-17-2011","12023",54,"Gen1:1-31","430362","I agree with micro-evolution (adaptation). I do not agree with macro-evolution (the change from one species to another, or more plainly put, the adding of information). However information can be subtracted ex: wolf (canine) domesticated to dog (canine). This is not a debate of science vs religion. This is the debate of the science of one religion vs the science of another religion. Religion by definition is a cause, principle or belief held to with faith or ardor. Science by definition is knowledge attained through study or practice. Because ""macro-evolution"" takes so much time according to evolutionists, and because you cannot observe the past and only the present, you cannot observe ""macro-evolution"" and thus it requires just as much faith as any other religion. No true transitional fossils have been found. And before you people go and use that dinosaur bird against me that is exactly what it is, a dinosaur bird. It is a dinosaur with bird feathers nothing more, nothing less. Continuing with transitional fossils, the odds of a single protein, the most basic unit of life, forming by chance is 1/20^300. That is just a single protein, and a single DNA strand requires thousands. The odds of a new DNA strand forming by chance is 1/10^400,000. Now let me ask you, in all the ""transitional fossils"" we have found they are all perfect, to say, no consistent genetic deformities. How could something with the odds of 1/10^400,000 form on the first and every try? You answer that. Why evolve skeletons? According to evolutionary scientists we started out with exoskeletons similar to insects. Insects are still around and are thriving, so why ""evolve"" something you don't need? Oh and if we are ""evolving"" then every human is ""evolving"" at the same pace with the same mutations, the odds of that are impossible. What is your ultimate authority? A group scientists that are biased, mortal, non-omniscience and fallible, or a supreme being that is unbiased, eternal, omniscience, and infallible aka God of the bible.","Matthew","432477","There is no difference. Speciation comes about as different members of the same species adapt to different environmental conditions. As long as gene flow continues across the entire group, there will simply be different varieties of the same species. If one part of the group becomes isolated from the rest, the remaining two groups will evolve independently. If their isolation ends, they may have evolved beyond the ability to continue inter-breeding even though they're together again. Voila: two species. In short, if you accept micro-evolution (as you say), and if you accept that environments change across space and time (which I would hope is pretty obvious), then macro-evolution is to be expected. First, information can in fact be increased via evolution, through any number of ways (gene duplication, e.g.). Creationists using information theory don't understand what they're talking about. Bill Dembski has suckered a whole lot of people. Second, why does a dog contain less information than a wolf? It seems rather arbitrary to claim so without presenting evidence of there respective genomes. No, it's a debate between pseudo-science offered by partisans of one form of religion, and real science that is independent of any religious faith. This is far too broad. By this definition, political parties are religions. So are the professional ethical codes held by doctors or lawyers. Metaphorically, okay. But as a literal definition of religion, this is poor. Again, far too broad. In the ancient world, when the entire term ""science"" was used differently, okay. But not in the modern world. Science involves searching for natural explanations for natural phenomena, and requires empirical evidence. By your definition, a Shakespeare scholar is a scientist. And that's ridiculous. Defining religion and science in these incredibly broad ways serves a rhetorical purpose for creationists. Unlike most definitions, they make the terms less clear, rather than more. But therein lies their rhetorical utility, of course. There is no requirement of direct observation for knowledge. Note that all of history would be invalidated by what you here claim. So would forensics. It's not a matter of faith, but of inference. Big difference. I find it very ironic, by the way, that creationists simultaneously claim that their position is true, while adopting cognitive relativism in defense of it. So why would dinosaurs have feathers? Come on. This ""no transitional fossils"" mantra is absolutely absurd. There are lots of transitional fossils, for birds, for humans, for more. With all due respect, DNA is not made of protein. Regardless, it's also worth noting that no one claims proteins form by chance. The natural selection under which proteins evolve is not a chance process. What is a ""consistent genetic deformity?"" It's hard to figure out what you're even demanding here. Or why you're demanding it. Why do you think evolutionists claim such complexity happened spontaneously? No evolutionist has ever claimed that nature moved from random chemicals to an organized protein in a single step. Evolution has been going on for billions of years. It isn't starting from scratch, and it isn't making such huge leaps. But its effects are cumulative. All these arguments from vanishingly small probabilities are deeply flawed. Nonetheless, creationists keep using them, to sucker people who don't know evolution well enough to spot the straw man. Deliberate use of such a fallacy is, quite frankly, dishonest. Don't fall for it. Our lineage evolved from invertebrates, it's true. But we did not evolve from insects or any other arthropod. The split between insects and their kin (including most other invertebrates) and vertebrates and their kin (including us humans) is very ancient. In fact, based on developmental evidence we appear more closely related to echinoderms such as starfish! And interestingly, echinoderms have an endoskeleton, as we do. The earliest chordates (which include us vertebrates) appear to be wormlike creatures possessed of a notochord, a primitive internal backbone (e.g. Haikouella or Haikouichthys). At no stage does it seem we possessed exoskeletons such as those of insects. We are still evolving as a species. This does not mean that every individual comes to possess the same mutations. Again, you don't seem to understand how evolution works. Except that your authority on these matters is not God but creationists and their interpretations of the Bible and God's will. And they are as fallible as any other mortal, plus more dishonest than most. I repeat: Don't fall for it. Start looking at evolution for yourself, rather than through the lens of what creationists say about it. You'll soon realize, creationists don't represent evolution accurately at all. And despite being called on it many, many times... they keep repeating their misrepresentations.

The assumption that smooth selective gradients exist between selectable functions is unfounded.
