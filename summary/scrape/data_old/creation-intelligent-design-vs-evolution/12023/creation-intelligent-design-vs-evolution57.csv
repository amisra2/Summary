"07-22-2011","12023",57,"Gen1:1-31","434859","1. According to the links Stonewall provided, the average age of a spiral galaxy is 1-2 billion years, however the age of our galaxy has been estimated at 5 billion years old, which according to your science it should not be a spiral galaxy anymore, so maybe you should not trust your sources Matthew. 2. Stonewall, your link says that Davis was wrong about the age of the universe, when your scientists are missing 988 second stage stars, and 5033 third stage stars!? Davis' calculation might have not been perfect, but according to your link's data, the universe can only be 20,000 years old at the maximum , far closer to the biblical time line. Freedom, yes every supernova has not been observed and supernova explosions don't stay that way forever, but the amount of observable supernova should be far, far greater than it is. 3. Your link's only plausible explanation is that everyone saw it on the horizon and made it look red ,and that is a huge assumption. And what about the ones that did see it red? Where they all wrong? It would not prove that God made everything, but it would prove that it does not take 100,000 years for stars to evolve. Freedom, if their was a red star in between it, where did it go? 1. The ancient astronomers who described Sirius as red were looking at it when it was low on the horizon, so its reddening was due to the earth's atmosphere. The ""red Sirius"" refers to observations made at the heliacal risings and settings of the star in Greek and Roman society (Ceragioli 1996; Whittet 1999). 2. Not all ancient astronomers recorded that Sirius was red. Many ancient sources confirm that it was white or bluish white 2,000 years ago (van Gent 1984, 1989). 3. The bright star visible without a telescope, Sirius A, is not a white dwarf. Sirius A has a white dwarf companion star, Sirius B, which has nothing to do with what ancient astronomers saw. Hovind did not check the facts behind his claims. 4. Even if Sirius had changed color, it would not support creationism or a young earth in any way. It would simply mean that one observation was unexplained. 4. Because Stonewall, according to the laws of Thermodynamics objects lose energy. By now the Earth's molten core should be cool by now (and Ganymede' should too even with the sacrificing of orbital potential energy ) if the solar system is billions of years old. 5. According to you scientist the rings of Saturn formed several billion years ago when a moon like object broke up and formed he rings, yet the rings according to your link can only be 100 million years old. Saturn's rings may be less than 100 million years old (Cuzzi and Estrada 1998). However, that says nothing about the age of the planet. The rings could have formed when Saturn captured a small moon that fell within the Roche limit (the distance below which moons will be pulled apart by tidal forces). This could have happened any time in Saturn's history. Saturn's moons shepherd the particles that make up the rings, preventing them from drifting and maintaining the gaps between the rings. This shepherding may allow the rings to be much older than 100 million years. (However, the color of the rings suggests not much more than 100 million years' worth of accumulated dust.) 6. Yes Freedom I was assuming the rate was constant, and I gave you the max distance from the Earth with it, but if you don't want to to assume the rate was constant the according to the laws of Thermodynamics objects lose energy, so the moon would have been traveling even faster away from the Earth, meaning that it would be in the Earth at the minimum distanced. 7. Stonewall, your link is using a argument similar to saying that a watermelon is blue on the inside until you cut it open. You can't prove the Oort cloud exists, and I can't prove it doesn't exist, and I have a question, if the Kuiper Belt gets it's supply from the Oort cloud, where does the Oort cloud get it's supply from? 8. Once again the law of Thermodynamics states an object losses energy so the Earth's magnetic field should to weak to support life. 9. Stonewall, let me point out that your link says the their was a 14 hour day 4.6 billion years ago, then it says it was a 22 hour day 370 million years ago, so which is it? 10. Why is their no evidence of a larger desert? They are if their is a prevailing wind pattern. 11. No, I don't, because you won't consider anything that suggests a creator. Stonewall, once again your link has made many assumptions, with no supporting facts. 12. So I guess in those millions of years of sitting up right, nothing (earthquakes, volcanoes, floods, dinosaurs) moved it? As for Malone's ""problem"" with the ""thousands of years"" for the tree to remain upright for ""slow accumulation"" to occur, it is a non-problem - he is simply interpolating the average depositional rates for an entire formation down to the scale of metres. This is not the correct way to do it, because individual beds can be deposited rapidly (say, sands and mud during a levee breach), and then little deposition can occur for a long time (e.g., a soil horizon), as is observed in modern river floodplain environments where trees commonly occur. In short, he is assuming conventional geologists would interpret the occurrence the simple way he has interpolated - they do not. 13. Then why is their no unbroken record for several million yeas, since no major disaster occurred?","Stonewall","435117","Who said that the Milky Way was always a (barred) spiral galaxy? It wasn't. It formed slowly just like everything else in the universe, and looked very different in the distant past. By the way, our galaxy is more like 13 billion years old. Davies' work was a complete sham, making up numbers that would fit his pre-determined conclusion. And it's obvious you didn't read the entire link at all (probably because you don't actually care). But read section 10.3 that explains why we can't see all the remnants (the number one reason being dust and interstellar matter blocking them.) Supernovae, Supernova Remnants and Young Earth Creationism FAQ How are the other answers not plausible? And you already answered your own question... yes, if they saw it as red, they were incorrect, because it was only the earth's atmosphere causing the reddening. And even if it changed, it wouldn't prove anything at all about the evolution of stars. Says who? You are basically saying that 4+ billion years is such a long time that anything should have cooled off by now, but you have done absolutely no calculations. Why don't you show the calculations? Make sure to factor in the initial temperature, external energy sources such as the sun and collisions, and the insulating effects from the cooling of the crust. And so what? Am I to believe that Adam and Eve were trotting around on a big, molten fireball? It also says that the age of the rings has nothing to do with the age of the planet. I ask again, so what? Here is the whole answer, since you seem to have had trouble reading it the first time: You used terrible creationist math. 3 inches/year = .25 feet/year. Minimum current distance from earth to moon: 221,208 miles = 1,167,978,240 feet. 1,167,978,240/0.25 = 4,671,912,960 years. That is the number of years you would have to go back (assuming a constant recession rate) to see the moon at earth's surface, not 1.3 billion. Since Earth is only 4.54 billion years old, you have no argument. They come from the same place that planets come from. Clouds of dust and matter left over from supernovas. Gravity causes the matter to collapse into bigger and bigger rocks... when closer to the sun, there is going to be a greater amount of these rocks, and they will collide and form planets, but farther from the sun (where the Oort cloud is), there is less matter, and you will have a lot of smaller rocks instead of a few big ones. At that distance, they are going to be ice balls, and as the link says, it's only when gravity throws them into a weird orbit that they get close enough to the sun to start melting (that's what the tail is... the comet melting). Once again, you are just throwing around 'thermodynamics' like nobody is going to question you. I'm an engineer and very familiar with thermodynamics. It doesn't help you in this case. You haven't established a rate of 'energy loss', you haven't shown what strength is actually needed for life, you haven't shown what the initial strength was... And again, you failed to acknowledge the link I gave, which shows that there is no exponential decay of the magnetic field as well as all the mistakes made in the model you are referencing. Uh, both. It says that the rotation of earth has slowed down, so of course the day would have been shorter in the past. Also, keep in mind, the 'seconds' in the link I gave are 'arc-seconds.' The earth is always changing. From climate and weather to continental drift. The age of the Sahara has nothing to do with the age of the earth as a whole, just like the age of a wart has nothing to do with the age of the person who has it. A more detailed answer, with references (all you had to do was click the hyperlink on the original page I gave you): How Good are those Young-Earth Arguments: Hovind's 'Proofs' (continued) Millions? It wasn't even thousands! Why bother responding when you don't read the links? Are you really asking why there aren't any living creatures that are millions of years old? And what is this about no 'major' disasters occurring in the last several million years? There are natural disasters all the time, in every part of the world... and creatures in the wild don't generally last very long (and definitely not THAT long) because future generations would have evolved to be better adapted to the environment and more efficient at using resources. These generations would out-compete the old organisms until the old ones died. That's why you don't see thousand year old trees and other plants/animals very often. Also, nice job avoiding my link again, as it showed the example of the King Clone creosote bush in the Mojave Desert which is 11,700 years old.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","06:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","842"
