The difference is the ""evolutionist"" will take the results at face value. A creationist will reject the results unless they fit their preconceived idea of what happened. While I don't neccesarily share that belief, there is nothing that contradicts it. You've basically summed up deism-God set the universe in motion and sat back to watch the results. While I won't deny many scientists are religious, I don't think scripture is responsible for many advances in science. What o_c is arguing against is the idea that we can not trust our observations or experimental results because God could just magic up the results. This basically removes any and all semblance of sanity from our world. Would you agree that in scientific investigation of the world, we must trust our observations and base our hypothesis on what we can observe? Or, should we (as CashBurnRate states), believe that there was a global flood, against all evidence to the contrary, because God could have ""magicked"" away all the evidence?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","03:36 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","136"

I want to see models and predictions. That would be your unsupported opinion. So what? Just because Tom Cruise is a scientologist doesn't make Born on the 4th of July a bogus film. Whether Einstein believed in a god or not is completely unrelated to the accuracy of relativity. The fact that Newton was motivated to study by his belief that a god-created universe should make sense has no bearing on whether that belief was correct. Get it? Sorry, but I care about whether my beliefs are true or not, don't you? As such, i prefer to have the maximum number of verifiable beliefs, and the minimum number of unsupported ones. I have tools I use to make these judgments; reason, logic and evidence. Without lapsing into the sophistry of radical scepticism, there are a few things I take purely on faith: That I am real. That other people are real. That the evidence from my senses is real. That's it. Everything else is highly provisional. I accept science so comprehensively because it simply is , at its core, the best way of obtaining verifiable, ie likely-as-possible-to-be-true, knowledge, with the following points being especially noteworthy: Demand for quantifiable predictions Understanding of methodological limitations Potential falsifiability Mandatory publication Peer review This provides a highly reliable framework for the advancement and refinement of knowledge.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","06:02 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","137"

Here's just one example of the content which it argues: Let's Look at the Evidence: The following are 18 Evidences of either massive flooding and erosion, extremely rapid layering of strata, or direct evidence of a Worldwide Flood. Such evidences are found in numerous places on virtually every Continent. Polystrate Fossils: One of the strongest pieces of evidence for a worldwide flood is the existence of what Rupke termed ""polystrate fossils."" Such fossils are found all over the world. They usually consist of fossil trees that were buried upright, and which often traverse multiple layers of strata such as sandstone, limestone, shale, and even coal beds. 1,2,3,4 They range in size from small rootlets to trees over 80 feet long. 3 Sometimes they are oblique in relation to the surrounding strata, but more often they are perpendicular to it. For example, at Joggins, Nova Scotia, polystrate tree (and root) fossils are found at various intervals throughout roughly 2,500 feet of strata. Many of these are from 10-20 feet long, 5,6 and, at least one was 40 feet long. 5,6,7 Very few of these upright fossil trees have attached roots, and only about 1 in 50 8 have both roots and rootlets attached. Such trees, and their -- more often than not -- missing roots, are discussed in much more detail in The ""Fossil Forests"" of Nova Scotia. 9 Likewise, many (if not most) of the large, fragmented, and broken-off Stigmaria roots are also missing their rootlets. 9 Many of these roots and rootlets, are also buried individually. 9 This strongly suggests that these trees did not grow in the same places where they were buried, but rather were uprooted and re-deposited there. Similar circumstances occur at various other places in Nova Scotia, as well as in the United States, England, Germany, and France. Another place where large tree stumps are preserved without their roots attached is Axel Heiberg 10,11 Island in Northern Canada. And although there is much data on buried trees in the geological literature, most of it is over 100 years old, and difficult to access. One of the few articles on this subject was by Rupke, and in it he comments that: Personally, I am of the opinion that the polystrate fossils constitute a crucial phenomenon both to the actuality and the mechanism of cataclysmic deposition. Curiously a paper on polystrate fossils appears to be a 'black swan in geological literature. Antecedent to this synopsis a systematic discussion of the relevant phenomena was never published. However, geologists must have been informed about these fossils. In view of this it seems unintelligible that uniformitarianism has kept its dominant position."" 12 With regard to Rupke's observation, I suspect the reason why such is (still) the case has more to do with one's personal bias against the concept of a Creator / God to whom we might very well have to give account than to the ever-mounting evidence against the theory of evolution and the millions of years old Earth that it requires (to appear plausible). However, T-I-M-E is simply not enough: not even BILLIONS of years of it. See also The Organic Levels of the Yellowstone Petrified Forest 13 and The Yellowstone Petrified ""Forests"" 14 by Harold Coffin. Scientific Evidence for a Worldwide Flood How do you explain""polystrate fossils."" Such fossils are found all over the world. They usually consist of fossil trees that were buried upright, and which often traverse multiple layers of strata such as sandstone, limestone, shale, and even coal beds. 1,2,3,4 They range in size from small rootlets to trees over 80 feet long. 3 Sometimes they are oblique in relation to the surrounding strata, but more often they are perpendicular to it.

Another place where large tree stumps are preserved without their roots attached is Axel Heiberg 10,11 Island in Northern Canada. There are 17 other scientific facts revealed which evolutionists either avoid asking the obvious questions about, or just flat out ignore. Examples like this: A ""Whale"" of a Fossil: Or should we say ""a fossil of a whale? It's true, but what is most interesting about it is how it was buried. In 1976, workers from the Dicalite division of Grefco inc. found the remains of a baleen whale entombed vertically in a diatomaceous earth quarry. ""They've found fossils there before; in fact the machinery operators have learned a good deal about them and carefully annotate any they find with the name of the collector, the date, and the exact place found. Each discovery is turned over to Lawrence G. Barnes at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. The Whale, however, is one of the largest fossils ever collected anywhere... (It) is standing on end.. and is being exposed gradually as the diatomite is mined. Only the head and a small part of the body are visible as yet. ""The modern baleen whale is 80 to 90 feet long and has a head of similar size, indicating that the fossil may be close to 80 feet long. 46,47 So it begs the question child as to how hydrology doesn't support a young Earth or the great flood when it is only by way of a rapid sedimentary build up which buries large trees and even 80 foot long Whales upright can be explained in hydrological terms in so many diverse places which only the great flood accounts for? And please, offer evidence to refute this information, not just insults of my intelligence or your personal opinion. If you want to have a serious debate about this, then deal with facts rather than personal attacks.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:10 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","144"

Body parts such as eyes, muscle, bone, etc. We have not seen one instance of a new body part evolving in a population in which it has not existed previously. Evolutionists will wave the magic ""time wand"" and simply claim that such a change could never be observed in a few decades. What about fruit flies? One generation of fruit flies = around a day. Fruit flies were exposed to x rays to speed up mutation rates, we have observed the equivalent of millions of years (in terms of human generations) of super-accelerated mutation and.... no new body parts. Evolutionists will also list in steps how a new body part can arise. This is only plausible if each of those steps could be directly observed. If not, then it is nothing more than science fiction. Evolutionists have been searching for any direct evidence of the theory of evolution since the 1800's. They are still looking.

"12-04-2008","12023",10,"Archangel","335354","Can you refute these scientific evidences for the flood without attacking the author or the source, but based simply on the science? they were not a problem to explain in the 19th century, and are still not a problem now. John William Dawson (1868) described a classic Carboniferous-age locality at Joggins, Nova Scotia, where there are upright giant lycopod trees up to a few metres tall preserved mainly in river-deposited sandstones. These trees have extensive root systems with rootlets that penetrate into the underlying sediment, which is either a coal seam (i.e. compressed plant material), or an intensely-rooted sandstone or mudstone (i.e. a soil horizon). Dawson considered and rejected anything but an in situ formation for these fossils, and his interpretation is closely similar to current interpretations of sediments deposited on river floodplains. most ""fossil forests"" do not occur in volcanic deposits, and do have the fragile roots of the stumps tightly penetrating into the surrounding sediment, often into a paleosol (fossil soil) [besides Joggins, see also 3]. One occurrence is even associated with dinosaur footprints on the same surface, on top of a coal seam [4, 5, 6]. The ""transported floating upright stumps"" model [2] is a complete red herring that does not apply to the vast majority of ""fossil forest"" occurrences. Had anybody taken the time and trouble to check the facts, they would have found that the story by Russel (1976) took some liberty with the facts and lacked very important information. First, the skeleton was not found in a vertical position, but was lying at an angle 50 to 40 degrees from horizontal . Finally, although at this angle, the whale skeleton lay parallel to the bedding of strata which at one time was the sea floor on which the dead whale fell after its death . These facts were confirmed by inquiring with the people at the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History who excavated the whale.","Peeling","335366","Yep : Just to be clear, the YEC model of flood deposition depends upon the trees not being rooted in place, especially where there are well over a dozen soil horizons layered atop one another, as there are in the Nova Scotia case. Which 'flood-based' scenario do you prefer: that each layer of trees somehow managed to grow to maturity in a few hours, deep underwater, while being buried by more sediment? Or that the flood managed to scoop up and pile the layers atop one another without disturbing them in the slightest? Or you can go with the conventional explanation, which is that occasional flooding swamped each layer of trees with sediment, with time between for a new layer to grow to maturity atop the buried remains of the old. What do you say? The anomalous example in Yellowstone, where the tree fossils aren't rooted, is easily explained: violent vulcanism and landslides deposited the sediment rather than flood deposition (you can tell that because of the composition of the deposited material). However: How is that supposed to have happened in the flood model? A dinosaur's footprint, hardening beside a tree that supposedly grew to full size in a few hours under thousands of feet of sludgy water (and yes, it would have to be thousands upon thousands of feet of water for it to hold enough material to deposit the formation). Oh, and yep: Just to be perfectly clear: the whale was not a polystrate fossil. End of story. I've tackled your source head on - do you think you could find it within yourself to throw me a bone and say ""Ok, so I was wrong?""","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","149"
