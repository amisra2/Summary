You're talking about cellular biology rather than ecological biology, right? Here at the University of Minnesota-Morris, our biology department is slowly but surly being usurped by the ecology folks. It's already split into two groups of professors -- those who specialize in cellular or ecological biology -- and it's driving PZ and others mad. I consider myself lucky I'm not a bio major.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:26 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","290"

In one simple sentence (and if you don't give the proper definition, I will give one that I am sure all the people who are on the non-religious side of the argument will agree with), give me your definition of evolution. I have seen many people bluster and make claims.. but often the ones that bluster the most know the least.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","02:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","291"

Let me state it out a little simpler and not as you erroneously stated: I said: If we are to assume that your perception of bluster, as noted in your post, is of any relevance, then you know less than anyone on this thread. TRANSLATED FOR THE SIMPLE MINDED: If others here on this thread accept as truth what Trebor stated in his previous post: "".. but often the ones that bluster the most know the least."" then the degree of his own bluster logically dictates that he knows less than anyone else. Capische? Do I need to spoon feed it? Hmmmm... Carry on.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","03:06 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","294"

However, in the biological texts, it is specifically called 'Decent with modification' Now, since you are so scornful of the TOE, do you know what the actual evidence is?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","04:00 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","295"

"05-22-2009","12023",20,"None","None","None","southern_reckon","354728","The debate title says: ""There is absolutely no convincing evidence of the theory of evolution"". The science is solid, evolution is a fact, and a cornerstone of modern biology. If there is evidence to the contrary, present a paper to one of the evolution journals. If the evidence is solid, you will change scientific minds. It is impossible to teach evolution in this forum. If you need to understand more about the Theory of Evolution, then I suggest Evolution101 podcast by Zachary Moore found at learnoutloud dot com. (Sorry, this is my first post, I cannot give the url). The core of this debate is in the first part of the title: ""There is absolutely no convincing evidence"". There is no amount of evidence that may be presented to change the mind of a hard core creationist or <pick your religious creation belief>. Guess what? That is perfectly fine. Teach it in Sunday school or the equivalent. However, do not call on science to defend your religious beliefs. Do not attempt to make a religious belief equal to science. Science is not magic. Science is not faith. It is simply a proven method of acquiring knowledge of our world. That method has improved our world since the Age of Reason. If the science contradicts your religious beliefs and you feel offended, then I am sorry you are offended. Submit the opposing evidence to the scientific journals and you may change my mind.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","09:34 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","300"
