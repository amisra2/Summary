"02-23-2010","12023",36,"iangb","391990","No, someone who is an agnostic and is not an atheist is an agnostic theist - and Accipter certainly isn't one of those. An athiest is not just 'someone who believes in no God'. It broadly means 'someone who does not believe in God' - the people with faith in God's absence are just a subset of all those who don't have faith in His presence. Like I said, (a)theism is a dichotomy. You either believe in a God, or you don't - you can be a skeptic, but you still have to lie on one side or other of that dividing line. Your attempt to label this as 'pedantic' is ironic, coming from someone who's currently trying to tell me what my beliefs (or lack thereof) are. (Oh - and who just took the time to look up and post the definition of 'pedantic'.) Agnostic atheism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia .","gansao","392000","An Athiest is someone who denies the existence of God. An agnostic is someone skeptical about the existence of God but does not profess true atheism Is this hard for you to understand? An Atheist agnostic or an agnostic atheist is clearly a BS term for someone who doesnt know what they believe but despite this wants to appear to be knowledgeable. Copy and pasting the definition of pedantic is not ironic nor does it make me pedantic instead of you .","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","01:21 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","526"

"02-23-2010","12023",36,"iangb","392012","...it only looks that way to you because we're going in circles. You have stated your opinion. I have cited my definition - repeatedly. That your opinion disagrees with my citations is not my problem, and repeating that opinion will get you nowhere.","gansao","392019","It is you that is going around in circles trying to created something complicated from something simple so that you appear clever. You wasnt aware of that post from Accipter was you? I never stated an opinion, I provided definitions to prove that Accipiter was not what he said he was..and succeeded","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","01:47 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","532"
"02-23-2010","12023",36,"iangb","392020","The opinion you've implied is that the definition you linked to is the only one for atheism that applies. The opinion you've stated is that an agnostic is someone who 'denies true atheism'. Both of these opinions conflict with my citations. Both of these opinions are incorrect. I don't disagree with your definitions - just your citations.","gansao","392021","I think Accipter cant call himself an atheist Where have I implied an agnostic is someone who denies true atheism. I have made very simple and accurate definitions and reached a conclusion using those definitions..the rest is in your head","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","01:59 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","534"
"02-23-2010","12023",36,"iangb","392029","The exact phrase you used was 'does not profess true atheism' - post #526. It is false because it implies that 'true atheism' is different from what it is. As I showed before - 'denial of god' is just one subset of non-believers, all of whom are 'true atheists'. Accipter can call himself an atheist for the same reason that I can - we have no belief in God.","gansao","392031","An Athiest is someone who denies the existence of God. Accipiter does not rule out the existence of God therefore he cannot deny Gods existence.

"02-23-2010","12023",36,"Freedom","391896","Only observed data, no experimental data. ....common descent...","Databed","392036","Common descent and also slow changes in the genome. You just lumped it all under a much broader category than what the experimental and observed data suggests. I doubt you even understand the ERV mapping or you would not have made that comment. You are really slipping here. All you have done so far is say that I am wrong. You have offered not even a speck of substance in your rebuttal. If you aren't going to address the actual issues I have presented then just stop commenting. That being said, explain to me how ERV's in our genome indicates only common descent and how common descent does not necessarily mean evolution. I am going to ignore the rest of your reply to keep you from coming back with feigned content.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","02:23 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","537"
"02-23-2010","12023",36,"iangb","392073","Just repeating this definition, over and over, gets you absolutely nowhere. I have said already - this is but one definition of atheist, one sub-set of all the possible things that an atheist can be while still being a 'true' atheist. An atheist can be someone who denies the existence of God - I'm not questioning this. An atheist can be anyone who falls within the broad definition of atheism - that of anyone who does not believe in a God. I've shown that the broader definition exists and should be applied. You are just repeating your small subsection of the definition over and over, in a manner that makes me suspect you aren't actually reading my arguments (or, at the very least, that you are responding to arguments other than the ones that I'm posting). In an attempt to break the cycle... an analogy. Let's say we are talking about Dr Iain Stewart (chosen at random because I've been watching an awesome TV series of his recently). In our analogy, you insist that Dr Stewart is 'not a doctor', quoting the (paraphrased) definition that 'a doctor is a qualified member of the medical profession'. I say he is a doctor, based on the broader definition: 'a doctor is anyone with a doctors degree (a PhD)'. All you respond with is the repetition of your definition. Now, replace Dr Stewart with Accipter, 'doctor' with 'atheist', your definition with 'an atheist denies God' and my broader definition with 'an atheist has no belief in God'. Analogy complete.","gansao","392076","Just denying a simple definition over and over again gets you nowhere. Trying to make a simple definition unduly complicated says more about you and your false analogy than 'pedantic' ever could.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","03:51 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","539"
