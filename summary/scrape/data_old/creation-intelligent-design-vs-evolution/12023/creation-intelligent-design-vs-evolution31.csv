"02-19-2010","12023",31,"Accipiter","391193","I have been sitting here reading this stuff and wondering what would happen if ID and IC was accepted by the scientific community, what then? How would they test the theory? Is it just to be considered proved based on what appears to be something resembling philosophy?","marc9000","391322","It would then be studied and observed in the scientific realm to a comparable extent that godless abiogenesis is studied and observed today. It would appear in high school science textbooks along side godless abiogenesis, with equal space and attention devoted to it. It would be open for study at the university level, receiving equal public funding and grants that godless abiogenesis receives today. Students who took an interest in focusing on it's study could do so without fear of discrimination. The ACLU couldn't sue local or state school boards over it. It would be as testable as godess abogenesis is testable. No, that's the way it already is with godless abiogenesis. It would REMOVE godless abiogeneis from that position, and make it accountable and answerable to alternative philosophies.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","07:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","454"

(I am a little surprised that you do not have a firm grasp of that simple concept.) Unfortunately there is no way to make a quantifiable observation or measurements to support your theory of god. I would be interested to know if anyone has any idea at all of how to go about doing that.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","07:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","455"

As there is no way to make quantifiable observation of a spontaneous origin of life billions of years ago. But you don't require it of abiogenesis studies? Why such a blatant double standard?

Bottom line is, all you have to say is that any new function cannot possibly arise because it could not be selected for before it exists. This makes any function in any organism impossible to explain with your definition of evolution. You lack fundamental understanding of how evolution works. Specifically, you don't seem to understand that evolution capitalizes on accidents. You gripe about the use of personified words to describe the processes that lead to changes in organisms yet you still seem to assign evolution with the necessity of intention and direction. You can have your definition of evolution and you can keep on making yourself look like an imbecile to the people who do understand the subject we are talking about. BTW, I thought this was funny...

I'm giving them time, and I'm busy, and bored with only one opponent. But what in this world does that have to do with answering a question here? You and Accipiter obviously don't - his question certainly wasn't original. When the same questions are asked over and over, there's nothing wrong with answering them over and over. Who knows, the answer could possibly sink if he sees it enough. Then again, maybe not. Can you reasonably challange my answer? Didn't think so. That would come in second on your skills list, your number one biggie is trolling. No wonder you don't post at EvC.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","11:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","464"

Cannot possibly arise under current understanding of evolution. Any novel function, functions may certainly be improved. I do not stand ashamed of what can only be described as healthy skepticism. Proponents of evolution are fighting over examples of ""micro-evolution"" no better proof than that can be found for the fact that just as this thread is titled there is no objective, clear, singular evidence for evolution. It is good that you mentioned ""my definition"" of evolution; I see this definition from dictionary.com ""Change in the genetic composition of a population during successive generations, as a result of natural selection acting on the genetic variation among individuals, and resulting in the development of new species."" I have made no arguements against this, this does not imply anything about increasing complexity, advancement. The definitional error is when one begins to speak of evolutionary history, which necessitates advancement and say it is explain by evolution, begging the question ""how do you go from change in genetic composition to advancement in genetic composition."" I have shown you the reason that is not the same thing as ""merely a beneficial change"" that beneficial can be novel functionality or improved functionality and that mutation can explain both, however; only mutation and natural selection can make the second probable. That being said there are other definitions floating around like ""evolution: The gradual process by which the present diversity of plant and animal life arose from the earliest and most primitive organisms, which is believed to have been continuing for the past 3000 million years."" Now tell me, isn't that the one you are really thinking of? If you were thinking of the first why didn't you defeat my arguements by merely stating that evolution does not claim to explain the last 3000 million years so IC is not a problem for the theory? I'll ignore the irrelevant attack and focus on what is very key to my points. That novel functionality must be an accident in evolution. You have been arguing pretty fervently for a while now, why did you just not say ""it was a single mutation"" if that was evolution's explanation? This side of the argument is taken, please return to your side. I know this isn't standard response but doesn't that make you more of an imbecile to be unable to destroy my logic? I do not hate to say it, but a billion voices matter little against one fact, even if those voices are coming from lab coats. I have not made an appeal to people or religion, and thankfully you have not made a serious appeal to people or atheism.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","11:58 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","465"
