Were we to place fruit flies in a novel environment we would expect them to adapt. This adaptation won't necessarily be in new body parts, but could reflect changes in size or shape or brain structure. Then again the actual body parts could change, eg if they were placed in an environment where flight was useless their wings might mutate into something else.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","07:29 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","4"

Yankeefanwill refuse to define what he means as it allows him to reject everything that proves we are right. Notice he doesn't define what a new body part means. Notice his reply to Symbiote. He's not interested in the real definition of evolution and how it works. He's attempting to 'refute' evolution based on his own strawman. It's a classic creationist tactic. Never discuss honestly the issue but attempt through dishonest methods to refute evolution. Our failure to meet yankeefan's strawman criteria will only prove to rational people that his strawman is poorly designed. But to an avid creationist who has been annihilated on another board over and over again, it will feed his ideology that his evidence free belief is valid. Of course it's still a false dichotomy, but logic, reason and facts are not found in YEC creationism.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","09:24 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","8"

Define evolution before you start arguing about what constitutes as evidence for or against it.","Archangel","334339","I think his point is paulie, that if evolution is actually as evo defines it, as changes made by way of random mutations, then why doesn't life reflect those random mutations? For example, why haven't a large number of lower animals who live their lives being hunted by carnivores adapted eyes in the back of their heads as a needed early warning system to see their stalkers coming from behind them? Especially in times of drought and famine when food is scarce? The environmental pressure exists at those times to justify such a change, yet from fish to birds to reptiles to mammals to even insects, most every creature in creation has 2 eyes, 1 mouth, 2 ears, (if they even have ears since some animals use vibration sensors to locate the movement of prey and predator.) It makes sense that Eagles, Hawks and Falcons have only 2 eyes since they are apex predators which rule their skies. But they regularly swoop down on smaller birds and pluck them out of the sky for food for their young. So why haven't smaller birds found the need to evolve eyes in the back of their heads? One reptile has a type of third eye, but it isn't for sight nor is it permanent. It is used to absorb vitamin D from the Sun for the first 6 months of life in order to help it grow into a healthy adult. Then it is covered by scales. Tuatara Fact Sheet But the question persists as to why it seemingly devolved the need for that third eye if it originally had 3 working eyes? I mean, it didn't simultaneously evolve a poison gland or some other form of defense to replace the need for it. Now let's look at some insects which you will invariably mention as flaws in my argument. They too have extra eyes called ocelli, not working eyes mind you; and neither do they aid in sight but the ocelli are simple structures and are believed they only detect light levels and movement. Now why would evolution not give vulnerable flying insects perfect vision when they have allegedly had literally hundreds of millions of years and many reasons to evolve it? Are you aware that the visual acuity of insects is approximately 1% of that of humans? And we all know that humans don't have the best eye sight in the animal kingdom. MICROSCOPY-UK / MICSCAPE - Insect insights. Insect eyes. Honeybee legs. What really distinguishes evolutionists from creationists is that creationists will ask the questions fear to ask since this fraudulent gospel has so many inconsistencies which can't be reasonably or rationally answered, they refuse to even consider them. Keep in mind that I have pointed out scientifically documented realities about what exists within the animal kingdom, but what I will get back from you are what ifs and maybes regarding these inconsistencies. Why is it that you never look at what is evolutionary dogma and ask why if random mutation happens based on environmental, social and predatory pressures, hasn't it made more diverse selections where needed, as in a working third eye in the back of animals heads, rather than in all cases follow a proscribed formula which exists today, just as it existed in the oldest fossils ever collected?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:42 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","10"

Er . . . they have, sort of. Prey animals, such as antelope, have eyes on the sides of their heads so as to spot approaching carnivores. This gives them a very wide field of vision. For example the pronghorn antelope has a field of vision of around 320 degrees.
