The accumulation of changes towards the structure to be explained is absolutely core to the explaination, and an axiom of the concept (now that I have read OOS I can assure you of that). That is why IC is a problem even though it makes no specific claims about what can happen and what can't. The assumption that smooth selective gradients exist between selectable functions is unfounded. So yes, one does imply such spontaneous events if one claims that the process as we know it produced all biology; because there are times and places (which far out number the inverse) where selection simply is not applicable. i.e. regardless of pressure no element is presented which it can act on.","Databed","432491","It is an increase of information. 1011011 is less information than 10110111011011. In addition, any change to any little bit of a DNA sequence is in fact an increase in information. If I have two dogs, one with a mutation and one without, I now have more information contained in those two dogs than I would in two identical dogs (or either dog alone). Please don't provoke this nonsense Matthew. Just take my word for it - Freedom will never back down from this issue no matter what corner you back him into.

So an increase of genetic material means an increase in DNA which means an increase of genetic information.","Databed","432492","He just means that it only means more physical material -and maybe that two identical disks side by side only contain as much information as any one of the disks alone. He misses the point - if you repeat the same information twice on the same disk, that is in fact more information as it might result in an extra toe or something like that. He is just being bratty and nitpicking something he clearly knows is not what the original author was trying to say.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","06:07 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","812"

The debate is over, and in my judgment, IC fails completely. For what it's worth, anyone who wants a really good example of why should read Sean B. Carroll's The Making of the Fittest , or Jerry Coyne's Why Evolution Is True . The odds are not nearly as long as people think, and once population sizes, generation times, and available time are accounted for, the odds are actually on the side of mutations producing selectively advantageous features in the long run. (Unfortunately, I moved recently, and a box containing a number of my biology books was damaged in transit, with about a dozen books gone missing. I apologize for not being able to provide more specific reference.) Hell, it's been observed in the lab, in the justly famous and still continuing Lenski experiments at Michigan State. The guy deserves a Nobel Prize. In fairness to Freedom, though, I don't believe he has ever said that evolution itself is impossible. He also doesn't argue in favor of an intelligent designer of any usual sort, be it Yahweh or any other deity, so far as I can tell. In his response to Gen on this very thread, he said as much. Where Freedom disagrees is his notion that random mutation plus natural selection is not an adequate model of evolution, even just as a basic way of putting it. He thinks that IC diagnoses a deep problem, but not one that rules evolution out or deities in. As noted, I think he's entirely wrong about that, and I've state why more than once, no need to rehash here. But I think it's important to be fair about what he's saying, because as far as I can tell he's not wrong about all of it. I could be wrong about his general position as described above, and I'm sure he or someone else will correct me if I am.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","09:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","815"
"06-20-2011","12023",55,"Freedom","432515","Matthew what experiments or models were used in the books you mention? If they are merely arguments for random chance... What's my problem then? I have identified it by defining two terms, rational and irrational evolution. Rational evolution is the processes we know about (RM+NS) and anything it can produce by the laws and patterns we can verify and understand. Irrational evolution in a pseudo-magical entity that is treated almost as an intelligent designer itself, it contains the idea of NS and RM but doesn't limit it's claims to it's means. It can accomplish anything based on whether NS would select for that thing not based on whether RM+NS could assemble it. You have no idea how many times I have heard 'but if X does show up NS will select it, therefore it was evolved'. It blurs the difference between theory and fact, observation and explanation; since it claims to explain life and common descent, these fact of life is supposed to mean it itself is a fact. I claim that irrational evolution is impossible, not unlikely; impossible. It is scientific embarrassment and a mess. That is what IC blocks not the odds themselves, it is saying the odds as they first appear are unmitigated by an ordered process lie NS. Given how consistently this is the case... ...you can surely understand why Behe & friends think they have found a problem with evolutionary theory. If people had said 'oh yea we understand that' to his IC analysis he wouldn't have written a book I'm sure.","Matthew","432735","Any number of experiments, from the ongoing Lenski experiment at Michigan State to experiments about the evolution of ultraviolet vision in birds. As for the model... They are not arguments for random chance. They do presume -- indeed, explain -- what is meant by calling mutation ""random."" Coyne actually suggests that ""indifferent"" would be a much better way of describing mutations, i.e., they occur indifferent to the needs of the organism in which they occur: they might help, they might hurt, they might do nothing, but they occur regardless of their consequences. No, the model being defended is that populations evolve -- not that individuals mutate, but that populations evolve -- thanks to the combined impact of random mutation AND natural selection. Let me jump ahead in your post a moment: Which is to say, the books above are using what you call rational evolution as their model. They are including both random mutation and natural selection as parts of the model. What I still don't understand is (a) who has ever argued that random mutation without natural selection is evolution, or (b) who has ever argued that there can be natural selection on something that hasn't already come to be through variation ultimately derived from random mutation, or (c) who has ever claimed that because something could have happened according to mutational and selective steps x and y and z, it did happen according to mutational and selective steps x and y and z. I have simply never seen anyone claim (a) or (b). The standard model is and always has been that both random mutation and natural selection are necessary for evolution, at least insofar as evolution is a matter of adaptation. And while I have seen claims about (c), every author I've ever seen do this in the popular literature points out that such-and-such is a hypothesis, possibly even a highly speculative one at present. They are trying to provide plausible reconstructions of how this or that phenomenon evolved. So what they do is try to figure out what sorts of mutations and selective conditions would do it. That mutations and selection could do it, however, is something for which they argue only against those who think that they couldn't, e.g. Behe. All in all, I don't see the distinction between RE and IE, as you're trying to make it, because I have no idea who has ever argued for IE. Evolutionists are all claiming that both random mutation and natural selection, together , are what produce evolutionary change in populations over time. So while I appreciate that you aren't doing so deliberately with any sort of malicious intent, I think you've constructed a straw man. Back to the earlier part of the post: But as near as I can tell, everyone is saying this! Random mutation alone is just random mutation, not evolution. Natural selection alone is just natural selection, not evolution. In order for a population to evolve, random variants must be subject the non-random process of natural selection. I just don't know who is claiming otherwise. You say: But I can't think of any cases at all! Show me the published authors who are making the argument you're trying to counter. Until then, I really don't get it. And I certainly don't see how IC helps, even on your own terms, because... ...Behe is arguing that random mutation plus natural selection is not sufficient to explain how complex features evolve, at least at the cellular level. That's why he's part of the Intelligent Design movement. He thinks that if there's something irreducibly complex, the process of random mutation plus natural selection couldn't have produced it -- only an intelligent designer could. It is abundantly clear that you are not a creationist. Nonetheless, the concept you are defending seems to be that of Behe, who uses it to argue that RM+NS is not a good enough model for how adaptive evolution occurs, at least at the level of cells and biochemistry. So I believe we can be forgiven if a lot of us find your view rather confusing. Just some thoughts. Still have no idea what you think is the problem with evolution, such that it needs to be distinguished into an RE and an IE model, since no one has ever used the IE model. And still have no clue what is right about IC, such that it will explain how RM and NS jointly produce evolutionary change, since other exponents of IC use it to argue against RM+NS accomplishing anything at all.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","11:00 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","817"

This is non-controversial -- but it is also a straw man, insofar as no one has ever said that random mutation alone is evolution. No one thinks that something as complex as a flagellum develops as a result of a single mutation. It takes a whole series of mutations (or variations ultimately derived from mutation), each subject to natural selection. The thing is, this is not how IC gets used by anyone. The whole reason why Behe thinks it's a big deal is that, in his view, it shows why complex phenomena (at least at the cellular or biochemical level) couldn't have evolved -- ""rationally"" or ""irrationally"" -- but had to be designed. It's what makes the complexity allegedly irreducible: if the complex phenomenon can't be reduced in complexity without being rendered useless. It's not just the idea of a complex feature evolving in a single-stroke that he's trying to rule out. It's the idea of stepwise mutations and selection events being capable of evolving complexity that he's trying to eliminate. Ultimately, I don't think that's remotely justified. I'm really not sure that IC means what you think it means -- or that it's used as you think it's used.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:35 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","818"
"06-21-2011","12023",55,"Stonewall","432873","The whole argument just seems to come down to odds, which is ridiculously silly. The odds of any mutation are going to be exceedingly small... even a 'common' mutation is going to have small odds. When you are talking about odds, it's often meaningless. Consider the odds that you (or I) are alive today... First of all, your mother and father had to find themselves in the same city, out of all the cities on earth... they had to find each other out of the 6+ billion people on earth, and they had to be in the situation that they had to meet each other. Then... what are the odds that they hit it off, and eventually decide to have sex on just the right day, so that just the right egg, out of all the eggs your mother produced in her life, and just the right sperm, out of allllllllllllllllll the sperms that your father created in his life, would be able to perform the very rare action of fertilization, etc. You get the point... I just tried to look up the odds for a sperm's chance of fertilizing an egg and stumbled on this site... The chances of you existing It doesn't take into account a lot of other factors, and I don't know exactly how accurate it is, but: The point is that you are here, and I'm here despite the odds being so stupidly low. And if things hadn't happened that exact way, and you and I didn't exist, two other people would exist whose existence would be just as unlikely. It's like lottery numbers. The chance of any individual number being picked is very small, but one of the numbers does get picked. 12345678 is just as likely 47632753... but as humans, we view things as being special. Those mutations that led to novel functions are special... the odds are too low. The universe is special, the odds of its existence are too low... humans are too special, the odds of them being here is just too low. People are just really, really bad with probabilities.","Freedom","432877","That is a strawman. First of all Mendelian genetics does not permit that each sperm or egg is unique in a significant way. The reason that however (along with lotteries) are a bad example is because the odds of what happened just as it happened were low but the odds of the class of phenomenon were high. Not that my parents found each other out of 6 billion but that one person found another, not that one sperm out of millions found one egg, but that an egg found a sperm. The chances of one person winning the lottery are low, but someone must win the lottery. That is not true in cases of probability and you and I both know it. The chances that earth will be hit by a extinction level asteroid are quite low, but it does happen exceedingly rarely. Do you think people don't realize that you have to multiply the odds against the number of trials? Of course they know it, behe wrote a book after his first examining the numbers. The final odds are unbelievably more likely than the single event, but still effectively zero for many of the systems he analyzed. I am interested in the odds, but I am more interested in people understanding what is what; what argument is about odds and what is about a process which may ignore the odds because of some informational feedback.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","10:49 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","821"
