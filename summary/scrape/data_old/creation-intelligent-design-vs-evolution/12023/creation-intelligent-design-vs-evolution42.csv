As you say it is impossible to be objective but you can bracket out one's bias as well as one can. Going back to your point about the ""...and they suppress the truth in unrighteousness."" I infer that you mean that they are the non biblical adherents and that we are suppressing some truth. If this is the case could you substantiate or retract your implication?","fartingle","411702","You are the reason I put ""(most of)"". It is that people create other explanations for things to avoid the accountibility of a holy God. Of course, I already knew this would really have meaning only for me.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","616"

(Earthquakes, the aurora's, volcanoes, etc.). No. The passage is in the context of morals, but also about how God shows himself through nature. So it is really finding out the way God made these phenomena work.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","04:13 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","618"

Just like we know lightning does not require the hand of Zeues. Nothing in human history has been adequately substantiated as needing a non materialistic explanation. This does not rule out magic but it is substantial evidence that there is no supernatural or magic going on in our world.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","06:33 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","619"

If he did, then said phenomena absolutely required him to create them in the first place (he did not make only stagnant air, only non-active earth, or a sun that sheds nothing)","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","04:12 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","620"

Which is why I say the word supernatural is void because no one I have ever met (nor myself) can find an objective difference between them besides the mysticism associated with one. If there was a God and he was standing right before me this very minute my first question would be 'what are you?'. Under what justification do you declare God unnatural? The triumph of reason over mysticism is far deeper than mere proof of a God. It requires something that can never happen, proof that proofs aren't required. Even so that does not defeat the christian (again looking to the catholics) view of evolution. If god made all the world so that it's rules never appear to be broken why would he break that pattern to make life?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","07:27 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","621"

I conclude that your god is not required for and earth quake the same way I conlude that lightning does not require another god (not your one): we know what causes them.
