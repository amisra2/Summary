From that cornerstone, fundamental areas of research has blossomed. 3. In order to understand the fact of evolution, one must understand how science works. 4. Scientists ask testable questions. At any point a testable question may be proven false. 5. Scientist test the questions through experiments and observations. 6. Once a testable question passes many, many experiments and observations, then the question get bumped up to a theory. 7. A theory is not just some idea or explanation. It is a comprehensive explanation that has stood the test of time and is unlikely to be altered in the face of new evidence. 8. Once a testable question becomes a theory, the theory allows scientists to make predictions and to be confirmed with evidence. 9. If the theory can stand up to repeated tests and confirmations of predictions, then it is considered a scientific fact. Before I go any further, I have to know. Do you agree or disagree with any of these 9 statements? If you agree with these statement, then I can move on to show that evolution is a scientific fact. If you do not agree with these statements, then I need to know which statements you disagree with and why.","Steamroller","354955","I have no problem with the statements you have made thus far.

However, you have to be careful where you draw the implication. Just because a textbook says, ""15 billion years ago, the expansion of the universe began with the big bang, 4.5 billion years ago the Earth formed, and 3.5 billion years ago life arose and began evolving,"" does not mean that all these processes are part of the same theory. This could be a helpful analogy: It's a high school physics class, and the students have to do a problem that involves variables for properties such as momentum, energy, mass, velocity, acceleration, and force all at once. But that wouldn't mean that all the variables represent the same properties. No. This is because genetic mutations do not happen in a linear fashion. There are more than 6 billion human beings on this planet, and not a single one will ever experience the same genetic mutations at conception that another does. Millions of mutations happen in every new individual organism -- it's not a controlled aspect of life. Natural selection, or the environment, is the force that weeds out the not-so-helpful genetic traits from the helpful. If evolution were a linear force, then our muskrat-like ancestor would be able to survive in every environment on Earth. But of course that isn't the case. Some mammals have genetic traits that make them much more suited for hot deserts (camels) where vegetation and water is scarce, while other mammals are suited for tropical rain forests (ex. jaguars), and others for colder temperatures (yak oxen). If life were not diversified, evolution would be in big trouble. One of the specific scientific predictions of evolution is that life will be diversified and suited to the different environments. The fact that life is so diversified is what actually lead Darwin to discover natural selection in the first place. While visiting the Galapagos Islands, Darwin realized on every island, there were different variants of finches, with beaks and size being the primary differences: On some islands, the finches had large, short beaks for cracking large seeds that were only present on that island, while on other islands, the finches were smaller and had longer, narrower beaks for tiny seeds from plans that weren't on the other islands. Diversification is one of the primary pieces of evidence for evolution, not against it. Unfortunately for most of the life that has ever been on this planet, adaptation is not very useful in the grand scheme of things. A rat can adapt to slightly colder temperatures by burrowing into the ground, but he's screwed if the environment dips down -40 on a regular basis. You asked why some mammals evolved into whales, and answer seems clear enough when talking about this issue: Muskrats can't well swim 2,000 feet down into the ocean, can they? Take Darwin's finches again. Unless they have evolved the proper beak, a genetic trait, there would be no way for some of those finches to eat the seeds that other finches eat. They can't adapt to that situation because it's not possible for them to simply grow differently-sized and shaped beaks at will. Even the ability to adapt is itself an evolutionary trait. We humans heavily rely on adaptation, but we wouldn't be able to do so if we hadn't had our large, complex brains. When we experience a situation like the finches on the Galapagos Islands, we design our own tools or perhaps move to a better environment, but birds don't have the intelligence capacity to do that. You have stumbled upon a good point, though, and that's that mammals are fairly well adapted for many environments right out of the womb. Mammals live all over the world in all but the very most extreme environments, and mammal-like animals have been around since before the dinosaurs. Like the shark, the mammal is an unusually successful specimen of life. Part of what make mammals so successful are their features: they are warmblooded, so they can generate their own heat and survive in colder temperatures as long as there is food available; hair has become useful in all sorts of ways for controlling the body temperature further; the females protect and produce milk for their young, ensuring a better survival rate for their kin than other animals; and many mammals have much larger, quicker, and more complex brains than their reptilian and water-breathing counterparts.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","01:45 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","309"

"05-25-2009","12023",21,"None","None","None","southern_reckon","354977","Before I delve into species, you need a quick and dirty background of evolution: The following is summarized from the Evolution 101 podcast by Dr. Zachary Moore, PhD and can be found on the learnoutloud dot com. I. The fact of evolution basically means change of allele frequency of a population over time. 1. A loose definition of allele is essential a gene or set of genes responsible for characteristics of an organism. (Example: An allele for blue eyes or the redness of a flower) 2. In essence the fact of evolution says that the genes of a population of plants or animals change over time. If the changes help the plant or animal to survive, then the number of animals with the change will increase. 3. Example from Scientific American April 2009: Southern California is seeing a rise in snakebites that is extremely toxic. Why? The normal rattlesnakes in Southern California are the red and speckled rattlesnake. People are killing them off because these two snakes are noisy with their rattles and hiss. As a result the frequency of the Southern Pacific rattlesnake is increasing. The Southern Pacific has an allele that tells it not to hiss and not to rattle so much when they are threatened. It lays low, but the chances of a human encounter is high and the snake bites. The bite of the Southern Pacific is wicked and has three types of toxins. Due to environmental pressures (created by people), there is an increase in the genes or alleles to have snakes that are quieter. It just happens that the quieter snake is more venomous than the ones the humans are killing off. II. What is NOT evolution? Some people like to say there are different kinds of evolution. This is not true. 1. You may hear terms such as: a. Cosmic, Chemical, or Planetary evolution. (Big bang, chemical creation, planet creation) b. Organic evolution: life evolving from non-life or abiogenesis. c. Macro evolution: Changes between kinds of plants and animals d. Micro evolution: Changes within kinds of plants and animals 2. Cosmic, Chemical, Planetary, and organic evolution has absolutely nothing to do with evolution and serves to bring confusion to the field. 3. Some people (especially creationists) like to differentiate macro- and micro- evolution claiming they have different mechanisms. The term kinds is a biblical term, not a scientific term. The only difference between the two concepts is scale. The same mechanisms apply to both macro- and micro- evolution. 4. Some people give poor analogies of evolution or setting up of straw men to easily knock down. There are many variations, but the original one is the watch and the watchmaker. Clearly, a watch cannot come into existence by random chance. It must have a watchmaker and a designer. By analogy, life must have a maker and designer. This analogy misses the point entirely. 5. Some ask, what is the goal of evolution. Evolution has NO GOAL. Humans are no more highly evolved than bacteria. Both sets of organisms are adapted to their environment and surviving quite well. My next post will delve more into your question of species.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","311"

Hooved mammals, cats, and dogs are each fairly good examples of clear evolutionary chronologies, in both the fossil record and DNA. Mammals with hooves are good because we see them in all kinds of environments: The first mammals with hooves, tens of millions of years ago, were about the size of a small domestic cat. The various species diversified, and some became about the size of a wolf, while others went on to evolve into mammals that rivaled large dinosaurs. We have horses, donkeys, ox, cows, yak and such today, and then we have the whales, my personal favorite example of evolution in the fossil record. Small, vegetarian hooved mammals started swimming in shallow water and eating underwater vegetation; eventually their bodies became more adept for swimming with arrival of shorter arms and wider appendages; their skulls and bodies became slimmer; eventually their teeth allowed them to eat meat, and by then they looked a lot like a crocodile; finally, with larger and more effective flippers, heavier bodies, and lack of legs allowed them to take to the oceans. I'm not really sure how the following kinds of beaks could possibly come about in a single lifetime: If you've ever seen a bird change beak size and shape depending on the food given to it, I'd be excited to hear about that, but I won't cross my fingers.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:56 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","312"

OK.... two questions.","trebor","354982","There are multiple threads of evidence.. there is no one piece of evidence that 'proves' that once species share a common ancestor with another. This is known as 'convergence of evidence'. One of the pieces of evidence is the genetic evidence. Another piece that is important also is the fossil evidence. Now, the media tends to overstate what the scientific claims are, so while it might be a good '90,000 feet' overview , often it is not accurate when looked at closely. For example, the 47 million year old Ida is probably NOT a human ancestor, although it could be considered a 'transitional form', since it has certain traits that distinguish it from older forms that is more 'human' like than older fossils. It is a very important fossil, since it fills in a lot of 'blanks' we have in exactly what happened. However, it isn't nearly as dramatic of a change in thought that other fossils were in the past. It is a pretty fossil, and a dramatic specimen.. but it's importance is hyped up. Now, when it comes to new species, we can not only see evidence in genetics, and in the fossil record, but by seeing their ability for reproductions. If you look at the donkey and the horse, part of the reason we can guess they are related species, and had a common ancestor is that they can reproduce with each other, although their offspring is sterile 99.xxx% of the time. If you look at tigers and lions, they can produce offspring, however, the males are sterile, and the females usually aren't. Remember, fossil evidence and morphology (comparing how simularities from skeletons) were the main way for trying to figure out a 'family tree'. It has only been recently through being able to do genetic analysis and figuring out the genome of species that we have further evidence for the commonality of descent for species. Some of the evidence we found when we did that was interesting to say the least. Apparently, the split between the chimp line and the human line was a bit messier than thought, and hominids and the chimp ancestors swamped genes for a few hundred thousand years after they started becoming seperate species.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:21 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","313"
