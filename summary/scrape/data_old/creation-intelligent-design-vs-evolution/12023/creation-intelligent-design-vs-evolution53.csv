"05-23-2011","12023",53,"Accipiter","430442","Do birds need jet engines? No they don't, but boy it would sure be a tremendous advantage! Evolution is driven by the environment, if a species can reproduce and maintained great enough numbers their would be no pressure from the environment to change. Lots of organisms have not changed since their arrival, what requires them to increase their ""performance""?","Freedom","430464","Evolution as we know it is driven by benefit that allows for greater reproductive success and that encompasses everything. There is always pressure where there is reproduction and death. Whether anything changes depends not on whether something else would be better but on whether a change was beneficial. So no, you are dead wrong. It doesn't matter how many of a species is flying or running about, if a change is beneficial; say a jet engine. It will be selected.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","04:11 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","784"

"05-23-2011","12023",53,"Freedom","430476","Why are there dolphins? Until we know how novel systems come about we can't know why some are generated but others are not. The easy answer would be to say that the function is IC (like all systems) and it cannot just spontaneously form, but that is true of gills and lungs even in their respective species. Obviously they do exist so something made them.","Accipiter","430485","What made icicles?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","10:09 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","788"

No what gives snow flakes their ordered shape is what I described.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","11:20 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","791"

"05-24-2011","12023",53,"Freedom","430476","I don't know if you are the same one who made the mistake before, but you are confusing the inefficiency of the motor with the inefficiency of the system. Massive energy is wasted in the free burning of hydrocarbons to heat. If you could effectively transmit bio-chem energy to a neodymium electric motor (just an example) you would see how absurd it is to consider limbs more efficient than rotary devices in these cases. I do admit limbs are far more versatile for such creatures that need it.","Stonewall","430523","No, that wasn't me. Here's an interesting article on bird efficiency and jet efficiency. Scientific Analysis of the Efficiency of Bird Flight Yeah, electric motors are efficient, but jet engines aren't so much (which is what you originally said). Even so, like you said, the versatility of birds' wings and bodies in general are better (for their purpose) than anything we could design. Just like animal legs are better than wheels, etc.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","02:10 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","793"
"05-25-2011","12023",53,"Freedom","430526","I thought you did. I have no idea what relevance icicles would have.","Accipiter","430581","Well I guess that snowflakes would do just as well because they are also unique in shape and a product of their environment. You trying to tell me that the environment is not responsible for shaping the things and organisms with in it is simply inane. You have put yourself in a position where your arguments must become increasingly ridiculous to defend the foundational argument. You have invented your own special physics to create a universe that fits your arguments which would not work and you are the only person in the entire world who believe it is correct. You are a complete waste of time, I insult myself by discussing anything with you.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","01:31 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","795"
