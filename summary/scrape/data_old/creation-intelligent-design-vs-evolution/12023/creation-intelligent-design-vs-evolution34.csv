So it depends on how you see it, if you think I can't take the scientific part without the dogma part I think it's false without a shadow of a doubt. I don't believe ID is the only possible answer, unlike those who are supposed to be scientists I do not have a problem with not knowing everything scientifically because if one did then one would have to have all data, or contradict the scientific method in the first place. As I said before I do believe ID is likely but I have no evidence in biology to point to that belief, I will not commit the same fallacy as you have and inject irrelevant opinion into this debate. Bottom line being, I don't know but one doesn't have to know the root of a equation to tell you it isn't a cherry sunday.","Accipiter","391616","I am still interested in how one might take the concept of ID and turn it into something tangible, I cant see how scientists (or any one else) would go about doing that. Of course my personal limitations could be the problem but I still would be interested to hear any speculation. Observable evidence supporting the TOE is all over place in living things as well as fossils, artificial selection and artificial speciation have been observed and all of it makes for some pretty compelling evidence. How can ID be observed in such a way that it will produce evidence as compelling as the evidence supporting the TOE? To me ID sounds like a nice idea but I cant see it really going from an idea to something tangible.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","11:48 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","497"

I believe evidence for ID (if any) would take the form of philosophical analysis of some of the most basic observations of the universe. Here is where I will probably get dinged, most people would claim philosophy is not science, I am somewhat unique in that I think science is all knowledge reached by rational thought, certainly evolutionist agree on the premise as you cannot falsify evolution by experiment. So I believe one can come to conclusions and just like science take them to be true until you either discover the premises you used were false or extra variables that change the nature of your understanding. Please note this is not the same was what I have been saying about evolution, for since a problem with evolution has been found one of the premises ""evolution is the mechanism"" is false. Are you aware of Aristotles observation of the prime mover? The only way to avoid the prime mover argument for ID is to have energy eternal. In other words either the universe always was, or the prime mover always was. The big bang is all good and well, but all energy and matter spontaneously spawned? On what physical law is that based, by what in all our observations could cause that to be scientific? When has anything ever acted without reason? ""For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction except for the greatest reaction/action"" - Why? If the universe has always existed then one can take infinite time for any given physical process to be infinite and approach this analysis from the philosophical version of ""taking the limit as X approaches infinity"" If one considers that the universe has existed for an infinite amount of time, then all elements of the universe have existed for an infinite amount of time. Hold on because that last may be confused for the fallacy of composition, without a reference frame you cannot differentiate time, if there was any change in the nature of the universe it would be 0 or infinity, as it is multiplied by infinity. So if stars died or gravity collected mass that would be continuing for an infinite amount of time, which means they reach equilibrium and are dynamic over relative points but do not change their nature or energy. As far as we can tell energy has existed back towards the big bang, and farther if one wants to exclude faith. Alright here is the crux, if intelligence is part of the universe (and it is we are here) then it cannot be increasing or decreasing except on relative reference frame. So either intelligence has always existed, or intelligence designed and formed the universe, and the universe has not always existed. We have scientific evidence we have not always existed, therefore the latter. This is obviously quite shaky as far as logic goes; probably the most unacceptable part to you is the change in elemental conclusion about the universe. This line of reasoning condensed could be seriously condensed if one assumed there was no universe before the big bang: Either the universe has always existed or that which formed it has, the universe has not always existed therefore the thing which formed it has. Well you certainly got the more speculative end of my brain If you have read my response to databed you know that I find that evaluation a failure to separate necessary evidence from inferential evidence. In other words evolution predicts common descent and common descent predicts our fossil record, our fossil record exists that is only direct evidence for common descent. Anything further would take the form of ""Since evolution claims to explain common descent and that is true evolution must be true"" Comparing two 0's here I'm afraid. Like so many generations before us, we are just going to have to wait for more data. I however suspect that it won't be that simple, you see I am not a super naturalist but an ultra naturalist. I think if there is a designer it wouldn't be above existence but its core. Therefore if one is looking for evidence of a designer by searching for contradictions in the universes laws that could only be explained by an intelligent force changing those laws one will not find it. I saw a quote about how scientists will climb the last peak of knowledge to find theologians there, that may be true but I like to climb Let it be known this response was drastically off topic, I dont want to hear about it in relation to evolution not even to commit an ad homenim circumstantial fallacy.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","01:05 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","498"

Even Newtonian physics allows for the possibility of a black hole . Current physics predict that the universe was once a singularity. All of the above can be calculated through observation and mathematics. None of the above can answer the question of ID. Science does not need the possibility of ID to progress. ID is an opinion elevated by the holders of that opinion to a philosophy. Believers in God have no doubt that there is intelligent design.Athiests have no doubt there was not ID and scientists care not one way or another until the question effects science. Debating ID is for fun not for profit.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","09:06 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","500"

Here is an experiment: Hypothesis: the earliest organisms were living in water. This can be seen by dating the fossil layers in which they are found and comparing their structure to today's creatures of the sea. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the first emergence of legs would be found in layers above that of the earliest aquatic organisms. Take it further, the emergence of wings would be found above the earliest land walkers. What do you know, hypothesis is verified. One point for evolution. A better experiment can be performed when you look into ERV mapping, especially in primates and hominids. You come up with a hypothesis, knowing from fossil records that humans probably evolved from a common ancestor as monkeys, that you should find ERV's matched in the two that aren't found in any other animals (except for those who also evolved from the common ancestor of course). You should also hypothesize that there won't be any ERVs that humans and dogs have, but monkeys do not (sometimes you do see deletions, but this is obvious based on the surrounding DNA.) Both assumptions are verified no matter where you look. Another point for evolution. ID cannot make such predictions. It is more philosophy (really religion, but I will steer away from that). It can only be assumed true based on what a person chooses to believe, but never on data or experiment.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:46 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","505"
