"02-23-2010","12023",35,"None","None","None","Iuris","391951","Actually, gansao, you'll find that atheism is a broad term covering a whole host of varied positions. From those who simply say god hasn't been proven yet, to those who claim that god can't be proven at all to those who actively claim god doesn't exist. With all kinds of positions in between. Looking at definitions of ""weak"" atheism, I'd be hard pressed to find the actual difference from agnosticism...","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","10:08 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","520"

"02-23-2010","12023",35,"iangb","391976","I am your guest. There are two dichotomies being discussed here: (a)Theism - whether you believe in a God or not. (a)Gnositicism - whether you (think you) know something or not. The thing about dichotomies is that you cannot ignore them - you have to fall one side or the other. You can't be just 'an agnostic' - you have to be 'an agnostic' about something ( thanks for the example, Obama ). Simple maths, then, dictates that you have a combination of four possibles to choose from: Gnostic theist - one who believes in God, and is certain of it. For example: those who claim to have had a 'personal experience'. Agnostic theist - one who believes in God, but cannot be sure. For example: who were born into the faith and don't see any reason to change. Gnostic atheist - one who does not believe in God, and is fully confident in this lack of belief. For example: Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens and any 'strong' atheist; the terms are synonymous. Agnostic atheist - one who does not believe in God, but accepts that they may be wrong. For example: myself, Accipter, TQ (I think) and any 'weak' atheist; the two terms are synonymous. Thus, as someone who isn't sure but chooses not to believe, Accipter is an agnostic atheist. EDIT: It's true that 'agnostic' is often taken to be about atheism because it's where the word is most commonly used - hence your definition. However, being an agnostic and being an atheist are by no means mutually exclusive - and being 'an agnostic' does not prevent you from being a theist.","gansao","391980","An atheist is someone who denies the existence of God An agnostic is someone skeptical about the existence of God but does not profess true atheism. Accipter is an agnostic not an atheist. All the rest is irrelevant and a chance for you to be pedantic. pedantic /pdntk/ Show Spelled[puh-dan-tik] Show IPA adjective .overly concerned with minute details or formalisms","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","523"
"02-23-2010","12023",35,"iangb","391990","No, someone who is an agnostic and is not an atheist is an agnostic theist - and Accipter certainly isn't one of those. An athiest is not just 'someone who believes in no God'. It broadly means 'someone who does not believe in God' - the people with faith in God's absence are just a subset of all those who don't have faith in His presence. Like I said, (a)theism is a dichotomy. You either believe in a God, or you don't - you can be a skeptic, but you still have to lie on one side or other of that dividing line. Your attempt to label this as 'pedantic' is ironic, coming from someone who's currently trying to tell me what my beliefs (or lack thereof) are. (Oh - and who just took the time to look up and post the definition of 'pedantic'.)
