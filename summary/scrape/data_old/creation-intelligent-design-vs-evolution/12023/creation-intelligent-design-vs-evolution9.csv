How completely inconsistent of you. Is there no end to the contradictions within evolutionary theory which you wont claim in order to cover its failings? In every other debate here it has been defended that the process of GRADUAL evolution is based on random mutations by way of Natural Selection. Here's the definition: evolution |evlo sh n| noun the process by which different kinds of living organisms are thought to have developed and diversified from earlier forms during the history of the earth. The idea of organic evolution was proposed by some ancient Greek thinkers but was long rejected in Europe as contrary to the literal interpretation of the Bible. Lamarck proposed a theory that organisms became transformed by their efforts to respond to the demands of their environment, but he was unable to explain a mechanism for this. Lyell demonstrated that geological deposits were the cumulative product of slow processes over vast ages. This helped Darwin toward a theory of gradual evolution over a long period by the natural selection of those varieties of an organism slightly better adapted to the environment and hence more likely to produce descendants. Combined with the later discoveries of the cellular and molecular basis of genetics, Darwin's theory of evolution has, with some modification, become the dominant unifying concept of modern biology. So you see, rapid adaptation has never been an accepted aspect of evolution prior to it being shown to exist first in the Galapagos finches, and now with your example which took place in only 36 years. What remains obvious is that evolutionists will claim any change that occurs in Nature as evidence of their theory, even if it conflicts directly with their stated theory. Now, I know you will produce some pro-evolution link that will attempt to tie the two processes together as evolutionary processes, but I remember debating this very issue before evolutionists even accepted rapid adaptation as having actually occurred. Once they could no longer deny the reality of it occurring throughout the animal kingdom, they now attempt to explain it away as one type of evolutionary process. The only consistent fact that exists regarding evolution is its inconsistency and it's ability to rationalize any process which conflicts with what the theory of gradual evolution has always represented itself to be. So what you have in fact done is produced evidence which proves animal adaptation, but disproves classical evolution.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","01:36 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","124"

I even bolded and underlined them for you. Here, let me break it down even further for you so you don't get confused. This helped Darwin toward a theory of gradual evolution over a ""long period"" The point of posting the definition of evolution was to show that according to the premise upon which it is based, it is gradual and you people have posted a massive amount of so called evidence in every debate we have ever had on this subject justifying how many hundreds of millions of years it took for all life to evolve. And now you want to also claim that these lizards evolved new organs according to the same principles in only 36 years? No! You can't have it both ways. I have always argued that rapid adaptation explains a natural symbiotic relationship between animals and the Earth in order to preserve life in an ever changing world. And since it completely conflicts with Darwins gradual evolution over a long period of time, you can't now claim it fits with the evolutionary theory.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","04:19 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","126"

How much clearer can it be? Darwin's Classical theory of evolution. Darwin-that's your first hint that it's 150 years old. Classical should be the second. Classic Archie. If your point is countered, just keep posting it... Yes. Actually, we can. You've always argued for creationism. Now you're claiming that your intent all along was in arguing for some form of Gaianism? Your whole problem is you have no clue what you're talking about. You have no understanding of gravity, chemistry (hell, any basic science), or basic math, yet you declare that your understanding is the correct one.

There. Now that we cleared that up, on to the following point. If selective pressure is high enough, rapid change will occur. In this case, the pressure was very high, and thus, the change very rapid, perfectly logical, perfectly in line with current evolutionary theory. Yes, it was different in the past, but so was the shape of the earth, that too got changed when better data became available, and you're not suggesting that that statement is wrong because it got changed, now are you?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:56 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","130"

It's the possible origins of a modern-day Peppered Moth, if nothing else. With regards to 'physical changes' - it's extremely unlikely that you will see many for a very long while. What you would be more likely to see is an old limb being used for a new function, and adapting accordingly. For example - I would predict that the legs of an amphibian (when forced to live in an entirely aquatic environment and put under evolutionary pressure) would change over time into flipper/fin analogies. For example - the 'Two-toed tribe' find their mutation to be helpful when climbing trees. If their lives depended on their tree-climbing ability, then the two-toed foot would dominate even more and a variation on the common 'foot' appendage would appear. Asking for an entirely new and functional appendage is tantamount to asking for the sudden appearance of an irreducibly complex limb - it just ain't going to happen. Be prepared to see old limbs used in new ways, however. EDIT: Another example sprung to mind - the Human appendix , which has (possibly) changed function from breaking up cellulose to aiding the immune system.","supersport","335309","I'm not sure how it is that going from 5 toes down to two is adding a new structure....and no, I'm not just asking for new structures, I'm asking for new parts to existing structures created by mutation.
