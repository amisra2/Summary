Define evolution before you start arguing about what constitutes as evidence for or against it.","Archangel","334339","I think his point is paulie, that if evolution is actually as evo defines it, as changes made by way of random mutations, then why doesn't life reflect those random mutations? For example, why haven't a large number of lower animals who live their lives being hunted by carnivores adapted eyes in the back of their heads as a needed early warning system to see their stalkers coming from behind them? Especially in times of drought and famine when food is scarce? The environmental pressure exists at those times to justify such a change, yet from fish to birds to reptiles to mammals to even insects, most every creature in creation has 2 eyes, 1 mouth, 2 ears, (if they even have ears since some animals use vibration sensors to locate the movement of prey and predator.) It makes sense that Eagles, Hawks and Falcons have only 2 eyes since they are apex predators which rule their skies. But they regularly swoop down on smaller birds and pluck them out of the sky for food for their young. So why haven't smaller birds found the need to evolve eyes in the back of their heads? One reptile has a type of third eye, but it isn't for sight nor is it permanent. It is used to absorb vitamin D from the Sun for the first 6 months of life in order to help it grow into a healthy adult. Then it is covered by scales. Tuatara Fact Sheet But the question persists as to why it seemingly devolved the need for that third eye if it originally had 3 working eyes? I mean, it didn't simultaneously evolve a poison gland or some other form of defense to replace the need for it. Now let's look at some insects which you will invariably mention as flaws in my argument. They too have extra eyes called ocelli, not working eyes mind you; and neither do they aid in sight but the ocelli are simple structures and are believed they only detect light levels and movement. Now why would evolution not give vulnerable flying insects perfect vision when they have allegedly had literally hundreds of millions of years and many reasons to evolve it? Are you aware that the visual acuity of insects is approximately 1% of that of humans? And we all know that humans don't have the best eye sight in the animal kingdom. MICROSCOPY-UK / MICSCAPE - Insect insights. Insect eyes. Honeybee legs. What really distinguishes evolutionists from creationists is that creationists will ask the questions fear to ask since this fraudulent gospel has so many inconsistencies which can't be reasonably or rationally answered, they refuse to even consider them. Keep in mind that I have pointed out scientifically documented realities about what exists within the animal kingdom, but what I will get back from you are what ifs and maybes regarding these inconsistencies. Why is it that you never look at what is evolutionary dogma and ask why if random mutation happens based on environmental, social and predatory pressures, hasn't it made more diverse selections where needed, as in a working third eye in the back of animals heads, rather than in all cases follow a proscribed formula which exists today, just as it existed in the oldest fossils ever collected?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:42 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","10"

Because they evolved from fish, land animals inherited the sense of smell. The same holds true with parts like legs and eyes. The first land animals had four legs, so shouldn't it make sense for most of their descendants to have four legs as well provided they're an effective trait? Only in very specific cases where environmental pressures require radically different conditions for life are those four legs done away with (snakes, whales, dolphins). Your use of the word ""formula"" is a creative and clever bit of rhetoric, but it's misleading and not relevant. Common decent predicts exactly what you describe. Tetrapods all come from the same common ancestor, so they all have similar traits. Of course, the farther down the evolutionary tree you go, the fewer resemblances you find.

The diagram immediately above that photo on the website shows the location of the other four eyes, to the side and rear of the head: I have to ask: why did you present the supposed lack of animals with eyes in the backs of their heads as evidence against evolution, if the existence of animals with eyes in the backs of their heads isn't allowed to count as evidence for evolution? Well, assuming for the sake of argument that they even were spiders at the time they evolved their arrangement of eyes, the answer would be ""Slightly less well"" Seriously. Animals of the same species are competing against each other as well as the rest of the environment. Spiders hose out far, far more offspring than could possibly ever survive, so even a slight statistical advantage, over hundreds of generations, can transform the genetic profile of the species. Which makes the next useful mutation more likely to occur to a creature already possessed of the first mutation, so they stack. And so on. It doesn't have to be an all or nothing, survive or perish situation. Those are very rare. You probably drive a car to work, right? It's quite likely that a horse and cart would not meet your commuting needs. If we apply your logic from above, the advantage - even necessity - of cars in your modern way of life means horses and carts could never have existed! The mistake is obvious: we're holding too much constant. Horses and carts were once perfectly adequate - and still are in some societies. What makes you think it was any more hostile than now? What makes you think it hasn't ? It's never possible to discount special creation of all life, only to show that it's a loose and inelegant theory that doesn't make useful predictions. Special Creation is an explanation, Evolution is an explanation. The difference is that when we ask Creation 'what should we expect?' we get little more than a shrug. Creation means anything's possible. Evolution, on the other hand, is tightly bound by its own rules. We should never see a fossil of one of these creatures earlier than those creatures. We should never see this feature in that class of creature, because it evolved after evolution seperated them. If you have two sports anchors, and before the match one of them gives a detailed run-down of the teams' history and form, and expounds at length about what he expects the result of the game to be and how each player should perform, while the other says ""Well, I definitely think one team will win; I expect the ball to be kicked quite a few times and there will certainly be some passing and some running."" - whom do you respect more if all the predictions of both anchors prove to be accurate?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","11:41 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","31"

It can do something its ancestors could not - for the very simple reason that it's not the same as its ancestors. I smell an arcane semantics-based proof brewing... ...and I wasn't disappointed I don't know what 'chance as causality' is supposed to mean, but to speak of evolution being 'based on chance' is highly misleading. If I have an accident on the way to work tomorrow morning, there will be a definite cause; a specific series of events leading up to it. We cannot guess what they might be. Nevertheless, we can still makes statements about the statistical likelihood of such an accident occurring, yes? Does that accurate statement of probability mean that my fate on the road is literally determined by a dice roll, that if my number comes up, I crash, with 'chance as causality'? Of course not. We are merely describing the likelihood of an event in a system of which we have imperfect knowledge. As our knowledge of the system increases, our assessment of that likelihood changes: if you know my age and gender, my driving habits, my route and how busy or quiet it is - all these things permit a more accurate assessment of the odds. If we had perfect knowledge of a deterministic system, the odds would be 1 or 0. Similarly, every mutation that has ever occurred has had a definite proximate cause, and if we knew what they all were and what they would all be in the future, evolution would lie mapped out before us in all its detail. Nevertheless, in the absence of perfect knowledge of these individual causes we can still describe the occurrence of such events statistically, saying how long we might have to wait, or how many trials we might conduct in order to expect a given outcome. So to say that the evolution of the nylon bug, for instance, was based on chance is misleading: the evolution of the nylon bug was based on whatever proximate cause shuffled its DNA. Correctly viewed, evolution is not a series of unlikely events, but a series of highly likely ones. It is highly likely , for instance, that some bacteria in a large colony would experience a mutation enabling the digestion of nylon. Sure - breaking that event down on a per-bacterium basis yields tiny probabilities, but why stop there? Why not break it down on a per-bacterium, per-microsecond basis? The chances just got even smaller! See? It's a silly way to think about it, because in the end it's the chance of the event occurring that matters, not some arbitrary deadline by which it must occur or cell to which it must occur.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","34"

That is the whole argument... without anything to start you cannot have cause be the agency for events to follow. Invalid argument to assert that mutations can map a road outside of their assigned task in illogical, where would the information to do so come from? (Evolution is a series of highly likely events)Evolution simply put, is the creation story for secular humanists and nothing more, which in and among itself if fine - I don't personally care if believe we evolved from Mountain Dew, but don't try to pass that off as fact when there is substantial evidence that says otherwise.","Peeling","334583","I keep seeing that stated and restated, and yet nobody ever seems to be able to say what the difference supposedly is. As I pointed out to someone earlier, one could readily morph a chimp genome all the way into a human genome without ever making any single change that could not be dismissed, were it to be observed in nature, as a mere 'lateral' mutation. Nor do I think you perceive the import of what you've just conceded: a nylon bug may not be a nylon horse, but nor is it constrained to be what it was, forever. The universe evidently has no blanket prohibition against novelty - and that means you cannot argue against evolution from the standpoint of inviolable principle, but only upon the substantially weaker grounds of impracticality. I'm sure you reproduce these quotes in good faith, but you ought to know they are not necessarily what they seem. The Darwin quote is a particularly craven quote mine: he was expressing empathy with those of his readers who found it difficult to imagine how such a thing as an eye could evolve by stages; effectively putting himself in their place so that he might more readily take them by the hand and show them how such evolution may occur, with ample supporting evidence from the natural world. I refer you to the Quote Mine Project for further edification. But there are ample known causes for such novelty as is required by evolution. Mutation induced by chemical or energetic interference, recombination through sexual reproduction - surely you are not suggesting that these processes do not occur ? Since we have observed it happening in the case of the nylon bug, it cannot be the obstacle you presume It's easy to get lost in abstract concerns about 'information'. For instance, imagine a lock with a three-digit code, like those on briefcases. It's easy to get in if you know the code, but it's also perfectly possible to get in without knowing the code - it just takes longer. If you're right about the way information works, that oughtn't to be possible. The crucial point is that the lock contains all the information required to open it. That information is transferred to the person trying to open it via feedback: when you get the right code, the case opens. If there was no feedback - if the person was not actually opening the case themselves but was just blindly shouting numbers for someone else to try with no idea if it was working or not - they would be none the wiser. Similarly, the nylon waste products metabolised by the nylon bug intrinsically possess all the necessary information concerning how they can be broken down. That information is transferred to the bacteria via the feedback of natural selection: the bugs who hit upon the right combination survive, and those who do not, perish. In this manner information about how to survive in the present environment is transferred from the environment and encoded in the genome. No information is being created, it is merely being moved around. On the contrary, there is no evidence to suggest that we have not evolved via common descent.

That's simply inevitable, since simple mathematics indicates that such a molecule would only arise once in a great while- and in the interrim, the offspring of that one molecule would devour or absorb all others, like a hatchling that ate all the other eggs in the nest. Now the question arises: did a greater intelligence PLAN it that way? Well if so, then it would have to be SO intelligent, that we couldn't prove it one way or another, at our current level of development. It would have had to have started at the Big Bang, using some short of mechanism to program a complex chain of events using precise physical principles; however given what we DO know, it would have have most likely depended upon various ""uncertainty principles"" to permit a general result rather than a precise one, simply setting the process in motion and calculating that life would arise somewhere by the laws of probability (which it also created and determined). For example, Earth's evolution of humans is more or less a freak-occurrence, since the moon mainly keeps earth's rotation on its axist-- rather than the North Pole ending up on the current equator every few million years (though we DO have ""global warming"" of a few degrees about every 1000 years). Therefore without the moon, life could never have evolved on Earth. But the moon wasn't always there, but is believed to come from the further reaches of space, and have slammed into the Earth and RIGHT THROUGH it (see the ""Big Whack"" theory, as whacky as it sounds). Otherwise, Earth's gravity wouldn't be strong enough to keep it in orbit. Likewise, factor in the Yucatan meteorite which killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, which was irrefutably essential to human evolution, and the probability of organized planning, rapidly approaches zero-- again, short of an intelligence so advanced, that proof becomes impossible via current means. In fact, the very term ""intelligence"" fails in terms of being an epistemological construct, rather than ontological (which likewise fails in terms of being epistemological in itself). So the notion of ""intelligent design"" yields only the requirement of proving a negative, with no mutually exclusive positives-- i.e. it's a null argument.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","01:33 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","59"

He is an #####. Yes, he has a PH.D. but his education was financed by Sun Yen Moon so he can 'disprove evolution'. He had a bias from the begining, and he lies. Actually, I did. You just didn't bother to read. Gosh, I wonder why you can't answer my answer. N.C.S.E. answer: Because evolutionary theory works with any model of the origin of life on Earth, how life originated is not a question about evolution. Textbooks discuss the 1953 studies because they were the first successful attempt to show how organic molecules might have been produced on the early earth. When modern scientists changed the experimental conditions to reflect better knowledge of the earths early atmosphere, they were able to produce most of the same building blocks. Origin-of-life remains a vigorous area of research. A. Fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals all are post-Cambrian. We would recognize very few of the Cambrian organisms as modern; theyre in fact at the roots of the tree of life, showing the earliest appearances of some key features of groups of animals - but not all features and not all groups. Researchers are linking these Cambrian groups using not only fossils but also data from developmental biology. A: The same anatomical structure (such as a leg or an antenna) in two species may be similar because it was inherited from a common ancestor (homology) or because of similar adaptive pressure (convergence) . Homology of structures across species is not assumed, but tested by the repeated comparison of numerous features that do or do not sort into successive clusters. Homology is used to test hypotheses of degrees of relatedness. Homology is not evidence for common ancestry: common ancestry is inferred based on many sources of information, and reinforced by the patterns of similarity and dissimilarity of anatomical structures. A: Twentieth-century and current embryological research confirms that early stages (if not the earliest) of vertebrate embryos are more similar than later ones; the more recently species shared a common ancestor, the more similar their embryological development. Thus cows and rabbits - mammals - are more similar in their embryological development than either is to alligators. Cows and antelopes are more similar in their embryology than either is to rabbits, and so on. The union of evolution and developmental biology evo-devo is one of the most rapidly growing biological fields. Faked drawings are not relied upon: there has been plenty of research in developmental biology since Haeckel (long-discredited drawings that were used in textbooks 20 years ago) and in fact, hardly any textbooks feature Haeckels drawings, as claimed. after it? A: The notion of a missing link is an out-of-date misconception about how evolution works. Archaeopteryx (and other feathered fossils) shows how a branch of reptiles gradually acquired both the unique anatomy and flying adaptations found in all modern birds. It is a transitional fossil. These fossils are not direct ancestors of modern birds but relatives, and, as everyone knows, your uncle can be younger than you! A: These pictures are illustrations used to demonstrate a point - the advantage of protective coloration to reduce the danger of predation. The pictures are not the scientific evidence used to prove the point in the first place. Compare this illustration to the well-known re-enactments of the Battle of Gettysburg. Does the fact that these re-enactments are staged prove that the battle never happened? The peppered moth photos are the same sort of illustration, not scientific evidence for natural selection. A: Textbooks present the finch data to illustrate natural selection: that populations change their physical features in response to changes in the environment. The finch studies exquisitely documented how the physical features of an organism can affect its success in reproduction and survival, and that such changes can take place more quickly than was realized. That new species did not arise within the duration of the study hardly challenges evolution! A: In the very few textbooks that discuss four-winged fruit flies, they are used as an illustration of how genes can reprogram parts of the body to produce novel structures, thus indeed providing raw material for evolution. This type of mutation produces new structures that become available for further experimentation and potential new uses. Even if not every mutation leads to a new evolutionary pathway, the flies are a vivid example of one way mutation can provide variation for natural selection to work on. A: Drawings of humans and our ancestors illustrate the general outline of human ancestry, about which there is considerable agreement, even if new discoveries continually add to the complexity of the account. The notion that such drawings are used to justify materialistic claims is not borne out by an examination of textbook treatments of human evolution. A: In the last century, some of what Darwin originally proposed has been augmented by more modern scientific understanding of inheritance (genetics), development, and other processes that affect evolution. What remains unchanged is that similarities and differences among living things on Earth over time and space display a pattern that is best explained by evolutionary theory.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","10:55 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","61"

We have a guy arguing against evolution on the basis that organisms don't form new parts, new limbs and new abilities over time. Why are we even arguing here? Evolution doesn't imply animals spontaneously growing new appendages randomly. In fact, the concept of common decent is core in the theory of evolution. Predators and prey have 2 eyes each, big deal. They don't have to have 4 eyes to demonstrate that they evolved. The fact that they have only 2 eyes and can still see behind them shows that they have developed the necessary mechanisms to evade predators and stay alive in the most efficient way. The problem with this discussion is that the point isn't whether prey have 4 eyes or not.

If their lives depended on their tree-climbing ability, then the two-toed foot would dominate even more and a variation on the common 'foot' appendage would appear. Asking for an entirely new and functional appendage is tantamount to asking for the sudden appearance of an irreducibly complex limb - it just ain't going to happen.

Here's just one example of the content which it argues: Let's Look at the Evidence: The following are 18 Evidences of either massive flooding and erosion, extremely rapid layering of strata, or direct evidence of a Worldwide Flood. Such evidences are found in numerous places on virtually every Continent. Polystrate Fossils: One of the strongest pieces of evidence for a worldwide flood is the existence of what Rupke termed ""polystrate fossils."" Such fossils are found all over the world. They usually consist of fossil trees that were buried upright, and which often traverse multiple layers of strata such as sandstone, limestone, shale, and even coal beds. 1,2,3,4 They range in size from small rootlets to trees over 80 feet long. 3 Sometimes they are oblique in relation to the surrounding strata, but more often they are perpendicular to it. For example, at Joggins, Nova Scotia, polystrate tree (and root) fossils are found at various intervals throughout roughly 2,500 feet of strata. Many of these are from 10-20 feet long, 5,6 and, at least one was 40 feet long. 5,6,7 Very few of these upright fossil trees have attached roots, and only about 1 in 50 8 have both roots and rootlets attached. Such trees, and their -- more often than not -- missing roots, are discussed in much more detail in The ""Fossil Forests"" of Nova Scotia. 9 Likewise, many (if not most) of the large, fragmented, and broken-off Stigmaria roots are also missing their rootlets. 9 Many of these roots and rootlets, are also buried individually. 9 This strongly suggests that these trees did not grow in the same places where they were buried, but rather were uprooted and re-deposited there. Similar circumstances occur at various other places in Nova Scotia, as well as in the United States, England, Germany, and France. Another place where large tree stumps are preserved without their roots attached is Axel Heiberg 10,11 Island in Northern Canada. And although there is much data on buried trees in the geological literature, most of it is over 100 years old, and difficult to access. One of the few articles on this subject was by Rupke, and in it he comments that: Personally, I am of the opinion that the polystrate fossils constitute a crucial phenomenon both to the actuality and the mechanism of cataclysmic deposition. Curiously a paper on polystrate fossils appears to be a 'black swan in geological literature. Antecedent to this synopsis a systematic discussion of the relevant phenomena was never published. However, geologists must have been informed about these fossils. In view of this it seems unintelligible that uniformitarianism has kept its dominant position."" 12 With regard to Rupke's observation, I suspect the reason why such is (still) the case has more to do with one's personal bias against the concept of a Creator / God to whom we might very well have to give account than to the ever-mounting evidence against the theory of evolution and the millions of years old Earth that it requires (to appear plausible). However, T-I-M-E is simply not enough: not even BILLIONS of years of it.

Another place where large tree stumps are preserved without their roots attached is Axel Heiberg 10,11 Island in Northern Canada. There are 17 other scientific facts revealed which evolutionists either avoid asking the obvious questions about, or just flat out ignore. Examples like this: A ""Whale"" of a Fossil: Or should we say ""a fossil of a whale? It's true, but what is most interesting about it is how it was buried. In 1976, workers from the Dicalite division of Grefco inc. found the remains of a baleen whale entombed vertically in a diatomaceous earth quarry. ""They've found fossils there before; in fact the machinery operators have learned a good deal about them and carefully annotate any they find with the name of the collector, the date, and the exact place found. Each discovery is turned over to Lawrence G. Barnes at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. The Whale, however, is one of the largest fossils ever collected anywhere... (It) is standing on end.. and is being exposed gradually as the diatomite is mined. Only the head and a small part of the body are visible as yet. ""The modern baleen whale is 80 to 90 feet long and has a head of similar size, indicating that the fossil may be close to 80 feet long. 46,47 So it begs the question child as to how hydrology doesn't support a young Earth or the great flood when it is only by way of a rapid sedimentary build up which buries large trees and even 80 foot long Whales upright can be explained in hydrological terms in so many diverse places which only the great flood accounts for?

John William Dawson (1868) described a classic Carboniferous-age locality at Joggins, Nova Scotia, where there are upright giant lycopod trees up to a few metres tall preserved mainly in river-deposited sandstones. These trees have extensive root systems with rootlets that penetrate into the underlying sediment, which is either a coal seam (i.e. compressed plant material), or an intensely-rooted sandstone or mudstone (i.e. a soil horizon). Dawson considered and rejected anything but an in situ formation for these fossils, and his interpretation is closely similar to current interpretations of sediments deposited on river floodplains. most ""fossil forests"" do not occur in volcanic deposits, and do have the fragile roots of the stumps tightly penetrating into the surrounding sediment, often into a paleosol (fossil soil) [besides Joggins, see also 3]. One occurrence is even associated with dinosaur footprints on the same surface, on top of a coal seam [4, 5, 6]. The ""transported floating upright stumps"" model [2] is a complete red herring that does not apply to the vast majority of ""fossil forest"" occurrences. Had anybody taken the time and trouble to check the facts, they would have found that the story by Russel (1976) took some liberty with the facts and lacked very important information. First, the skeleton was not found in a vertical position, but was lying at an angle 50 to 40 degrees from horizontal . Finally, although at this angle, the whale skeleton lay parallel to the bedding of strata which at one time was the sea floor on which the dead whale fell after its death . These facts were confirmed by inquiring with the people at the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History who excavated the whale.","Peeling","335366","Yep : Just to be clear, the YEC model of flood deposition depends upon the trees not being rooted in place, especially where there are well over a dozen soil horizons layered atop one another, as there are in the Nova Scotia case. Which 'flood-based' scenario do you prefer: that each layer of trees somehow managed to grow to maturity in a few hours, deep underwater, while being buried by more sediment? Or that the flood managed to scoop up and pile the layers atop one another without disturbing them in the slightest? Or you can go with the conventional explanation, which is that occasional flooding swamped each layer of trees with sediment, with time between for a new layer to grow to maturity atop the buried remains of the old. What do you say? The anomalous example in Yellowstone, where the tree fossils aren't rooted, is easily explained: violent vulcanism and landslides deposited the sediment rather than flood deposition (you can tell that because of the composition of the deposited material). However: How is that supposed to have happened in the flood model? A dinosaur's footprint, hardening beside a tree that supposedly grew to full size in a few hours under thousands of feet of sludgy water (and yes, it would have to be thousands upon thousands of feet of water for it to hold enough material to deposit the formation). Oh, and yep: Just to be perfectly clear: the whale was not a polystrate fossil. End of story.

The anomalous example in Yellowstone, where the tree fossils aren't rooted, is easily explained: violent vulcanism and landslides deposited the sediment rather than flood deposition (you can tell that because of the composition of the deposited material). However: How is that supposed to have happened in the flood model? A dinosaur's footprint, hardening beside a tree that supposedly grew to full size in a few hours under thousands of feet of sludgy water (and yes, it would have to be thousands upon thousands of feet of water for it to hold enough material to deposit the formation). Oh, and yep: Just to be perfectly clear: the whale was not a polystrate fossil. End of story. I've tackled your source head on - do you think you could find it within yourself to throw me a bone and say ""Ok, so I was wrong?""","Archangel","335392","Not at all. All you have done is posted more T.O. excuses in order to explain away solid evidence they can't refute with equally scientific facts. They actually think that claiming the whale was at a 40 to 50 degree angle rather than directly upright is evidence that the evidence is irrelevant while ignoring the evidence to the contrary. Your link ignored the fact that trees that were buried upright, without roots, and which often traverse multiple layers of strata such as sandstone, limestone, shale, and even coal beds defy the principle of gradual stratification. And you are ignoring that similar circumstances occur at various other places in Nova Scotia, as well as in the United States, England, Germany, and France. And this is only where we have discovered such evidence. One event might be coincidental or a random occurrence, but to have taken place over such a wide range supports a planetary deluge of monumental proportions. And what about the other 16 points my link refers to? Must I quote each section directly before you'll consider it? The point is that all of the scientific questions it raises and asks leads to an accurate picture of this event occurring. For example, Turbidity Currents: A turbidity current is an underwater mud flow, the discovery of which caused somewhat of a revolution in geology. As a result, many sedimentary strata layers throughout the world have been reevaluated and found to be turbidites. 34,35,36,37,38,39,40 For example, regarding turbidites and the impact they are having on modern Geology, Kurt Howard, 41 said the following in his paper on this topic: My physical geology professor said, ""Regarding uniformitarianism, you can take it with a grain of salt."" After reviewing geology texts on the subject of turbidites, I am following the courageous professor's advice. To paraphrase his words, I am taking uniformitarianism with a grain of sand, for the philosophy of uniformitarianism states that sedimentary layers form over many millions of years, while ... recent research has shown that turbidites form within a few hours. {1} Emphasis Added In 1972 Burgert identified several lower basal Tapeats units as turbidites in Grand Canyon's Cheops Bay. Dr. Ariel Roth a geologist at Loma Linda University's Geoscience Institute, suggested that 30% of all sedimentary rocks in Grand Canyon are turbidites. Some geologists suggest that 50% of the world's sedimentary rocks might be turbidites. Emphasis Added Modern geologists discarded the terms flysch sediments and geosyncline because rapidly formed megathick flysch is incompatible with uniformitarianism and long ages. However, in the last few years, the number of geologists abandoning the classical uniformitarian discipline and adopting the new catastrophism is almost a shock to ... creationists. Geologists are finally beginning to grudgingly agree with ... creationists about the nature of the stratigraphic record, which is a record of major catastrophic events and not the slow year-by-year buildup suggested by uniformitarianism. Flysch deposits might be the sedimentary results of a global flood. The idea of geosynclines is unpopular because most geologists believe in plate tectonics. Emphasis Added Extensive Strata and Pancake Layering: As we observe sedimentary strata throughout the world we see almost everywhere flat-lying (or ""pancake"") layered strata. Many of these layers are so extensive that they cover several states. Evolutionists believe that such layers were deposited slowly over millions and millions of years, or that they are simply ""river"" deposits or river deltas. 42,43 Creationists, and a growing number of geologists see problems with such interpretations. 44,45 First because there is virtually no evidence of erosion between the layers, and second, because the sheer size and extent of the strata suggests that the layers were neither formed by rivers, or river deltas. That's because many of the ""layers"" are quite thick, and cover (literally) hundreds and even thousands of square miles, and in many instances are the size of the state of Utah, or even larger. This, coupled with the presence of marine fossils that are buried in many of the layers, tells us that they were deposited by ocean currents (i.e. from a major, major Flood), like nothing we have ever seen before. We can say for certain that it was the ocean (as opposed to a lake) because of the marine fossils that are buried in much of this strata. For example, in the Grand Canyon area itself, old Earth geologists have said that the Ocean swept over the whole area on six different occasions. Young Earth geologists say it was probably only once. What is shown very clearly from all of these scientific interpretation of the same evidence is that there are two ways to interpret it. But for you evos to claim victory based on your interpretation which is as biased as ours is, is the epitome of arrogance. We may have to agree to disagree peeling, but don't you dare just assume you're right and the debate is over because you have proven nothing absolutely.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","02:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","161"
"12-04-2008","12023",11,"Archangel","335354","Can you refute these scientific evidences for the flood without attacking the author or the source, but based simply on the science? Here's just one example of the content which it argues: Let's Look at the Evidence: The following are 18 Evidences of either massive flooding and erosion, extremely rapid layering of strata, or direct evidence of a Worldwide Flood. Such evidences are found in numerous places on virtually every Continent. Polystrate Fossils: One of the strongest pieces of evidence for a worldwide flood is the existence of what Rupke termed ""polystrate fossils."" Such fossils are found all over the world. They usually consist of fossil trees that were buried upright, and which often traverse multiple layers of strata such as sandstone, limestone, shale, and even coal beds. 1,2,3,4 They range in size from small rootlets to trees over 80 feet long. 3 Sometimes they are oblique in relation to the surrounding strata, but more often they are perpendicular to it. For example, at Joggins, Nova Scotia, polystrate tree (and root) fossils are found at various intervals throughout roughly 2,500 feet of strata. Many of these are from 10-20 feet long, 5,6 and, at least one was 40 feet long. 5,6,7 Very few of these upright fossil trees have attached roots, and only about 1 in 50 8 have both roots and rootlets attached. Such trees, and their -- more often than not -- missing roots, are discussed in much more detail in The ""Fossil Forests"" of Nova Scotia. 9 Likewise, many (if not most) of the large, fragmented, and broken-off Stigmaria roots are also missing their rootlets. 9 Many of these roots and rootlets, are also buried individually. 9 This strongly suggests that these trees did not grow in the same places where they were buried, but rather were uprooted and re-deposited there. Similar circumstances occur at various other places in Nova Scotia, as well as in the United States, England, Germany, and France. Another place where large tree stumps are preserved without their roots attached is Axel Heiberg 10,11 Island in Northern Canada. And although there is much data on buried trees in the geological literature, most of it is over 100 years old, and difficult to access. One of the few articles on this subject was by Rupke, and in it he comments that: Personally, I am of the opinion that the polystrate fossils constitute a crucial phenomenon both to the actuality and the mechanism of cataclysmic deposition. Curiously a paper on polystrate fossils appears to be a 'black swan in geological literature. Antecedent to this synopsis a systematic discussion of the relevant phenomena was never published. However, geologists must have been informed about these fossils. In view of this it seems unintelligible that uniformitarianism has kept its dominant position."" 12 With regard to Rupke's observation, I suspect the reason why such is (still) the case has more to do with one's personal bias against the concept of a Creator / God to whom we might very well have to give account than to the ever-mounting evidence against the theory of evolution and the millions of years old Earth that it requires (to appear plausible). However, T-I-M-E is simply not enough: not even BILLIONS of years of it. See also The Organic Levels of the Yellowstone Petrified Forest 13 and The Yellowstone Petrified ""Forests"" 14 by Harold Coffin. Scientific Evidence for a Worldwide Flood How do you explain""polystrate fossils."" Such fossils are found all over the world. They usually consist of fossil trees that were buried upright, and which often traverse multiple layers of strata such as sandstone, limestone, shale, and even coal beds. 1,2,3,4 They range in size from small rootlets to trees over 80 feet long. 3 Sometimes they are oblique in relation to the surrounding strata, but more often they are perpendicular to it.

Another place where large tree stumps are preserved without their roots attached is Axel Heiberg 10,11 Island in Northern Canada. There are 17 other scientific facts revealed which evolutionists either avoid asking the obvious questions about, or just flat out ignore. Examples like this: A ""Whale"" of a Fossil: Or should we say ""a fossil of a whale? It's true, but what is most interesting about it is how it was buried. In 1976, workers from the Dicalite division of Grefco inc. found the remains of a baleen whale entombed vertically in a diatomaceous earth quarry. ""They've found fossils there before; in fact the machinery operators have learned a good deal about them and carefully annotate any they find with the name of the collector, the date, and the exact place found. Each discovery is turned over to Lawrence G. Barnes at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. The Whale, however, is one of the largest fossils ever collected anywhere... (It) is standing on end.. and is being exposed gradually as the diatomite is mined. Only the head and a small part of the body are visible as yet. ""The modern baleen whale is 80 to 90 feet long and has a head of similar size, indicating that the fossil may be close to 80 feet long. 46,47 So it begs the question child as to how hydrology doesn't support a young Earth or the great flood when it is only by way of a rapid sedimentary build up which buries large trees and even 80 foot long Whales upright can be explained in hydrological terms in so many diverse places which only the great flood accounts for?

They actually think that claiming the whale was at a 40 to 50 degree angle rather than directly upright is evidence that the evidence is irrelevant while ignoring the evidence to the contrary. Your link ignored the fact that trees that were buried upright, without roots, and which often traverse multiple layers of strata such as sandstone, limestone, shale, and even coal beds defy the principle of gradual stratification. Geologists have also found that some of the larger polystrate trees found within Carboniferous coal-bearing strata show evidence of regeneration after being partially buried by sediments. In the case of these polystrate trees, they were clearly alive when partially buried by sediments. Because of their size, the sediment, which accumulated around them, was insufficient to kill the trees. As a result, they developed a new set of roots from their trunks just below the new ground surface and grew higher to compensate for the part of the trunk buried by sediment.[4] Until they either died or were overwhelmed by the accumulating sediments, these polystrate would likely continue to regenerate by adding height and new roots with each increment of sediment, eventually leaving several of meters of former ""trunk"" buried underground as sediments accumulated. And you are ignoring that similar circumstances occur at various other places in Nova Scotia, as well as in the United States, England, Germany, and France. Contrary to the claims of creationists, these sedimentary basins are considerably smaller than the state of Texas. The specific layers, which contain polystrate fossils, occupy only a very, very limited fraction of the total area of any of these basins. And what about the other 16 points my link refers to? Must I quote each section directly before you'll consider it?","Peeling","335450","AA, please, read what was posted. The significant fact is not the angle of the whale, but the fact that it was parallel to the sedimentary layer in which it was buried . By definition it was not a polystrate fossil. Polystrate = many strata . This fossil = single strata. So, how about that 'I was wrong' now? And you're continuing to ignore the fact that geologists know not all stratification is gradual By the way, the claim that these trees 'traverse' coal beds is highly misleading. The ones that 'traverse' coal beds are those with roots, and only 'traverse' the bed because they are rooted in it! Let's be perfectly clear about this: the unrooted examples present no problem at all to conventional geology, while the rooted examples are fatal to the flood model. Particularly examples like this : How is that supposed to happen? If the whole tree was buried in one go under thousands of feet of sediment, how is it supposed to carry on growing? I'm not ignoring it. The vast majority of fossil forests are rooted , and they invariably found in locations known to be susceptible to rapid deposition: floodplains, areas of excessive vulcanism and so forth. And once again, your source is clearly and deliberately misleading you: Do you understand what they're doing? This is equivalent to saying that there is a Wal-Mart covering an area the size of the United States. I'm happy to go through them all, if you like, but I think it better to clear the first couple up before moving on, otherwise we're just going to get lost and confused. I'm not boring you, am I? To recap: The Whale Purely and simply, this was not a polystrate fossil, by definition. It lay parallel to the sedimentary layer in which it was found - a layer which was itself folded and distorted by geological movement, hence the 40-50 degree angle. The trees. Conventional geology satisfactorily explains all the phenomena we've discussed, and has done for a hundred years. Rapid deposition is an established feature of geology and can be traced to proximate causes: periodic flooding, vulcanism, landslips etc. Fatal problems for the flood model: These are observed facts , not interpretations, for which the flood model simply cannot account. 1. Stacked layers which include rooted trees. While it's perhaps conceivable that the flood model could accommodate a rooted tree in the lowest soil layer of a formation, it's not conceivable that a flood could deposit and stack atop one another a dozen or more continuous soil layers, each containing rooted trees, and separated by layers of limestone or other materials. Conventional explanation: Trees grew, were partially and eventually completely covered by layers of rapid and/or gradual sedimentation, and then more trees grew on top. This process repeated over a substantial period of time to produce the observed effect. 2. Fossilised footprints, deep underground, beside rooted tree fossils. What on earth is the story here? How can a dinosaur leave a footprint halfway down a thousand-yard column of precipitating sediment? Conventional explanation: As above. Because the layers were not all depositied in one giant lump, there was ample time for the dinosaur to walk across the surface and leave footprints, which were subsequently covered by later stratification. 3. Trees continuing to grow after being partially buried. What more needs to be said? How can a tree, buried a kilometre or more beneath a billion tons of mud over the space of a few weeks, put out decades of extra growth? Conventional explanation: As above. Large trees survived periodic inundations with sediment and thrust out new roots into the new ground layers, continuing to grow. Further reading: One of the original papers on the subject. As I said, I'm happy to go through the rest of the page with you if you like, but what I'd like to hear first is either a flood-based explanation for the phenomena above, or an honest admission that you can neither conceive of one nor find one on the internet.

Whatever happened to plain old 'agreeing'? We can do it a tiny step at a time, if you like. Do you agree that a fossil lying parallel to the sedimentary layer in which it is found is not a polystrate fossil? See, that wasn't so bad. about : do you agree that a tree cannot continue to grow for several decades after being buried under a kilometre of mud? Do you agree that a flood could not deposit a dozen or more stacked layers of trees, still rooted in the soil in which they grew, seperated by yards of limestone and other minerals? We really don't need to agree to disagree on these points; it's perfectly OK to just agree. If you're worried how I or others might react if you did, please don't.

But that isn't what the evidence states according to my source. It's only your pro-evolution source which states that and I have no reason to believe your version over my own. Of course I agree with that. The problem is that it's your link that states that growth of now fossilized trees continued while they were partially buried in sediment. My question is, how do they prove that, or observe that from fossils? Again Peeling, you are picking and choosing the evidence you will accept. It was shown that both rooted and un-rooted trees were standing vertical through multiple layers of strata when we both know that if it took the millions of years for strata to form through sedimentary deposits, even an upright tree would never be found in more than one layer as it would have long since rotted away through exposure above the sediment line.

"12-05-2008","12023",12,"Archangel","335465","I have no problem agreeing with that as a factual statement. But that isn't what the evidence states according to my source. It's only your pro-evolution source which states that and I have no reason to believe your version over my own. Of course I agree with that. The problem is that it's your link that states that growth of now fossilized trees continued while they were partially buried in sediment. My question is, how do they prove that, or observe that from fossils? In the case of these polystrate trees, they were clearly alive when partially buried by sediments. Because of their size, the sediment, which accumulated around them, was insufficient to kill the trees. As a result, they developed a new set of roots from their trunks just below the new ground surface and grew higher to compensate for the part of the trunk buried by sediment. Again Peeling, you are picking and choosing the evidence you will accept. It was shown that both rooted and un-rooted trees were standing vertical through multiple layers of strata when we both know that if it took the millions of years for strata to form through sedimentary deposits, even an upright tree would never be found in more than one layer as it would have long since rotted away through exposure above the sediment line. You're ignoring these contradictions which directly conflict with the process of stratification, In a few years after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, the erosion of loose pyroclastic deposits covering its slopes created a series of volcanic lahars, which ultimately buried large parts of the countryside along major streams draining these slopes beneath several meters of volcanic sediments. The repeated deposition of sediments by volcanic lahars and sediment filled rivers not only created innumerable polystrate trees, but also polystrate telephone poles, churches, and houses, over a period a few years.[8] The volcanic deposits enclosing these modern polystrate trees are often virtually identical in their sedimentary structures, external and internal layering, texture, buried soils, and other general character to the volcanic deposits containing the Yellowstone buried forests. As in case of modern forests buried by lahars, the individual buried forests of the Yellowstone Petrified Forest and the layers containing them are very limited in their areal extent As it's perfectly ok for you to just agree regarding the innumerable inconsistencies and unprovable assumptions made by evolutionists. I don't know why you always expect me to convert you your way of thinking rather than you seriously considering the inconsistencies your pseudo science promotes.

It's a fact these rooted fossil trees did carry on growing, long after the deposition of the first layer of sedimentation.

Please stop saying geologists think it took millions of years to bury these trees; it isn't true:","Archangel","335519","Yes it does! ""polystrate fossils."" Such fossils are found all over the world. They usually consist of fossil trees that were buried upright, and which often traverse multiple layers of strata such as sandstone, limestone, shale, and even coal beds. 1,2,3,4 They range in size from small rootlets to trees over 80 feet long. 3 Sometimes they are oblique in relation to the surrounding strata, but more often they are perpendicular to it. For example, at Joggins, Nova Scotia, polystrate tree (and root) fossils are found at various intervals throughout roughly 2,500 feet of strata. Many of these are from 10-20 feet long, 5,6 and, at least one was 40 feet long. 5,6,7 Very few of these upright fossil trees have attached roots, and only about 1 in 50 8 have both roots and rootlets attached. Such trees, and their -- more often than not -- missing roots, are discussed in much more detail in The ""Fossil Forests"" of Nova Scotia. 9 Likewise, many (if not most) of the large, fragmented, and broken-off Stigmaria roots are also missing their rootlets. 9 Many of these roots and rootlets, are also buried individually. 9 This strongly suggests that these trees did not grow in the same places where they were buried, but rather were uprooted and re-deposited there. Again, irrelevant issue where a whale found thousands of miles from an Ocean is concerned, and when it is standing upright in diatomite. And here's more: Chapter 19 Appendix Part 2 Living and fossil marine life has been found far inland in continental areas. The book, Anomalies in Geology: Physical, Chemical, Biological, by *W.R. Corliss (1989), lists a number of these on pages 48-52. Here are some sample items: (1) Freshwater seals in Lake Baikal, indicates that that lake was once connected with the ocean. (2) Mummified seals in Antarctica. (3) Whale skeletons in Vermont; Ontario, Canada; Sweden (330 feet [101 m) high, 20 miles [32 km] inland); Norway; Michigan; Alabama. (4) Marine invertebrates living in fresh water in Lake Tanganyika, Lake Baikal, New York lake, Ross Ice Shelf, Lake Titicaca. (5) Salmon in northern U.S. lakes. (s) Sharks and Sawfish in a Nicaraguan lake (110 miles [177 km] from the ocean). (7) Herring and salmon in Lake Baikal. (8) Seahorses in Lake Titicaca. (8) Sponges and dead fish on Ross Ice Shelf. For details, see the book. [The existence of living seahorses in Lake Titicaca is questioned by some experts.] No; it clearly say's the whale is standing vertical in diatomite. It isn't making vague implications and leaving anything to the imagination. You always imply that creationists are motivated to be dishonest as if they earn more money by promoting this belief. When in fact, it's evolutionists who attempt to stifle any opposing evidence by force and intimidation if need be. They will destroy the credibility and professional character of any expert who dares go public with contradictory evidence. Again Peeling, you have it exactly backwards. it say's this: Very few of these upright fossil trees have attached roots, and only about 1 in 50 8 have both roots and rootlets attached. Such trees, and their -- more often than not -- missing roots, are discussed in much more detail in The ""Fossil Forests"" of Nova Scotia. 9 Likewise, many (if not most) of the large, fragmented, and broken-off Stigmaria roots are also missing their rootlets. 9 Many of these roots and rootlets, are also buried individually. 9 This strongly suggests that these trees did not grow in the same places where they were buried, but rather were uprooted and re-deposited there. Sure it does, and it is as complete as yours, but unlike what evolutionists do, my source isn't adding nonexistent details in order to attempt to strengthen their position. And evos do that so they don't have to face the realities of the inconsistencies of evolution. I'm glad you brought this up again since you ignored my question in the last post. Prove to me how it is possible to confirm that these petrified and fossilized trees grew after being partly buried so long ago. I never said geologists said it took millions of years to bury these trees peeling. I said evolutionists claim it takes millions of years for strata to build upon strata and that they are reliable ways of determining which epoch, or geological time period they are in at the time. But my point is that if the flood occurred in reality, then potentially 2 or 3,000 feet of diverse and unique instant stratification layers with instantly buried organic and biological life, was formed in 40 short days as each new strata settled upon the one below it giving the appearance to belief hungry evolutionists that this ring of evidence represents hundreds of millions of years of evolution. And thus, a new secular religion is born. Too bad it's just another false cult though. This explains the randomness of the types of life found in places they normally wouldn't be, and with creatures they wouldn't be caught dead with, if they had a choice that is. I marvel at how evolutionists can be digging up sea creatures, both freshwater and Ocean types, side by side with both large and small mammals, reptiles and amphibians and never beg the question as to how this occurred. To any rational person it would appear to be a mass extinction. But evos interpret it as they all died at their leisure over hundreds of millions of years. And yet, these same alleged scientists know full well that if anyone lays any type of dead body out in the wild, and comes back in only 7 days, it will be consumed, ravaged and its bones will be spread far and wide by the predators which ate what they wanted and then dropped what remained where they were. So it goes without saying that something big happened at once and it indiscriminately buried massive amounts of biological and organic life instantly or else they would have just ended up like any other carcass which dies out in the open and we would have even less fossil evidence than is currently available to fossil hunters.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","09:24 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","179"

Do you agree? I beg your pardon? The fact that the fossil isn't polystrate isn't relevant to the creationist suggestion that it is ? Fact: The whale was lying parallel to the sedimentary layer in which it was found. It was not polystrate. So why would your creationist source bring it up in a discussion of polystrate fossils if not to mislead you into thinking it was polystrate? Oh really? So it makes it explicitly clear that the diatomite layer in which the whale was preserved is also folded at the same 40-50 degree angle, does it? No, it doesn't. It lets you assume that the whale is standing vertically in a bed of horizontal strata - be honest, that's what you pictured, isn't it? So their deception worked.

That could not have happened if the whole tree was buried in one go. Do you agree? Um, yes you did See? If the flood occurred in reality in 40 short days, then how did a dozen layers of trees get a chance to grow to maturity, rooted in a dozen clearly distinct different soil layers, putting out more roots from their trunks into the sedimentary layers deposited atop those soil layers, all the way down that kilometre of sediment?

It's not dishonest to say the fossil is lying parallel to the strata in which it was found - you have in fact done EXACTLY what I said your creationist source expected you to do, which is intuitively visualise strata as horizontal bands and assumed that a fossil at a 50 degree angle would have to cross them. It's not about whether every single tree would have had to be uprooted. It's about the fact that flood apologetics claim all sedimantary rocks were formed by deposition over the course of 40 days. Now, the facts this model has to explain are as follows: we have discovered a location where over a dozen layers of upright, rooted tree stump fossils are stacked on top of each other, separated by further layers of deposition: The dark layers bear the fossilised hallmarks of soil, including insect burrows and so forth, and there are fossil trees in each layer, with roots and rootlets still in place. Yes, there are also unrooted chunks of fossilized wood preserved in the formation, but the significant ones as far as the flood model is concerned are these rooted examples. How can a single 40 day flood produce this formation? Also (not shown on the sketch), there is the fact that many of these stumps have root systems emerging from their trunks into the later-deposited layers, proving that they were able to continue growing for some considerable time after that section of the trunk was buried. Again, how can that happen if after 40 days they were under a kilometre of mud? I repeat: these are facts , not interpretations. It is a fact the whale fossil was not polystrate, and it is a fact that there are layer upon layer of fossilized rooted trees, many with secondary root growth from their trunks, in the Nova Scotia formation. I need make no reference to the conventional geological model to show that the flood model is incompatible with that latter fact.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","10:54 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","199"

It's true, but what is most interesting about it is how it was buried.

(It) is standing on end.. and is being exposed gradually as the diatomite is mined. Only the head and a small part of the body are visible as yet. ""The modern baleen whale is 80 to 90 feet long and has a head of similar size, indicating that the fossil may be close to 80 feet long. 46,47 Do you agree that a fossil lying parallel to the sedimentary layer in which it is found is not a polystrate fossil? I have no problem agreeing with that as a factual statement. But that isn't what the evidence states according to my source. It's only your pro-evolution source which states that and I have no reason to believe your version over my own. it just says the fossil was 'vertical', and lets you assume from that statement that it crossed horizontal strata. Go back and read it again - I'm right, aren't I? No; it clearly say's the whale is standing vertical in diatomite. It isn't making vague implications and leaving anything to the imagination. And only you could dishonestly imply that a body lying at fifty degree angle is resting in parallel position. Assuming it was at 50 degrees, couldn't an 80 to 90 foot object encompass 2, 3 or more quickly laid strata over a 40 day and night period which this flood occurred in?","Peeling","338989","Ok, let's go back and look at exactly what your source has to say about the whale: Would you agree that is the sum total of what your source has to say on the subject? Ok. Now, I would like you to point out where in the above text it says the fossil was polystrate. It doesn't, does it? It just describes it as 'vertical' - which is a bit of a stretch, but 50 degrees is indeed more vertical than horizontal. It says nothing about the angle of the sedimentary layer in which the fossil lies. Perhaps you don't appreciate why that omission is of such vital significance. Here's why: Sedimentary layers are (more or less) horizontal at the time they are deposited. Any distortion, bending or folding etc occurs afterward. The whale fossil is parallel to the layer in which it is buried, which means that at the time it was buried it was lying horizontal, and was subsequently tilted, along with the diatomite, through geological movement. The whale fossil was not polystrate, and your source doesn't claim it was. So why is it, do you suppose, you are so utterly convinced that your source disagrees with me? The answer is very simple: the above text is located almost immediately below a discussion of polystrate trees. The intention is obvious: talk about polystrate trees, then segue on to a 'vertical' whale fossil, highlighting the fact that its angle of burial is what's 'interesting' about it, and your readers won't notice the fact that you've stopped explicitly claiming the fossil was polystrate. Instead, they'll do exactly what you did, AA: you imagined that sedimentary layers are always horizontal and that a 'vertical' whale fossil would have to cross them. Here you are, in subsequent posts, arguing for something your own source never claimed: Except it clearly is, because you go on to argue: See? You're passionately defending something your source never once claimed to be true. And you're doing it because your source behaved dishonestly, mentioning a 'vertical' whale fossil right below a discussion of polystrate trees without mentioning that the whale fossil wasn't polystrate. This is why I say many creationist sources are dishonest, AA: because I can clearly see the effects of that dishonesty upon their readers. You are now utterly - and seemingly irrevocably - committed to believing that whale fossil crossed several strata, something even your source clearly knows is factually untrue. It makes me incredibly angry and sad to see you treated like this in the name of 'righteousness'.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","06:50 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","215"

Here's the link I posted: Scientific Evidence for a Worldwide Flood And the paragraphs immediately above and below the quote you posted. Extensive Strata and Pancake Layering: As we observe sedimentary strata throughout the world we see almost everywhere flat-lying (or ""pancake"") layered strata. Many of these layers are so extensive that they cover several states. Evolutionists believe that such layers were deposited slowly over millions and millions of years, or that they are simply ""river"" deposits or river deltas. 42,43 Creationists, and a growing number of geologists see problems with such interpretations. 44,45 First because there is virtually no evidence of erosion between the layers, and second, because the sheer size and extent of the strata suggests that the layers were neither formed by rivers, or river deltas. That's because many of the ""layers"" are quite thick, and cover (literally) hundreds and even thousands of square miles, and in many instances are the size of the state of Utah, or even larger. This, coupled with the presence of marine fossils that are buried in many of the layers, tells us that they were deposited by ocean currents (i.e. from a major, major Flood), like nothing we have ever seen before. We can say for certain that it was the ocean (as opposed to a lake) because of the marine fossils that are buried in much of this strata. For example, in the Grand Canyon area itself, old Earth geologists have said that the Ocean swept over the whole area on six different occasions. Young Earth geologists say it was probably only once. A ""Whale"" of a Fossil: Or should we say ""a fossil of a whale? It's true, but what is most interesting about it is how it was buried. In 1976, workers from the Dicalite division of Grefco inc. found the remains of a baleen whale entombed vertically in a diatomaceous earth quarry.

""The modern baleen whale is 80 to 90 feet long and has a head of similar size, indicating that the fossil may be close to 80 feet long. 46,47 More Fossil Whales: ""In bogs covering glacial deposits in Michigan, skeletons of two whales were discovered ... How did they come to Michigan in the post-glacial epoch? Glaciers do not carry whales, and the ice sheet would not have brought them to the middle of a continent... Was there a sea in Michigan after the glacial epoch, only a few thousand years ago?"" 48 ""Bones of Whale have been found 440 feet above sea level, north of Lake Ontario; a skeleton of another whale was discovered in Vermont, more than 500 feet above sea level; and still another in the Montreal-Quebec area, about 600 feet above sea level..."" 48 Marine Fossils In The Mountains: In Mountains all over the world one can find sea shells and other marine fossils. These include the Sierras, the Swiss Alps, the Himalayas and many more. 49,50,51,52,53 For more on this subject see the following video 54 by Dr. Walter Brown. Frozen Mammoths: Frozen mammoths and Mammoth bones are found in large numbers in Siberia, Alaska, and Northern Europe. Some of these were in such good preservation that Eskimos would feed their dogs meat from them when they became exposed due to melting ice and snow: that is, if wolves didn't get their first. For those who want to know more see: Frozen Mammoths. Also, keep in mind that above this quoted section, polystrate strata are directly discussed. And here is a diagram regarding the same vertical whale evidence from a source that is familiar with the actual facts of this issue: here And it is nothing like your home made diagram. I agree that with any single issue raised in my link you can argue opposing views. But when all of these examples are taken together, and considering that all of these discoveries listed in that link were independently discovered by secular/non christian methods and processes. It seems ludicrous to me that we ignore what the evidence shows and disregard it out of hand since it doesn't fit with your preferred world view. It doesn't in the posted text, but it say's it above it here: Polystrate Fossils: One of the strongest pieces of evidence for a worldwide flood is the existence of what Rupke termed ""polystrate fossils."" Such fossils are found all over the world. They usually consist of fossil trees that were buried upright, and which often traverse multiple layers of strata such as sandstone, limestone, shale, and even coal beds. 1,2,3,4 They range in size from small rootlets to trees over 80 feet long. 3 Sometimes they are oblique in relation to the surrounding strata, but more often they are perpendicular to it. For example, at Joggins, Nova Scotia, polystrate tree (and root) fossils are found at various intervals throughout roughly 2,500 feet of strata. Many of these are from 10-20 feet long, 5,6 and, at least one was 40 feet long. 5,6,7 Very few of these upright fossil trees have attached roots, and only about 1 in 50 8 have both roots and rootlets attached. Such trees, and their -- more often than not -- missing roots, are discussed in much more detail in The ""Fossil Forests"" of Nova Scotia. 9 Likewise, many (if not most) of the large, fragmented, and broken-off Stigmaria roots are also missing their rootlets. 9 Many of these roots and rootlets, are also buried individually. 9 This strongly suggests that these trees did not grow in the same places where they were buried, but rather were uprooted and re-deposited there. Similar circumstances occur at various other places in Nova Scotia, as well as in the United States, England, Germany, and France. Another place where large tree stumps are preserved without their roots attached is Axel Heiberg 10,11 Island in Northern Canada. And although there is much data on buried trees in the geological literature, most of it is over 100 years old, and difficult to access. One of the few articles on this subject was by Rupke, and in it he comments that: Personally, I am of the opinion that the polystrate fossils constitute a crucial phenomenon both to the actuality and the mechanism of cataclysmic deposition. Curiously a paper on polystrate fossils appears to be a 'black swan in geological literature. Antecedent to this synopsis a systematic discussion of the relevant phenomena was never published. However, geologists must have been informed about these fossils. In view of this it seems unintelligible that uniformitarianism has kept its dominant position."" 12 With regard to Rupke's observation, I suspect the reason why such is (still) the case has more to do with one's personal bias against the concept of a Creator / God to whom we might very well have to give account than to the ever-mounting evidence against the theory of evolution and the millions of years old Earth that it requires (to appear plausible). However, T-I-M-E is simply not enough: not even BILLIONS of years of it. See also The Organic Levels of the Yellowstone Petrified Forest 13 and The Yellowstone Petrified ""Forests"" 14 by Harold Coffin. The Fossils Themselves: Fossils don't form on lake bottoms today, nor are they found forming on the bottom of the sea. 15 Instead, they normally only form when a plant or animal is buried soon after it dies. 16 Therefore, the fossils themselves are evidence of a catastrophe such as a flood or volcanic eruption that took place in the past. See also Rapid Petrification of Wood, by Andrew Snelling. Clastic Dikes: According to Austin, a clastic dike is ""a cross cutting body of sedimentary material which has been intruded into a foreign rock mass."" 17 ""These dikes...(may) penetrate horizontal sedimentary strata (or) they may occur... in igneous and metamorphic rocks. The process of formation of a clastic dike is analogous to wet sand oozing up between ones toes, but on a much larger scale."" 17 Clastic dikes present a problem to the ""mythions of years"" mindset of evolution in that massive ""older"" sediments are found intruding up into overlying younger strata. This must have occurred while the ""older"" sediments were still in a plastic state. What took these ""older"" sediments so long to become hard? One would think that a million years would be more than enough time to turn massive sand laden sediments into sandstone, yet we have an example of sediments which are said to be 80 million years older than those above them, and yet they still had not become hard, but were in a wet and plastic state when an earth movement caused them to be forced up into the (supposedly much) ""younger"" sediments. Such things not only present serious problems for the evolutionary method of ""dating"", but also tell us that something is wrong with the millions of years mindset of evolutionary theory itself, and thus cause strongly suspicion that we are not being told the truth by the mass media, nor the ""Scientific"" community of believers in evolution. 17,18,19 Mt. St. Helens: Three separate eruptions produced sedimentary-type layers hundreds of feet thick. One of these was a hurricane velocity deposit that produced thousands of thin laminations up to 25 feet thick 10,11,12 The third eruption was a lava flow, which turned into a hot mud-flow as it crossed the Toutle River. This hot mud flow not only diverted the river, but carved a 17 mile long series of canyons (up to 140 feet deep) in a matter of hours. They call it the Little Grand Canyon of the Toutle River."" 20,21,22 And to this very day, the neither the mass media, nor any popular ""science"" publications have told the public what happened. 23 For more on this see Mt. St. Helens: Evidence in Support of Biblical Catastrophe. Palouse Canyon: In Eastern Washington State there is a canyon that was eroded through solid basalt by Lake Missoula floods in 1-2 days. This canyon is 300 to 500 feet deep. See references below for more information. 24,25,26,27,28 Observations at an Australian Beach: At Greenmount Beach on the Gold Coast of Queensland, an interesting thing occurred: ""clear laminations, or layering, in the sand--formed by the separation of normal silica-sand grains and smaller, denser mineral sand-grains such as rutile which are dark in color.. The layering was present along the whole sand mass exposed."" 29 Emphasis Added ""This was produced as a result of a beach restoration project (which involved) the dredging of sand from (a) sand bar (on) the Tweed River and carrying it by ship several kilometres north to the southern Gold Coast beaches, where it was pumped ashore as a water/sand slurry through a large pipe to the beach."" 29 See also Talking About Geology / Varves. 30 Emphasis Added Spontaneous Sorting of Layers: Laboratory experiments have shown that spontaneous sorting and layering occurs with a sand, mud and clay slurry. When the mixture slows down, the sand, mud and clay will spontaneously precipitate (settle out) and form individual layers. Dr. Guy Berthault has performed a number of experiments which demonstrate this. 31,32,33 Those who wish to see for themselves, may do so by simply ordering one of the following videos : Evolution: Fact or Belief? Or Experiments in Stratification. Turbidity Currents: A turbidity current is an underwater mud flow, the discovery of which caused somewhat of a revolution in geology. As a result, many sedimentary strata layers throughout the world have been reevaluated and found to be turbidites. 34,35,36,37,38,39,40 The relevant point here is that regarding what the complete page say's, you have no right or reason to just ignore these factual discoveries which throw a massive wrench in the assumptions evolutionists make in their interpretation of this info without seriously questioning them and seeking to explain them all away with rational and reasonable answers which consistently and honestly justify the existing conflicts, if it's the objective truth that is being sought.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","09:11 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","216"

I wonder how many news we get from the media, and assume they are correct... and they're not.","Matthew","339231","Well, they may have been only partially incorrect. Things are complicated. I mean, the reason why the issue of teaching creationism makes the news at all is that there are people trying to make it happen, even though they haven't succeeded yet (and aren't likely ever to reverse that trend). And they try loudly , which makes them seem much more widespread than they are. The two biggest cases recently have been in the state of Kansas and in the town of Dover, Pennsylvania. In neither case did creationism actually get taught, and in neither case did evolution get removed from the curriculum. In Kansas, the state school board removed naturalistic methodological constraints from its definition of science, so that supernatural explanations could be taught alongside natural ones. To my knowledge, this never actually happened in a classroom, however. In addition, the offending board members were subsequently voted out and the definition changed back. On the other hand, the new board members themselves were subsequently voted out in turn. I have no idea where things stand right now, but I don't think it looks too good for the creationists. This is mainly because of how things turned out in Dover. There, the local school board tried to force science teachers to read a statement saying that ""evolution is just a theory"" and encouraging students to investigate the supposedly non-religious idea of ""Intelligent Design."" To make a long story short, not only is ID bad science and entirely religious (and perhaps even bad theology as well), several of the board members were caught in flagrant lies pertaining to the case. (It was quite absurd: they'd say ""I never said x,"" and then the lawyers would play video of them saying x.) The judge decided against the IDists, describing the entire matter as ""breathtaking inanity."" So the upshot is, creationism has been defeated again.

The witnesses were school board members William Buckingham and Alan Bonsell whose testimony at trial differed from their previous sworn depositions. There were two issues. One was the source of $850 used to purchase the creationist text book, Of Pandas and People for the school library. In his deposition, Bonsell stated that his father had ""donated"" the books. At trial it was revealed that the money was collected by Buckingham in his church, given to Bonsell, who then gave it to his father to buy the books. In his deposition, Buckingham denied that he had any knowledge of the source of the money used to purchase the books. There was also the issue of whether IDCreationism is scientific. In his deposition, Buckingham had admitted that his support of IDCreationism was religiously motivated. At trial he specifically denied that.

Perhaps most crucially, He hasn't given us any way to determine that reason is systematically wrong about things. So if our reason does systematically lead us into error, despite all our inclinations to use it, then God would be (in Descartes' words) a ""deceiver"" for having given it to us in the first place. But deception, he further argues, is entirely incompatible with God's power and goodness. Hence, God cannot be a deceiver, and we ought to trust our reason. Why creationists are so opposed to ""natural reason"" -- which to a believer is a gift from God -- is really puzzling.

Cuvier collaborated for several years with Alexandre Brongniart, an instructor at the Paris mining school, to produce a monograph on the geology of the region around Paris. They published a preliminary version in 1808 and the final version was published in 1811. In this monograph they identified characteristic fossils of different rock layers that they used to analyze the geological column, the ordered layers of sedimentary rock, of the Paris basin. They concluded that the layers had been laid down over an extended period during which there clearly had been faunal succession and that the area had been submerged under sea water at times and at other times under fresh water. Along with William Smith's work during the same period on a geological map of England, which also used characteristic fossils and the principle of faunal succession to correlate layers of sedimentary rock, the monograph helped establish the scientific discipline of stratigraphy. It was a major development in the history of paleontology and the history of geology.","pandion","340029","I don't know. Perhaps if you could only ask the creationist scientists who devised the methods of relative dating, Georges Cuvier and contemporaries for example. They recognized that the fossils from each stratigraphic layer were different from other layers. They also recognized that some widely spread fossils appeared in the strata in the same order wherever they were found. They hypothesized that the lower fossils were older than those in more shallow deposits. They assigned names to the strata, and after that they used the fossils to identify the various layers wherever they were found. They named the typical fossil layers to represent the relative ages. After than, when they found a fossil they could assign it to the appropriate age. As Wikipedia says: The principle is still good in that certain types of fossils only appear in rocks of a certain age. For example, trilobites only appear in rocks of the early Devonian and older. If you find a trilobite fossil, you know for sure that it did not come from Permian rocks. Other fossils were also found in rocks of a limited age. When several of these fossil types are considered together, they are typically grouped differently in rocks of various ages. These groupings are called suites. Therefore, by identifying a particular suite of fossils I can assign an approximate age to the stratum in which that group of fossils was found. Of course, these same creationists realized that the multiple strata could not represent one great flood. As a result, they realized that what they read in the Bible could not possibly be literally true. They hypothesized a series of creations and destructions - multiple creations and destructions by multiple floods. So modern paleontology has creationists to thank for the method of relative dating that is still used today to give approximate dates for fossils. It is quite reliable. But modern creationists have reverted to the dark ages before the development of scientific thought. Maintaining the fantasy that the mythology of the Bible is real is so important that creationists reject scientific theories developed by early creationist scientists. Instead creationists now point to people like Mr. Kent Hovind and Ken Ham as ""creation scientists.""","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","11:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","268"

CBC News Sergey Steinberg, a biochemistry professor at the University of Montreal, found the answer in the ribosome, a relatively large mechanism within the cell that takes RNA instruction and builds proteins. His discovery, made with student Konstantin Bokov, has been published in the scientific journal Nature. Scientists have long wondered how chemicals spontaneously came together to create proteins before life itself began. Steinberg and Bokov's theory fills in a critical step in how life got started four billion years ago, said Stephen Michnick, the Canada Research Chair in Integrative Genomics at the University of Montreal. A key breakthrough came when Steinberg found that chemicals could spontaneously come together and form something as complex as a ribosome. Previous theories had suggested only simple proteins could form spontaneously. This had been shown in a seminal experiment in the 1950s in which basic chemicals were combined in a flask, heated and zapped with electricity, creating basic proteins as a result. But proving that chemicals can spontaneously form simple proteins did not prove that spontaneous action could create more complex mechanisms. ""In the absence of such explanations, some people could imagine unseen forces at work when such complex structures emerge in nature,"" said Steinberg. Steinberg was able to show otherwise. He found the ribosome was put together using relatively simple structural rules, a bit like a three-dimensional puzzle. For critics who ask why spontaneous formation didn't lead to something other than the ribosome, Steinberg used mathematical models to show there was no other possibility. The ribosome simply wouldn't hold together if it were constructed any other way. ""The assembly followed rules that were logical and for which there were no alternatives,"" said Michnick. ""This forces us to think about bigger structures. This type of thinking is important to understanding all sorts of structure."" For instance, the next step might be to consider why proteins begin to form wrongly spontaneously. Several neurodegenerative diseases occur when proteins start to malform, said Michnick. Steinberg's research could give insight in how that happens, and why. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2009 Bell Canada, Microsoft Corporation and/or their contributors.

"02-27-2009","12023",19,"Matthew","339420","You know, Descartes actually made an argument about this in his Meditations over 350 years ago. According to his argument, God has given us the power of reason. He has given us strong inclinations to trust it, and He has given us good evidence that trusting it works out well for us. Perhaps most crucially, He hasn't given us any way to determine that reason is systematically wrong about things. So if our reason does systematically lead us into error, despite all our inclinations to use it, then God would be (in Descartes' words) a ""deceiver"" for having given it to us in the first place. But deception, he further argues, is entirely incompatible with God's power and goodness. Hence, God cannot be a deceiver, and we ought to trust our reason. Why creationists are so opposed to ""natural reason"" -- which to a believer is a gift from God -- is really puzzling. For despite the implications (as spelled out by Descartes), they really do seem to think that it's fundamentally flawed. Just look at all Archie's comments belittling my reliance upon ""human intellect,"" for example.","Archangel","345228","I have never belittled your reliance upon human intellect at all.

Even here in this post, you quote descartes as your evidence for reason when in his own generation he was considered a person with more atheistic beliefs than christian even though like you, he claimed to be a devout catholic. Here's a short bio of his spiritual life. Religious Beliefs It has been rigorously debated within scholarly circles regarding the religious beliefs of Ren Descartes. He himself claimed to be a devout Roman Catholic, claiming that one of the purposes of the Meditations was to defend the Christian faith. However, in his own era, Descartes was accused of harboring secret deist or atheist beliefs. Contemporary Blaise Pascal said that ""I cannot forgive Descartes; in all his philosophy he did his best to dispense with God. But he could not avoid making Him set the world in motion with a flip of His thumb; after that he had no more use for God."" [13] Ren Descartes - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Notice what Pascal, a contemporary of his thought of him. Also notice that the man you quoted at least gave God credit for creation even though he abandoned the rest of of what it meant to be a christian. What I find curious about you is even though you claim christianity, you can't see the reason it requires for true believers to accept God at His word in the bible which God says is His Holy Word. Can't you see the problem that creates for you and your alleged spiritual condition? Try applying your critical thinking and ability to reason to that contradictory position which you so eloquently represent in every secular humanist post you write.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","277"

Meanwhile, let me point out yours as you claim to be a dedicated believer in Christ yet you deny Him and His word at every turn in every debate you participate in. Tts 1:9 holding fast the faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching, so that he will be able both to exhort in sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict. Tts 1:10 For there are many rebellious men, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, Tts 1:15 To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience are defiled. Tts 1:16 They profess to know God, but by {their} deeds they deny {Him,} being detestable and disobedient and worthless for any good deed. Tts 2:1 But as for you, speak the things which are fitting for sound doctrine. Tts 2:7 in all things show yourself to be an example of good deeds, {with} purity in doctrine, dignified, Tts 2:8 sound {in} speech which is beyond reproach, so that the opponent will be put to shame, having nothing bad to say about us. Tts 2:11 For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, Tts 2:12 instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in the present age, Tts 2:13 looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus, Tts 2:14 who gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless deed, and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds. Tts 2:15 ""These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one disregard you"". So you see Matthew, the bible tells us to defend Gods word and His doctrines against the lies of the enemies of truth.

However, you have to be careful where you draw the implication. Just because a textbook says, ""15 billion years ago, the expansion of the universe began with the big bang, 4.5 billion years ago the Earth formed, and 3.5 billion years ago life arose and began evolving,"" does not mean that all these processes are part of the same theory. This could be a helpful analogy: It's a high school physics class, and the students have to do a problem that involves variables for properties such as momentum, energy, mass, velocity, acceleration, and force all at once. But that wouldn't mean that all the variables represent the same properties. No. This is because genetic mutations do not happen in a linear fashion. There are more than 6 billion human beings on this planet, and not a single one will ever experience the same genetic mutations at conception that another does. Millions of mutations happen in every new individual organism -- it's not a controlled aspect of life. Natural selection, or the environment, is the force that weeds out the not-so-helpful genetic traits from the helpful. If evolution were a linear force, then our muskrat-like ancestor would be able to survive in every environment on Earth. But of course that isn't the case. Some mammals have genetic traits that make them much more suited for hot deserts (camels) where vegetation and water is scarce, while other mammals are suited for tropical rain forests (ex. jaguars), and others for colder temperatures (yak oxen). If life were not diversified, evolution would be in big trouble. One of the specific scientific predictions of evolution is that life will be diversified and suited to the different environments. The fact that life is so diversified is what actually lead Darwin to discover natural selection in the first place. While visiting the Galapagos Islands, Darwin realized on every island, there were different variants of finches, with beaks and size being the primary differences: On some islands, the finches had large, short beaks for cracking large seeds that were only present on that island, while on other islands, the finches were smaller and had longer, narrower beaks for tiny seeds from plans that weren't on the other islands. Diversification is one of the primary pieces of evidence for evolution, not against it. Unfortunately for most of the life that has ever been on this planet, adaptation is not very useful in the grand scheme of things. A rat can adapt to slightly colder temperatures by burrowing into the ground, but he's screwed if the environment dips down -40 on a regular basis. You asked why some mammals evolved into whales, and answer seems clear enough when talking about this issue: Muskrats can't well swim 2,000 feet down into the ocean, can they? Take Darwin's finches again. Unless they have evolved the proper beak, a genetic trait, there would be no way for some of those finches to eat the seeds that other finches eat. They can't adapt to that situation because it's not possible for them to simply grow differently-sized and shaped beaks at will. Even the ability to adapt is itself an evolutionary trait. We humans heavily rely on adaptation, but we wouldn't be able to do so if we hadn't had our large, complex brains. When we experience a situation like the finches on the Galapagos Islands, we design our own tools or perhaps move to a better environment, but birds don't have the intelligence capacity to do that. You have stumbled upon a good point, though, and that's that mammals are fairly well adapted for many environments right out of the womb. Mammals live all over the world in all but the very most extreme environments, and mammal-like animals have been around since before the dinosaurs. Like the shark, the mammal is an unusually successful specimen of life. Part of what make mammals so successful are their features: they are warmblooded, so they can generate their own heat and survive in colder temperatures as long as there is food available; hair has become useful in all sorts of ways for controlling the body temperature further; the females protect and produce milk for their young, ensuring a better survival rate for their kin than other animals; and many mammals have much larger, quicker, and more complex brains than their reptilian and water-breathing counterparts.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","01:45 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","309"

"05-25-2009","12023",21,"None","None","None","southern_reckon","354977","Before I delve into species, you need a quick and dirty background of evolution: The following is summarized from the Evolution 101 podcast by Dr. Zachary Moore, PhD and can be found on the learnoutloud dot com. I. The fact of evolution basically means change of allele frequency of a population over time. 1. A loose definition of allele is essential a gene or set of genes responsible for characteristics of an organism. (Example: An allele for blue eyes or the redness of a flower) 2. In essence the fact of evolution says that the genes of a population of plants or animals change over time. If the changes help the plant or animal to survive, then the number of animals with the change will increase. 3. Example from Scientific American April 2009: Southern California is seeing a rise in snakebites that is extremely toxic. Why? The normal rattlesnakes in Southern California are the red and speckled rattlesnake. People are killing them off because these two snakes are noisy with their rattles and hiss. As a result the frequency of the Southern Pacific rattlesnake is increasing. The Southern Pacific has an allele that tells it not to hiss and not to rattle so much when they are threatened. It lays low, but the chances of a human encounter is high and the snake bites. The bite of the Southern Pacific is wicked and has three types of toxins. Due to environmental pressures (created by people), there is an increase in the genes or alleles to have snakes that are quieter. It just happens that the quieter snake is more venomous than the ones the humans are killing off. II. What is NOT evolution? Some people like to say there are different kinds of evolution. This is not true. 1. You may hear terms such as: a. Cosmic, Chemical, or Planetary evolution. (Big bang, chemical creation, planet creation) b. Organic evolution: life evolving from non-life or abiogenesis. c. Macro evolution: Changes between kinds of plants and animals d. Micro evolution: Changes within kinds of plants and animals 2. Cosmic, Chemical, Planetary, and organic evolution has absolutely nothing to do with evolution and serves to bring confusion to the field. 3. Some people (especially creationists) like to differentiate macro- and micro- evolution claiming they have different mechanisms. The term kinds is a biblical term, not a scientific term. The only difference between the two concepts is scale. The same mechanisms apply to both macro- and micro- evolution. 4. Some people give poor analogies of evolution or setting up of straw men to easily knock down. There are many variations, but the original one is the watch and the watchmaker. Clearly, a watch cannot come into existence by random chance. It must have a watchmaker and a designer. By analogy, life must have a maker and designer. This analogy misses the point entirely. 5. Some ask, what is the goal of evolution. Evolution has NO GOAL. Humans are no more highly evolved than bacteria. Both sets of organisms are adapted to their environment and surviving quite well. My next post will delve more into your question of species.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","311"

Hooved mammals, cats, and dogs are each fairly good examples of clear evolutionary chronologies, in both the fossil record and DNA. Mammals with hooves are good because we see them in all kinds of environments: The first mammals with hooves, tens of millions of years ago, were about the size of a small domestic cat. The various species diversified, and some became about the size of a wolf, while others went on to evolve into mammals that rivaled large dinosaurs. We have horses, donkeys, ox, cows, yak and such today, and then we have the whales, my personal favorite example of evolution in the fossil record. Small, vegetarian hooved mammals started swimming in shallow water and eating underwater vegetation; eventually their bodies became more adept for swimming with arrival of shorter arms and wider appendages; their skulls and bodies became slimmer; eventually their teeth allowed them to eat meat, and by then they looked a lot like a crocodile; finally, with larger and more effective flippers, heavier bodies, and lack of legs allowed them to take to the oceans. I'm not really sure how the following kinds of beaks could possibly come about in a single lifetime: If you've ever seen a bird change beak size and shape depending on the food given to it, I'd be excited to hear about that, but I won't cross my fingers.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:56 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","312"

OK.... two questions.","trebor","354982","There are multiple threads of evidence.. there is no one piece of evidence that 'proves' that once species share a common ancestor with another. This is known as 'convergence of evidence'. One of the pieces of evidence is the genetic evidence. Another piece that is important also is the fossil evidence. Now, the media tends to overstate what the scientific claims are, so while it might be a good '90,000 feet' overview , often it is not accurate when looked at closely. For example, the 47 million year old Ida is probably NOT a human ancestor, although it could be considered a 'transitional form', since it has certain traits that distinguish it from older forms that is more 'human' like than older fossils. It is a very important fossil, since it fills in a lot of 'blanks' we have in exactly what happened. However, it isn't nearly as dramatic of a change in thought that other fossils were in the past. It is a pretty fossil, and a dramatic specimen.. but it's importance is hyped up. Now, when it comes to new species, we can not only see evidence in genetics, and in the fossil record, but by seeing their ability for reproductions. If you look at the donkey and the horse, part of the reason we can guess they are related species, and had a common ancestor is that they can reproduce with each other, although their offspring is sterile 99.xxx% of the time. If you look at tigers and lions, they can produce offspring, however, the males are sterile, and the females usually aren't. Remember, fossil evidence and morphology (comparing how simularities from skeletons) were the main way for trying to figure out a 'family tree'. It has only been recently through being able to do genetic analysis and figuring out the genome of species that we have further evidence for the commonality of descent for species. Some of the evidence we found when we did that was interesting to say the least. Apparently, the split between the chimp line and the human line was a bit messier than thought, and hominids and the chimp ancestors swamped genes for a few hundred thousand years after they started becoming seperate species.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:21 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","313"

A species is not as intuitive as one may think. But I am not going into the details of each of the methods of differentiating species. You may do your on research on the four (typology, morphometry, sexual isolation, phylogeny) methods. Humans like to put things in categories (e.g. organisms in categories of species), but nature does not care. Lets look at one method of defining a species. Sexual isolation: organisms that can mate with each other and give viable offspring. We shall ignore hybrids such as mules and ligers. They are usually sterile. There is a particular set of organisms called ring species that allow us to get s snapshot of speciation in action today. I find them fascinating. Think of a straight line as a circle where G connects back to A. (I am not very good with ASCII art so this will have to work. There are excellent examples on the net, just search for ring species. On youtube: search for: Evolution in Action: Ring Species) A B C D E F G A One such ring species is Ensatina eschscholtzii. A group of salamanders that live in the mountains which circle the California Simi Valley. The mountain range splits around the valley. As the salamanders moved south, there was a split in lineage from the parent. Some went on the east side of the valley, some went to the west side of the valley. At the southern end of the valley, the daughters of the salamanders meet after about 10 million year split. However, something strange happened. Imagine A and G are the ones meeting in the southern part of California. Just to keep it simple, I will use A-G instead of their scientific names. Here is the cool thing: 1. A can mate with B 2. B can mate with A and C 3. C can mate with B and D 4. D can mate with C and E 5. E can mate with D and F 6. F can mate with E and G 7. G can mate with F, BUT NOT A Each group looks a little different from the one next to it. And A does not look anything like G! At this moment, they are considered the same species. What happens if B-F goes extinct? We now have two separate species! The ring species causes the evolutionary branching effect on the evolutionary tree. This is one example of evolution in action as predicted by Darwin. Imagine this same process happening for nearly 4 billion years over the entire earth. Mind boggling. I noticed in your post that you are looking for an example of a mammal. I do not know of a present day ring species of a mammal. (But then I am just a little, country boy from Mississippi, not a biologist.) We must rely on other evidence. As one understands how evolution works, you see the overwhelming evidence in fossil record, DNA research, and in speciation with common ancestors.

The evolution of complex molecular systems can occur in several ways. Natural selection can bring together parts of a system for one function at one time and then, at a later time, recombine those parts with other systems of components to produce a system that has a different function.

Such design would, at the very least, be quite 'natural' to the Designer. Thus the evolutionist will never accept the possibility of an Intelligent Designer. The evolutionist feels the elusive answer to OOI is right out there waiting to be found and with 'nearly infinite time available' time is on his side.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:46 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","333"

"02-14-2010","12023",25,"Freedom","390459","By using pre-existing functionality you are not defeating that observation you are side stepping it. you cannot say that an irreducible complex system can be reduced by reducing components with different purposes when it is the function of the system that would allow it to be selected for. You are moving the ""chance"" factor from the mutation to the chance that existing elements will form the system, natural selection can still not select for what does not function so you are still talking about extreme improbability WITHOUT gradual selection. For instance if I said cell structure A was irreducibly complex you could say ""well it could have formed in one shot as a massive lucky mutation"" or ""it could have formed from several pre-existing systems that were being selected for"" Exactly, so what happens when there is nothing to modify? evolution can't reach beyond natural selection and selection works only on what is functional. Therefore functionality is a pre-requisite to evolution. The first life form had to have DNA and had to reproduce itself by copying that DNA, if it did not it could not evolve. Think about what you are saying, if it isn't a cell it can't reproduce with mutation, no modification with decent which means no evolution, which means it was the random result of atoms and molecules bonding. That regression does not exist if there is a design, and it seems to be taken for granted that there is design. Note how even the most blind evolutionary scientist speaks of how evolution produced ""this design."" It is the combination of order, complexity, and energy that is specific to life. The number of components is always directly proportional to the chaos except in life. The most orderly crystals have the most homogenous particles (the least different components), the most complex systems appear to be the most disordered (weather), and the most energetic systems are the most chaotic (stars). It appears to be a design by as sound thinking as a car appears to be a design. Consider for a moment that you did not know that someone designed a car, what would lead you to believe that it was designed if anything? Please explain the reason for life being a consequence of the laws of physics? Or is that the same question? Your error is to say that no scientific explanation can equal a scientific theory. The people who formed ideas based on a book called ""the origin of species"" and called it science. They have taken the non-existence of a supernatural or ultra-natural entity as a granted and used that to conclude that the origin of species must have been unintentional. I will apply the scientific method to all knowledge including the hypothesis of ID. They are backed up against the wall if they are claiming they know something that they don't, not before. You can attempt the separate the origin of life from the theory of evolution but I will not accept the claim without some reason. The method of evolution is not yet known, it must be a method capable of forming useful functionality without existing functionality. It is extremely cogent thinking to believe that that mechanism would be the same one that formed life, as it is the same outcome (functionality formed), the same subject material (chemicals).","Larni","390463","I don't see what observation is being side stepped.

The convergence in the results of these independent studies which was neither planned nor sought constitutes in itself a significant argument in favor of the theory.""[16] In the same address, Pope John Paul II rejected any theory of evolution that provides a materialistic explanation for the human soul: ""Theories of evolution which, because of the philosophies which inspire them, regard the spirit either as emerging from the forces of living matter, or as a simple epiphenomenon of that matter, are incompatible with the truth about man."" lThat the origin and/or advancement of life has been explained scientifically Did nothing of what I said about irreducible complexity make it to your mind?

But taking out NS does not happen in nature. The only way you could do that would be in an experiment. What would that show us. Every replicator that has to compete for resources and replicates imperfectly has NS acting on it. Even as you read this the words I write are undergoing NS as you select the sentences that are of more interest to you.

Take it easy, freedom","Freedom","390581","Not when talking about a so called sicentific hypothesis, by definition one must imagine how something can work or else they would not have a rational explaination for it. If you believe my position is that of fallacy try to defeat my falling leaves and bricks theory, can you do it without doing something I am doing to evolution? What? Where did you get that? It is clear that ""it has always been"" is a an answer that would end the regression, it would be valid to say that about life.... if we didn't know it was false. They have observed life without cells have they? Because you said so huh? Then what's all the fuss about, Intelligent design is only a figure of speech. You see they only mean that the design is intelligently conceived, not that anyone actually designed it I committed a fallacy by answering your question on why scientist use certain terms?...... Take physics, I don't mean to be rude but since you are contending that my generalizations are not correct you would have to mean that more energetic systems are not more chaotic and complex crystals are not less ordered than simple crystals. How would you know a serial number is the mark of a designer? Not directly or exclusivly A hypothesis does not become true because you cannot falsify it. Again disprove my falling brick and leaf hypothesis. Been reading too much theoretical physics there. Perhaps my analogy of unified field theory was prophetical. Remember that. I am shocked; Christians seem to take it as a matter of doctrine to be against evolution. Well this won't make it any easier; they have as much faith as you All right you clearly dont understand what I'm talking about. Evolution states that mutations occur, the negative ones are eliminated the positive ones are selected for. Yes selection is not merely a negative force, if it is beneficial mutation the creature will have a higher reproductive ratio and its genes will be spread at a greater ratio. If this last was not the case neutral mutations would drown out beneficial ones like static. The key to evolution is defeating the odds, by accumulating beneficial mutations over time, natural selection being the filter. You have (and forgive me if I misunderstood) attempted to refute IC by claiming that it does not make it impossible for an IC system to form. You are correct, what it does prevent is gradual selection. That is the key of evolution which means it prevents evolution. You have said systems could already exist that would form a IC system, that is possible, what is not possible is that those systems were being selected for the functionality of the IC system. Of course natural selection never stops working, but it never works on what does not exist. If system A is IC you cannot say it was selected for over multiple mutations because IC means it does not work without all components. Similarly if a system is IC you cannot say it was formed out of components that were selected for, because that is merely moving the mutation to the preexistence of other elements. If system A can be made out of systems B and C, and systems B and C are being selected for it does not mean system A is being selected for. Explain how system A can be selected for if it is IC? Thanks, you too. Just realized something after I walked into the next room, of course the Catholic Church isn't against evolution, they don't see it as a block to ID, but atheist see ID and evolution as diametrically opposed.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","393"

I don't think you would. Climbing or jumping legs were not being selected for when fish emerged from the water and no one who truly understands evolution would think so. So give me one example of a system that has evolved without being selected for. Notice I left out the term gradual, it is not necessary when the process of evolution as a whole is already known to be gradual. I guarantee you can't do this.","Freedom","390824","Does evolution explain advancement? Does evolution explain advancement? I know, read my post. No I am not, I pointed out cases which evolution is claimed to explain but on which natural selection is not applicable. It is not a misrepresentation to say that if natural selection is not causing gradual ordered change, then it is random change; making clear my erosion example. Scaffolding is an attempt to defeat IC by pointing out that a way can be imagined for an IC system to form. On what basis does that show evolution can form an IC system? Because it is believed by many or because you need it to be true? I don't mind if you separate evolution from the toxic subject of origin, it does not defeat my position. Forgive me if I don't take your word on it. By changing the DNA that constructs the system. You do not understand irreducible complexity; adapted purpose is exactly what I accept natural selection to be capable of. No I can't. I can give you examples of systems that couldn't have been selected for before they were formed.

If you mean organisms becoming more fit for survival, yes. If you mean a genome becoming more complex, again, yes. Behe's work on IC has been almost entirely proven false. Many of his examples of IC have been shown not even to conform to his definition of IC. In most of his examples, structures in other organisms have been shown to consist of only a portion of the in question IC structure. These simpler structures still serve a function in the other organism. The classic example of the flagella only took Ken Miller a few days to prove false. He showed that in the same organism there is a syringe structure that consists of the flagella minus 40 parts. It still functions. Other organisms contain this same syringe structure but with only 30 or so missing parts. You can see a clear progression from one structure to the supposedly IC structure. There is not a single example of a truly IC structure. As for eukaryotic cells, this is easy to explain. If you had said prokaryotic cells it would have been much more difficult. We have very little information on life before prokaryotic cells but tons of information on the life that existed before eukaryotic cells. That's because many of these examples are still around as bacteria. Most evolutionary biologists believe that eukaryotic cells evolved from a symbiotic relationship between two or more different types of prokarytic bacteria. One type found it was able to live inside the other, maybe parasitic at first. Not very difficult to imagine, right? Of course the parasite had to take care of the host to make its own survival more likely. Eventually, they evolve (independently) to be symbiotic. At this time the original parasite is able to evolve to a much simpler function, say, a single task even. The host provides energy to the parasite in return for it completing its task. This is of course leading to chloroplasts or mitochondria. I add that both carry their own separate DNA today. Why else would these organelles need their own unique copy of DNA? The nucleus is easy to explain too because the cell needed better and better ways to segregate its own DNA from the organelles. There, no dramatic leap, no lack of selection.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","424"

"02-17-2010","12023",29,"Freedom","390851","It's so easy when they defeat their own arguements. Thank you, you may step down. You don't know why IC is a problem then, it is not a stumbling block because there is no way it could be formed it is a stumbling block because NS doesn't effect the formation. I have repeated this same point about 10 times now, I think that's enough so I trust you will just repeat it to yourself if that is the proper rebuttal. Again (and for the last time) because a method can be conceived to form an IC system does not mean that it was probable or that evolution could have formed it. Example: I can think of a method right now to form an IC system, a single massive mutation which forms all necessary components. Behe has apparently not been informed hes been dis-proven, in fact he still seems to be doing that ""science"" thing, or at the very least he is not quoting the bible and yelling like you would have us believe all anti-evolution persons are. Excuse my ignorance I didn't know there was life before prokaryotic cells ""Found"" ""had to"" for a purpose of survival; more of those intelligence implying figures of speech I guess? Glad you brought of mitochondria,and chloroplasts both excellent examples of IC. You did not fulfill the requirements for this one but let's see you start on aerobic metabolism and solar energy usage. I don't mind if you copy paste. How did it start forming internal membranes? They don't just form from need they are assembled by multiple specific proteins. No leaps? what about parasitism? at what point before penetrating the cell membranes and using sugars or ATP is it being selected for? You say the parasite didn't kill the host? then how did it reproduce inside? There is a system that controls cell division that would need to be in place before any successful symbioses. I wonder if left for reproduction? or did the system of simultaneous reproduction appear from the void as well? You kind of swept over at the part where it switched from being a parasite to a symbiont, until that happened selection for the host would be to get rid of the thing, do we ignore that part while we let the invader continue it's evolution? About that, what task could the invader do that the host could not do before? It can't have performed mitochondrial functions outside of a cell, and if it had photo-synthesis why would it have become parasitic when it had such great advantages in energy production? Oh that reminds me, have they suggested a way for the oceans of primordial earth to be filled with abiotic sugars or ATP? If they haven't they have a serious problem with cellular metabolism before photosynthesis. More is coming into my head I don't think you would appreciate it as I am almost certain your comeback is going to be ""just because we don't know everything.""","Databed","390877","What? You think you've proven something here ? Yeah, you keep saying that but have yet to demonstrate an example of this. Problem, Genious. That's never happened! The whole argument is whether IC systems by Behe's definition actually exist. Why are you now creating hypothetical ones? Yeah, another creationist in delusion is all. He's been informed. He lost Dover vs BoE. He's been ridiculed by scientists who actually understand evolution. If you think I am constrained by the classic definition of life, you are wrong and excused. Terminology, actually. They work quite nicely. Argument from ignorance. Some of the first self-replicating molecules to exist were surely photosynthesizes. On some level they constructed higher energy molecules from solar energy. It's not a stretch to put this as a precursor to the function of chloroplasts. The same can be said with mitochondria. The original function of mitochondria was probably not the same as it is seen today. Again, functions change and I fall back on my argument from before that the organelles evolved through a symbiosis. I didn't copy and paste anything. Do I need to spell this out completely? Do you have no speculative abilities at all? Look, we see varying degrees of all of these structures in many different microbes. A common designer would suggest that all would be the same, instead we see increasing complexity in these structures that perfectly matches the time line of when the fossil record suggests they first emerged. (I know you are going to try and get me on the increasing complexity comment) Not quite. You seem to forget again that the mitochondria has surely mutated and the function of ATP production is certainly not its original function so there didn't necessarily need to be sugars to metabolize. Further, why couldn't there already be sugars produced by photosynthesizers? Who said anything about cellular metabolism before photosynthesis? I think you made that up. It would have started as a parasite and reproduced on its own, possible even free to leave the cell if it chose. At some point it would have become unable to leave its host and have been perfectly happy staying inside multiplying as the host multiplied. After being in such a system for so long, organisms become reliant on the system. This can be seen across the spectrum of evolutionary biology, zoology etc. As soon as they are reliant on each other, they begin evolving together as a benefit in one must benefit both or both die. This leads to the fine tuning of things like meiosis.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","07:56 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","435"

Not because Freedom has anything even resembling a good argument, but because he doesn't and doesn't realize it. Freedom, if I am not mistaken, you have claimed that IC presents a problem for evolution because producing an IC system requires selection for a system that doesn't yet exist. Let's take a look at what IC is. You've posted Behe's original definition from his book. Did you know that he later ""updated"" his definition to include reference ""core"" components? Did you know that Dembski later took it upon himself to re-redefine IC? Did you notice that Dembski's re-redefinition actually gutted the entire concept? The original intent of introducing IC as a hurdle for evolution is essentially what you have claimed: that natural selection could not produce a structure that could not function without each component in place; that removing even one piece destroyed the functionality of that system. This is an entirely conceptual idea: unguided, stepwise evolution cannot produce such a system. The problem is that unguided, stepwise evolution can produce such a system. Once the underlying concept -- that unguided, stepwise evolution cannot produce such a system -- has been refuted, the claim falls apart. It's not even a question of finding such a system (although it has been done plenty). Busting the idea busts the ""problem."" Conceiving of any way that unguided evolution can produce an ""IC"" system disproves the entire point. Scaffolding can do this. Scaffolding HAS does this. Consider the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. This protein has three domains, two of which are homologous; one of these domains is a duplication of another, and one of those two domains has experienced enough mutation to have a slightly different function than the original. The pre-duplication protein had two functions; the post-duplication and post-mutation protein had three functions, yet it's all one piece. A second, different protein that formerly performed the ""newest"" (third) function could be lost without imparting a selection pressure upon the possessing species. But the IC approach declares that the system is now irreducibly complex. Removing one component of the system -- the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase -- removes functionality of that biochemical pathway. The protein that formerly performed the same function as the new (third) domain of CPS made the evolution of the current form of CPS possible without losing functionality of the system , but a current snapshot of the system would make the IC-believer conclude that the system could not have evolved. Even if this situation were entirely hypothetical, it refutes the ability of the concept of IC to be effective in showing the impossibility of an evolutionary pathway. And it's not even hypothetical. You have claimed that IC produces a problem because there can be no natural selection for a system that does not exist. There can be no natural selection FOR a system that does not exist, but there can be natural selection OF a system that does not exist in that there can be selection FOR parts that can end up forming that system. This is the case for the allegedly IC bacterial flagellum. Components that were useful to the organism were combined in previously nonexistent ways that were also useful to the organism. The ""guts"" of the flagellar mechanism is a secretory system, and the ""tail"" is the same stuff as cytoskeleton. There's no reason at all that the parts could not exist (and be selected FOR) before the flagellum existed. (This is co-option or exaptation.) Behe then changed his definition to overcome the problem of having systems that fit the original definition but whose evolution could be explained by scaffolding and co-option/exaptation. The problem was that the redefinition didn't do anything, it just pushed the requirement back a bit to what Behe arbitrarily called the ""irreducible core."" It essentially said, ""Go back far enough, and you'll not have an explanation for some things."" Such an argument falls prey to the very same reasoning that doomed his original definition. Dembski tried to save IC by redefining it again. He used Behe's original example of a three-legged stool to demonstrate his redefinition. Behe considered a three-legged stool irreducibly complex: remove any leg or the seat, and the stool fails to function. (Nevermind that the pieces might be somehow useful elsewhere, because that has been addressed.) Dembski pointed out that a simpler system would serve the same function: a seat being held up by a block. Thus, a three-legged stool is not IC, but a block that can serve as a butt-rest is. In order for something to be IC, Dembski said, there can't be any simpler system that serves that function. What Dembski is too dumb to understand is that his re-redefinition entirely abandons Behe's original intent, requires proving a universal negative (that no simpler system can serve the same function) to show that something is IC, and still doesn't sidestep the refutations of exaptation ! And if you don't believe my characterization of Dembski's re-redefinition, look it up on Dembski's blog! Arguing that the arising of an IC system via either scaffolding or exaptation is improbable is insufficient for maintaining that IC (of any definition!) presents a problem for modern evolutionary theory.

You clearly do not understand evolution if your contention is that no function can arise without first being selected for. What happens when the organelle doesn't make it to both sides? One side lives and one dies. This is easy to see how evolution could perfect the system. You could have only synchronized meiosis first, selected for because it increase the chances that both dividing halves of the cell get the organelles they need - but no separation mechanism. One cell would die if it didn't get any organelles and the living cell would have to grow and try again. This wouldn't be very good for survival, but all that has to happen to improve the system is the separation mechanism. Also, it is very likely that whatever was triggering the meiosis was very similar for both organelles and host cells. Further, at the time these functions were first evolving, there could have been many more organelles than current cells have. This would have been true so that both halves would surely get some. As soon as cell division became more efficient, the number of organelles would have been reduced. There is no such thing as IC.

Cannot possibly arise under current understanding of evolution. Any novel function, functions may certainly be improved. I do not stand ashamed of what can only be described as healthy skepticism. Proponents of evolution are fighting over examples of ""micro-evolution"" no better proof than that can be found for the fact that just as this thread is titled there is no objective, clear, singular evidence for evolution. It is good that you mentioned ""my definition"" of evolution; I see this definition from dictionary.com ""Change in the genetic composition of a population during successive generations, as a result of natural selection acting on the genetic variation among individuals, and resulting in the development of new species."" I have made no arguements against this, this does not imply anything about increasing complexity, advancement. The definitional error is when one begins to speak of evolutionary history, which necessitates advancement and say it is explain by evolution, begging the question ""how do you go from change in genetic composition to advancement in genetic composition."" I have shown you the reason that is not the same thing as ""merely a beneficial change"" that beneficial can be novel functionality or improved functionality and that mutation can explain both, however; only mutation and natural selection can make the second probable. That being said there are other definitions floating around like ""evolution: The gradual process by which the present diversity of plant and animal life arose from the earliest and most primitive organisms, which is believed to have been continuing for the past 3000 million years."" Now tell me, isn't that the one you are really thinking of? If you were thinking of the first why didn't you defeat my arguements by merely stating that evolution does not claim to explain the last 3000 million years so IC is not a problem for the theory? I'll ignore the irrelevant attack and focus on what is very key to my points. That novel functionality must be an accident in evolution.

You can't prove it so we are left with data analysis and thought exercise, all of evolution consist of those two things. Why can't the same be used to refute it? Conceiving of a way evolution could produce an IC system disproves the entire point conceiving of a way a IC system could be produced doesn't. Scaffolding assumes that selection is not necessary for interaction, scaffolding takes it as a granted that systems will change function because of mutation, why is this different from mutation? 1) link to data? 2) relevance? I was responding to each paragraph individually when I realized that the main point I was making was going to be lost in the smaller ones and that you would feel safe attacking those. How did the CPS protein acquire the third piece of functionality? If your answer is a single mutation that is exactly what IC predicts is neccessary. You are using the arguements I have identified several times and refuted. Natural selection of a system that does not exist, what do you mean by that? Second by moving the burden of randomness from the mutation to the parts of a system it appears as if you have solved the odds problem, NS cannot work on parts that aren't yet functioning any more than it can work on a mutation that has not yet occurred. Parts can be refined for a function but the direction of that refinement CANNOT be towards a system that does not exist except by random chance. No reason at all, but we aren't talking about them being selected for are we? his original definition was sound except that he should have clarified that it is not the functionality that is irreducible but the selection for that functionality. Ok, I'll take your word on it. It is sufficient to me. I am glad you realize probability is the core of my arguement, do you realize anti-probability is the core of evolution?","electrolyte","391399","Right: according to the ID caricature of stepwise evolution, an IC system can't be built stepwise because the reduced system allegely has no functionality. Even if we assume that the reduced IC system has no functionality, it does not follow that the components have no function. Thus these structures are prone to selection pressures. It seems that your argument is that without natural selection driving the formation of the IC system from pre-existing components, the probability of the system being built from those otherwise non-interacting components is very small. But so is hitting the Powerball jackpot, and there are only two per week. See law of large numbers. Either could be used to refute it if either has any meat to it. Yours doesn't. Not all of evolution consists of those two things. Statements like that make me want to stop treating you as someone who is capable of understanding this topic. You claim that we can't prove that evolution is capable of doing this, but even the thought experiment shows that it can. Nevermind that we have the evidence that it has happened. If I've interpreted this mess of English correctly, then I agree! The issue is that I have conceived of a way that evolution could produce an IC system. (Okay, I wasn't the first person to do this, but still...) You object because it doesn't involve natural selection selecting FOR that system, and you think that this missing characteristic means that evolution can't do it. In reality, it means nothing of the sort. Hey, I agree that scaffolding can take place with mutation of components and without selection FOR a system that doesn't exist. Are you agreeing with me? Additionally, it's possible that the system might change function without even a mutation in a coding sequence of any of those components but via a mutation in any targeting system. Sorry, got this from a real book: Biochemistry , Berg, J.M., et al, 5th ed. Freeman. (p 695) Real world example of conceptual disproof of IC ""hurdle."" Aren't you paying attention? I feel safe attacking any idiocy. My answer is not a single mutation, it is a number of mutations. Either way, though, your assertion is purely false. IC doesn't predict anything. Why would a single mutation difference either support or challenge claims of IC? Bullspit. You say that you've identified these arguments and refuted them, and then you say, which shows that not only have you not refuted it, but you haven't identified it because you don't even understand it. Having this discussion without understanding the difference between selection FOR and selection OF is like bringing a knife to a gunfight. A pocketknife. A mini pocketknife. Let's use a very simple model. Suppose that allele A imparts characteristics X and Y upon the possessing organism. Suppose characteristic X presents a favorable selection pressure upon that organism. Characteristic X is selected FOR, meaning that allele A is selected FOR. But because allele A is selected FOR, characteristic Y experiences the same effect of being selected for even though there was no selection for characteristic Y. Characteristic Y has been selected; i.e. there was selection OF Y. I've done neither, exactly. Mutation of some sort can still play a part, but we don't need the multiple simultaneous mutations that the IC proponent claims are needed. Odds were never a problem; people still play Powerball. 1. NS (+RM) isn't the only mechanism of evolution. 2. The parts are functioning, just not originally as the new system. I agree with what you mean but not with one interpretation of what you have said. NS cannot direct refinement based on the fitness conferred by a nonexistent system, but it can direct refinement (1) based on fitness conferred by an existing system and (2) in a way that happens to lead to new function. I explain this because there is not necessarily no relationship between the two, meaning that the ""random chance"" here is not very similar to the ""random chance"" of multiple simultaneous mutations or even of a single point mutation in ""just the right spot."" Yes, we are. There is a fitness benefit to having these structures that IC proponents argue can't be expected to confer a fitness benefit because the IC system isn't fully built. I agree that his first definition was the least troublesome of the three (for the IC/ID proponents), but that doesn't make it any less flawed. I understand perfectly what his point was/is. The fact that it was (is) flawed is what led to his redefinition. Seriously: even Behe realized that his original definition was insufficient for proving his point. But you don't have to. You can look it up right on his blog. Of course, Dembski's being an XXXXX doesn't really refute Behe's original idea, but the fact that Dembski felt the need to re-revise Behe's definition might be interpreted as being indicative of a problem. Of course it's sufficient for you . You can't connect dots. You say that NS can't favor nonexistent or nonfunctional systems, which is true. You conclude that evolution can't build systems that have intermediate or incomplete forms that are nonfunctional. We provide examples of ways that evolution can do this, and you hand-wave it away. Yes, and no. Yes, probability is the core of your argument, meaning that it's an argument from incredulity, as others have already pointed out. And no, anti-probability is not the core of evolution. It's pretty damn dumb to make that argument, too, as if there's no positive evidence for evolution. This is why many educated people can't take evolution deniers seriously.

Simply put this algorithm was designed to succeed, note when he called people who thought this ignorant. Insults are usually targeted towards the threat. 1.) Functionality already existed, review all my arguements for why this is not what I am speaking about. Whats that? he didn't start it off as a clock? no but every single permutation told time, or else he could not calculate which one told it the worst. In fact his code doesn't even allow clocks that don't tell time through the evolution matrix. 2.) Functionality was predefined, note how he had components and random elements but that the randomness never extended beyond scalars. I will some day create a algorithm of my own to prove to myself one way or the other. It will consist of random base code and the final result will not be predictable by the simplest analysis. The clock example was somewhat hard to comprehend in relation to evolution, let me identify a program that would show the same result for the same reasons. A series of 250 numbers are generated called number A, a second number B is generated, number B is copied twice forming two permutations changing one digit for each, the permutation which is less numerically identical to number A is deleted and the other is copied again. This will continue until number A equals number B, that will not convince me evolution is true, nor does it account for IC.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","09:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","479"

They were not shown not to be, there are far more than the ones shown as example by behe. A misunderstanding of IC you are consiously continuing caused that mistake. So stop doing it. We have the ignoring that things don't happen without reason. Yes I can see that.... Find H,J. Muller's explaination post it here and watch me apologize. I read about the PCP munching bacteria and what was before, which displayed a misunderstanding to some degree of IC, but basicaly tried the same trick that has been tried in this thread, tried and defeated. At some point here I am going to have to tell you just to reread my posts because I am getting tired of reiterating the concepts I have presented as clearly as I can. Oh right the example, I am sure if you read it you noticed that all three enzymes existed already. It was admitted they had other roles, it was admitted that the only difference between the enzymes was optimization. IC in this case would consist of no enzymes capable of breaking down PCP. Scaffolding in this case would consist of what apparently happened, the systems already existed. Let's pretend that the system met my criteria of not having function previous to proposed evolutionary event, say that the middle enzyme could not break down PCP but it could with some mutation. Until PCP was being broken down exactly what mutation would be selected for in PcpC that would cause it to be able to work on PCP? For the sake of argument say that A - B is the distance in difference of DNA between working PcpC and non-working PcpC A mutation that brought A half way to B would not cause selective pressure on the enzyme. Only once A = B is there selective pressure, but as you can see since there was no pressure inbetween those points there was no evolutionary process. You can say it was 25 mutations that happened to happen in order or you can say it was 1 it doesn't matter because no matter how many times you break it up there is no natural selection filtering the mutations in favor of B. The basic contetion of scaffolding is that the above is granted but natural selection is filtering the mutations in favor of C where C is the optimized function of that enzyme in it's current role. The assumption which is not part of evolution, not rational, and most certainly random is that C = B Why do you believe that? If there is an unbroken chain of such happenings I would consider it evidence for ID. It would mean that there is a definite chain of coninsiding functionality not guided by natural selection but by their own properties, by the nature of carbon based life.

You also ignore, ""This system could result from a larger system with a different function whose function was changed through slight changes and then unnecessary parts removed."" This is scaffolding. Somehow you completely ignore this example stating, ""Yeah, but the selective pressures could not have been towards the final ""IC"" system. Therefore, no NS and no evolution."" What!? First off, that really doesn't make sense since we already said the selection is toward an alternate function. Secondly, the selection of the function CAN exist once it emerges in some form from within the non IC system which will later be trimmed down into your definition of IC. The function doesn't have to be fully formed for selection to take over. It only has to have an inkling of a benefit. Freedom, you have by no means won the argument here.

I can prove that false in the same way I can prove the Bible false: by proving the way things REALLY are. EVIDENCE FOR EVOLUTION Lets see here, evidence for evolution - The fossil record which stretches back a few billion years and shows that over time the organisms which become fossilized have changed, advanced, developed new functions, new appendages in such a way that fits exactly with what evolution predicts. We find new evidence confirming evolution every day. DNA - which has all the chances in the world to disprove evolution. We only need ONE unexplainable anomaly in the DNA record to debunk evolution. Instead, time after time, DNA studies, both nucleic and mitochondrial continue to fall right in place with what evolution predicts in time frame and physical location. Physical characteristics - In living creatures we see physical characteristics change from niche to niche but any beneficial features remaining unchanged. We see in the breeding of dogs that DRASTIC physical changes can take place over a very short period of time. Further, these features can be selected for and we can get functions from the dogs that dont even exist in nature. We have produced what many would argue is a new species. Extinction - We have INNUMERABLE species of animals and plants in the fossil record that do not exist anymore, just as evolution predicts. There is not enough room on the whole planet to accommodate at the same time populations of all of the species known to have existed. Missing links - Countless times the missing link that evolution predicts must have existed has turned up. Contrary to Christian claims, there are very few gaps in the fossil record. Many times we have pinpointed where the missing link must have lived. Lo and behold we go looking for it and there it is, in the exact fossil layer it should be. Never have we found an anomaly in the fossil record that doesn't make sense to evolution. EVIDENCE FOR ID ""It's just so complicated."" That's all you've got!

I believe evidence for ID (if any) would take the form of philosophical analysis of some of the most basic observations of the universe. Here is where I will probably get dinged, most people would claim philosophy is not science, I am somewhat unique in that I think science is all knowledge reached by rational thought, certainly evolutionist agree on the premise as you cannot falsify evolution by experiment. So I believe one can come to conclusions and just like science take them to be true until you either discover the premises you used were false or extra variables that change the nature of your understanding. Please note this is not the same was what I have been saying about evolution, for since a problem with evolution has been found one of the premises ""evolution is the mechanism"" is false. Are you aware of Aristotles observation of the prime mover? The only way to avoid the prime mover argument for ID is to have energy eternal. In other words either the universe always was, or the prime mover always was. The big bang is all good and well, but all energy and matter spontaneously spawned? On what physical law is that based, by what in all our observations could cause that to be scientific? When has anything ever acted without reason? ""For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction except for the greatest reaction/action"" - Why? If the universe has always existed then one can take infinite time for any given physical process to be infinite and approach this analysis from the philosophical version of ""taking the limit as X approaches infinity"" If one considers that the universe has existed for an infinite amount of time, then all elements of the universe have existed for an infinite amount of time. Hold on because that last may be confused for the fallacy of composition, without a reference frame you cannot differentiate time, if there was any change in the nature of the universe it would be 0 or infinity, as it is multiplied by infinity. So if stars died or gravity collected mass that would be continuing for an infinite amount of time, which means they reach equilibrium and are dynamic over relative points but do not change their nature or energy. As far as we can tell energy has existed back towards the big bang, and farther if one wants to exclude faith. Alright here is the crux, if intelligence is part of the universe (and it is we are here) then it cannot be increasing or decreasing except on relative reference frame. So either intelligence has always existed, or intelligence designed and formed the universe, and the universe has not always existed. We have scientific evidence we have not always existed, therefore the latter. This is obviously quite shaky as far as logic goes; probably the most unacceptable part to you is the change in elemental conclusion about the universe. This line of reasoning condensed could be seriously condensed if one assumed there was no universe before the big bang: Either the universe has always existed or that which formed it has, the universe has not always existed therefore the thing which formed it has. Well you certainly got the more speculative end of my brain If you have read my response to databed you know that I find that evaluation a failure to separate necessary evidence from inferential evidence. In other words evolution predicts common descent and common descent predicts our fossil record, our fossil record exists that is only direct evidence for common descent. Anything further would take the form of ""Since evolution claims to explain common descent and that is true evolution must be true"" Comparing two 0's here I'm afraid. Like so many generations before us, we are just going to have to wait for more data. I however suspect that it won't be that simple, you see I am not a super naturalist but an ultra naturalist. I think if there is a designer it wouldn't be above existence but its core. Therefore if one is looking for evidence of a designer by searching for contradictions in the universes laws that could only be explained by an intelligent force changing those laws one will not find it.

This can be seen by dating the fossil layers in which they are found and comparing their structure to today's creatures of the sea. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the first emergence of legs would be found in layers above that of the earliest aquatic organisms. Take it further, the emergence of wings would be found above the earliest land walkers. What do you know, hypothesis is verified. One point for evolution. A better experiment can be performed when you look into ERV mapping, especially in primates and hominids. You come up with a hypothesis, knowing from fossil records that humans probably evolved from a common ancestor as monkeys, that you should find ERV's matched in the two that aren't found in any other animals (except for those who also evolved from the common ancestor of course). You should also hypothesize that there won't be any ERVs that humans and dogs have, but monkeys do not (sometimes you do see deletions, but this is obvious based on the surrounding DNA.)

"02-23-2010","12023",35,"iangb","391976","I am your guest. There are two dichotomies being discussed here: (a)Theism - whether you believe in a God or not. (a)Gnositicism - whether you (think you) know something or not. The thing about dichotomies is that you cannot ignore them - you have to fall one side or the other. You can't be just 'an agnostic' - you have to be 'an agnostic' about something ( thanks for the example, Obama ). Simple maths, then, dictates that you have a combination of four possibles to choose from: Gnostic theist - one who believes in God, and is certain of it. For example: those who claim to have had a 'personal experience'. Agnostic theist - one who believes in God, but cannot be sure. For example: who were born into the faith and don't see any reason to change. Gnostic atheist - one who does not believe in God, and is fully confident in this lack of belief. For example: Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens and any 'strong' atheist; the terms are synonymous. Agnostic atheist - one who does not believe in God, but accepts that they may be wrong. For example: myself, Accipter, TQ (I think) and any 'weak' atheist; the two terms are synonymous. Thus, as someone who isn't sure but chooses not to believe, Accipter is an agnostic atheist. EDIT: It's true that 'agnostic' is often taken to be about atheism because it's where the word is most commonly used - hence your definition. However, being an agnostic and being an atheist are by no means mutually exclusive - and being 'an agnostic' does not prevent you from being a theist.","gansao","391980","An atheist is someone who denies the existence of God An agnostic is someone skeptical about the existence of God but does not profess true atheism.

My first real post on this topic sums it up best, I think. You're quite right that atheism is often described as 'the belief in no God' - but that is only a subset of atheism in general, which is simply a lack of theism - 'no belief in God' would be the catch-all phrase. See Wikipedia's cite notes on the matter. Hence you can have 'strong' (gnostic) atheism and 'weak' (agnostic) atheism. (A)gnosticism, on the other hand, is the descriptor that deals with certainty. A gnostic is certain, and an agnostic is uncertain. Hence you can have agnostic atheists and agnostic theists - stick both into google/wikipedia for the relevant info to highlight the differences between the two. EDIT: You beat me to it.

That point is clearly discussed in the Wikipedia article so I would not understand the logic of denying that.

Mysticism is the belief system that knowledge can be gained by non-rational means. It may be a contradiction in terms but it is a belief that too many people have and are having. I am not kidding, one must believe something is true in order to carry out a method which is fundamentally dependant on that thing. I find this debate quite pointless even by online forum standards, it is however a good an example of prejudice, several evolutionist took the opposing side to me for no apparent reason. There is no way in hell anyone sane could actually oppose my statement if they knew what it meant. I did not say of I said in. In because rationality is a type of epistemological belief. and that is not what it says in 'simple English'. epistemology - a branch of philosophy that investigates the origin, nature, methods, and limits of human knowledge. rationality - 1. the state or quality of being rational. 2. the possession of reason. 3. agreeableness to reason; reasonableness. 4. the exercise of reason. 5. a reasonable view, practice, etc. reason, philosophy - a. the faculty or power of acquiring intellectual knowledge, either by direct understanding of first principles or by argument. b. the power of intelligent and dispassionate thought, or of conduct influenced by such thought. Believing in rationality in epistemology means: Believing that in the origin, nature, methods, and limits of human knowledge ; only the exercise of the faculty or power of acquiring intellectual knowledge, either by direct understanding of first principles or by argument /||/ the power of intelligent and dispassionate thought, or of conduct influenced by such thought. Since science at a fundamental level is based on the fact that true knowledge is logically obtained science is rational. One must believe that rationality can produce knowledge therefore in order to even consider science as a valid method. Believing anything is a path or source of knowledge is a philosophical belief of the branch epistemology . I agree only to the last. I do not, I have seen what happens to a debate when debaters use the same word with different definitions in their mind. It is as close to utter chaos as any communication can get. I avoid this by stating the definition I am using when I feel there is more than one way to interpret the meaning given the context. This is not inferior to doing the same minus the clarification. I do not pull definitions out of the hat unless I am creating a new phrase to represent a new concept. Yes, I am unrelenting. When I do relent it happens so quickly that no one notices or cares.

"09-19-2010","12023",44,"Freedom","412968","So belief != 'think to be true'? You did not understand correctly. It was a conceptual tool I was using to illustrate that the distinction made by IC is definable and objective. Well I can see how one would be confused there, but in fact if you read carefully I was only attacking unsound attacks on ID, I never made a positive argument for it. I do the same thing for other subjects as well because the point of debate is to weed out incorrect logic (at least it is to me). I have attacked the unsound attacks that creationist have made against evolution such as 'no intermediate fossils' and 'where does the DNA come from'. My position on ID (for the record) is that the only evidence is a generalization which means it's still a hypothesis for now and probably will stay that way for a very long time. I reject, however; the notion that it is not a valid hypothesis for it certainly does explain what it claims to explain if it was true. That is actually in a better position than irrational evolution which I reject not because of a lack of evidence but because the hypothesis itself is invalid, i.e. it does not explain what it claims to. The final evaluation of my position is I don't know where life came from or how it advanced, and that doesn't bother me because there are a lot of things I don't know. I am content to never surrender to ignorance, and to always be vigilant for the truth. kk, so when you say science you mean the body of theories not the method.","Bennedict","412986","belief does not necessarily mean 'think to be true.' i think that belief in the context that we are talking about is faith oriented - and with faith implies that you believe something to be true just because. so i dislike the word faith more than i dislike the word believe, because faith is much less of a scientific term. you could use the word believe in science, by saying 'science is a method based on a belief system' but in that context again, faith is implied. IC is a tool used by ID proponents. also, IC has been completely disproven by the scientific community. i think it was disproven about 5 years ago or something - the scientific way of going about that sort of thing would be either to revise the theory to make it acceptable or to drop it altogether and start a new one. that's how its been done since Aristotle's time. ID proponents have done neither of those, just continuously push the idea of IC in different forms, all of which being disproven almost immediately as soon as they arise. this is another point as to why ID has no scientific validity - it doesnt follow the scientific method. if you would like to be vigilant for the truth and never surrender to ignorance, then read up on evolution before defending ID. have you read Origin of Species yet? you cant blame me for thinking that youre lying in saying that you are content to never surrender to ignorance. you havent read the main evolution literature, leading me to believe that you havent read any published evolutionary literature at all, yet you defend ID as if it is a valid theory that contends to Darwin's. that is ignorance in a nutshell, freedom. all creationists do the same. im not saying that ID is not a valid hypothesis, it isnt a valid scientific theory. i told you before that ive read a creationist book before (Darwin's Black Box by Michael Behe, in my naivety thinking it was a pro-evolution book, but i bit my tongue and read it anyways.) and evolution completely kills it. if i was talking about the scientific method, i would have said 'the scientific method is fundamentally true' which wouldnt make sense. but talking about science as a whole, it does make sense, as ive explained above.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","03:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","658"

Is it so extensive you cannot post it? a.k.a ""Yes"".","Bennedict","413008","i am so overjoyous that youve asked me why IC is wrong. lets start with the eyeball: ID proponents bring up the eyeball as evidence of irriducible complexity, yet we have a very good evolutionary explanation for the complexity of the eye. a patch of skin on a single celled eukaryotic organism developed a variation which enabled the differentiation between light and dark - thus being able to avoid dangers slightly and survive longer. an example of this sort of eye is the euglena bacterium. a rudimentary eye formed through natural selection, one like that of a nautilis. the evolution of the eye continued to a complex eye that we humans have and many other animals. so, the eyeball can be reduced to a simpler form, it is not irriducibly complex. another example used by the ID proponents is the infamous bacterial flagellum. Behe proposed that there is nothing like the bacterial flagellum, and even without one part of the flagellum, the mechanism would not work. certain eukariotic flagellum are a more rudimentary version of the bacterial kind. they are missing sometimes up to 40 of the 50 parts of their flagellum and they are still perfectly functional. there is a heirarchy between flagellum that one can trace back in the evolution of the organelle. the bacterial flagellum is actually a very good example of evolution taking place, because we have many varieties of the flagellum organelle in specimens. the bacterial flagellum is not irriducibly complex in that we can trace back it's evolutionary roots. a radio interview with a fellow from the discovery institute said that the whale's blowhole has not been traced back to the lungs of land dwelling creatures, hence IC. in fact, we have an excellent understanding of records depicting the esophogus moving up to the top of the head in mammals. the respiratory system of whales can be reduced to land dwelling mammals, thus it is not irriducibly complex. the immune system has been heavily documented in it's evolution, yet ID proponents like Behe describe the immune system as being irriducibly complex. first of all, it should be noted that the immune system is genetic, so it could get highly technical. i will try to keep things simple. the vertibrate immune system evolved first from the immune system from invertibrate species - thus both systems are different. vertibrate immune systems developed first from the clumping of genes called major histocompatibily complex genes (MHC). MHC genes come in two versions, the first being for fish and the second being for mammals. selection pressure encouraged the development of auto-immunity from these MHC and other genes (TAP/LMP etc). MHC promotes immune reactions within cells, and its also used to control these reactions. these combined clumps of genes encouraged the production of hormones which produce a group of proteins called cytokines which are created by cells, used sort of like an enzyme, but to provide communication between cells. this means that cells which hold an immunity to a certain virus can transmit that immunity information to other cells. over time, a large amount of these cytokines can be produced by cells which hold an immunity. the vertibrate immunity system can be traced back to a simpler immunity system, thus meaning it is not irriducibly complex. i think that just about covers every one of the IC arguments, if you have any other propositions, dont hesitate to ask me or make a thread and get a number of answers.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","06:37 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","662"

Do you mean: "" If science was a belief system then it would need to be a system that you believe in to be true "" ? I am overjoyed that you seem willing to argue it instead of dismiss it. Mistake number one on the topic of IC is mistaking it for a unprovisional conclusion. Nothing in science is without provisions and IC is no exception. IC does not claim that something cannot happen it claims that it cannot be produced by a process. The point being that 'a very good evolutionary explanation' is not so unless all selection pressures are identified. What these 'very good evolutionary explanations' tend to be are evolutionary stories. There is the belief (or thought) amongst evolutionist that if they can imagine a series of steps that is an explanation. These stories tend to contain two elements, a proposed intermediate and the reason it would be beneficial to an organism. On the surface this is all that should be required but the IC analysis reveals that the final selection pressure does not equal the process selection pressure. Evolution as Darwin put forth was gradual with practically an unlimited number of intermediates (Here I just made a statement about evolution as Darwin put forth which means if I haven't read OOS and this is my ignorance you should point it out) and IC in essence shows that evolution does not do well when this premise is strayed from. These stories therefore typically have a 'magic transition', I just coined that phrase now but I mean by it the part of the story that actually represents the event which is meant to be explained. The common theme in almost all these stories is that this magic transition is simply an assertion that it happened. Let's look at what you just said for example. ""a patch of skin on a single celled eukaryotic organism developed a variation which enabled the differentiation between light and dark"" The bolded part is evolution, the rest is particular context and good record keeping. The assertion here is that there was a single mutation (variation) that caused this ability to manifest. Since the function forming event is the crux and primary subject of IC it is obvious that this story defeats every attempt at IC analysis because it simply states it away. BTW I assume you mean a protein complex in a cell membrane when you say patch of skin? I see you are starting off with examples and this is good because I have already extensively argued IC vs IE in the abstract with databed and peeling. Therefore making the same arguments with particulars will clarify things for many I think. I thought you said you read his book. Would you care to elaborate on this, what parts are actually missing? Then the fellow from the discovery institute needs to reread the book because IC has nothing to do with tracing. Don't, that will cause confusion. The biggest problem with Behe's book in my opinion was that he used page after page trying to make analogies and simplify concepts for his readers (which I guess were mostly creationist so....) Tracing does not prove IC incorrect, you have confused it for ""there isn't anything like this"" which would be difficult if you read and understood DBB. I am aware genes produce functions. Another side note you said mammals and fish, aren't you missing reptiles and birds because I am sure they are not invulnerable to infection by virtue of God's grace. Actually the abstract argument covered them all, but it will be interesting to apply.","Bennedict","413053","yes, i was overjoyous but ashamed because as i said in another thread, people who value science should be ignoring ID. but whatever, you asked. i assume you are referring to Darwin's tree of life, where the lines are straight. we have found that evolution is not a ramp from one species to another, but a staircase with intermediates on each step. the reason is because each step is going to be better at surviving than the previous one. in a ramp illustration, the process would be unstable, but in the way evolution works, a species is maintained for a while before a variation arises and after maybe a couple decades the entire species has developed this feature. also, if Darwin's tree of life were correct, we would see one species branching off into a million different directions, seeing as different variations arise that may all be an advancement. so to continue with the eye as you asked, this 'complex of proteins on the cell membrane' ie patch of light sensative skin... no need to complicate things for no reason... developed a variation to be concave - thus differentiation between light and dark as well as knowing the general direction of which the light source or shadow is coming from. the edges of the skin folded over the opening of the concave structure giving a very blurry image to form on these light sensative cells. liquid and a rudimentary lens formed inside and provided a much clearer image... the process continues. IC can be disproven by tracing back the evolutionary process. you said yourself that the IC argument is that certain things could not have come about by a process, but as ive shown you, we can trace back the process of the evolution of the eye to more basic forms - thus IC is wrong in saying that the eye did not form by a process. thank you for asking about the flagellum. the flagellum evolved from something called a bacterial syringe: this is the one example i gave that is missing 40 of its 50 parts. its missing the hook, tip, junction, filament, and the parts that makes it rotate. it doesnt function the same say as a flagellum does, but the flagellum can be reduced to it. there are also intermediates, like the cilia; the flagellum rotates in a circular patter whereas a cilia moves back and forth. it isnt missing 40 parts, but it is still missing parts of which Behe says are essential to function, yet the cilia and the bacterial syringe are perfectly functional. i suggest researching Ken Miller's explanation of the evolution of the bacterial flagellum. simplicity does not cause confusion, freedom. we use simplicity to avoid confusion. what Behe did was make tangents. the mouse trap analogy is just silly. i agree, Behe made things complicated in his book, but not for describing things in simple terms. reptiles and birds would fall into the MHC class 2 with mammals. i was giving examples of both in saying fish and mammals. if we trace back the evolutionary process of these systems, we can see that they can be broken down into other simpler mechanisms, and that disproves IC which states, as you put it, that evolution could not have caused the development of such complex systems. from what ive seen, the argument is one of two - that either there are no intermediates, like the eyeball which is incorrect, or that if you remove one part, the system is completely non functional like the flagellum which is incorrect. the same goes for both examples; there are intermediates between the flagellum and the bacterial syringe, and if you remove one part of the eye, it is still functional.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:09 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","665"

Please don't feel offended because this is quite normal. This is in fact exactly why so many evolutionist have thought I was in contradiction accepting common descent without accepting irrational evolution. Common descent says that creatures came from common ancestors, life has advanced so then I must accept that something is causing life to advance over generations. Yes I do, that does not specify what I must accept though, you are basically pointing out 'common descent' for organisms and conjecting that some process must have happened. Ah, here is the good stuff. Another evolutionist (I don't remember who but will look it up) tried to use the secretory system as a proposed precursor as well, as evidence he posted a link to an article discussing the similarities between them. The most interesting thing after reading that article, however; was no the similarities but the fact that the article had good reason to think that the secretory system was a decomposition of the flagellum, i.e. the secratory system evolved from the flagellum. I suspect this circular descendancy comes from that fact that similarity ~~ descent connection but that does not specify the direction so often 'scientist' simply choose which ever happens to be more convenient for their paper. If it does not function ""the same say as a flagellum"". It is not a flaggelum. You may now see the relevance of my opposition to the notion that every biological system is merely a permutation of some other system. On that premise you will be hard pressed to understand IC because you will only see one actual system in life, this blurring is objectively flawed. I have, the video you linked to surmised ken miller's argument precisely I think. Are you suggesting the cilia has any connection with a flagellum besides they do the same thing for the cell? I am not suggesting that one attempts to make things complicated but trying to simplify something beyond the level made possible by the number and the meaning of the terms will omit information and necessarily cause confusion. It does not. Again I have gone through these arguments before on this very forum, since you do not wish to read what I have argued perhaps I should give you a primer. ON TYPES OF SYSTEMS: I concluded all systems in biology are either IC or HIC HIC = hybrid irreducibly complex, meaning as system which contains both necessary parts and unnecessary but merely helpful parts. HIC is a favorite escape for arguing against IC, examples of HIC are given in which the necessary component becomes necessary, it then becomes IC. It is then asserted that since an HIC system can be converted to an IC system and IC system is not IC. The blade cuts both ways though, an IC system may be converted to an HIC system and every system has an IC core which means that all novel function is IC. ON INTERMEDIATES: I made detailed arguments from many directions on the invalidity of association any function with a specific selection pressure. This is the mistake that ken miller made in the video you posted for me, He used Behe's definition of IC which has some terms implied that should not be. Most important of these being when he says 'function' he does not mean any function he means the function of the said system. The ability to decompose a system into systems with different function does not mean the system was not IC because you in fact are not able to remove and of the parts and retain the function, merely a function. Further the ability to compose a system into simpler systems with the same function does not mean the system was never IC, it means it is HIC now. ON GUIDED MUTATION: The tool previously mentioned is a formula for identifying the concept IC is talking about. I do not wish to restate it's definition if you are not interested. I can summarize what it does, it returns a boolean value which is an absolute measure of whether a genetic change is produced by evolution or pure chance. true = guided = the result of natural selection + random mutation = rational evolution. false = unguided = luck = irrational evolutions production of novelty Using this function one can define IC in another way: An IC system is one which returns false when measuring from any previously existing genetic code to the systems minimal functional form (IC core). Since nearly axiomatic that all systems have an IC core the analysis seems silly to take to see if an IC core is IC but it will still return the correct value, it is much more useful to see if a proposed IC system is just IC or HIC. It's primary purpose however is it's extreme convenience at defining the difference between creating an IC system (novel system) and improving an existing one. At the risk of sounding arrogant Behe's book 'the edge of evolution' could be reduced to two pages of explaining this tool and would stand some improvement for the lack of puzzle fitting one would have to do. No intermediates and 'you can't remove a part without removing the function' are equivalent. The eye is a system of compound IC improvements, as opposed to the flagellum which as far as I can tell is actually IC. (or very slightly HIC).","pandion","413134","That's a lot of straws.

(or very slightly HIC).","Bennedict","413166","yea. see you dont quite understand how evolution works still. first of all, evolution is far from constant and gradual. we can see some organisms evolve in our life span whereas some organisms can stay unchanged for thousands of years. evolution is very much time based, and whether a variation comes about or not in an organism is dependant on a number of variables - which could lead to evolving really quickly or very slowly. like i said previously, it could take mere decades for a species to fully develop an upgraded feature, so Darwin's original tree of life is wrong. in the one we acknowledge now, there are much more horizontal and vertical lines, and of course certain variations will not survive, that's obvious when were talking about natural selection. i think your main argument is that a feature with one purpose cannot evolve from a feature with a different purpose. this cannot be a better example of how little you know about evolution. it is very easy to draw the evolution of the hands and arms from chimpanzee to human; a chimp will use its hands and arms to aide it in walking, whereas we use our arms and hands universally, but certainly not for walking. take the feet of the chimp and compare it to that of a human; again very easy to draw similarities, but chimps use their feet for climbing trees and hanging - even using them in the same way they use their hands. we do not - we have a different purpose for our feet. those are extremely easy examples which show that you are infact wrong in saying that one feature cannot evolve from a similar feature with a different purpose. ive explained to you already one possible way of how the stomach could have developed - through the esophogus, which has a very different function than the stomach. even the evolution from fin to limb is very well documented; one is used for swimming, one is used for walking. i read somewhere that creationists love to view features as something designed with a purpose in mind. this is not how evolutionists think. if a feature is good at doing something, it will use that feature for that purpose and therefore develop it further. if we find that our hands are not so good for walking, we wont use them for walking anymore. the bacterial syringe, although it does not have the same function as a flagellum, thus it is not a flagellum as i did not claim, IS a simpler version of the flagellum. lets look at the specifics of both. both the flagellum and the syringe have rings (M,S,C,P, and L rings). the syringe uses these rings to inject host cells with a virus whereas the flagellum uses its rings as a motor. again, the features have not been designed with a purpose in mind, they use the same features for two different purposes. about this eyespot on the skin (or membrane if you prefer), i gave the example of the euglena bacterium which is a single celled eukaryotic organism with an eyespot on it's membrane: i wont dispute you when you say that multi-celled organisms can have such eyespots, they do; but single celled organisms can have similar eyespots. why the hell arent we allowed to trace back the evolution of a feature to simpler features and use that as evidence of the evolutionary process? thats exactly the kind of thing we WOULD use as evidence in any process in which time is involved. evolution is heavily based on time, so why cant we use time to explain it happening? also, you will never hear any evolutionist talk about 'luck' as you have described them doing when outlining irrational evolution. from what you say about rational evolution (minus the guided part) is what every evolutionist thinks. so irrational evolution is...well, irrational. you can just use 'evolution' from now on. no more strawmen, please. i will ignore any response to this. we can argue about the differences between no intermediates and removing a part of a function, but that would be off topic. ive already explained to you how the eye could have evolved - and we can look at simpler forms of it (this time with similar functions) in other organisms to get an idea of the process; ie the retina evolved first via the eyespot, cornea second etc. ive also explained to you that the flagellum is not irriducibly complex, seeing as we can reduce it to other, simpler forms to get an idea of how it evolved, too.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:28 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","676"

"09-21-2010","12023",46,"Freedom","413208","So you have said. In essence that is IC. If you can give reason why this is an example of ignorance I will take no offense. I have explained to you already that this level of final purpose is not what i mean when I say function. All limbs and digits are merely different shaped versions of each other. The key to recognizing a functional domain is to avoid claiming that function that can be performed inefficiently does not accomplish the function. I can climb a tree now, if was truly a different function I would not be able to. I simply cannot do it better than a chimp. Chimps have refined climbing limbs and I have refined walking limbs. I am sorry it appears I used the '40 of 50' as a reference between eukaryotic rudimentary flagellum and this bacterial syringe. ""certain eukariotic flagellum are a more rudimentary version of the bacterial kind. they are missing sometimes up to 40 of the 50 parts of their flagellum and they are still perfectly functional."" <-> ""this is the one example i gave that is missing 40 of its 50 parts. its missing the hook, tip, junction, filament, and the parts that makes it rotate. it doesnt function the same say as a flagellum does"" It is coincidence that the number of missing parts are the same, and when you said you gave the example you meant before this thread? I am still interested in the rudimentary flagellum though. I don't actually see an argument against IC in this post. I reread it and realize I became confused. You equated skin with a membrane but then you stopped talking about the euglena and started on the macro-scopic eye right? ""to continue with the eye as you asked, this 'complex of proteins on the cell membrane' ie patch of light sensative skin... no need to complicate things for no reason... Speaking about multi-cellular eye NOW developed a variation to be concave - thus differentiation between light and dark as well as knowing the general direction of which the light source or shadow is coming from. the edges of the skin folded over the opening of the concave structure giving a very blurry image to form on these light sensative cells. liquid and a rudimentary lens formed inside and provided a much clearer image... the process continues."" I did not know the single cells could even make use of this information it gets from a light sensitive organelle. Very interesting, do you know what control systems are attached to the input? Actually I just realized there was a chloroplast inside that fellow, it probably knows to swim when there is no light right? Be my guest but this tracing gives you no insight into any evolutionary process it (as far as I can see in all examples) merely sets up decendancy connections. Could you please try to formulate the argumental link between this tracing and the process of evolution? This will help me to understand and respond to you. Databed and peeling were forced to it by my arguments and you probably will be as well if you continue to argue honestly. Uh the guided part is what differentiates it from irrational evolution. but yes I have noticed that effect, it seems most keep the idea of rational evolution in their minds while at the same time assuming the conclusion of irrational evolution. Define 'evolution' and I will use it as you define it. I disagree, as I said it appeared you asserted that all the actual advancements 'developed' by means of 'variation'. Since this is the subject matter it is equivalent to saying ""how did it happen? , by the process of it happening"". You aren't trying to answer the same questions as I then, you are looking for a time line given the premise that functions spring up by chance and that this need not be explained no matter how many proteins are required. Perhaps your finest If you think that is a pathetic comeback, that's because it is. I am not debating you; you are having some kinda of bizarre grammatical sparing match. As you have completly convinced me of this now I will be ignoring any attempt at it's continuance. I am not sure what you mean. I have not yet seen any true arguments from you yet I thought you were 'setting your pieces up' with this information of proposed IC systems. You asserted that 'tracing' disproves IC but I have not seen support for this nor do I see how it follows myself. The argument was made in the abstract and must be defeated in the abstract. This is true of all arguments even though some are very much example ridden. The first step would be (as it always is) to identify the invalid logic in the argument. You are looking for a fallacy that doesn't exist namely that IC claims that no function has a simpler form. You can disprove a rule with an exception but not an exception with an exception. Behe is to be faulted for not explaining the way he was using the word intermediate but I will define it more explicitly. It is irrelevant that any specific intermediate exists, conceptually you can see it is obvious there can always be an intermediate if you attach no further conditions to that. (even if only a partially constructed system). An intermediate as Behe uses the word is actually a range of genetic change in which n intermediates exist and have identical selection pressure direction (scale does not matter). The ratio between n and the total genetic change is relevant for the odds of spontaneous formation jumps. Nomenclature problems such as this is why I invented (and and condemned for it) a more precise and less cluttered set of terms and rules to analyze systems. Anyway though if I was being paid (moral obligations aside) to defend irrational evolution from IC I think the most promising attack angle would be a co-option tree. A co-option tree is a connection between preexisting functions not on selection pressures but the chance that the pre-exisitng structure is so similar to a novel function that a small mutation 'jumped over' to the novel one. Even then that would be an indirect attack (i.e. it attacks the conclusion that life couldn't have advanced by pure chance by minimizing that chance) (this would be an appeal to odds) As I said I didn't see any. If your argument on a flagellum for example is 'there is a bacterial syringe', of course I am not going to attack that it's a fact. I attacked the implications you claimed that fact had.","Bennedict","413224","ill start with reasons for your ignorance. saying that a feature cannot come about from a similar feature with a different purpose is simply incorrect. almost all of the features in biological systems are an evolved version of a different feature with a different function at some point or another. evolution 101 will tell you this. another thing evolution 101 can tell you is the process in which evolution works - natural selection. ill get back to that. i apologize for the confusion, i said 'certain eukaryotic flagellum'... but then started talking about the syringe missing 40 of 50 parts, but you thought i still meant a flagellum. the argument that the flagellum and syringe use the same set of rings to perform two completely different functions indicates that the syringe is a rudimentary flagellum that performs a different task. so, the flagellum could have easily evolved from the syringe, instead of providing a tool for injection of a virus, providing a mode of efficient transportation. one cell could carry many syringes on it's membrane, but if just one were to evolve into a simple cilia or flagellum, the result would be very very harmful to the host cell. selection pressure would encourage the syringe to evolve into a mechanism for movement, which, with it's rings are capable of doing. like i said, multi-cellular organisms can employ the same type of eyespot that single cellular organisms can, and with multi-celled organisms, the eyespot can become concave, but not so with single-celled. i think the euglena uses chemical reactions in its cytoplasm to provide communication between eyespot and nucleus, all of it's organelles do. its such a simple mechanism that it doesnt need an optic nerve like in a more advanced eye. it most likely knows to swim where it is light, i assume. do you mean using its energy at night time and storing it when its daytime? decendency connections? what more do you need to outline the evolutionary process? by tracing back a feature to earlier evolutionary stages we can see that selection can advance a feature - not necessarily with the same function, but advance it nonetheless. most people think of selection as predator-prey relationships, but selection doesnt necessarily mean just that. for example, lets say an organism has a basic concave eye, but no real predators. it's still able to find food better than it's cousins who have a simple eyespot. if you mean that we have intermediates but not enough of them, we should have a smooth transition from one to the other, that is incorrect. evolution is not smooth or gradual or constant. similarly, not all organisms are in the same stage of development. for example, humans are just as modern as a gobbie, but a gobbie is most likely in a much early evolutionary stage. a link between tracing and evolution is this; that comparing an organism's feature that is in an early stage of development to a different organism's feature, we can see a general progression from more basic forms (early in evolutionary stage) to a more advanced form (late in evolutionary stage) which hints to us that a process of evolution must have taken place in the later, more advanced forms of that feature. the eye is a great example; we can see the nautilis' eye which is in its earlier stages and quite basic compared to the eye of an octopus, and since the two organisms are very similar, we can conclude that the eye of the octopus evolved from a form very similar to that of the more basic nautilis eye. both nautilis and octopus are part of a classificiation of animals called mollusks, and the mollusks are interesting because within that class contains every stage of eye development. snail will have a more basic eye than the nautilis for example, so it can be concluded that the nautilis' eye developed from the more basic and thus earlier in it's developmental stage, snail eye.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","07:12 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","682"

The first dozen times I was actually pretty worried that I would be made a fool by some piece of evidence, but this I think is about the 50th example and I just skim through them until I find the inevitable facts that show that this occurrence is perfectly consistent with my conclusions. The inevitable fact is that the mutation is usually very small, the 'adaptation' already existed and was being reactivated or slightly modified, or most common something was deleted that broke something that was causing a weakness. Let me share with you the important parts of this article: ""It turns out the fish sport a handy modification to a gene encoding a protein known to regulate the toxic effects of PCBs and related chemicals, called the aryl hydrocarbon receptor2, or AHR2. The fish are missing six base pairs of DNA of the AHR2 gene , and the two amino acids each triplet would code for. PCBs bind poorly to the mutated receptors, apparently blunting the chemicals' effects. The adaptation occurs almost universally in Hudson River tomcod, but crops up only infrequently in two other tomcod populationsin Connecticuts Niantic River and the Shinnecock Bay at Long Islands south shore. The fact that it exists at all in those nearby populations leads the researchers to believe the Hudson Bay tomcod had the mutation at least to a low degree before the PCB onslaught. In a classic case of natural selection, the fish with the mutated genes survived."" So we actually have all three common themes, the mutation was small, it was a deletion, and the adaptation already existed. How many of these will it take to convince me that complex systems can be generated by variation plus natural selection? No amount will be sufficient because they don't show that happening. Again and again the examples are of just the kind of mutations and selections I think are proper to expect based on a rational ToE.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","02:01 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","709"

The problem was and still is that you're assuming arbitrary english language semantics legislate the mapping of genes to function. That is to say, you seem to believe if you can find a way of describing two functions such that they appear conceptually discontinuous, it implies we must expect the genes or gene combinations responsible for those functions to also be widely separated. The classic counterexample we discussed was the bacterial flagellum, wrongly classified as irreducibly complex (and thus immune to construction via cumulative selection) on the grounds that removing any of the parts prevents it functioning as a locomotor. As I'm sure I and others have pointed out before, there is a plausible sequence of intermediate, functional and thus selectable stages of development for the flagellum through the progressive co-option of genes. The fact that the intermediate functions are different is neither here nor there. Your hypothesis that we shouldn't 'expect' such intersections of function gradients is, as I said, based on nothing more than arbitrary conceptual segregation - and must in any case wilt before empirical evidence. Even if intersections of this kind are relatively unusual, it can still be the case that all life is founded upon an exploration of those that do exist.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","09:54 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","711"

I need nor make use of either of these assumptions, I merely observe that there is no logical reason (and therefore no proper assumption) that different functions ought to have similar genes. Therefore it is a fact that co-option is a random chance just as surely and for the same reasons as a mutation is, yet my opponents use it to attempt to circumvent the odds they feel exist in claiming straight unselected mutation. It is entirely a matter of comfort for them that they feel selection events make any given outcome more likely even though as I have explained to them they have merely pushed the unlikelihood to another aspect of the situation so they don't have to look at it. The bacterial flagellum as far as anyone has shown me is one of the few purely IC systems, all systems however contain an IC core. It is immune to any kind of ordered, predictable, explained construction via cumulative selection. That fact is everything, a different standard of selection necessitates a different selective direction except in the case where A = B the paths are the same, assuming such paths exist for no reason and in sufficient quantity (for all systems with a smidgen of complexity) is a work of wishful and supported thinking akin to the first religion. I did not say we cannot expect co-option I said we cannot rely on it to explain the construction of systems, just like if evolution was mutations and that's it we could not expect them to explain the construction of systems. Where is co-options 'natural selection' the concept that makes the sum non-random? Make the case, but also as I said before even if that case was made we would be looking at an explaination of the advancement of life in which it is essentially an inevitable consequence of carbon based life. The answer would then be that in this universe every advancement is a consequence of launching off previous similarly inevitable ones. It would be fundamental observation... like gravity.","Peeling","425128","Then upon what are you basing your assertion that a gene or gene complex that constitutes an IC core in the context of one conceptual function cannot, or should not be expected to be, non-IC in the context of a different conceptual function?

I read a fascinating e-book a while ago in which someone described how, seemingly for all iterative rule-sets above a certain minimum, there existed a minority of starting conditions from which those rules would generate startling complexity. What better explanation can there be than inevitability? Moreso even than that, I feel. When you think about it, the ultimate and indeed only possible satiation of 'why' is the understanding of why things could not be otherwise. I do not present co-option as such a solution - there remains whatever deeper principle ingrains it in everything from bacteria to cutlery - but I do not think its existence can be denied.","Freedom","425161","I don't need to, none of my assertions require that they are thrown out merely that no one has any reason why they should. It is the exact same situation with mutations, I cannot give a reason why a single mutation event could not form a flagellum; I don't need to to say it is unlikely. I can easily make a statistical appeal here, most sequences by far are non-functional. This not only means it is easy to damage functional sequences but it more importantly indicates large distances between functional sequences in the DNA sequence space. That is because you are thinking of applications not functions, Observe: A plane has many functions, it can carry people to both Sweden and detroit. It can bomb or spy. Or does it? A plane functions as a flying vehicle. A true example of multiple functions in a plane would be taxing around on the ground and being therefore a giant car. Now lets look at your examples. What is random about it? Nothing, these things can be used for multiple functions because what they are is essentially the same, that is equivalent to saying their DNA is the same. For a screwdriver vs a knife you would tell a blacksmith to make a flat metal object with a handle. To illustrate why advancement is an objective measurement let's assume we had a screwdriver. A screwdriver is missing something essential in a knife, a blade. Since this screwdriver is a screwdriver and would be selected based on it's function as a screwdriver why would you expect it to get sharper? What is lawful about such an expectation? Present the evidence. For a function. Who says I say they should not exist, but you cannot present them and say ""look they exist so my explaination for why must be correct"". You consider the fact that no one has disproved the idea that a flagellum could arise by random processes proof that it did so. Such is an appeal to ignorance. I have only even been interested in disproving that a non-random process (like rational evolution) explains these systems. I have made the case, but it was a different case than the one against irrational evolution. No path for the flagellum has been found in my opinion, if you think it has you can post the genetic differential and force the admission out of me. That is merely the application of databeds 'million systems' explaination which proposes it is just inevitable that a mutation forms a function. It simply does not match reality. That is an escape from the duty of explaination not an explaination. Further it is an assumption by definition unless you happen to know how many possible biological systems there are. Because it is a variant of the same shape, just like a fluke and a leg are variants of the same limb organs and bones. Why doesn't a car function as a plane? In case you didn't hear I offered to build a software simulation of evolution testing out my conclusions. I offered to do so if someone who opposed my conclusions worked with me on it so as to be satisfied it is proper. Any answer would be speculation.

No. That's a completely unjustified leap. You may as well argue that since only a small proportion of the matter in the solar system is alive, and the solar system is very big, there must be enormous distances between each living organism. This is what I was talking about when I say you keep cherry-picking whatever level of abstraction suits you. What makes the 'difference' of rolling around on the ground vs flying qualitatively different from the 'difference' between dropping bombs and carrying passengers? To drag up a rhetorical question from further down: A car cannot evolve into a plane because limitations on the preservation of functionality restrict the available evolutionary paths. A car must always be able to transport human occupants, drive on roads etc etc. It is not free to evolve ever smaller and lighter (not in blind pursuit of flight, but of some other benefit) to the point where surface area vs mass starts to make falls survivable and gliding feasible (whereupon we can imagine evolution modifying the wing-mirrors to extend gliding times and the exhaust so as to provide propulsion). But that's just it: a protein transcribed from DNA is every bit as workaday and physical as a screwdriver or a hammer. They aren't abstract 'codes' or 'words'; they physically turn chemical screws and bang on chemical nails. As an incurable DIY enthusiast I can personally assure you that if all you have to cut something with is a screwdriver, you'll make do. I've buttered toast with a screwdriver. Look at what you're saying here: No. You cannot invent an arbitrary category of 'thing' and then assert objects that fit that category are only and ever subject to selection based on that category's imagined function. That's nonsense. If a sharper blade on the screwdriver would help in any way, such a modification can be selected for. The same goes for a heavier, flatter-ended handle (helping to hammer nails in - and again I can personally vouch for the efficacy of a nice heavy screwdriver in that regard). Not at all. I appeal to the fact that a series of entirely plausible intermediate systems has been presented, explaining the gradual evolution of the flagellum through progressive co-option. Before I go digging around, are you saying 'in your opinion' because the path involves changes in function? Not at all. You have assured me you do not believe co-option to be impossible, merely rare and unlikely. Presumably very rare, although you cannot support this claim. Very well. Consider the flagellum again. If you're right, and opportunities for co-option are so rare that, out of all possible biological systems, only a tiny minority could ever be realised through co-option, the discovery of such a path for the flagellum would be hugely significant, yes? Because if nature didn't depend on co-option for the evolution of its systems, it would be impossibly unlikely that any given system would, purely through chance , present itself as amenable to gradual development.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","07:47 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","719"

So I may as well argue that if you move X distance in a radius of living organism and the vast majority of the random vectors end in non-living matter the organisms are far apart, and I would. I am sorry that you cannot see the pattern, the cherry is the most generic description of function a structure can have. A structure can have more than one of those but it is quite impossible to have variants fail to meet it's most basic defining functions so it happens that no actual co-opting exists between them since the function already exists for all. Why is the need to carry humans to where they are going so fundamentally different from the kind of selection pressures real systems would experience? So for reasons which must be admitted are totally irrelevant to flight, which can never be demonstrated to have any relationship except coincidental similarity the car gains all the necessary elements for flight and thereby a novel system is evolved. What about this, one car's offspring is an ultra light. Impossible or just unlikely, and heres the biggie, is that evolution? That does not mean every system is merely variant shapes of each other, as you would have to admit if you looked at some. Sure I can, and I will tell you why. The category of thing is not arbitrary nor are their functions imagined. It will never be selected on a function that it is not performing, that is not arbitrary it is simple extension of the law of cause and effect projected onto the concept of natural selection. Sure, but since the object is a screwdriver that means a sharper edge is making it a better screwdriver. If it is now cutting it has changed or added a function has it not, and is it not now being selected based on it's function as a knife? It is then being selected by the standard of it's function as a hammer which makes it a hammer. What purpose do these intermediate systems [of the flagellum] serve in the explaination? No guided path can bridge a change in function, You misunderstand, co-option is purely through chance until someone of us comes up for a theory why it should be any particular way or in any pattern. By the nature of DNA mathematically the calculation of the odds for co-option and the odds for a mutation performing the same function are equivalent. Without that fact I could hardly keep arguing.","Peeling","425302","Why on earth would you think I'm forgetting that? No, you're still missing the point. You've said that since the majority of DNA sequences are non-functional, functional DNA sequences must be assumed to be widely separated. But we know this not to be the case.

How can you justify your assumption that this continuity is, or should be expected to be, compartmentalised in a way that suits your argument? Then I cherry pick ""aids survival and reproduction"" as the most generic possible description of any biological structure or system's function, and thus remove any obstacle to co-option. Too simplistic. Imagine functions A, B and C, and a structure that strongly satisfies the requirements of A and weakly those of B. If satisfying B becomes strongly selected for, the structure can, through improvements to its B function, acquire slight C functionality, which can then in turn be selected for. My earlier example illustrates this: a hammer is no use whatsoever as a screwdriver, but can eventually evolve into one via intermediate steps. It isn't; that's the point. Cars can't gradually evolve into planes - not because acquiring a new function by gradual steps is impossible, as you insist, but because the gradual steps by which it would be possible are being strongly selected against by the aforementioned need to carry humans. No; that's a distortion of what I wrote. I said that the car could evolve to be smaller and lighter. Mass decreasing by the cube, area by the square; it's why mice can survive a fall that would kill us outright, and it's why mice (or something similar) could evolve flight and elephants could not. What's impossible or unlikely about a mammal evolving to be smaller and lighter, and thus becoming susceptible to selection for improved falling, gliding and eventually flying performance? Not direct variants, certainly. But I can't help remembering my Theory of Computability, and how no computer, physical or electrical, possesses any more utility than a Turing machine, though it may certainly possess less. I suspect the same argument could extend to physical function. All a biological system has to do to be selected is 'aid survival and reproduction'. We can have a stab at understanding how it aids survival and reproduction but we will almost certainly miss some nuance, and our categorisation will therefore be in error. Hence, arbitrary. I've never tried to argue otherwise. You're so close, but no. In being selected as a screwdriver it inevitably acquires a minor secondary ability to cut - and hammer, and all kinds of other misuses. If these minor abilities prove beneficial, modifications favouring them will be selected - providing the benefit outweighs any coincident loss of 'screwdriver-ness'. I think it would be very hard indeed to argue that improvement in function ever - let alone usually - leads to the elimination of all potential secondary or tertiary uses.

You seem to have misunderstood my comment about DNA for what of your baseless assertions about sequences I could only assume exist. I am saying that since the majority of mutations are neutral and negative we know that the systems of life are isolated in the gene space. There are no if ands or buts about it, if they were truly clustered as you hope they are mutations would oft as not fall upon another function or system. You are asking us to believe that this is inded the case but we simply can't observe it. You are asking us to believe in the most unlikley patterns that could exist, singular strings connecting different functions which are too small to be noticed in all the mutations we have ever observed but real enough for co-option to explain advancement, not only this but these strings connect every known function since it is your replacement for evolutionary theory. Simply making generalizations about observations is all I have done, it is that wishful thinking above which requires support. Lol, nice try but again biology is against you. Many things can aid survival and reproduction. They all do it in various ways though, it is that very reason why selection pressure is always based on the system in quesiton and how it is benefiting the organism. The how is the function not the do. To illustrate the absurdity of your claim, does a flagellum have co-option with extra cellular nerve ending complexes? They both aid in survival and reproduction. It of course would be the same sort of magic to say that a flagellum modification generates nerve endings in a non-random manner as the rest but since you walked right into most obvious and extreame case of the fallacy I will let you see what you can do. Why would improving B form C functionality? It is the inability to answer that question with anything more than 'just because' that neccesitates my conclusion that this is no more an explaination for life than a 'just because' in the case of mutation. Impossible as a result of a process, not impossible as an unpredictable chance. Answer the question please. Obviously, and just as obviously it needs to in some way do this. That is the function. We know many functions, that aside our inability to categorize them all means absolutely nothing to the fact that they must exist to aid in survival and reproduction by definition. Why in the world would you think the idea that everything or anything has only one use is a premise to any of my arguments? It is helpful to a proper analysis, I am glad to see you thinking of it correctly, i.e. as directions which mutations move a system. Do they? Let's take a chess board, there is one particular set of peice locations that happens to be desired. From the starting positions it takes 114 moves to reach this position. A young chess player comes and insists he can do it in 4. They ask him how, he answers that he will start with a board that only requires four moves. Then they break the news to him, they aren't going to tell him what the desired peice-locations are, but there are some other peice locations that are helpful although they will not tell him if any of these have a relationship with the desired arangement. What use are the helpful sets then he asks? Oh well normally you would have to start from the standard setup, but once you find a helpful set you may start from there in a new round. Do you think his odds of finding the desired set are any higher? Think about this before you answer, do you know where the helpful sets are compared to the desired one? For all you know they could be farther away than the starting positions. The point, MY POINT is that you just don't know and so you can't claim to explain the discovery of the desired set as anything but dumb luck, no matter how many helpful sets you set up. Yes the genetic differential between an intermediate and a proposed novel function could be less, that is a chance which as of right now you can't predict just like it is a chance that a mutation would render that advantage pointless. The source material for either calculation is the same. Just biology for now I don't rely on any system only having one function, but I do rely on the fact that any system which has the function may be ruled out from the list of canidates to be used in any explaination of the formation of the function. I was merely pointing out that trying to posit examples in which co-option is meant to be supported by having a system not change functions but emphazie one or the other, or otherwise modify a function that already exists is self-defeating. Of course not, but no one is claiming to explain where gravity comes from, and if they tried to do so with an appeal to odds then that I would 'cry chance'. I see, so in the absence of a theory we are too assume these things are not by chance as would be any sane persons first impulse but by unknown laws which escape us but may still be relied upon.

What is claimed to be going on is the spontaneous, unexplained, totally random drunkard walk accident that a sequence is stumbled upon that is capable of performing a novel function. Developed is not the word for this, popped into existance or spontaneous generation is. It has nothing to do with selection or explaination, if I were to write a book about it the first page would read ""Variation exists, all functionality comes from the chance that a variation might function"". Now don't say something idiotic like ""yea that is what evolution is"", if that is what evolution is then why is it that whenever any of the 'traditional' IC advocates start talking about the odds immediately as if it should matter natural selection is thrown into their face. 1. There are those who think the type III secretory system evolved from a flagellum, any comments on that? 2. You see it easily? could you give some measurements in genetic differential to back up that gut insticnt? You misunderstand the problem if you think IC prevents development because the 'old' function might be still useful. The IC analysis which I have refined to my guided genetic change test makes it very clear that it doesn't matter a XXXX what the sequence was before. It could be a vestigial useless piece of junk DNA or the crux of the organism, the only difference is the possibility that function can be increased due to similarity with final is if the current is performing the same function. Now what you say is true, if selective pressures are strong keeping a sequence a certain way that would stop it's evolution but that is another layer and certainly not why novelty is a problem. If you insist on invoking co-option for an existing useful function you will have to throw in the random generation of differentiation systems (to build a flagellum one place and a secretory system in another), but compared to the actual fairy dust of the advancement itself that is small change. How optimistic!

"03-10-2011","12023",50,"Peeling","425400","I don't know why you think you can change my argument to suit yourself. I surmise that functional genes are sufficiently clustered as to explain the existence of life in its current forms, no more, no less. Functional gradients are not single strings If fitness gradients in gene space were arranged by chance, it would be impossible to locate them via any means other than a brute-force search of gene space. I neither expect nor require mutations to 'as oft as not' fall upon another function or system. Functional gradients are not single strings, and individual mutations are often observed to affect multiple aspects of an organism, proving beyond doubt the reality of co-option. And again, I remind you that to describe something as 'unlikely' you must be able to demonstrate the extent to which the phenomenon is subject to chance. Since you do not seem to be advocating any kind of infinite universe/multiverse explanation for the existence of life, it follows you are (at least unconsciously) assuming some lawful pattern to their arrangement permitting shortcuts to their discovery. So, given that we both require some unknown law to arrange gene-space to suit our hypotheses, you may want to reconsider your implication that this implies insanity. Connect or bring within plausible reach, yes. Nor is this a 'replacement' for evolutionary theory, any more than the supposition that the gene-function mapping preserves homologies 'replaces' evolutionary theory. It is merely a prerequisite; context - just as the details of carbon-based chemistry are part of the context - within which evolution is possible. I'm playing by your explicit rules here. You stated that your categorisation of selectable function was not arbitrary, but was the most general possible description of what a biological system achieved. That is, without exception or question: ""Aids survival/reproduction[/i]."" If you wish to disagree, then you must either show how a system which does not aid survival or reproduction may be consistently selected for, or give a still more generic description of functionality. You're starting to trip yourself up. In your discussion with Benedict, you insist that it is not the specific ways in which a system actually helps an organism that define its function, but what it is in capable of, regardless of whether that functionality is leveraged. Earlier you cherry-picked 'flying vehicle' as the most generic description for a plane, because you have (for some reason) decided that flight constitutes a 'new function' which is not allowed to evolve stepwise (although you have been very quiet on the subject of small ground-based mammals gradually improving their ability to leap and glide through adaptations to their limbs and skin). But why not 'vehicle'? Vehicles of many kinds can take you all over the world, helping in exactly the same way as planes. Perhaps not to the same degree or with the same level of convenience, but degree doesn't constitute a change in function, right? Not directly, to my knowledge. You recall the screwdriver/knife/spoon/hammer analogy from before? Not all functions need directly support co-option for them to be ultimately linkable. It's hard to answer that question when it's unclear what, to you, constitutes the 'forming' of C functionality. For instance, take a mammal evolving smaller and lighter (in the pursuit of some ecological niche) such that its surface area becomes capable of significantly slowing its fall. Does this constitute the formation of new functionality (gliding, the prelude to flight), or would you say that, since the surface area of a creature always provides air resistance, it 'always' possessed that functionality, albeit in a quantity too small and too swamped by other selection factors to itself be selectable? My question was my answer. You keep going on about how unlikely this all is, yet you refuse to provide a single example where co-option is impossible - or even unlikely. Thus I ask again: if your objection to co-option is that it's unlikely , how unlikely do you think it is for (say) mammals to evolve smaller in pursuit of an ecological niche, and thus encounter an opportunity to evolve flight? Because you keep saying co-option is unlikely. =Peeling;425400We might as well stop there. By specifying a single goal at the outset you invalidate the analogy. In evolutionary theory the flagellum was not an 'ultimate goal'. It's merely something which turned out to be possible to reach. You call that 'chance'; I have already explained why that cannot be the case regardless of how you believe the flagellum came to pass. 1. A chance arrangement of functional gradients is not navigable by anything other than a brute force search. 2. The more rare you insist instances of co-option must be, the more profoundly significant empirical examples of sequential evolutionary function changes such as the flagellum becomes, since if nature did not have to rely upon co-option to form novel systems we would never expect to see a false positive by chance .","Freedom","425566","Sorry for the long response time. I too will do some rearranging. On what evidence? That life exists? I see some contradiction on the fitness landscape here, if you neither expect nor require mutations to 'as oft as not' fall upon another function or system and thereby accept that the ratio we observe is more or less correct you are forced to admit not only that the vast majority of sequences are non-functional but also that the vast majority of known functional sequences are isolated in most directions from other systems. In the fitness landscape this along with the assumption of co-option allows only one class of terrain, a web of well strings. These strings may be far wider than just one sequence at a time but they would be strings. I do not assume that gradients themselves have no pattern, I have said explicitly before that I think it is eminently predictable that slight modifications of an existing system would most likely produce a variant system, this is not a rule there are obviously exceptions but it can still be assumed. In the fitness landscape that is like saying that (lets just take higher to mean greater fitness) we can count on functions being more or less hill shaped. The fact that mutations most often are neutral or negative means that we are not dealing with a giant mountain in which it's always up up up. Neutral means no change in height, i.e. a plateau. Negative means a loss in height, i.e. a valley. Co-option means that functions are connected by fitness gradients, so then we are talking about ridges in which the local path is high fitness but also the direction along the ridge is steep enough to move the sequence to another function. Your assumptions and accepted facts are working together to give you a pretty clear picture of the general geology of your fitness landscape and it does have 'strings'. While we are talking about this my point about co-option is that unlike the hills you are claiming that we have mountain ranges (i.e. a specific placement of functional gradients) but with no justification. Correlation of structure is fully accounted for in the fitness landscape as you would simply me observing valleys or heights that are the result of multiple structures. As I have said before co-option is at least as unlikely as equivalent mutation. That is not a specific number because the odds would change from system to system. Odds of mutation = 1/4^difference Odds of perfect co-option = 1/4^sequence length Difference < sequence length Therefore odds of mutation are always > odds of perfect co-option. Clearly imperfect co-option + odds of mutation = odds of perfect co-option as every degree (base pair) of imperfection in co-option is the same degree increase in differential. Clearly this assumes that the odds of co-option = 1/4^sequence length, that is a purely random view of the distribution of functions. How am I unconsciously assuming some lawful pattern? If I am does that exempt my point that no one has found one from validity? and finally what hypothesis are you talking about? My hypothesis is that evolution doesn't explain what people claim it explains. It is not just a prerequisite, if co-option is as you think of it, the traditional evolutionary mechanism is just a train that creeps along tracks of co-option. Still a factor of course but not the source of the so called 'information'. Theistic evolution supporters would just love this idea because it would mean that the 'information' for life was 'coded' into the universe. All of that is irrelevant at this point however because I am merely talking about the notion that the evolutionary mechanism (mutation + natural selection) is responsible for the advancement of life. If you manage to (I don't think you will) set up patterns of co-option as the explanation I will consider that a new theory or at least a substantial expansion of the theory. Alright, I am sorry if this seems like mincing words but I really did rely on such shades of meaning when in my original quote. I did not say the most general description of of what a biological systems achieves, you made that up. I said the most general description possible of a function. You are talking about the purpose of a structure, and in life it either aids in survival or is vestigial. A function in engineering and biology has a specific meaning, it is a process with an aim (to aid in survival) but the actual function part is the process which implies two things, what is done and how it is done. What is done need not be the ultimate purpose of the function and in life it cannot be, there is no structure that directly 'aids in survival' they all happen to do specific things that contribute to survival. It would by si-fi to imagine a system that generated some mystical life force. I would like to note that it is partially my fault if you misunderstood because my own example did a poor job illustrating this because obviously 'a flying vehicle' is not the function of a airplane; it's definition is: a heavier-than-air aircraft kept aloft by the upward thrust exerted by the passing air on its fixed wings and driven by propellers, jet propulsion, etc. The function is the what is done as well as how it is done, a plane is not a helicopter nor a airship. Furthermore this is in fact not the most general description of the function possible, because this still leaves the propulsion system undefined, a plane that has the propulsion of a propeller is not just another shape of a plane with a jet propulsion system. So another way you might define the difference between functions is that a function may have many variants but they are all just shapes of each other (I call these applications nowadays). A different function however, regardless of whether it happens to do the same thing must at least do so in a different way. Now I don't know how much of this thread you have read but the above including the comments about 'most general' are post hoc english extrapolations of the concept. In my guided mutation test the word 'function' doesn't even appear. The important part in that test is 'whether a mutation is selected due to similarity in the final'. Conceptually that is only possible because of converging on a biological function so that is why there is all this blabing about what functions are, if however you are going to get so precise with the wording I would just refer you to the definition that a function is a set of sequences with the same selection pressures (direction not magnitude). i.e. you can tell if you have left the function if the selective pressure being experienced is no longer based on how the structure used to aid in survival whether positive or negative. How is it possible that a function does not have co-option with itself? I am not sure what that means If satisfying B becomes strongly selected for, the structure can, through improvements to its B function, acquire slight C functionality The 'acquire C functionality' would be the formation, degree is important only if it is too slight to experienced selection and that is not an assumption that can really be made in general. It's always possessed air resistance that is true, however the smaller and lighter selective force has nothing to do with that (I assume); in the guided mutation test it would fail the 'selected for similarity with B' so regardless of whether the function could be said to exist or not it would not being selected so it could not be guided. i.e. it is a coincidence that being smaller and lighter has brought the creature closer to flight. The formation of a new function would be before the moment when the first selection occurs due to the ability to glide by definition, however that selection is the proof that the function does exist. So the creature always possessed air resistance but not always the ability to glide. The ability to glide is formed when the creature doesn't just fall slow, when it actually travels distance, and the proof that this function exists to evolution is when it can select for it. I hope you can see the difference between this and the hypothetical cases that bennedict brought, in which the function already existed and merely became more useful (therefore selectively emphasized) due to some environmental shift. That would be in this example that the mammal could already glide but for some reason it was more important to run quietly until it migrated to somewhere with tons of trees or cliffs. i.e. just because the function is not being used does not mean it does not exist, however the inability to select for the function despite it's potential usefulness is proof that it does not exist yet. Is it impossible or just unlikely that a mammal to have an offspring which has gained the use of flight which it's parents did not have? Ah but for that I only need to assume forward connections are unlikely not backward connections. I think most systems preserve old functions to some degree easily, that does not mean that the old functions have anywhere near sufficient sequence homology with the new ones. For instance (I don't remember who gave this example) someone on this forum came up with the example of QWERTY key arrangement on a keyboard and a type writer, noting that a keyboard has preserved the 'functionality' of QWERTY is easy, it is like saying that a section of the DNA for a keyboard codes for the QWERTY system; that in no way however proves that any amount of finagling with a type writer will produce a computer system. This is a very important part of the claimed co-option method of generation referred conveniently as 'association' in which control systems gene expression and luck all combine to allow elements from all over organisms to combine to form a new function, this is the height of the unlikeliness I am talking about. By specifying a single goal I am reflecting that the flagellum or the piece setup is claimed to have evolve, it is perfectly legitimate in every way. If you want to consider every system and not just one that is fine, but then we will consider the odds of producing every system in life and not just one. How are you going to do that besides breaking it into individual chances? and so? So you are saying that the more rare I insist co-option is the more important it is that you find examples of it because we would not expect examples to exist? You realize that it is precisely the failure to predict the phenomenon that is the basis for my dismissal of the concept right?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","04:10 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","738"

The fact it took eons for that intelligence to develop through evolution is irrelevant since God is timeless. To deny the scientific facts is to deny use of the gifts God gave us, namely our intelligence and the truth as shown by scientific evidence. Frankly, I think Creationists are either stupid or unwitting pawns of the Devil since denying God's gifts and the truth is wrong.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","07:02 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","739"

I advise you to steer away from an information theory perspective. There is much information reflected by natural selection, most of it temporary shifts in environment. A genome could in a very real sense gain gigabytes of data that has nothing to do with any real advance in biological systems. That is not true, a direct observation is not required to make conclusions about something. All history, archeology, paleontology, geology; and even network news agencies would be on unsure footing if conclusions could not be made indirectly. When you read an ancient wall with a dead language you are not observing some ancient event which it records, you are concluding that it is unlikely they made it up. It requires no more faith to believe that something happened when you were not there to see it than it does to believe that the moon is round though all you ever see is a partially shaded disk. Define a true transitional fossil and you will see that the term is inapplicable or most certainly has been found. Evolutionary theory holds that there will be millions of transitional forms, at least one for every selected mutation. How many of those selected mutations do you need to find before you consider it a complete transitional record? Which one? That calculation doesn't seem to follow. If the 20 is meant to be the sequence length it should be a dimensional increase (an exponent). The number of basepairs in the strand determine the number of different combinations that could be had for a sequence that length. If on the other hand 20 is to represent the different types of amino-acids, is 300 meant to mean the length of the polypeptide? If so you must realize that that is not nearly the smallest they can be. I don't think treating the odds in terms of amino acids is a good idea anyway. It assumes mutations happen in the form of codon shifts and they don't need to. I think it generally muddies up the concept. For instance if a sequence was 6 base pairs (2 codons) not including control sections the odds of any given sequence of base pairs is 1/4^6, the odds of any given sequence of codons (aminoacids) is 1/20^2. That is 400 possibilities (codon analysis) vs 4096 possibilities (base pair analysis). Can't you see that the vast difference in possibilities? This is because four values in groups of three can have 64 permutations while 20 in groups of one can only have 20. ""But freedom pretty much all of the 64 codons specify a amino-acid so shouldn't it balance out with the AA view?"" No it shouldn't, because insertions and replacements disrupt the codon pattern. It can change the amino acids until the next intron. In other words the base pair permutation does matter. A strand of DNA doesn't require any proteins but the ones that copy and read it. How can you give a single number for a 'strand' as if it was a standard unit? If they are transitional fossils, they are genetic deformities from their ancestors. What makes you think complete DNA can be extracted from fossils? What are you talking about? There is no only one try, a fatal mutation effects only one organism. I see now what they mean when they say 'why' is not the question. While I asked 'why' to unjustifiably assumed and arbitrary patterns... you ask 'why' to natural selection and mutation. Mutation doesn't answer to why. Natural selection will answer to any benefit whether we think it was needed or not. No, we don't have the same mutations. If evolution was operating on humans as we understand it the people with the favourable mutations will have more kids than those without. Eventually those genes would be prevalent. So the entire species would 'evolve' at one rate. You must realize of course that mutations that are inheritable occur when your organism is constructed, at any other point it would exist in but one cell and have no chance of representing your DNA in the form of gametes. You omit reason. You ask a real scientist, a good scientist and they will not use themselves as the authority for their proclamations. They will say the 'evidence'. It is not truly the evidence alone that they invoke as authority but the premise that through reason there is but one conclusion. That is given the evidence logic has dictated something. (Note when someone can prove something with just logic and no more evidence than a chalk board and notation) If the choice was between reason and an infallible god, I would answer that it matters little which you trust because they must agree. Reason is the essence of truth, the axiom of all facts and before it even the premise of an infallible god must melt away when confronted with contradiction. Yet the choice is not as you presented it even if updated with reason instead of a scientist authority. God is not speaking to me nor to anyone I know about, nor has the claims that god has spoken to them been supported by anyone that has ever existed (to our knowledge). The god you would cite as authority has not the presence of authority to match a meek undergrad doing research in their basement. The bible is no more proof of god than the iliad is proof of Zeus. You have one, and I pray you recognize it for what it is; because you have just made yourself a lighting pole for personal assault by more than a few and you won't get much better.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","01:19 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","755"

Some say that when two entities can't reproduce, they are different species, but as far as taxonomy goes, that isn't the case (like horses and zebras, as Freedom said). When there are observable differences in physiology, they are retaxonomized if needed and viewed as different species. There have been a few cases where a change in physiology or behaviour has been seen in one lifetime, like with the Anolis lizards. When enough change (or microevolution) happens in which the species has distinguishable differences to it's ancestor, it's concluded that macroevolution has happened. It's a pet peeve of mine to hear people say ""I believe in microevolution, but not macroevolution"".

Worker bees are more closely related to their sisters than to their mothers. Among the numerous side effects of this is that suicidal defense of the hive can be advantageous: doing so allows them to help their sisters survive. At the very least, so long as there's not a selective disadvantage -- and again, those unusual genetics are at play -- the feature can persist even if it's not advantageous. It's also good to remember that just because an adaptation could be selectively advantageous, this doesn't mean it will evolve. Sometimes, creatures fail to adapt, and their species is driven to extinction. Did it occur to you that the plumage is an indicator of ""size, strength,"" or general fitness? As Amotz Zahavi has put it in his formulation of the ""handicap principle,"" the extravagant signal does make males more vulnerable -- but those who are fit enough to make desirable mates are able to survive despite their plumage. Those are the individuals that females want to mate with. Additionally, there is evidence that plumage qualities may indicate capacity to resist parasites and pathogens. Mangy peacocks don't do well with the peahens. No according to evolution, adaptations come about through a combination of variation and natural selection . Variations includes mutations, and they're random in the sense that it they're not necessarily advantageous to the individuals that possess them. If such random variation were all that evolution involved, adaptation would never happen. But natural selection is not a random process . What Darwin first explained (along with Wallace, really), and what subsequent research has shown time and again, is that the non-random survival and reproduction of random variants is quite enough to explain the diversification of life over time. Note further that the science of evolution does not claim that intelligence is not involved with the process. It just does not claim that intelligence is involved with the process, either. What the evidence supports is the process itself. It doesn't support any metaphysical claims about whether the process is or isn't the product of a designer's intentions. Theism and atheism can both be consistent with evolution. In sum, I would suggest that you have misunderstood evolution on a number of fronts. You don't seem to understand what evolution actually says, either in terms of general principles or specific problems. You don't seem familiar with evidence in favor of it, insofar as you emptily declare that it all amounts to nothing without specific references to experiments or their failings. And you don't seem to have considered the relationship of evolution to religion in much depth at all.

The bee sting, the bee's self defense tool for survival, but it comes at a cost, as a result the bee stinger is pulled out of the body,and the bee eventually dies because the muscles are pulled out. Why would evolution produce a self defense tool that kills the animal. Hornets, wasps and yellow jackets all have stings, but their stings don't get pulled out. Why would the bee not evolve to make the necessary changes for survival? Also,the peacock, why would evolution produce something that requires six foot tail feathers to mate? Really, those things are like giant target signs for predators. Most birds mate based on size, strength, or talons. The peacocks survival rate is not very high, so why not evolve so it can have a better survival rate? You know all those experiments that supposedly ""supported"" evolution. They did absolutely nothing! Because, according to evolution their is no intelligence guiding it, its just random genetic mutations. Those experiments had an intelligent design to them (humans,computers). If anything, they proved that an intelligent designer was required for life to exist!","Stonewall","432257","The bees that sting are sterile. It is more beneficial to the drone bees' genes to die protecting its relatives (sister bees, etc.) than to continue living itself. Social insects are very interesting... It's sexual selection, first of all. Maybe originally a larger tail was a sign of verility or something, and since the hens would choose the one with the longer tail, this trait spread and the tails got bigger... But aside from that, the tail also gives the appearance of a bigger animal when spread, and has what looks like eyes all over it that would scare off some predators. A better question would be this: How would a trait that hurts an animal's survival chances be evidence that God created it? Wouldn't he make an animal that was perfectly suited for its environment? Mutations are filtered by natural selection, which is not random.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","02:34 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","806"

And those interpreters simply have no idea what they're talking about when the topic is science. They seem to, but only if one doesn't look at what non-creationist scientists actually say.

"06-17-2011","12023",54,"Gen1:1-31","430362","I agree with micro-evolution (adaptation). I do not agree with macro-evolution (the change from one species to another, or more plainly put, the adding of information). However information can be subtracted ex: wolf (canine) domesticated to dog (canine). This is not a debate of science vs religion. This is the debate of the science of one religion vs the science of another religion. Religion by definition is a cause, principle or belief held to with faith or ardor. Science by definition is knowledge attained through study or practice. Because ""macro-evolution"" takes so much time according to evolutionists, and because you cannot observe the past and only the present, you cannot observe ""macro-evolution"" and thus it requires just as much faith as any other religion. No true transitional fossils have been found. And before you people go and use that dinosaur bird against me that is exactly what it is, a dinosaur bird. It is a dinosaur with bird feathers nothing more, nothing less. Continuing with transitional fossils, the odds of a single protein, the most basic unit of life, forming by chance is 1/20^300. That is just a single protein, and a single DNA strand requires thousands. The odds of a new DNA strand forming by chance is 1/10^400,000. Now let me ask you, in all the ""transitional fossils"" we have found they are all perfect, to say, no consistent genetic deformities. How could something with the odds of 1/10^400,000 form on the first and every try? You answer that. Why evolve skeletons? According to evolutionary scientists we started out with exoskeletons similar to insects. Insects are still around and are thriving, so why ""evolve"" something you don't need? Oh and if we are ""evolving"" then every human is ""evolving"" at the same pace with the same mutations, the odds of that are impossible. What is your ultimate authority? A group scientists that are biased, mortal, non-omniscience and fallible, or a supreme being that is unbiased, eternal, omniscience, and infallible aka God of the bible.","Matthew","432477","There is no difference. Speciation comes about as different members of the same species adapt to different environmental conditions. As long as gene flow continues across the entire group, there will simply be different varieties of the same species. If one part of the group becomes isolated from the rest, the remaining two groups will evolve independently. If their isolation ends, they may have evolved beyond the ability to continue inter-breeding even though they're together again. Voila: two species. In short, if you accept micro-evolution (as you say), and if you accept that environments change across space and time (which I would hope is pretty obvious), then macro-evolution is to be expected. First, information can in fact be increased via evolution, through any number of ways (gene duplication, e.g.). Creationists using information theory don't understand what they're talking about. Bill Dembski has suckered a whole lot of people. Second, why does a dog contain less information than a wolf? It seems rather arbitrary to claim so without presenting evidence of there respective genomes. No, it's a debate between pseudo-science offered by partisans of one form of religion, and real science that is independent of any religious faith. This is far too broad. By this definition, political parties are religions. So are the professional ethical codes held by doctors or lawyers. Metaphorically, okay. But as a literal definition of religion, this is poor. Again, far too broad. In the ancient world, when the entire term ""science"" was used differently, okay. But not in the modern world. Science involves searching for natural explanations for natural phenomena, and requires empirical evidence. By your definition, a Shakespeare scholar is a scientist. And that's ridiculous. Defining religion and science in these incredibly broad ways serves a rhetorical purpose for creationists. Unlike most definitions, they make the terms less clear, rather than more. But therein lies their rhetorical utility, of course. There is no requirement of direct observation for knowledge. Note that all of history would be invalidated by what you here claim. So would forensics. It's not a matter of faith, but of inference. Big difference. I find it very ironic, by the way, that creationists simultaneously claim that their position is true, while adopting cognitive relativism in defense of it. So why would dinosaurs have feathers? Come on. This ""no transitional fossils"" mantra is absolutely absurd. There are lots of transitional fossils, for birds, for humans, for more. With all due respect, DNA is not made of protein. Regardless, it's also worth noting that no one claims proteins form by chance. The natural selection under which proteins evolve is not a chance process. What is a ""consistent genetic deformity?"" It's hard to figure out what you're even demanding here. Or why you're demanding it. Why do you think evolutionists claim such complexity happened spontaneously? No evolutionist has ever claimed that nature moved from random chemicals to an organized protein in a single step. Evolution has been going on for billions of years. It isn't starting from scratch, and it isn't making such huge leaps. But its effects are cumulative. All these arguments from vanishingly small probabilities are deeply flawed. Nonetheless, creationists keep using them, to sucker people who don't know evolution well enough to spot the straw man. Deliberate use of such a fallacy is, quite frankly, dishonest. Don't fall for it. Our lineage evolved from invertebrates, it's true. But we did not evolve from insects or any other arthropod. The split between insects and their kin (including most other invertebrates) and vertebrates and their kin (including us humans) is very ancient. In fact, based on developmental evidence we appear more closely related to echinoderms such as starfish! And interestingly, echinoderms have an endoskeleton, as we do. The earliest chordates (which include us vertebrates) appear to be wormlike creatures possessed of a notochord, a primitive internal backbone (e.g. Haikouella or Haikouichthys). At no stage does it seem we possessed exoskeletons such as those of insects. We are still evolving as a species. This does not mean that every individual comes to possess the same mutations. Again, you don't seem to understand how evolution works. Except that your authority on these matters is not God but creationists and their interpretations of the Bible and God's will. And they are as fallible as any other mortal, plus more dishonest than most. I repeat: Don't fall for it. Start looking at evolution for yourself, rather than through the lens of what creationists say about it. You'll soon realize, creationists don't represent evolution accurately at all.

The debate is over, and in my judgment, IC fails completely. For what it's worth, anyone who wants a really good example of why should read Sean B. Carroll's The Making of the Fittest , or Jerry Coyne's Why Evolution Is True . The odds are not nearly as long as people think, and once population sizes, generation times, and available time are accounted for, the odds are actually on the side of mutations producing selectively advantageous features in the long run.

"06-20-2011","12023",55,"Freedom","432515","Matthew what experiments or models were used in the books you mention? If they are merely arguments for random chance... What's my problem then? I have identified it by defining two terms, rational and irrational evolution. Rational evolution is the processes we know about (RM+NS) and anything it can produce by the laws and patterns we can verify and understand. Irrational evolution in a pseudo-magical entity that is treated almost as an intelligent designer itself, it contains the idea of NS and RM but doesn't limit it's claims to it's means. It can accomplish anything based on whether NS would select for that thing not based on whether RM+NS could assemble it. You have no idea how many times I have heard 'but if X does show up NS will select it, therefore it was evolved'. It blurs the difference between theory and fact, observation and explanation; since it claims to explain life and common descent, these fact of life is supposed to mean it itself is a fact. I claim that irrational evolution is impossible, not unlikely; impossible. It is scientific embarrassment and a mess. That is what IC blocks not the odds themselves, it is saying the odds as they first appear are unmitigated by an ordered process lie NS. Given how consistently this is the case... ...you can surely understand why Behe & friends think they have found a problem with evolutionary theory. If people had said 'oh yea we understand that' to his IC analysis he wouldn't have written a book I'm sure.","Matthew","432735","Any number of experiments, from the ongoing Lenski experiment at Michigan State to experiments about the evolution of ultraviolet vision in birds. As for the model... They are not arguments for random chance. They do presume -- indeed, explain -- what is meant by calling mutation ""random."" Coyne actually suggests that ""indifferent"" would be a much better way of describing mutations, i.e., they occur indifferent to the needs of the organism in which they occur: they might help, they might hurt, they might do nothing, but they occur regardless of their consequences. No, the model being defended is that populations evolve -- not that individuals mutate, but that populations evolve -- thanks to the combined impact of random mutation AND natural selection. Let me jump ahead in your post a moment: Which is to say, the books above are using what you call rational evolution as their model. They are including both random mutation and natural selection as parts of the model. What I still don't understand is (a) who has ever argued that random mutation without natural selection is evolution, or (b) who has ever argued that there can be natural selection on something that hasn't already come to be through variation ultimately derived from random mutation, or (c) who has ever claimed that because something could have happened according to mutational and selective steps x and y and z, it did happen according to mutational and selective steps x and y and z. I have simply never seen anyone claim (a) or (b). The standard model is and always has been that both random mutation and natural selection are necessary for evolution, at least insofar as evolution is a matter of adaptation. And while I have seen claims about (c), every author I've ever seen do this in the popular literature points out that such-and-such is a hypothesis, possibly even a highly speculative one at present. They are trying to provide plausible reconstructions of how this or that phenomenon evolved. So what they do is try to figure out what sorts of mutations and selective conditions would do it. That mutations and selection could do it, however, is something for which they argue only against those who think that they couldn't, e.g. Behe. All in all, I don't see the distinction between RE and IE, as you're trying to make it, because I have no idea who has ever argued for IE. Evolutionists are all claiming that both random mutation and natural selection, together , are what produce evolutionary change in populations over time. So while I appreciate that you aren't doing so deliberately with any sort of malicious intent, I think you've constructed a straw man. Back to the earlier part of the post: But as near as I can tell, everyone is saying this! Random mutation alone is just random mutation, not evolution. Natural selection alone is just natural selection, not evolution. In order for a population to evolve, random variants must be subject the non-random process of natural selection. I just don't know who is claiming otherwise. You say: But I can't think of any cases at all! Show me the published authors who are making the argument you're trying to counter. Until then, I really don't get it. And I certainly don't see how IC helps, even on your own terms, because... ...Behe is arguing that random mutation plus natural selection is not sufficient to explain how complex features evolve, at least at the cellular level. That's why he's part of the Intelligent Design movement. He thinks that if there's something irreducibly complex, the process of random mutation plus natural selection couldn't have produced it -- only an intelligent designer could. It is abundantly clear that you are not a creationist. Nonetheless, the concept you are defending seems to be that of Behe, who uses it to argue that RM+NS is not a good enough model for how adaptive evolution occurs, at least at the level of cells and biochemistry. So I believe we can be forgiven if a lot of us find your view rather confusing. Just some thoughts. Still have no idea what you think is the problem with evolution, such that it needs to be distinguished into an RE and an IE model, since no one has ever used the IE model. And still have no clue what is right about IC, such that it will explain how RM and NS jointly produce evolutionary change, since other exponents of IC use it to argue against RM+NS accomplishing anything at all.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","11:00 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","817"

This is non-controversial -- but it is also a straw man, insofar as no one has ever said that random mutation alone is evolution. No one thinks that something as complex as a flagellum develops as a result of a single mutation. It takes a whole series of mutations (or variations ultimately derived from mutation), each subject to natural selection. The thing is, this is not how IC gets used by anyone. The whole reason why Behe thinks it's a big deal is that, in his view, it shows why complex phenomena (at least at the cellular or biochemical level) couldn't have evolved -- ""rationally"" or ""irrationally"" -- but had to be designed. It's what makes the complexity allegedly irreducible: if the complex phenomenon can't be reduced in complexity without being rendered useless. It's not just the idea of a complex feature evolving in a single-stroke that he's trying to rule out.

"06-22-2011","12023",56,"Freedom","432865","If they are using rational evolution as their model they cannot claim to have demonstrated a process that creates novel functions. Anyone who has argued against IC eventually implies one or the other as they must (unless they give up). kenneth miller. More importantly though the term 'could' is quite useless in the context of probabilities. Anything can happen because there is no limitation on what mutations can happen. IC proves that selection has nothing to do with it... It is the case, as I said by miller; and others. Certainly those who have argued against IC on this forum. If they would admit that natural selection cannot mitigate the odds of forming a novel system then your claim would have merit... but they won't. The reason they won't is because then people like behe will bring them a flagellum and a simple odds calculation which they refuse to deal with. The reason I asked about the books you referenced was because I am interested in an analysis of the odds, but not more denial founded in ignorance intentional or otherwise. Right, the key word is 'process'. Just because there is no process does not mean something cannot happen, it just means you can't have a theory which predicts the outcome. Could a mutation that created a flagellum have happened? Technically yes, but that is hardly an explaination and every time you insist evolution can't be 'just' mutation you back me up. IC helps explain evolution in a more precise way than the descriptions which inevitably intentionally ignore any kind of temporal analysis of selection. He's [Behe is] making the same mistake they are and you know I've said it. Adaptive evolution vs ? If a system can be modified to work better in different conditions it can happen by rational evolution and it is adaptation. There is nothing wrong with that model. Further IC is not restricted to bio-chemestry but is less intuitive at larger levels because by definition larger levels are abstract derivations of smaller patterns. The functions on the macroscopic level far fewer than they are made out to be hence the massive number of strawmen against IC. For instance wings, legs, and flukes are all quite diverse in their application but the function is the same, a limb held rigid by bones and motivated by contracting muscles tied to central control system. It's not confusing unless you assume the same dichotomy that behe does, and that implicitly atheist do. IC isn't a theory of life, it doesn't explain how RM and NS jointly produce anything, it identifies the possible interactions of NS and RM which indicates what they will produce and why (or why not). None of those selections do anymore to explain the system or reduce the odds of it's formation than random mutation does because with respect to the system they are just as random.","Matthew","432919","Sure they can. It's called mutation. If you don't think that mutations can create novel functions, then I really don't what to say. They can cause enzymes to change their shapes in such a way that the cleave molecules they couldn't do anything with before. They can cause pigments to become sensitive to light wavelengths they couldn't detect before. (See Carroll's discussion of birds and ultraviolet vision, of which more later. Again, sorry I can't provide the page number, since I lost the book.) And more and more. Unfortunately, mutations can also cause novel failures of function, often with lethal results. If a mutation enables an enzyme to cleave something it couldn't before, but disables it from doing something absolutely vital to the organism, then this is a problem. But that, of course, is where natural selection kicks in. To say that mutation can produce a novel function (or failure of function) for a single individual is not to say that the function has ""evolved."" For that, we need to show that random mutation plus natural selection made the function common amongst an entire population (or made it uncommon, or even drove the population extinct). (And let me just reiterate that I believe there is a great deal of vagueness surrounding the use of terms like ""novel function"" and ""creates."") And by way of clarification and segue: while random mutation can produce novel functions, random mutation by itself is not evolution. This is just false. No one says that random mutation is evolution, or that it can produce complex structures at a single stroke. No one says that natural selection even has anything to work on without variations ultimately derived from mutation, and it certainly doesn't call forth mutations of either a helpful or hurtful kind. If you think that there are people who say these things, then provide your evidence. You won't find them in the literature, even the popular literature, and you won't even find them on this board. As for giving up, well, people often opt out of arguments when, no matter how many times they say x, they are chastised for not saying x. Only random mutation plus natural selection qualifies as adaptive evolution (more on the qualifier in a moment, since it was evidently confusing). Only random mutation plus natural selection can produce complex features, and it needs a lot of time (generation time, not necessarily a fixed measure) to do so. I know of no evolutionary biologist who claims otherwise. It's time for you to put up or shut up on this score. Meanwhile, on the matter of arguing that something could happen according to a given sequence, therefore it did happen according to a given sequence, you offer the following individual as an exemplar: I presume that you are referring to his suggestion of an evolutionary relationship between the flagellum and the type III secretory system, or TTSS. I would suggest that you don't understand his argument. Why would I suggest this? In part, because he explicitly states that he is not arguing that because one of these structures could have evolved from the other, it did. On page 58 of Only a Theory , he notes that some proponents of intelligent design have pointed to speculation that the TTSS evolved from the flagellum as proving that the smaller system couldn't be the actual ancestor of the flagellum. That might be so, but other scientists have suggested quite the opposite, and in any case, it actually doesn't matter if today's TTSS is the ancestor of anything. It is absolutely correct to argue to that the existence of the TTSS today doesn't answer the question of how the flagellum actually evolved. But that overlooks why the ID camp believed that irreducible complexity was so critical in the first place: They thought it proved that the flagellum couldn't have evolved. It doesn't. [boldface added] He is not trying to argue that the flagellum evolved from the TTSS, and he certainly isn't claiming so on the basis of the fact that it could have. Nor is he arguing the opposite on the same absurd basis. He is arguing that it is in fact possible for a part of the flagellum to have had a different but selectively advantageous function, such that a subsequent mutation could alter the structure and hence its function -- and therefore the claim that this could not happen is false. First, is the phrase ""could not"" similarly useless? Because that's what Behe is saying about evolution: evolution could not produce the structures that he calls ""irreducibly complex."" Since that's what he claims for IC, why is it useless to consider what ""could"" happen? Second, it is not the case that ""there is no limitation on what mutations can happen."" There are only 20 amino acids to code for. There are only 4 DNA bases to arrange into the triplets that will do the coding, and the code is degenerate. Some mutations are even functionally invisible. All in all, there are only so many ways for a mutation to happen, given the genes that are already present . It is not the case that mutation means just anything can happen. And in any event, without natural selection, whatever does happen thanks to mutation wouldn't lead to the evolution of a population. Wait a minute, selection has nothing to do with what , exactly? I thought that ""rational evolution"" meant random mutation, plus natural selection? A rather confusing way of putting it. What does that even mean? Natural selection does not ""form novel systems?"" Blech. Just more vagary. And yes, I know you've tried to explain it before, I just don't think you've succeeded. Random mutation in genes can lead to the development, in an individual, of a simple feature that is new. If it's a helpful feature, natural selection will cause that individual's advantage-conferring genes to spread through the population, at a rate and to a degree depending upon how great the advantage. If it's hurtful, natural selection will purge those genes from the population in the same way -- perhaps even by purging the population itself. This -- random mutation plus natural selection -- is evolution. Now, of course, nature isn't static, so what's advantageous or disadvantageous can vary. Still, that's the basic model, as I understand it. For complexity, all that's needed is whole series of mutations and their selection events. That's what needs to be reconstructed. They won't deal with that odds calculation because it's a straw man. The odds are insurmountable, if and only if one presumes that one goes from not even one component of what is now the flagellum to the flagellum. But since no one makes this presumption, that odds calculation is irrelevant. I wold highly recommend them, especially Carroll's The Making of the Fittest , especially his discussion of the evolution of ultraviolet vision in birds. I'd also recommend Dawkins' discussion of the Lenski experiment in The Greatest Show on Earth , noting particularly that one strain of the bacteria developed the ability to feed on citrate while the others did not. UV vision in birds and citrate-feeding: novel functions that initially occurred in an individual via random mutation and subsequently spread through whole populations via natural selection. Novel functions, in short, that evolved, by our very definition of evolution in terms of the combination of random mutation and natural selection. But don't take my word for it. Read the books. I'm not sure what you mean by ""prediction"" in the context of reconstructing past events. Beyond that, all I can say is, we are clearly in agreement that a single random mutation cannot create something as complex as a flagellum. All I'm trying to argue, and all that evolutionary theorists argue too, is that an entire series of random mutations, each of which is subject to natural selection, can eventually produce a complex feature like a flagellum as a feature of a whole species of organisms. What Behe claims is that such a sequence of mutational and selective events can not bring about a flagellum. Unfortunately for his argument, ""irreducible complexity"" fails to prove anything of the kind. And this is one of those moments where I just have no idea what you're even talking about. By trying to understand whole series of mutations and selective conditions, evolution is always a temporal analysis. Mutations are events in time; just look at how the Lenski experiment figured out when not one but two mutations occurred to enable citrate consumption. Selective conditions change over time; just look at how paleontologists try to explain why legs would be advantageous for early tetrapods before they even left the water. It's always a matter of temporal analysis. If anything is non -temporal, it's IC. This is exactly why Behe uses it to support the intervention of an intelligent designer. It's not a process occurring over time. Poof! The designer produces instantaneously the complexity that random-mutation-plus-natural-selection cannot. Except that you're using exactly Behe's conceptual weapon. In his hands, it is a weapon to argue that random-mutation-plus-natural-selection cannot produce complex biological phenomena from simpler precursors over time. In your hands, I can't see it working any differently. I realize that you say ""rational"" evolution is RM+NS. What's consistent with this is denying IC, not defending it. So, I don't think you're being consistent. Vs. non-adaptive evolution. Genetic drift, which isn't a matter of natural selection at all, but has nothing to do with adaptations to an environment, is a real feature of evolution. Particularly in small populations, it is very important. Agreed. I wouldn't call it ""rational"" evolution. All that evolution means is genetic change within a population over time. This doesn't have to involve adaptation, as in genetic drift. But RM+NS is indeed a fully adequate model for explaining how organisms come to be adapted to their environments. So wings, legs, and flukes are also irreducibly complex? Come on, Freedom. Adopt a !@#% consistent position. Is it possible for a wing to come about through an entire sequence of random mutations, subject to natural selection? If so, then IC is baloney, because it says such things are too complex to have evolved. You can't say ""RM+NS produces IC systems."" That makes a mockery of the whole argument. I'm not even raising Behe's false dichotomy of evolution and design. I'm raising the logical dichotomy of RM+NS being sufficient to account for complex biological phenomena or not being sufficient to account for them. What you seem to be saying is, RM+NS are sufficient, and that IC proves it -- which is confusing insofar as the entire point of IC is to show that RM+NS are not sufficient. So your IC means something completely different than what Behe's IC means? Beyond that, I just don't understand what you're driving at here. Selection isn't supposed to reduce the odds of a system's formation. It's supposed to take the genes that formed a system and promote them through or purge them from a gene pool. Moreover, it isn't random with respect to the system, insofar as whether the system gets promoted or eliminated is determined by the system itself at work under the selective conditions. The appearance of the system in the first individual is random; whether it spreads through or disappears from the population is not. How does any of this have anything to do with IC?!? -sigh- This is why I quit with you before, Freedom. I can't see how you're being consistent. I cant even see what your point is anymore.

"06-23-2011","12023",56,"Freedom","432949","All the examples that have ever been brought to my attention (and I think I know what enzyme you are talking about) have been vastly hopeful in their proposed implications. For instance if we are talking about the same enzyme it function was to cut the types of molecules it did, all the excitement was over a adaptation to a new variant of chemical. It's like saying a human can eat a dish he never has before has just evolved a novel function. I do not claim that the fact that benefit becomes prominent is unexplained. As I explained in my posts on guided genetic change/ guided mutation natural selection post production is useless to explain production, and thus no single mutation can be produced by evolution even if it was selected. The only other alternative is that no one has argued against IC, which you might be able to convince me of given the right definition of argue ... No. I am owed much explanation on this subject, far too many have quit and never retracted their assertions. I maintain that those things have been implied to me several times in an attempt to defend against IC, if you want to argue about IC you can but if you just want to argue about who said what you can go find one of the half a dozen threads in which I have said the exact same thing consistently in as many ways as I could think of. If you think you can argue against IC without implying one of those fallacies then it wouldn't matter if anyone else said them would it, that would just mean they were wrong if they did. Hey thanks for finding that, databed didn't believe me when I told him some thought the ancestry was the reverse. Good, then tell that to all those who brought his dialog to me to to answer 'how'. If he was not claiming that a flagellum could have evolved the way he described... ...then I have no problem with him but that would mean those who posted his dialog as support were mistaken about what he was saying (as well as I). I know that, but it betrayed a misunderstanding of that which he was arguing against. IC doesn't say that co-option or mutation could not happen they are just saying they are random and useless to explain the system any more than random mutation alone would. That's because evolution isn't ""anything that produces A"" it's an explainable process which produces viable biological structures. You can make a dent in a car by hitting it with a rock or by smashing it with feathers. If someone says smashing it with feathers won't do it; and in response someone tells him 'but you admitted a rock could do it!' I repeat there is no limitation on what mutations can happen. I have also had this discussion on what evolution means a half dozen times, wrote paragraphs on why 'a change in allele frequencies' is a double standard definition... ...and even more on why no single mutation selection pair is explained by the process (i.e. the odds have to be considered). [Quoting me:] They won't deal with that odds calculation because it's a straw man. The odds are insurmountable, if and only if one presumes that one goes from not even one component of what is now the flagellum to the flagellum. But since no one makes this presumption, that odds calculation is irrelevant. As far as I am concerned you just implied (b). They won't deal with that odds calculation because it's a straw man. The odds are insurmountable, if and only if one presumes that one goes from not even one component of what is now the flagellum to the flagellum. But since no one makes this presumption, that odds calculation is irrelevant. Doesn't sound worth it. For one your sad attempt to label them novel functions is a count against them, and I suspect they do the same. I am only going to say this once in this string: A modification of a function which allows another application is not a novel function. If you think it is I point you to the immune system and bacteria which constantly change, mutations which allow the bacteria to infect new hosts and the immune systems to fight new contagions. Novel application? Yes, Novel function? No. That's the easy part. Now you have to realize that co-option does not alter the odds. And a whole series of random mutations each, which didn't really have any selection could do it too with the exact same probability. Why? because any selections that happened to occur before the system existed were, what did you like to say? 'indifferent' to the non-existent (system to be explained).[boldface added] I see no purpose in separating a string of unselected mutations, it simply doesn't matter if 25 mutations ended up in some sequence or 10 slightly larger ones. I refer to them collectively as a mutation. No he argues, as I argue; that the selection events are irrelevant... ...and anyone who comes up with any explaination is claiming the exact same thing as someone who omitted the meaningless selection events. (spontaneous generation) All IC does is prevent someone from contradicting this premise. Ah, the old change in allele frequencies definition No, muscles, bones, and nervous systems are. Nothing, the problem is what people claim it explains.","Matthew","432994","Which just goes to show how vague and arbitrary the delimitation of ""novel function"" is. First, the analogy. If someone has never eaten blueberries or bok choy before, and then he does, I can see no reason to call this a ""novel function"" in evolutionary terms; these are perfectly normal foods for a human being, regardless of whether this or that individual happens to eat them. If, however, no one has ever eaten nightshade berries or rhubarb leaves without lethal consequences before, and then someone does, it seems to me that this is a ""novel function"": a function that is new to any member of the species. If it provides a fitness benefit, then it will spread, and the species has evolved. Now similarly, if a microbe develops the capacity to subsist on citrate rather than just glucose thanks to an enzymatic mutation, why shouldn't this be thought of as a ""novel function?"" Yes, it had the capacity to eat already, in an entirely general sense of ""eat."" But it could not eat citrate -- note: it's not merely the case that this microbe did not eat citrate, but that no microbes of its kind could eat citrate. We are talking not about a mere incidental change in the details of an individual's life history, but of a change in capacities for any member of that species. Seems novel to me. And similarly again, if a bird develops the capacity to see ultraviolet light because one of its opsin proteins has mutated, why shouldn't this too be thought of as a ""novel function?"" Yes, the bird could ""see,"" speaking generally. But it could not see in the ultraviolet spectrum at all, and now it can. This is not just a change in what the bird does see, as a matter of fact, but a change in what it can see, as a matter of capabilities. Quite novel. (And again: I highly recommend Carroll's book. This discussion is quite, ahem, illuminating, if you'll pardon the pun. All that has to happen for a bird to see ultraviolet light is a single change in a single protein, and there are multiple ways that the relevant gene can mutate in order to code for that change in the protein. Factor in generation time and fecundity, and it's pretty clear how random mutation will provide the change eventually. -- Which is probably why the evolution of ultraviolet vision appears to have happened independently in a dozen or so separate lineages of birds.) In short, I think the distinction of what is and what isn't a ""novel function"" is being made arbitrarily. And here I think we're back to my ongoing complaint about the vagueness of ""production."" For starters, no one claims that evolution ""produces"" mutations. That's actually backwards: mutations, when they are selected, produce evolution. As for the beneficial feature itself, it is ""produced"" in an initial individual by mutation, as I already noted. (""Sure they can. It's called mutation."") The enzyme necessary for an E. coli to eat citrate is produced by a mutation. The opsin necessary for a bird to see ultraviolet light is produced by a mutation. Further, the beneficial feature is ""produced"" as a feature of the species by subjecting that initial mutation to natural selection. Since eating citrate and seeing ultraviolet evidently enable the organisms with such capacities to survive and reproduce more effectively than those without them, the features spread through the population. If what you're concerned about is explaining why a given mutation itself occurs, in a given individual, well, this is not what evolution even attempts to explain. Molecular genetics is working on it, though. If what you're concerned about is why a beneficial mutation is in fact beneficial, evolution can seek to explain this. It can attempt to show how a given feature affects fitness, given the actual environmental conditions in which that feature occurs. I guess I don't see why any of this presents some grand problem for evolution, such that it doesn't explain how features get ""produced."" In individuals, explaining how mutations occur is a task for genetics. In populations, explaining how an initially aberrant feature becomes a normal feature of the species is a task for evolution. Where's the problem? Ultimately, it seems like a semantic point, concerning ""produce."" Evolution -- random mutation plus natural selection -- ""produces"" the features of species. It does not ""produce"" the features of individuals, save insofar as they are typical members of their species. Actually, there is at least one other alternative: Perhaps you haven't understood what others are saying as well as you think you do. Perhaps?... Perhaps they never retracted their assertions, because they felt no need to, insofar as they did not say what you thought they said. Perhaps?... Actually, I'll provide as much evidence for my claim as you just did for yours by saying that I don't think other people -- not you, but other people -- were saying what you thought. And they've done so at least half a dozen times. Moreover, I would really appreciate it if you would provide me some direct quotations of published authors in the field to give me an idea of what experts you're talking about. People on this board are one thing. Professional biologists (some on this board are, I gather, but the great majority are not) are another. Show me what experts in the field say what you charge them with saying. Indeed. But the fact is, I don't think you have shown that anyone is guilty of such fallacious reasoning in criticizing IC. Not even once. In fact, your use of Ken Miller as an example of it was entirely erroneous, for example. I think the passage I quoted amply demonstrates your mistake. Confronted with it, you respond: Well, great, databed made a mistake about the ancestry -- maybe. But the plain fact is, you've misunderstood Miller's argument. And still do (which is why I'm loathe to attribute an error to databed): Actually, he was claiming that it could have evolved that way! Or that it could have evolved in a similar way, maybe even in the reverse sequence. Regardless of which sequence is right, he is arguing that the flagellum could have evolved via such a sequence, against someone, namely Behe, who claims that it could not have evolved according to any such sequence. But he still isn't arguing that the hypothetical sequence he offers is the way the flagellum did evolve, just because it's a way the flagellum could have evolved. Meanwhile... It is great that you admit being mistaken about Miller here. But you're actually mistaken about the nature of your mistake, as indicated in my preceding paragraph. So I actually think that those who've been posting about Miller on this thread in the past -- including databed, for example -- probably understand his argument better than you do. And that's an utterly preposterous claim. Dawkins defeated it in advance 25 years ago with with his discussion of the ""methinks it is like a weasel"" program in The Blind Watchmaker . At every single step, any beneficial random mutation will be preserved and/or promoted by non-random natural selection. The final outcome -- which can only be described as ""final"" with hindsight -- is the result of a whole sequence of mutations and selections occurring over vast stretches of time with huge numbers of generations. Ah, so evolution does ""produce"" after all!... And indeed it does, with precision. It isn't just ""anything,"" as you note. Behe, however, is claiming that evolution cannot be productive, at least at the level of biochemical pathways and cellular ultrastructure. And I repeat that this is not true. Mutations are always constrained by real circumstances. If you want to claim that there is no limitation, fine, in an abstract logical sense, there is none. But I'm not talking about speculative metaphysics. I'm talking about real material genes, subject to real material conditions around them. There are only so many ways a given gene can actually mutate. Sorry, but it's not. Evolution in general just means change in allele frequencies in a population over time. Many such changes are adaptive, in that they have a bearing on the fitness of the members of the population; these changes are where natural selection is relevant. But not all changes in allele frequency are adaptive. They're evolution, just not adaptive evolution. If you have a problem with calling genetic drift ""evolution""... well, this does seem to be about semantics, at times.... What does this even mean? That evolution is somehow supposed to explain why a mutation occurred as it did, and was subject to the selective conditions that it was? I'm sorry, Freedom, but I just don't see what you're even demanding of evolution. What should it explain that it fails to explain? As I've already said, explaining mutations is a task for genetics. Explaining how selective conditions affect mutations is a task for evolution. Not sure what the problem is. And as far as I am concerned you completely misunderstand how natural selection works. There is no claim at any point in what I wrote that natural selection is working on anything that does not yet exist. Mutation A occurs, and natural selection can act on its product(s). If it gets preserved, for whatever reason, then when mutation B occurs, natural selection can act on its product(s), too -- and on the combination of its product(s) and A's. And when mutation C occurs... and so on and so on. The odds against mutations A, and B, and C, and D, E, F, ..., Z all occurring in one fell swoop are astronomically high, especially if the idea is that their end result is selectively beneficial. The odds of A occurring at one time and being beneficial, however, are much better. Still small, but over enough generations, quite likely. If it occurs, then natural selection kicks in, preserving and spreading it through the population over time, if it's beneficial. And once that happens, A is no long merely a possibility whose odds of occurring are relevant any longer: it's a fact with probability 1/1. It is against this backdrop that we must then consider the odds of B occurring. This is again going to be a small probability, but as with A, over enough generations, the odds are surprisingly good. If B occurs, then natural selection again kicks in, preserving and spreading it if beneficial. Odds now no longer relevant: it's a fact with probability 1/1. Consider this against C. It is always possible for a further mutation to come along and undo A and its benefit. If such a mutation occurs, however, natural selection once again kicks in. If A is indeed beneficial, then there will be selection against mutations that undo it, and they'll get purged from the gene pool, often quite hastily. This is just the standard evolutionary account of how random mutation and natural selection work together over time to produce complex adaptations in whole species of organisms. It does not presume (b), i.e., that natural selection can operate on something that doesn't even exist yet. In each case, the mutation must happen first in order for natural selection to begin. To say otherwise is a patently absurd misrepresentation of the entire model. I repeat that I think your characterizations of what does or doesn't qualify as a ""novel function"" are completely arbitrary. You provide no rationale, just a declaration that my characterization is sad. And I am going to say this as many times as necessary in this string: Your use of ""novel function"" is totally arbitrary. This just recapitulates the problem in terms of a distinction between function and application. Are herbivory and carnivory functions, or just applications of the function of heterotrophy? Are heterotrophy and autotrophy functions, or just applications of the function of producing organic compounds? I don't think this distinction, as you've drawn it, holds up to an ounce of scrutiny. I would say that if the members of species can't do x, but then some individual member of the species gains the ability to do x, then x represents a quite ""novel function"" with respect to that species. Natural selection alters the odds, according to exactly the model laid out a few paragraphs above. You don't just multiply all these improbabilities against each other and wind up with an impossibly improbable event. You take an improbable event, select for it once it occurs so that it goes from improbable to normal, and then repeat. The odds calculations don't work anything like you seem to think they do. Not true, for exactly the reasons outline above. The mutations do get selected, just not according to what their ""final"" product will be. To wit: Suppose, for simplicity, that a flagellum needs mutations A, B, and C to occur. Until A, B, and C have all occurred, there is indeed no selection on a flagellum. But if mutation A occurs, while B and C have not yet, there can certainly be selection for whatever A's own benefits are. Then, if and when B occurs, there can be selection for B's benefits, as well as for any benefits that might accrue to A+B. And if and when C occurs, there can be selection for C's benefits, as well as for any benefits from A+C, from B+C, or from A+B+C. It is certainly possible that, prior to A+B+C's existence, there is already a selective condition that would make having a flagellum an advantage. But to say that a selective condition already obtains is not the same as saying that natural selection is already operating. If the relevant mutations don't occur, then whatever the conditions, there's nothing for them to work on. I repeat: I do not know of any evolutionary biologist who has said otherwise. I do not even know of any anti-IC poster on this board who has said otherwise. In my view, the fact that you think people are saying otherwise indicates a serious misunderstanding on your part. It in no way indicates a problem with evolutionary theory or the critique of IC. But Freedom, each mutation in the string is selected!!! Please note: they are only selected after they occur, not before. This is why it is illegitimate to lump them as simply "" a mutation."" You can't collapse time like that! Each mutation in the string must be selected on its own merits or on the merits of how it works in combination with previously selected mutations. Sorry, but again, the selection events are not irrelevant. They have a huge effect on how the probabilities work, whether you and Behe like it or not. Meaningless? Pshaw. The sequences of random mutations and non-random selection events is precisely what renders evolution meaningful. You are the one ignoring the selection events as irrelevant and then collapsing whole sequences of mutations into ""a mutation."" If anything qualifies as ""spontaneous generation,"" that's it. Ridiculous. All you've done above is taken an entire sequence, cut out the half that is selection, and then condensed it into ""a mutation."" IC is completely atemporal. Your own unwillingness to consider sequences of mutations as sequences, as you did above, is a perfect demonstration. Like it or not, that's the general definition. Some of those changes are adaptive, and some aren't. Both are evolution. If you think genetic drift is a crock, then I welcome your careful analysis of why. Really? Gee, why not muscle cells and bone cells and nerve cells? This is just more arbitrariness. And I don't think people are claiming what you think they are. ----- I'm going to quit here.

Once the spiral arms formed gravity would stabilize their shapes by pulling odd stars back. At the edges where the gravitational pull of the center is much weaker the pull of nearby stars could well be more massive than that of the galaxy center, meaning the stars there are more like the end of a rope. Stars in the center are more dominated by central gravity. Also remember the scale of the objects, even if our galaxy was for sure 20billion years old that would only mean 80 revolutions, which means you can't really claim end state behavior. 1. All that has exploded has not been observed 2. Super novas as the brilliant structures of hot gas don't stay that way forever, they cool and turn into dust clouds, dust clouds which we see everywhere. Perhaps that was because of it's position relative to earth. If a predominantly red gas was inbetween us and the white light... Apparently the moons of jupiter are sacrificing orbital potential energy to heat energy in a system of tidal gravitational cycles which keep the moons hot. I would have to see the data. Why are we assuming the rate of change is constant? Because there are still comet producing events. The life expectancy of a comet is not a hard number like that it depends on how big it is and where it's been, stars are what cause the tails.

According to the links Stonewall provided, the average age of a spiral galaxy is 1-2 billion years, however the age of our galaxy has been estimated at 5 billion years old, which according to your science it should not be a spiral galaxy anymore, so maybe you should not trust your sources Matthew. 2. Stonewall, your link says that Davis was wrong about the age of the universe, when your scientists are missing 988 second stage stars, and 5033 third stage stars!? Davis' calculation might have not been perfect, but according to your link's data, the universe can only be 20,000 years old at the maximum , far closer to the biblical time line. Freedom, yes every supernova has not been observed and supernova explosions don't stay that way forever, but the amount of observable supernova should be far, far greater than it is. 3. Your link's only plausible explanation is that everyone saw it on the horizon and made it look red ,and that is a huge assumption. And what about the ones that did see it red? Where they all wrong? It would not prove that God made everything, but it would prove that it does not take 100,000 years for stars to evolve. Freedom, if their was a red star in between it, where did it go? 4. Because Stonewall, according to the laws of Thermodynamics objects lose energy. By now the Earth's molten core should be cool by now (and Ganymede' should too even with the sacrificing of orbital potential energy ) if the solar system is billions of years old. 5. According to you scientist the rings of Saturn formed several billion years ago when a moon like object broke up and formed he rings, yet the rings according to your link can only be 100 million years old. 6. Yes Freedom I was assuming the rate was constant, and I gave you the max distance from the Earth with it, but if you don't want to to assume the rate was constant the according to the laws of Thermodynamics objects lose energy, so the moon would have been traveling even faster away from the Earth, meaning that it would be in the Earth at the minimum distanced. 7. Stonewall, your link is using a argument similar to saying that a watermelon is blue on the inside until you cut it open. You can't prove the Oort cloud exists, and I can't prove it doesn't exist, and I have a question, if the Kuiper Belt gets it's supply from the Oort cloud, where does the Oort cloud get it's supply from? 8.

Freedom, if their was a red star in between it, where did it go? By now the Earth's molten core should be cool by now (and Ganymede' should too even with the sacrificing of orbital potential energy ) if the solar system is billions of years old. 6. Yes Freedom I was assuming the rate was constant, and I gave you the max distance from the Earth with it, but if you don't want to to assume the rate was constant the according to the laws of Thermodynamics objects lose energy, so the moon would have been traveling even faster away from the Earth, meaning that it would be in the Earth at the minimum distanced. 8. Once again the law of Thermodynamics states an object losses energy so the Earth's magnetic field should to weak to support life. 9. Stonewall, let me point out that your link says the their was a 14 hour day 4.6 billion years ago, then it says it was a 22 hour day 370 million years ago, so which is it? 10. They are if their is a prevailing wind pattern. 13. Then why is their no unbroken record for several million yeas, since no major disaster occurred?","Freedom","434890","Please demonstrate that. You need to show that supernova's occur (within detectable distance) at a known rate. This is important because the bright flashes which indicate a super-nova anywhere, even in other galaxies do not necessarily constitute the gas clouds we can see; the stellar clusters in other regions of space in other galaxies and even our own could be much more prone to super nova due to their age or composition. Then you need to establish how fast they cool, which again is not necessarily constant; the famous supernova they show you at the observatory could be young or they could be from very large heavy super nova with lots of thermal inertia. Only with both the local(observation range for the gas clouds) explosion rate and cooling time could you predict how many clouds would still be glowing at any given time. Since you say this number is greater than expected I suppose you have the data I have mentioned. Our system is moving and so are other objects in our galaxy. Such an alignment is no more permanent than mars and Jupiter appearing in the same sky. I hope you realize it was just a hypothesis. I did not say red star I said red gas, an object the size of a star would have the most appalling odds of ever eclipsing another star much less for any significant time. I heard that there was excessive nuclear decay in earths core, and again you will have to demonstrate that gravitational tides aren't 'good enough' for Ganymede. Wait, so you are saying that if the rate isn't constant it's increasing? If that is the cause then it follows it could have a root or a constant asymptote much later than 1.3 billion years ago. I don't want to go down that road however because I still have not heard your explaination for this effect, what does the loss of energy have to do with anything? It also states that object may gain energy if another object transfers it. You are not applying the laws correctly if you think it means every phenomenon slowly decays to zero. You can have two completly dead hulks orbiting each other forever in space without ever losing any of the potential energy between them. Why can't it be both? A trend of longer days is not inconsistent because 24 hours is greater than both those points. Why don't you pick a patch of windy ground, and dump 10 tons of dry sand on it. I assure you that if it wasn't desert it won't become desert just because you did that. A desert isn't defined by sand or wind but a lack of moisture. No moisture leads to no or few plants, no or few plants means no top soil which means dust and sand due to wind. You are basically identifying a result of a desert as it's cause. Now in the Sahara there is too much sand to shake a stick at and you do see it burying previously 'nice' places, but they are equivalent to a square mm in the example above, if a bad sandstorm hit the Nile the Nile would simply wash the sand out to sea and if you look at the size of the underwater sand back in the mediterranean you might suspect that has happened.

"07-22-2011","12023",57,"Gen1:1-31","434859","1. According to the links Stonewall provided, the average age of a spiral galaxy is 1-2 billion years, however the age of our galaxy has been estimated at 5 billion years old, which according to your science it should not be a spiral galaxy anymore, so maybe you should not trust your sources Matthew. 2. Stonewall, your link says that Davis was wrong about the age of the universe, when your scientists are missing 988 second stage stars, and 5033 third stage stars!? Davis' calculation might have not been perfect, but according to your link's data, the universe can only be 20,000 years old at the maximum , far closer to the biblical time line. Freedom, yes every supernova has not been observed and supernova explosions don't stay that way forever, but the amount of observable supernova should be far, far greater than it is. 3. Your link's only plausible explanation is that everyone saw it on the horizon and made it look red ,and that is a huge assumption. And what about the ones that did see it red? Where they all wrong? It would not prove that God made everything, but it would prove that it does not take 100,000 years for stars to evolve. Freedom, if their was a red star in between it, where did it go? 1. The ancient astronomers who described Sirius as red were looking at it when it was low on the horizon, so its reddening was due to the earth's atmosphere. The ""red Sirius"" refers to observations made at the heliacal risings and settings of the star in Greek and Roman society (Ceragioli 1996; Whittet 1999). 2. Not all ancient astronomers recorded that Sirius was red. Many ancient sources confirm that it was white or bluish white 2,000 years ago (van Gent 1984, 1989). 3. The bright star visible without a telescope, Sirius A, is not a white dwarf. Sirius A has a white dwarf companion star, Sirius B, which has nothing to do with what ancient astronomers saw. Hovind did not check the facts behind his claims. 4. Even if Sirius had changed color, it would not support creationism or a young earth in any way. It would simply mean that one observation was unexplained. 4. Because Stonewall, according to the laws of Thermodynamics objects lose energy. By now the Earth's molten core should be cool by now (and Ganymede' should too even with the sacrificing of orbital potential energy ) if the solar system is billions of years old. 5. According to you scientist the rings of Saturn formed several billion years ago when a moon like object broke up and formed he rings, yet the rings according to your link can only be 100 million years old. Saturn's rings may be less than 100 million years old (Cuzzi and Estrada 1998). However, that says nothing about the age of the planet. The rings could have formed when Saturn captured a small moon that fell within the Roche limit (the distance below which moons will be pulled apart by tidal forces). This could have happened any time in Saturn's history. Saturn's moons shepherd the particles that make up the rings, preventing them from drifting and maintaining the gaps between the rings. This shepherding may allow the rings to be much older than 100 million years. (However, the color of the rings suggests not much more than 100 million years' worth of accumulated dust.) 6. Yes Freedom I was assuming the rate was constant, and I gave you the max distance from the Earth with it, but if you don't want to to assume the rate was constant the according to the laws of Thermodynamics objects lose energy, so the moon would have been traveling even faster away from the Earth, meaning that it would be in the Earth at the minimum distanced. 7. Stonewall, your link is using a argument similar to saying that a watermelon is blue on the inside until you cut it open. You can't prove the Oort cloud exists, and I can't prove it doesn't exist, and I have a question, if the Kuiper Belt gets it's supply from the Oort cloud, where does the Oort cloud get it's supply from? 8. Once again the law of Thermodynamics states an object losses energy so the Earth's magnetic field should to weak to support life. 9. Stonewall, let me point out that your link says the their was a 14 hour day 4.6 billion years ago, then it says it was a 22 hour day 370 million years ago, so which is it? 10. Why is their no evidence of a larger desert? They are if their is a prevailing wind pattern. 11. No, I don't, because you won't consider anything that suggests a creator. Stonewall, once again your link has made many assumptions, with no supporting facts. 12. So I guess in those millions of years of sitting up right, nothing (earthquakes, volcanoes, floods, dinosaurs) moved it? As for Malone's ""problem"" with the ""thousands of years"" for the tree to remain upright for ""slow accumulation"" to occur, it is a non-problem - he is simply interpolating the average depositional rates for an entire formation down to the scale of metres. This is not the correct way to do it, because individual beds can be deposited rapidly (say, sands and mud during a levee breach), and then little deposition can occur for a long time (e.g., a soil horizon), as is observed in modern river floodplain environments where trees commonly occur. In short, he is assuming conventional geologists would interpret the occurrence the simple way he has interpolated - they do not. 13. Then why is their no unbroken record for several million yeas, since no major disaster occurred?","Stonewall","435117","Who said that the Milky Way was always a (barred) spiral galaxy? It wasn't. It formed slowly just like everything else in the universe, and looked very different in the distant past. By the way, our galaxy is more like 13 billion years old. Davies' work was a complete sham, making up numbers that would fit his pre-determined conclusion. And it's obvious you didn't read the entire link at all (probably because you don't actually care). But read section 10.3 that explains why we can't see all the remnants (the number one reason being dust and interstellar matter blocking them.) Supernovae, Supernova Remnants and Young Earth Creationism FAQ How are the other answers not plausible? And you already answered your own question... yes, if they saw it as red, they were incorrect, because it was only the earth's atmosphere causing the reddening. And even if it changed, it wouldn't prove anything at all about the evolution of stars. Says who? You are basically saying that 4+ billion years is such a long time that anything should have cooled off by now, but you have done absolutely no calculations. Why don't you show the calculations? Make sure to factor in the initial temperature, external energy sources such as the sun and collisions, and the insulating effects from the cooling of the crust. And so what? Am I to believe that Adam and Eve were trotting around on a big, molten fireball? It also says that the age of the rings has nothing to do with the age of the planet. I ask again, so what? Here is the whole answer, since you seem to have had trouble reading it the first time: You used terrible creationist math. 3 inches/year = .25 feet/year. Minimum current distance from earth to moon: 221,208 miles = 1,167,978,240 feet. 1,167,978,240/0.25 = 4,671,912,960 years. That is the number of years you would have to go back (assuming a constant recession rate) to see the moon at earth's surface, not 1.3 billion. Since Earth is only 4.54 billion years old, you have no argument. They come from the same place that planets come from. Clouds of dust and matter left over from supernovas. Gravity causes the matter to collapse into bigger and bigger rocks... when closer to the sun, there is going to be a greater amount of these rocks, and they will collide and form planets, but farther from the sun (where the Oort cloud is), there is less matter, and you will have a lot of smaller rocks instead of a few big ones. At that distance, they are going to be ice balls, and as the link says, it's only when gravity throws them into a weird orbit that they get close enough to the sun to start melting (that's what the tail is... the comet melting). Once again, you are just throwing around 'thermodynamics' like nobody is going to question you. I'm an engineer and very familiar with thermodynamics. It doesn't help you in this case. You haven't established a rate of 'energy loss', you haven't shown what strength is actually needed for life, you haven't shown what the initial strength was... And again, you failed to acknowledge the link I gave, which shows that there is no exponential decay of the magnetic field as well as all the mistakes made in the model you are referencing. Uh, both. It says that the rotation of earth has slowed down, so of course the day would have been shorter in the past. Also, keep in mind, the 'seconds' in the link I gave are 'arc-seconds.' The earth is always changing. From climate and weather to continental drift. The age of the Sahara has nothing to do with the age of the earth as a whole, just like the age of a wart has nothing to do with the age of the person who has it. A more detailed answer, with references (all you had to do was click the hyperlink on the original page I gave you): How Good are those Young-Earth Arguments: Hovind's 'Proofs' (continued) Millions? It wasn't even thousands! Why bother responding when you don't read the links? Are you really asking why there aren't any living creatures that are millions of years old? And what is this about no 'major' disasters occurring in the last several million years? There are natural disasters all the time, in every part of the world... and creatures in the wild don't generally last very long (and definitely not THAT long) because future generations would have evolved to be better adapted to the environment and more efficient at using resources. These generations would out-compete the old organisms until the old ones died. That's why you don't see thousand year old trees and other plants/animals very often. Also, nice job avoiding my link again, as it showed the example of the King Clone creosote bush in the Mojave Desert which is 11,700 years old.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","06:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","842"
