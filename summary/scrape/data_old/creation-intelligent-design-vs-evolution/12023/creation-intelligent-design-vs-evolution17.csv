"01-07-2009","12023",17,"CashBurnRate","334285","you don't think scientists will alter surrounding conditions to accelerate mutation? regardless, we have yet to see any evolution of new body parts or its so called ""steps"" if evolutionists want to suggest that a few decades is too little time it is nothing but science fiction","pandion","339384","Why would they? What would be the purpose? Are you somehow suffering from the delusion that evolutionary biologists try to somehow cause evolution? Why would that even be expected? When you consider that it is important to maintain some sort of consistency in study populations, obvious mutants are excluded from the breeding stock. And yet, there are frequent observed mutations. In fact, my elder son once observed two mutations in a single fly in one of his populations. One fly had no wings and white eyes. Really? From what university did you earn your science degree that makes you qualified to make judgements about what is science?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","244"

Symbiote clearly pointed out that your strawmen of evolution was in fact a strawmen. He even went so far as to detail what evolution predicts and does, aka, far more then just body parts, specifically noting changes to body parts in ways you clearly don't consider to be part of evolution. Aka, you completely dismissed it as it showed that your argument on body parts was ill conceived, ignorant and essentially a strawman. Symbiote pointed out that changes to body parts under evolution does not always equate to new parts. You completely rejected that as part of evolution. Well that's largely due to the poor original post. In fact several people pointed out how you screwed up the topic from the beginning. http://www.4forums.com/political/334267-post2.html http://www.4forums.com/political/334292-post7.html http://www.4forums.com/political/334296-post8.html http://www.4forums.com/political/334333-post9.html http://www.4forums.com/political/334429-post19.html","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","10:47 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","245"

When creationists behave that dishonestly, it doesn't even make a compelling case that God plays a role in their own lives, much less that He should play a role in biology class. The Nova movie was great. I remember when it came out. The creationists responded not by the reasonable approach of challenging the film's factual claims (Why is that, do you think?...), but by the ad hominem route of accusing the filmmakers and the network of bias. As usual.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","11:16 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","246"

I have yet to find a creationist online that doesn't subscribe to obscene levels of outright dishonesty. However, it should be noted that the vast majority of them are either too stupid or ignorant to understand that what they are saying is outright false. I brought up how YEC results in God being a huge liar. Arch refused to do anything other then flame me and run away. The world doesn't work on a YEC basis, from nuclear power to the water from your local water supply, it just doesn't make an ounce of sense. Yet these people believe that the Earth is only 6,000 years old. Huh. Okay...so either God is lying about Earth's creation in the Bible, or he's lying about how he operates it. Either way, God's a liar. What is really interesting is creationist who argue that God sent light from stars more then 6,000 lightyears away 6,000 years ago. Apparently being dishonest in the natural world doesn't make one dishonest to these people. Try this elsewhere and all you get is flaming. No response to the actual logic which as you noted in the res of your post is generally how creationists operate. If I was a Christian I couldn't believe in a massive lying God. Why do Creationists? Because perhaps they are massive liars? Radiometric dating is false, yet I use nuclear power. Huh.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","01:45 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","247"

"01-08-2009","12023",17,"obvious_child","339408","If I was a Christian I couldn't believe in a massive lying God.","Matthew","339420","You know, Descartes actually made an argument about this in his Meditations over 350 years ago. According to his argument, God has given us the power of reason. He has given us strong inclinations to trust it, and He has given us good evidence that trusting it works out well for us. Perhaps most crucially, He hasn't given us any way to determine that reason is systematically wrong about things. So if our reason does systematically lead us into error, despite all our inclinations to use it, then God would be (in Descartes' words) a ""deceiver"" for having given it to us in the first place. But deception, he further argues, is entirely incompatible with God's power and goodness. Hence, God cannot be a deceiver, and we ought to trust our reason. Why creationists are so opposed to ""natural reason"" -- which to a believer is a gift from God -- is really puzzling. For despite the implications (as spelled out by Descartes), they really do seem to think that it's fundamentally flawed. Just look at all Archie's comments belittling my reliance upon ""human intellect,"" for example.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:34 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","250"

Besides those already given, a realistic look at geology tells you it isn't true. The only other alternative is a liar god. It's a simple concept. I am baffled as to how you could fail to have grasped it. You see, there is so much evidence from all of science that shows conclusively that the earth is old and that the universe is very much older that if your god created the universe only 6000 years ago, and thus created all of that evidence that leads any reasonable person to conclude a great age for the earth, then you god is a liar. Only a fool who has never opened a science book would state that anyone would claim that the speed of light is ALWAYS constant. What a great demonstration of your inability and unwillingness to even understand your own objections. But never mind. The speed of light as it was 170,000 years ago has been measured and found to be the same as today. Actually, his arguments make perfect sense. Just because you lack the ability to understand his arguments does not mean that you have refuted them. I haven't seen you refute anything, ever. You just disagree because you don't understand. By the way, here's one more about the 6,000 year old earth/liar god. 4) If your god created the light in transit, then observed super novae never actually happened. Thus, your god is a liar who created the history of events that never happened. If, on the other hand, your god changed the speed of light, then the universe as we know it is impossible. With just a little knowledge of elementary physics you would know that.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","10:03 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","254"
