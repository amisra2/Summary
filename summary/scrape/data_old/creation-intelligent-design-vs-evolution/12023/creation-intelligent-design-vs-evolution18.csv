This is a good example of the two sets of physical pre and post flood. Prior to the flood fluid mechanics didn't exist in the current form, that mass and size weren't indicators of sinkage, but instead complexity sorted items. Then fluid mechanics radically changed to mass and size rather then complexity. This is extremely strange. I'll add to your posts rather then respond to Cash.

If He was speaking this to them, do you think it doesn't apply to the rest of us also? I know that I'm attempting to humble myself before Him and live according to His words and life principles. Are you? Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to His disciples, Mat 23:2 saying: ""The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat. Mat 23:3 Therefore whatever they tell you to observe, [fn] that observe and do, but do not do according to their works; for they say, and do not do. Mat 23:4 For they bind heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers. Mat 23:5 But all their works they do to be seen by men. They make their phylacteries broad and enlarge the borders of their garments. Mat 23:6 They love the best places at feasts, the best seats in the synagogues, Mat 23:7 greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called by men, 'Rabbi, Rabbi.' Mat 23:8 But you, do not be called 'Rabbi'; for One is your Teacher, the Christ, [fn] and you are all brethren. Mat 23:9 Do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven. Mat 23:10 And do not be called teachers; for One is your Teacher, the Christ. Mat 23:11 But he who is greatest among you shall be your servant. Mat 23:12 And whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted. Mat 23:13 ""But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; for you neither go in [yourselves], nor do you allow those who are entering to go in. Mat 23:14 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. Therefore you will receive greater condemnation. [fn] Mat 23:15 ""Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel land and sea to win one proselyte, and when he is won, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves. Mat 23:16 ""Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is obliged [to perform it].' Mat 23:17 Fools and blind! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifies [fn] the gold? Mat 23:18 And, 'Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, he is obliged [to perform it].' Mat 23:19 Fools and blind! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift? Mat 23:20 Therefore he who swears by the altar, swears by it and by all things on it. Mat 23:21 He who swears by the temple, swears by it and by Him who dwells [fn] in it. Mat 23:22 And he who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits on it. Mat 23:23 ""Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have neglected the weightier [matters] of the law: justice and mercy and faith. These you ought to have done, without leaving the others undone. Mat 23:24 Blind guides, who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel! Mat 23:25 ""Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of extortion and self-indulgence. [fn] Mat 23:26 Blind Pharisee, first cleanse the inside of the cup and dish, that the outside of them may be clean also. Mat 23:27 ""Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead [men's] bones and all uncleanness. Mat 23:28 Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. Mat 23:29 ""Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous, Mat 23:30 and say, 'If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.' Mat 23:31 ""Therefore you are witnesses against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. Mat 23:32 Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers' [guilt]. Mat 23:33 Serpents, brood of vipers! How can you escape the condemnation of hell? Mat 23:34 Therefore, indeed, I send you prophets, wise men, and scribes: [some] of them you will kill and crucify, and [some] of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city, Mat 23:35 that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. Mat 23:36 Assuredly, I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation. Mat 23:37 ""O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under [her] wings, but you were not willing! Mat 23:38 See! Your house is left to you desolate; Mat 23:39 for I say to you, you shall see Me no more till you say, 'Blessed [is] He who comes in the name of the LORD!' [fn] "" He didn't. And if you knew Him you would realize that. And neither have I. Not once, and I challenge to to post evidence that I have. If you understood what love is you would realize that the love I have shared through the truths I have shared are more valuable than gold to you. But you prefer lies to the truth and accept everyone who tickles your ears with that you want to hear while condemning me for saying what you don't want to hear. But here is Jesus talking and saying that the scriptures can't be broken, if you can understand what that means. Jhn 10:35 ""If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came and the Scripture cannot be broken, I have made one error in dealing with you child. And since the bible say's it better than I could, I'll just post it for you. Pro 9:8 Do not correct a scoffer, lest he hate you; Rebuke a wise [man], and he will love you. The answers to your questions are in the bible and only in the bible. But saying that means I worship the book to you, right? But not its author, God whom I constantly defend here. Only a reprobate could think as irrationally as you do little child. Mat 4:4 But He answered and said, ""It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'* "" You do realize that the bible is Gods WORD don't you? Luk 8:11 ""Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. Luk 8:12 Those by the wayside are the ones who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved. Luk 8:13 But the ones on the rock [are those] who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away. Luk 8:15 But the ones [that] fell on the good ground are those who, having heard the word with a noble and good heart, keep [it] and bear fruit with patience. Which of these represent you child? I'm betting verse 12 describes you based on your belief that since I honor and trust Gods word that I must not worship Christ. Are you starting to comprehend how utterly ridiculous your allegation is yet? Or would you like more evidence that I am perfectly consistent with what the bible requires true believers to be?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","11:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","264"

[Or was it the other way around] lol. Cuvier collaborated for several years with Alexandre Brongniart, an instructor at the Paris mining school, to produce a monograph on the geology of the region around Paris. They published a preliminary version in 1808 and the final version was published in 1811. In this monograph they identified characteristic fossils of different rock layers that they used to analyze the geological column, the ordered layers of sedimentary rock, of the Paris basin. They concluded that the layers had been laid down over an extended period during which there clearly had been faunal succession and that the area had been submerged under sea water at times and at other times under fresh water. Along with William Smith's work during the same period on a geological map of England, which also used characteristic fossils and the principle of faunal succession to correlate layers of sedimentary rock, the monograph helped establish the scientific discipline of stratigraphy. It was a major development in the history of paleontology and the history of geology.","pandion","340029","I don't know. Perhaps if you could only ask the creationist scientists who devised the methods of relative dating, Georges Cuvier and contemporaries for example. They recognized that the fossils from each stratigraphic layer were different from other layers. They also recognized that some widely spread fossils appeared in the strata in the same order wherever they were found. They hypothesized that the lower fossils were older than those in more shallow deposits. They assigned names to the strata, and after that they used the fossils to identify the various layers wherever they were found. They named the typical fossil layers to represent the relative ages. After than, when they found a fossil they could assign it to the appropriate age. As Wikipedia says: The principle is still good in that certain types of fossils only appear in rocks of a certain age. For example, trilobites only appear in rocks of the early Devonian and older. If you find a trilobite fossil, you know for sure that it did not come from Permian rocks. Other fossils were also found in rocks of a limited age. When several of these fossil types are considered together, they are typically grouped differently in rocks of various ages. These groupings are called suites. Therefore, by identifying a particular suite of fossils I can assign an approximate age to the stratum in which that group of fossils was found. Of course, these same creationists realized that the multiple strata could not represent one great flood. As a result, they realized that what they read in the Bible could not possibly be literally true. They hypothesized a series of creations and destructions - multiple creations and destructions by multiple floods. So modern paleontology has creationists to thank for the method of relative dating that is still used today to give approximate dates for fossils. It is quite reliable. But modern creationists have reverted to the dark ages before the development of scientific thought. Maintaining the fantasy that the mythology of the Bible is real is so important that creationists reject scientific theories developed by early creationist scientists. Instead creationists now point to people like Mr. Kent Hovind and Ken Ham as ""creation scientists.""","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","11:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","268"

Its not the big bang, its not primordial soup, its not imagined nonsense that supposedly took place billions of years ago. None of it makes sense. You believe it because you want to believe it. Geologic column 1 varve = 1 year and no erosion marks or disturbance in the nice clean lines for millions of years!!! That doesn't make any sense at all. Therefore, I can't believe it. Any fossil more than 1/8th inch thick is a polystrata fossil, but the entire organism has to be buried b4 it rots. So polystrata fossils can only be formed one way. In 1 layer of something, even if, that layer is of mixed/multiple materials. Dah, gee wiz - it looks like millions of layers over - like millions of years ........ ...Not to me What does make sense is the mini grand canyon formed by Mt. St. Helens, with the nice clean layers all up and down the wall. How many millions of years old are the walls of Tuttle(sp) River Canyon from top to bottom? and if the dynamics of that mudflow is correct - very likely, fossils inside those walls, but not likely on the face of the wall.
