We don't have DNA from any hominids other than homo sapiens . This does not mean they are ruled out as ancestors. Seriously, the simple existence of other hominids has got to be the hardest thing for an evangelical thinker like you to explain. So why do you keep bringing it up? Where in the Bible does it say anything about any other species of human? I'm sure if you look really hard you can find some vague reference to people living in caves or something referencing some archaic, alternate definition used by some tribe of people living in some remote area of the Middle East whereby ""house"" means ""cave"" and then shoving that in my face as proof of the fact that the Bible knows all about other species of humans. I'm waiting.","Esdraelon","390697","""It does not mean they are not ruled out as ancestors.""

RNA That Replicates Itself Indefinitely Developed For First Time And there is a lot of research results in the subject of abiogenesis which you are probably unaware of.","Esdraelon","390700","""But the main value of the work, according to Joyce, is at the basic research level. ""What we've found could be relevant to how life begins, at that key moment when Darwinian evolution starts."" He is quick to point out that, while the self-replicating RNA enzyme systems share certain characteristics of life, they are not themselves a form of life. The historical origin of life can never be recreated precisely, so without a reliable time machine, one must instead address the related question of whether life could ever be created in a laboratory. This could, of course, shed light on what the beginning of life might have looked like, at least in outline. ""We're not trying to play back the tape,"" says Lincoln of their work, ""but it might tell us how you go about starting the process of understanding the emergence of life in the lab."" Scientists are all in competition and each one relishes the opportunity to suggest they are ""getting closer"" to solving the riddle of life.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","07:47 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","407"
"02-16-2010","12023",28,"Archangel","390650","But you said in the post right above that more complex molecules do form from simpler ones given enough energy. I assumed you were referring to more complex life forms evolving from simpler ones since it is evolution we are discussing here, no? This just seems to be more of the slippery definitions which always change and never remain consistent enough to actually pin down. You apologists for evolution can't defend your religion to save your lives, can you.","Databed","390740","Actually, like I said, I didn't expect you to get it. I was talking about more complex molecules forming from simpler molecules when energy is applied, just like I said. I never said more complex lifeforms. Again, make sure you know what you are talking about before you attempt to refute someone's claim.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","09:17 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","408"

"02-16-2010","12023",28,"Freedom","390651","Have you read my post? Separate systems are not selecting for an IC system, therefore it is non-gradual that an IC system would form from those components, just as if it were a single mutation. Evolution can operate on the components that might form a IC system but it is not selecting those components for an IC system so it is one shot random that components could form an IC system. If you have studied cellular biology you know that without the key phrase ""gradual change"" you are not looking at evolution. It would be support for ID for such an event to occur. (I have heard this from evolutionist apologists I did not make it up)","Databed","390746","Such an event is not necessary. What you seem to overlook is the fact that systems do not always evolve into a more complex system. They can lose parts and parts can change function. In evolution, losing parts can be a benefit as it conserves energy. When an organism finds a way to make a part obsolete and eventually get rid of it, it will take advantage of this.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","09:33 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","411"

"02-16-2010","12023",28,"Freedom","390760","I have not overlooked anything of the sort. What you have overlooked is that systems must evolve into a more complex system if that is the contention of evolution. There is no cheating in science, if your theory states that a system can become more advanced (the word advanced being disguised by beneficial change) merely by imperfect replication and natural selection than that is what has to happen for the theory to be true. I am not interested in the argument ""it's not physically impossible"" because it's not physically impossible for a mountain to erode into the exact shape of the statue of liberty! Continuing to argue that even though a system is not being selected for it can be formed by gradual change due to natural selection is your problem, I can only point it out.","Databed","390769","Nope, it's not actually. Evolution simply states that things change to fit the needs of their environment. Not that they necessarily become more complex Again, beneficial change is not the same thing as a change to something more complex. Evolution does make things more fit by selecting beneficial changes. What's the problem here? Erosion contains no elements of natural selection or evolution. You are misrepresenting evolution in an attempt to pick it apart. Also, nowhere have we used the argument that its not impossible as a sole basis for our conclusions. In the case of evolution, it's not only possible, but it is obviously true. Study of abiogenesis has a ways to go, but given what we do know, it could be speculated to not only to be possible, but likely. This demonstrates a huge misunderstanding of evolution on your part. Again, systems can change function. Would you also argue that evolution states that the slow evolution of legs from fish fins was so that kangaroos could jump? Or monkeys could climb trees? I don't think you would. Climbing or jumping legs were not being selected for when fish emerged from the water and no one who truly understands evolution would think so. So give me one example of a system that has evolved without being selected for. Notice I left out the term gradual, it is not necessary when the process of evolution as a whole is already known to be gradual. I guarantee you can't do this.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","414"
"02-16-2010","12023",28,"Archangel","390771","More arrogance and condescension from the guy who can't phrase his post clearly enough to be understood by someone he considers to be a novice. BTW, the discussion is about evolution of the species, not molecules. Unless you're going to come back and say that one leads to the other in which case your claim that I didn't get it is proven to be completely bogus as usual. In any event, you prove how slippery your ideology is as you attempt to not get proven wrong by me.","Databed","390773","Actually, one does lead to the other. That is the relevance. Why can't you just say that you misunderstood the context of the statement instead of now saying it doesn't belong in this discussion?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","01:08 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","416"

I don't see where you have said anything about it for the last three pages. All you do say what amounts to I have the answer and you guys do not. Your answer is, god is magic and made us! Grow up. BTW, the very hart of evolution is molecules and atoms and they certainly would be germane to the subject.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","03:42 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","417"
