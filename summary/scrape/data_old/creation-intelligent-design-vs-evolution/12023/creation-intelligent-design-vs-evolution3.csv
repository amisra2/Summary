Although they do serve lateral vision because the insect has no neck and therefore is unable to turn its head. It must turn its whole body in order to advance its line of vision. So by what evidence do you claim this is the result of evolution and not original creation? Had the spider been at such a defensive loss prior to allegedly evolving the median eyes, how did it originally survive the millions of years needed to adapt? Especially in the radically environmentally unfriendly period in evolutionary history when this evolution process would have occurred? And why hasn't it continued to evolve more sophisticated vision in the hundreds of millions of years since then? All of these questions demand a rational answer before Creationism can be discounted out of hand.","Peeling","334513","That photo is looking at the four eyes on the front of its head. The diagram immediately above that photo on the website shows the location of the other four eyes, to the side and rear of the head: I have to ask: why did you present the supposed lack of animals with eyes in the backs of their heads as evidence against evolution, if the existence of animals with eyes in the backs of their heads isn't allowed to count as evidence for evolution? Well, assuming for the sake of argument that they even were spiders at the time they evolved their arrangement of eyes, the answer would be ""Slightly less well"" Seriously. Animals of the same species are competing against each other as well as the rest of the environment. Spiders hose out far, far more offspring than could possibly ever survive, so even a slight statistical advantage, over hundreds of generations, can transform the genetic profile of the species. Which makes the next useful mutation more likely to occur to a creature already possessed of the first mutation, so they stack. And so on. It doesn't have to be an all or nothing, survive or perish situation. Those are very rare. You probably drive a car to work, right? It's quite likely that a horse and cart would not meet your commuting needs. If we apply your logic from above, the advantage - even necessity - of cars in your modern way of life means horses and carts could never have existed! The mistake is obvious: we're holding too much constant. Horses and carts were once perfectly adequate - and still are in some societies. What makes you think it was any more hostile than now? What makes you think it hasn't ? It's never possible to discount special creation of all life, only to show that it's a loose and inelegant theory that doesn't make useful predictions. Special Creation is an explanation, Evolution is an explanation. The difference is that when we ask Creation 'what should we expect?' we get little more than a shrug. Creation means anything's possible. Evolution, on the other hand, is tightly bound by its own rules. We should never see a fossil of one of these creatures earlier than those creatures. We should never see this feature in that class of creature, because it evolved after evolution seperated them. If you have two sports anchors, and before the match one of them gives a detailed run-down of the teams' history and form, and expounds at length about what he expects the result of the game to be and how each player should perform, while the other says ""Well, I definitely think one team will win; I expect the ball to be kicked quite a few times and there will certainly be some passing and some running."" - whom do you respect more if all the predictions of both anchors prove to be accurate?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","11:41 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","31"

We automatically lose because ""convincing"" evidence is already defined by Cash as something we are unable to present.","Darn Republican","334514","Yeah, I guess you loose to empirical evidence as well, since it's something you have to present. Evolution, Darwinian Naturalism... whatever you want to call it. With all it's fascistic leverage to create an environment of global acceptance is loosing the intellectual argument because as microbiology develops it is discovering more and more information at the sub-cellular level. These cells cannot be anything or produce anything other than what they are... in other words includes only the information to reproduce itself, ergo... human skin DNA cannot morph into liver DNA, so no fish forming legs, no apes flying planes or creating ""higher order"" intelligence. The whole of evolution is based on chance, chance as causality. That's it... a cosmological roll of the dice with impossibility preempting the whole argument - but is suppressed. Fully knowing that chance in itself is not agency - there is no causality in chance, chance is a byproduct of an event therefore cannot effect anything, so the equation would look something like: chance + any amount of time = nothing, therefore evolution or any of its pseudo-intellectual ilk are simply impossible.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","11:46 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","32"

It can do something its ancestors could not - for the very simple reason that it's not the same as its ancestors. I smell an arcane semantics-based proof brewing... ...and I wasn't disappointed I don't know what 'chance as causality' is supposed to mean, but to speak of evolution being 'based on chance' is highly misleading. If I have an accident on the way to work tomorrow morning, there will be a definite cause; a specific series of events leading up to it. We cannot guess what they might be. Nevertheless, we can still makes statements about the statistical likelihood of such an accident occurring, yes? Does that accurate statement of probability mean that my fate on the road is literally determined by a dice roll, that if my number comes up, I crash, with 'chance as causality'? Of course not. We are merely describing the likelihood of an event in a system of which we have imperfect knowledge. As our knowledge of the system increases, our assessment of that likelihood changes: if you know my age and gender, my driving habits, my route and how busy or quiet it is - all these things permit a more accurate assessment of the odds. If we had perfect knowledge of a deterministic system, the odds would be 1 or 0. Similarly, every mutation that has ever occurred has had a definite proximate cause, and if we knew what they all were and what they would all be in the future, evolution would lie mapped out before us in all its detail. Nevertheless, in the absence of perfect knowledge of these individual causes we can still describe the occurrence of such events statistically, saying how long we might have to wait, or how many trials we might conduct in order to expect a given outcome. So to say that the evolution of the nylon bug, for instance, was based on chance is misleading: the evolution of the nylon bug was based on whatever proximate cause shuffled its DNA. Correctly viewed, evolution is not a series of unlikely events, but a series of highly likely ones. It is highly likely , for instance, that some bacteria in a large colony would experience a mutation enabling the digestion of nylon. Sure - breaking that event down on a per-bacterium basis yields tiny probabilities, but why stop there? Why not break it down on a per-bacterium, per-microsecond basis? The chances just got even smaller! See? It's a silly way to think about it, because in the end it's the chance of the event occurring that matters, not some arbitrary deadline by which it must occur or cell to which it must occur.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","34"

With that said, and speaking of incredulity, care to take your own advice to CBR and provide evidence that spiders have rear facing eyes. My search showed no such insects exist with rear facing working eyes.","Larni","334530","Dude. Seriously, can you read? Misumenops is a crab spider, not a jumping spider. All the information was there, too. You only had to read the words. Yay! I'm debating with a guy who thinks a spider is an insect.

"11-27-2008","12023",3,"iangb","334521","...so where does cancer come from? Isn't that 'cells producing something other than what they are'? Come to that... given that all humans start out as a single cell, that's definitely false.","Darn Republican","334534","No, think about what you just said. A cancer cell doesn't mutate, it attacks healthy cells and causes the destruction of healthy tissue. Kinda like liberals in a healthy society - they are the free radicals of the body politic, huh... go figure. No, back to school... turn in what educational credntials you feel you have, and just stay at the coffeehouses... at least you have a .005% of hearing someone ineject some truth in one of those sidewalk tete a' tete's you nutters are so fond of... but here you are dead wrong. Have you ever heard of an egg? ever heard of a sperm? An egg is still considered a multiple cell organism, and a sperm as well. You're gonna have a hard time pulling that one off.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","02:19 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","37"

I seem to have wrote what I posted, so I cannot be illiterate. I certainly understand what I wrote, and assembled the information in such a way that it formed a cogent point, so your claim of ignorance is moot. Lastly... the quotes are evidence because in debate [as in law] they are admissible as state of mind, they have a word for those revelatory admissions in legal jargon - testimony! Eyewitness testimony that the ""theory"" is entirely questionable, has made a mockery of the scientific method, and basically is full of new mowed dog crud, and nothing more. The testimony goes to the heart of the mind that is attempting to propagate a useless theory as anything other. They are exactly what people need to hear to diffuse the perpetuation of a mythological benefit to mankind as a story of origin. If they who quoted such don't even believe it... the more logical question quickly becomes who would be fool enough to carry that torch? You seem to be their number one candidate... Think about that while you're quoting Asimov, hypocrite.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","03:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","41"

Darwin and the Eye With regards to 'causality' - that's another argument entirely, and deals with abiogenesis and the Big Bang, not evolution. With regards to 'chance' - it is, indeed, misleading. Evolution = random mutation (chance) + natural selection (non-chance). A 747 might not self assemble after a whirlwind, nor a clock from it's component parts - but if you add in natural selection then the watch can build itself . Incidentally, that (linked) video is well worth the watch, all.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","03:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","42"

You are ignorant, as you think that evolution means that a toenail can turn into an eye. And you posted quote mines (not ""testimony""). Quote mines are quotes which have been removed from context, most often in an attempt to make it appear that the one being quoted is saying something completely different from what they actually said. A good example is the ""Darwin-eye"" quote mine, which iangb already addressed.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","03:58 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","45"
