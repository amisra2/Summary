"01-13-2009","12023",19,"Smallax","340056","This is what YOU say. And because YOU believe it - it is true. It is true - because you said it and you believe it. Circular. Consider the source. There can be only one reality and the head of that reality is the only authority. Guess what - it is not you or me. Its not the big bang, its not primordial soup, its not imagined nonsense that supposedly took place billions of years ago. None of it makes sense. You believe it because you want to believe it.","Matthew","340066","Except that I have never said, and I would never say, that anything is true because I believe it. So your point is irrelevant. And even if I had said that, as you've phrased it above, it's not circular. All you've done is offer the same premise (""I believe it"") and the same conclusion (""It is true"") in two different orders. It would be circular to say that I believe it because it's true and then it's true because I believe it. Not that this is any more relevant, since I didn't say this either. But you don't appear to understand what circular reasoning is. I do. In the case of every single book of the Bible, that source is a human being . In some cases (e.g. the 1st Timothy passage Archie frequently quotes), the human authors of a particular books may claim to be transcribing the words of God Himself. The question then is, why should we believe these claims? And if you claim we should believe them because it's God speaking through them, that's clearly circular, since ""It's God speaking through them"" is the very conclusion we need to establish. Indeed not. But it's not the Bible, either. The Bible is not God. Has anyone ever claimed that these are ""authorities?"" Note how you have switched the point of argument. Not to you, anyway. But ""making sense"" is a subjective standard. Quantum mechanics doesn't make sense to me, but it works nonetheless -- else our computerized conversation wouldn't be happening in the first place. Really? How do you know what I want? And even if you're right, how would my desires render the Big Bang or evolution untrue? I really want to believe that I didn't die in my sleep last night. Does that make me dead? You are just piling on fallacious argument after fallacious argument here, Smallax.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","09:10 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","273"

If I assume I know what I'm talking about because I have learned something then presumably there was some form of evidence for that learned thing. Hey Presto, the circle is broken. Let me further explain. If I believe something is true, and my evidence that is true is because it says (correct spelling for Acrhie's benefit) it is true, then that is circular reasoning. However, if I believe something is true because I have seen evidence of its truth from multiple sources (sources which are not directly connected to that truth) then there is no circular reasoning involved. Can you see how this is critical, logical rationality? Smiley","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","09:15 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","274"

I think these sentences only appear circular, because they reduce to empty tautologies . It's like saying ""I believe he's a bachelor because he's unmarried"" and ""I believe he's unmarried because he's a bachelor."" Hardly any circularity there.

CBC News Sergey Steinberg, a biochemistry professor at the University of Montreal, found the answer in the ribosome, a relatively large mechanism within the cell that takes RNA instruction and builds proteins. His discovery, made with student Konstantin Bokov, has been published in the scientific journal Nature. Scientists have long wondered how chemicals spontaneously came together to create proteins before life itself began. Steinberg and Bokov's theory fills in a critical step in how life got started four billion years ago, said Stephen Michnick, the Canada Research Chair in Integrative Genomics at the University of Montreal. A key breakthrough came when Steinberg found that chemicals could spontaneously come together and form something as complex as a ribosome. Previous theories had suggested only simple proteins could form spontaneously. This had been shown in a seminal experiment in the 1950s in which basic chemicals were combined in a flask, heated and zapped with electricity, creating basic proteins as a result. But proving that chemicals can spontaneously form simple proteins did not prove that spontaneous action could create more complex mechanisms. ""In the absence of such explanations, some people could imagine unseen forces at work when such complex structures emerge in nature,"" said Steinberg. Steinberg was able to show otherwise. He found the ribosome was put together using relatively simple structural rules, a bit like a three-dimensional puzzle. For critics who ask why spontaneous formation didn't lead to something other than the ribosome, Steinberg used mathematical models to show there was no other possibility. The ribosome simply wouldn't hold together if it were constructed any other way. ""The assembly followed rules that were logical and for which there were no alternatives,"" said Michnick. ""This forces us to think about bigger structures. This type of thinking is important to understanding all sorts of structure."" For instance, the next step might be to consider why proteins begin to form wrongly spontaneously. Several neurodegenerative diseases occur when proteins start to malform, said Michnick. Steinberg's research could give insight in how that happens, and why. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2009 Bell Canada, Microsoft Corporation and/or their contributors.

"02-27-2009","12023",19,"Matthew","339420","You know, Descartes actually made an argument about this in his Meditations over 350 years ago. According to his argument, God has given us the power of reason. He has given us strong inclinations to trust it, and He has given us good evidence that trusting it works out well for us. Perhaps most crucially, He hasn't given us any way to determine that reason is systematically wrong about things. So if our reason does systematically lead us into error, despite all our inclinations to use it, then God would be (in Descartes' words) a ""deceiver"" for having given it to us in the first place. But deception, he further argues, is entirely incompatible with God's power and goodness. Hence, God cannot be a deceiver, and we ought to trust our reason. Why creationists are so opposed to ""natural reason"" -- which to a believer is a gift from God -- is really puzzling. For despite the implications (as spelled out by Descartes), they really do seem to think that it's fundamentally flawed. Just look at all Archie's comments belittling my reliance upon ""human intellect,"" for example.","Archangel","345228","I have never belittled your reliance upon human intellect at all. That is patently ridiculous. That would imply I am against or oppose the use of human intellect which is also patently ridiculous to think that I oppose the use of reason. What I have belittled you on is your claim of being a committed christian when everything you say and defend opposes the christian principles and beliefs that true believers accept as obvious. Even here in this post, you quote descartes as your evidence for reason when in his own generation he was considered a person with more atheistic beliefs than christian even though like you, he claimed to be a devout catholic. Here's a short bio of his spiritual life. Religious Beliefs It has been rigorously debated within scholarly circles regarding the religious beliefs of Ren Descartes. He himself claimed to be a devout Roman Catholic, claiming that one of the purposes of the Meditations was to defend the Christian faith. However, in his own era, Descartes was accused of harboring secret deist or atheist beliefs. Contemporary Blaise Pascal said that ""I cannot forgive Descartes; in all his philosophy he did his best to dispense with God. But he could not avoid making Him set the world in motion with a flip of His thumb; after that he had no more use for God."" [13] Ren Descartes - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Notice what Pascal, a contemporary of his thought of him. Also notice that the man you quoted at least gave God credit for creation even though he abandoned the rest of of what it meant to be a christian. What I find curious about you is even though you claim christianity, you can't see the reason it requires for true believers to accept God at His word in the bible which God says is His Holy Word. Can't you see the problem that creates for you and your alleged spiritual condition? Try applying your critical thinking and ability to reason to that contradictory position which you so eloquently represent in every secular humanist post you write.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","277"
"02-27-2009","12023",19,"Matthew","339602","Suppose for the sake of argument that your opponents, including me, behave hypocritically. Would that excuse your own hypocrisy? Suppose also for the sake of argument that I am too easy on atheists. Would that excuse your hypocrisy, either? We both know the answers to these questions, Archie. Stop making excuses, and start loving your enemies.","Archangel","345291","Feel free to point out my hypocrisy Matthew. Meanwhile, let me point out yours as you claim to be a dedicated believer in Christ yet you deny Him and His word at every turn in every debate you participate in. Tts 1:9 holding fast the faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching, so that he will be able both to exhort in sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict. Tts 1:10 For there are many rebellious men, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, Tts 1:15 To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience are defiled. Tts 1:16 They profess to know God, but by {their} deeds they deny {Him,} being detestable and disobedient and worthless for any good deed. Tts 2:1 But as for you, speak the things which are fitting for sound doctrine. Tts 2:7 in all things show yourself to be an example of good deeds, {with} purity in doctrine, dignified, Tts 2:8 sound {in} speech which is beyond reproach, so that the opponent will be put to shame, having nothing bad to say about us. Tts 2:11 For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, Tts 2:12 instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in the present age, Tts 2:13 looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus, Tts 2:14 who gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless deed, and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds. Tts 2:15 ""These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one disregard you"". So you see Matthew, the bible tells us to defend Gods word and His doctrines against the lies of the enemies of truth. For that you want to call me a hypocrite, when in fact, it is the guy who claims to be the believer but doesn't EVER defend God or His word who is the hypocrite.

"04-08-2009","12023",19,"CashBurnRate","334263","If all life evolved from a common ancestor, then there should be countless instances of new body parts evolving. Body parts such as eyes, muscle, bone, etc. We have not seen one instance of a new body part evolving in a population in which it has not existed previously. Evolutionists will wave the magic ""time wand"" and simply claim that such a change could never be observed in a few decades. What about fruit flies? One generation of fruit flies = around a day. Fruit flies were exposed to x rays to speed up mutation rates, we have observed the equivalent of millions of years (in terms of human generations) of super-accelerated mutation and.... no new body parts. Evolutionists will also list in steps how a new body part can arise. This is only plausible if each of those steps could be directly observed. If not, then it is nothing more than science fiction.

In fact, the word has been consistently defined possibly hundreds of times on this board alone. Bare-bones, it's this: Evolution: the change of the genetic makeup of a population over multiple generations as a result of natural selection acting on random mutations. That is obviously quite different from the layman definition of evolution, which is synonymous with change of any sort. For instance, if I say that my understanding of mathematics evolves, I am obviously referring to the layman's definition of evolution not the biological definition. Defined the biological way, there is certainly a lot of evidence for evolution. The ease at which you're able to find that evidence is a result of the fact that the above definition is really the only way biologists have ever defined evolution since the discovery of DNA. This link has probably already been posted, as this is a thread on the evidence of evolution, but I'll provide it anyway in case you're genuinely in search of the evidence for evolution.
