You said evolution relies on the concept of time, and you are absolutely correct, you must always consider the state of affairs at the time of proposed evolution the past and future are irrelevant, only what can produce benefit for the organism right then and there. I thought genetic drift referred the the accumulation of neutral mutations in a species. The adjective 'drift' is like drifting on the water as opposed to the directed force of a sail or motor. Yes. Perhaps but I could think of no better term. I was calling it guided selection but that doesn't make sense. The essence of the term is giving a namespace to the combined effect of natural selection + random mutation. Obviously this is the proposed mechanism of evolution but it would hardly do to use that word, especially when I am refering mostly to a test to see if the process is acting or not. The idea is that since evolution predicts a pattern in genetic change what can we use to identify exactly what patterns to expect; well the answer to that is that beneficial mutations are selected for so beneficial change is the meta pattern one would expect. How about more than a single mutation though, how about the accumulation of benefit which is as necessary to evolution as the singular selection? Can one tell what the pattern in multi-mutation (having intermediates) will be? What would you call change that is produced by evolution and change that is not (such as genetic drift)? Well I said since evolution is 'selecting' amongst various mutations (presented to it via individuals) the total change is guided by these selection events. I suppose you could say determined by instead of guided but I still think guided describes it better. I don't think so.","Bennedict","413435","the eye would have formed under positive selection pressure. meaning, no specific event needs to take place, per say. what i mean by positive selection pressure is that alleles increase a trait which succeeds instead of alleles decreasing and getting rid of negative traits, leaving only positive traits. the way the eye formed was probably not with negative pressure, seeing as with the progressions of the eye, animals will avoid predators instead of the negative alleles being eaten. genetic drift means a general change in the pattern and prevalence of a given interval in a species undergoing a genetic change. the name implies not a stillness but a movement from one point to another. and with the genetic drift formulas, we can predict the outcome of an interval based on known variations and knowing what they do. which is exactly what you proposed with guided mutation.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","11:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","691"

That is apparent. I have never heard of genetic drift being associated with any selection what so ever.

Can you frame it in such a way as to give us an idea of how it might be tested, measured or cataloged it in some way? I think we all understand the general idea of IC, I am just a little curious as to how it could be studied.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","01:37 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","696"
"09-24-2010","12023",47,"Freedom","413546","It's a boolean measurement, if you mean how does one go about measuring IC's implications to random chance I would say the genetic differential should be that meter. Yes, that was the point of the guided mutation formula / test. It's not a scientific theory it's an argument, you evaluate arguments you don't study them like a field of knowledge.","Accipiter","413557","I am assuming you have some kind of algebraic equation in mind, can you give us an example of how it might look? I'm sorry I don't know what a guided mutation formula / test is, can you provide me a link where I can read more about it? Can you show me how one would go about evaluating the argument for IC?

"09-27-2010","12023",47,"Freedom","413602","I do not but one can be defined. if X = the genetic matrix of the initial DNA and Y = the genetic matrix of final DNA. let the four base pairs equal unique positive integers. Then F(x,y) = (1/[2^(|x-y|)]) ^ infinity <- return boolean for difference G(X,Y) = (F(x1,y1) + F(x2,y2) + .... F(xi,yi)) <- genetic differential function Let the number of single base pair mutations selected due to similarity (i.e. functional benefit is caused for the same reason Y[n] is) with Y but not including selection for Y or X = b You can generally calculate b by taking G(X,B) where B is the DNA after the mutation, if G(X,B) < G(X,Y) b is lowering the genetic differential. That is in general but if a mutation was selected for a different cause than similarity to Y it could pass this yet still be pure chance with respect to Y. #mutations with multiple base pair changes are considered to be multiple mutations. H(X,Y) = b/G(X,Y) <- Evaluates ratio between selected mutations and genetic differential. If H is 0 the change is unguided. If H is 1 it was totally guided. Everything in between is a percentage of guidance. and I don't what to hear about infinity, take the limit. Now that was extraordinarily more clumsy than the english definition, why do you want it? Got some real examples to use it on ;p ?","Accipiter","413832","This makes no sense what so ever.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","07:28 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","702"

A chromosome duplication may involve millions of base pairs, but is a single event at a single point in time initially in a single organism. Millions of base pair changes = 1 mutation. Given that duplication events are now considered to be the driving force of evolutionary change, but each event is a single mutation, your assertion above disconnects your math from reality.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","02:48 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","704"

I should have said ""#mutations with multiple base pair changes are considered to be multiple b's"" b's are defined with a 1 to 1 relation ship between base pairs. It does not affect the logic to say a single mutation composed of 100 base pair mutations can be broken up into selected and unselected base pairs. and you do not understand my math or else you would not have thought that note disconnected it from reality.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","11:29 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","705"
