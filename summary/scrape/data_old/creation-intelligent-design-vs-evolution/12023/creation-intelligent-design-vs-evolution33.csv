You clearly don't know what scaffolding is. Wrong. It is exactly the latter. Back, again, to my argument. Scaffolding is the removal of features that are no longer necessary for the function of the system in which they are connected. This creates the illusion that parts were added just as they appear, but really the most recent change is not the addition of any one part, but the removal of an unnecessary part. Again, the flagellum has been shown to not comply with any of the definitions of IC. The removal of parts does NOT render it functionless. This can be seen in structures that exist in the very same microbe that Behe used in his example of the IC flagellum. Freedom, you have nothing. You are so convinced to validate your religion that you are determined not to accept this theory. Evolution has no holes in it. It is a solid theory with mountains of evidence for it. Face it, your religion has NO evidence just as your brick and leaf example has NO evidence. Your examples of IC have no substance and have already been refuted by evolutionary scientists which lead to Behe abandoning his IC definition for a completely different one which actually made his argument even worse. Get over yourself and your argument for something that you can't even come close to showing one iota of evidence for.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","09:27 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","482"

If you could somehow introduce some other controllable virus into a pool of the infectious virus and select for the ones that most effectively countered the infectious virus without any other bad effects you could quickly come up with a cure. I think the hard part here is being able to effectively select for the characteristics we want. The better solution is to use a simulation where we can synthetically select for the good characteristics.

Prove your statement that scaffolding can not explain I.C. system, and can not be formed through variation and Natural selection. Just because you claim that doesn't make it so. All the examples you have come up with for allegedly 'i.c.' systems has been shown to not be I.C. by the way.. Want to keep trying? Oh. you are right. Mutation is random. However, Natural Selection removes the randomness from the equation, and only filters in characteristics that help the organism pass on it's genes. That is yet another key point you are refusing to acknowledge. So, we have the claim , unsupported that scaffolding can't explain I.C. systems, We do have peer reviewed articles that talk about scaffolding in bactericidal evolution though We have a list of alleged systems that were allegedly i.c., all of which were shown not to be. We have the ignoring of the 'natural selection' part of evolution as the filter for 'selection'. We have ignoring of the use of similar pre-existing structures to produce i.c. systems. It is obvious that verbosity does not equal good information or understanding. The evolution of 'i.c.' structures was actually explained by H.J. Muller a century ago, many many years before Behe said it couldn't be done. We even have examples of new i.c. structures that evolved in bacteria in the last 70 years Irreducible Complexity Demystified As for the flagellum, funny you should bring that up, as the evolutionary path that allowed it to develop was solved. http://saier-144-51.ucsd.edu/~saier/...k4/paper4c.pdf http://www.newscientist.com/article/...flagellum.html Margulis, Lynn (1981).

Just because darwin, richard dawkins, and you claim it doesn't make it so. You are incorrect Do you think you can take the inverse of everything I have said argue against it and make me blink? This a strawman, my entire arguement was based on natural selection. You do not. Would you put that in premise conclusion form please? I am not interested in cogent arguement while I have deductive. They were not shown not to be, there are far more than the ones shown as example by behe. A misunderstanding of IC you are consiously continuing caused that mistake. So stop doing it. We have the ignoring that things don't happen without reason. Yes I can see that.... Find H,J. Muller's explaination post it here and watch me apologize. I read about the PCP munching bacteria and what was before, which displayed a misunderstanding to some degree of IC, but basicaly tried the same trick that has been tried in this thread, tried and defeated. At some point here I am going to have to tell you just to reread my posts because I am getting tired of reiterating the concepts I have presented as clearly as I can. Oh right the example, I am sure if you read it you noticed that all three enzymes existed already. It was admitted they had other roles, it was admitted that the only difference between the enzymes was optimization. IC in this case would consist of no enzymes capable of breaking down PCP. Scaffolding in this case would consist of what apparently happened, the systems already existed. Let's pretend that the system met my criteria of not having function previous to proposed evolutionary event, say that the middle enzyme could not break down PCP but it could with some mutation. Until PCP was being broken down exactly what mutation would be selected for in PcpC that would cause it to be able to work on PCP? For the sake of argument say that A - B is the distance in difference of DNA between working PcpC and non-working PcpC A mutation that brought A half way to B would not cause selective pressure on the enzyme. Only once A = B is there selective pressure, but as you can see since there was no pressure inbetween those points there was no evolutionary process. You can say it was 25 mutations that happened to happen in order or you can say it was 1 it doesn't matter because no matter how many times you break it up there is no natural selection filtering the mutations in favor of B. The basic contetion of scaffolding is that the above is granted but natural selection is filtering the mutations in favor of C where C is the optimized function of that enzyme in it's current role. The assumption which is not part of evolution, not rational, and most certainly random is that C = B Why do you believe that? If there is an unbroken chain of such happenings I would consider it evidence for ID. It would mean that there is a definite chain of coninsiding functionality not guided by natural selection but by their own properties, by the nature of carbon based life. What are you trying to prove here? God?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","01:36 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","488"

You seem to infuriate them, I wonder why that is if this is cut and dry science and all you have is faith?","Databed","391594","Frustrate is a better term. It's because you straight up lie. You claim to have won an argument using science when in fact all you have demonstrated is your faith. How you can claim not to be simply arguing from incredulity is beyond me. That's the difference between our arguments. You say, ""that is highly unlikely, therefore, this"" or, more specifically, ""I cannot imagine how this evolved by shear chance and natural selection alone, thus violating my faith, therefore, it didn't evolve AND it was created instead."" An evolutionist says, ""I have no reason not to believe what this evidence is obviously telling me, therefore evolution is true."" Or perhaps a rational creationist says, ""I did not realize the evidence was THIS complete. I was always told it was full of gaps and fallacies, but on the contrary, this is obviously telling me evolution really happens and this old book I was taught was magical from a very young age is simply what it looks like: an old book.""","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","04:35 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","492"

Just because we claim it doesn't make it so. Claims without evidence mean nothing. However, you have not responded to any of the evidence.. you just make sarcastic remarks, quote claims 30 years out of date that have been refuted, and create straw men and red herrings. You hand wave away the concept of scaffolding, and you totally ignore the point that such structures at the bacteria flagellum were pre-existing for other structures and function. You also did not respond to any of the peer reviewed scientific articles. Gasp..I am so not surprised you ignore evidence. That would be just terrible for your world view, so you ignore it. How about backing up your claims with some sources, and actually respond to the evidence provided.

"02-21-2010","12023",33,"Freedom","391601","I repeat my claim that I have won, the sure sign is when the opponents stop arguing and starts attacking.","Databed","391604","If by winning you mean not being convinced of your own delusion, then yes, you won. I can identify exactly where your train of thought goes wrong actually. You say, ""This particular system could not have had selective pressures driving its evolution because any precursor to this system could not have had the same function."" What you ignore is, ""This system has many possible functions that result from making slight changes."" We have shown examples of this second statement with the flagellum example of IC. You also ignore, ""This system could result from a larger system with a different function whose function was changed through slight changes and then unnecessary parts removed."" This is scaffolding. Somehow you completely ignore this example stating, ""Yeah, but the selective pressures could not have been towards the final ""IC"" system. Therefore, no NS and no evolution."" What!? First off, that really doesn't make sense since we already said the selection is toward an alternate function. Secondly, the selection of the function CAN exist once it emerges in some form from within the non IC system which will later be trimmed down into your definition of IC. The function doesn't have to be fully formed for selection to take over. It only has to have an inkling of a benefit. Freedom, you have by no means won the argument here. You have not demonstrated anything that has even come close to making me think, ""Oh wow, that does look designed"" and have supplied not even a satisfactory hypothetical example of IC. Instead, leaves falling off of trees caused by falling bricks? Where is your brain? You think I can't prove that false? I can prove that false in the same way I can prove the Bible false: by proving the way things REALLY are. EVIDENCE FOR EVOLUTION Lets see here, evidence for evolution - The fossil record which stretches back a few billion years and shows that over time the organisms which become fossilized have changed, advanced, developed new functions, new appendages in such a way that fits exactly with what evolution predicts. We find new evidence confirming evolution every day. DNA - which has all the chances in the world to disprove evolution. We only need ONE unexplainable anomaly in the DNA record to debunk evolution. Instead, time after time, DNA studies, both nucleic and mitochondrial continue to fall right in place with what evolution predicts in time frame and physical location. Physical characteristics - In living creatures we see physical characteristics change from niche to niche but any beneficial features remaining unchanged. We see in the breeding of dogs that DRASTIC physical changes can take place over a very short period of time. Further, these features can be selected for and we can get functions from the dogs that dont even exist in nature. We have produced what many would argue is a new species. Extinction - We have INNUMERABLE species of animals and plants in the fossil record that do not exist anymore, just as evolution predicts. There is not enough room on the whole planet to accommodate at the same time populations of all of the species known to have existed. Missing links - Countless times the missing link that evolution predicts must have existed has turned up. Contrary to Christian claims, there are very few gaps in the fossil record. Many times we have pinpointed where the missing link must have lived. Lo and behold we go looking for it and there it is, in the exact fossil layer it should be. Never have we found an anomaly in the fossil record that doesn't make sense to evolution. EVIDENCE FOR ID ""It's just so complicated."" That's all you've got! And you think I going to concede that you won this debate. Don't make me laugh!","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","09:32 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","495"
