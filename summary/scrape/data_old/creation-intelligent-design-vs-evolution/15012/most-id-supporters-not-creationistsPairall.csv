However a Buddhist model of the universe requires a self awareness of the universe itself and a regulating system within it( karma). Karma is just as applicable to all forms of flora and fauna as it is to humans. Just that only humans can recognise it. You wouldnt know Buddhist doctrine from scribblings on a toilet door so I am not surprised you cannot imagine Buddhism accommodating ID or at least a form of it. Your problem is that your imagined god that you think others imagine makes you angry and frustrated....good","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","06:14 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","120"
