He merely thought that Intelligent Lifeforms came here on space ships and influenced the evolution of Already living cells .","Freedom","430975","In other words he fit the definition of an IDer.

"05-29-2011","15012",4,"Stonewall","430969","Buddhism is compatible with a lot of different belief systems. I've even heard of Buddhist Christians.","Xcaliber","430976","Yeah I have too, but they aren't true Buddhists. True Buddhism does not recognize a God. They're merely Christians using various teachings of Buddhism to further understand their own Religion.. Doesn't make them any less Christian. A true Buddhist would never be involved in Creation or ID.","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","12:24 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","47"
"05-29-2011","15012",4,"Xcaliber","430929","In the early 1970s, Crick and Orgel further speculated about the possibility that the production of living systems from molecules may have been a very rare event in the universe, but once it had developed it could be spread by intelligent life forms using space travel technology, a process they called Directed Panspermia Lol.. Nice try but He was just a delusional Atheist Scientist who didn't believe in Creation . He didn't believe in intelligent design any more than I do. He merely thought that Intelligent Lifeforms came here on space ships and influenced the evolution of Already living cells. He also supported Darwinism, so he didn't exactly fit the intelligent design mold. Intelligent design is the proposition that ""certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection.""It is neo-creationism, a form of creationism restated in non-religious terms.It is also a contemporary adaptation of the traditional teleological argument for the existence of God, but one that deliberately avoids specifying the nature or identity of the intelligent designer. Its leading proponentsall of whom are associated with the Discovery Institute, a politically conservative think tank believe the designer to be the Christian God Intelligent design was developed by a group of American creationists who revised their argument in the creationevolution controversy to circumvent court rulings such as the United States Supreme Court Edwards v. Aguillard ruling, which barred the teaching of ""creation science"" in public schools as breaching the separation of church and state","Atlas","430979","I know of the origin of ID, irrelevant, I know that Crick wasn't a IDer, irrelevant, I do not doubt natural selection (aka Darwinism). In fact, given trillions of years, and a solution to abiogensis (or lack thereof), simple life might arise naturally. The fact is, given the time frame, life would be impossible with out interference. I could postulate until the cows come home how it came about, but that doesn't mean I know the answer.","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","12:43 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","48"
"05-29-2011","15012",4,"Xcaliber","430958","I never claimed to Know what Buddhism is all about, but I know that The Buddhist Religion Does not believe in a Creator or any kind. They believe that questions pertaining to the origin of life are a waste of time. Taking that into consideration you would be wrong in your assertion that Buddhism could be involved in Intelligent Design. Creationism, Although not specific to the Biblical God still maintains that a higher being Created Life. Intelligent Design was created to by a group of creationists.. You are wrong, get over it. Are YOU frustrated yet?.. I hope so...","gansao","430985","My assertion is not that they could be involved with intelligent design.creationism you imbecile. My assertion is that intelligent design could be accommodated withinn Buddism by karma and samsara...way way way over your head lol Yes I am frusterated..I dont suffer fools like you gladly . The trouble is that there are more XXXXXX like you than cockroaches","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","05:14 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","49"

Christian Buddhists accept Christ as an enlightened one without recognising his divinity( or any divinity). Not Christian as you see it but Christian all the same..there are some CHRISTIANS who doubt that Christ was devine. Can you chew gum and fart at the same time? I doubt it. You wouldnt know a true Buddhist if you fell over one","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","05:20 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","50"

I suppose you would know all about Buddhism given the fact that you continuously defend your ""GOD"" .. oh wait.. You don't know XXXX about Buddhism. True Buddhism cannot and would not support ID/Creation ..

They are one and the same after-all..

A buddhist who concentates on the teachings of a supposed buddha..in this case christ..could by definition call themselves a buddhist christian or a christian buddhist. You have demonstrated that you not only do not understand Christianity or buddhism you do not understand English either. YOU are far closer to the character of EZ that you throw around as an insult to others. So stop being like your fantasy EZ and start using your brain cell.
