A good designer would leave out all the parts we do not need. If you think about things that are wrong with humans like your back (many many people have back problems) or your tendency to really enjoy sugar, fat, carbohydrates and overeating or the fact that our air supply tube also doubles as the food delivery tube (gives us a venerability to choking) and so on you will begin to realize that the designer is a very bad designer and should be fired along with the theory of ID. All of these failings can be explained by evolution but not by ID.","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","01:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","4"

Sorry to break your heart but if you believe in intelligent design you are a creationist. If there is an intelligent designer then that implies an intelligent high power creating .. where else does design come from?.. ID'ers began calling themselves that to distance themselves from Creation, because they realized the futility of getting Creationism put back into public schools. They've since broken up into several factions.. Young earth creationists, Id'ers. And so forth.. but at the end of the day there is a designer involved therefore that is Creation. Don't be ashamed to call yourself a creationist like Freedumb, it'll eat at you until you can admit who you are.","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","05:08 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","6"

ID is a failed attempt at a pseudo-scientific creationist revival.","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","03:09 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","8"

Please try harder to describe ToE. It might take going to University, though. Going to put the work in? And, and, and if you posit a designer who is not a self created god who designed the designer?

"02-21-2011","15012",1,"Merry","424436","I am not sure what you mean by ""creationist."" I have difficulty imagining, however, that one can believe in Intelligent Design (ID) without believing in a Design er , and am not clear on the difference between ""creator"" and ""designer."" It is also interesting to note that to design nature, one must be super natural.","Freedom","424444","There isn't a clear one from the base meanings of the words but our culture has defined new words for us. ID = theory of life in which life was designed by an intelligent agent. Creationism = the superiority of religious doctrine over any theory of life. Creationist assertions fit the definition of ID but their epistemology is different. That is to say that the word ID used as opposed to creationism is meant to mean all those IDrs who are not creationist, which are IDrs who think there is a rational scientific theory as opposed to a faith based one. There is no evidence for ID, however; so all of this fuss is really about the scientific right to 'consider' ID theories. Could you please define supernatural and then spell out the logic you used?","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","12:11 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","15"
