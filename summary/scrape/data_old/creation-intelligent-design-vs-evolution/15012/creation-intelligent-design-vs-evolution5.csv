I just happen to agree with the the fact that you're wrong. You should feel better now knowing you and your buddy EZ have something in common.","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","10:55 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","61"

I didn't make that up idiot.","gansao","431011","You are the idiot because you cant get beyond your default definition. It doesnt matter if the idea of ID without a creator god is preposterous, that in itself it does not exclude the idea of a creatorless notion of ID.","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","10:56 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","62"

So why don't you enlighten us all with your brilliance and tell us exactly how you would explain Intelligent Design without the use of a Intelligent Designer/Creator... And you call ME stupid? that's Hilarious...","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","11:05 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","64"

The intelligence would be inate insofar as the laws of karma always produces a logical (and calculated) reaction to any action. Samsara would accommodate the continuous cycle of life where the laws of karma operate Is this too complex for you? An truly infinite universe negates the existence of a creator god anyway","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","11:18 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","66"

I've not been ignorant since I opened my eyes to reality and stopped living in a world of delusion... Unfortunately you haven't evolved to this level as of yet, you're still stuck in the world of delusion...

"05-29-2011","15012",5,"Freedom","431021","I have been attempting to correct your mistake, and I know I have failed at that. I have explained quite clearly in this thread post 15 what the relationship between ID and creationism is. You had nothing to say but counter-assertion. You are... simply.. unwilling to consider a term with the meaning of ID.","Xcaliber","431024","You can't correct a mistake unless one has happened ... I fully understand what the relationship between ID and Creation is. Intelligent Design is Creationism.. YOU are the one who fails to understand . How many times do you have to be proven wrong before you stop trying?...","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","01:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","71"
"05-29-2011","15012",5,"gansao","430985","My assertion is not that they could be involved with intelligent design.creationism you imbecile. My assertion is that intelligent design could be accommodated withinn Buddism by karma and samsara...way way way over your head lol Yes I am frusterated..I dont suffer fools like you gladly . The trouble is that there are more XXXXXX like you than cockroaches There is no ID theory that can be made, it is a theological assumption not a scientific one.","Xcaliber","431026","And you call me the Imbecile... I point you to your own words idiot... Found here in case you have trouble remembering.. http://www.4forums.com/political/cre...tml#post419187 So if ID is a theological assumption , (which btw I have maintained throughout this discussion) , then how could it be involved in a non-theological religion?.. As your buddy EZ would say... Busted...","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","01:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","72"

ID - certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause Deal with it. I understand quite well that you are just going to keep asserting that ID is creationism till you turn blue in the face and never, ever make an argument towards that effect. Once.","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","03:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","73"

ID - certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause Deal with it.","Xcaliber","431033","And the difference Is? ""Intelligent Cause"" That implies an Intelligent Form of Some kind Being involved. Id'ers Are notorious for being very specific not to mention a Higher Life Form or Supernatural Being as being that ""Intelligent Cause"" Fact.. A Inanimate Object does not have ""Intelligence"" I hope you will at least agree. Plus the Known fact that Intelligent Design was brought about by a group of Creationists who were XXXXXX because Creation Science is not allowed to be taught in schools. They have been trying to pass off Intelligent Design as Actual Science yet they fail to produce one shred of Scientific Data to back their theory. Intelligent Design IS neo Creationism.. Deal with that.","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","04:56 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","74"
