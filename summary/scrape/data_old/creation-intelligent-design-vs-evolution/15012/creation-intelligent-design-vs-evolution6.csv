Found here in case you have trouble remembering.. http://www.4forums.com/political/cre...tml#post419187 So if ID is a theological assumption , (which btw I have maintained throughout this discussion) , then how could it be involved in a non-theological religion?.. As your buddy EZ would say... Busted...","gansao","431039","It still does not mean it is creationism Einstein. Buddhism is a religion and its teaching can be seen as theological( I take the view of Jose Ignacio Cabezon). Buddhism does not recognise a creator god but its teachings would accomodate ID. Your basic premise is that ID is creationist .I have refuted this and basically eaten your lunch so you are trying as hard as your little brain allows to try to nail me. It would not matter if Buddhism was not a theology or even a religion..it would still accomodate ID if it were considered a philosophy therefore the notion of ID is not exclusively creationist. Yes I do call you an imbecile and you have done nothing so far to make me doubt it You have a vey unhealthy obsession about EZ is it because he makes you feel ashamed because you are gay?","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","06:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","76"
"05-29-2011","15012",6,"Xcaliber","431019","Keep telling yourself that.. It won't become any more real but if it keeps you busy And makes you feel good oh well....","gansao","431040","So it was too complex for you.....","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","06:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","77"

"05-29-2011","15012",6,"Freedom","431042","Post 15, this thread read it. That is because they foolishly hope that people like you are asking in good faith and want to know the difference. The truth is that even though you know the difference, even though you have practically spelled it out; you still claim it doesn't exist. What more can a rational person do but sigh in disappointment? I agree, meaning ID implies a designer or agent of intelligence. That is irrelevant even if true. They have a lot of work to do if they are going to match the damage done to young minds by irrational evolution and anthropogenic climate change. Prove it. I continue to try because that is what I signed up for. I have not been proven wrong or else I would as you have pointed out stopped holding the position.","Xcaliber","431047","You have been proven wrong, you just refuse to accept it so you keep trying to convince yourself that it's not true.. Intelligent Design is just another name for Creationism, that is a known fact to anyone who lives in reality.","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","07:32 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","80"

ID was born out of Creationism.. ID is not excepted among the Majority of the Scientific Community as Science .. The Supreme court has ruled on several occasions that ID is just another form of Creationism and this is why it is not allowed to be taught to school kids... ID relies on a Intelligent Designer.. which is another way to say Creator ... ID IS CREATIONISM.. you got it now ?..
