Aside from the sheer idiocy of that argument as it completely ignores physics, oil and gas deposits should, under that theory, be randomly scattered or should be evenly distributed everywhere.

But consider a hypothetical situation where we find life on another planet. Evolutionary theory predicts what we should expect if life here and there had a common ancestor. If those predictions are confirmed, it would suggest some form of panspermia. If they are not, it would suggest life arose independently in different places.

Secondly, your question is loaded since you wont accept inventions or scientific discoveries by christians based on their faith in God. From the George Washington Carver link above; here is what it say's about him. A devout Christian, Carver considered his laboratory ""God's Little Workshop."" He discovered that peanuts and soybeans would restore soil fertility, but farmers complained that they had no market for these products. To provide markets, Carver developed 300 products from peanuts and 118 from sweet potatoes. By 1940 peanuts had become the South's second largest crop. During World War II he developed 500 dyes. Archangel It is fair to say that had he not been a believer in God, ie a creationist, he may never have had the curiosity or the creativity to see the 300 products which came from Peanuts and 118 from sweet potatoes, hundreds of uses for soy Soybeans, George Washington Carver or the 500 dyes he invented. And remember, this was a second class citizen who rose above his station in life and accomplished more than the vast majority of whites who had unlimited opportunities in life. In 1916 he was honored by being appointed to the Royal Society of Arts in London. In 1923 he received the NAACP's prestigious Spingarn Medal. In 1938 a feature film, Life of George Washington Carver , was made. Before his death in 1943, he received the Roosevelt Medal for Outstanding Contribution to Southern Agriculture. The Hall of Fame for Great Americans inducted him in 1977. The National Inventors Hall of Fame included him in 1990. Carver's dedication to God and his people led him to patent only three of his 500 agricultural inventions because he wanted his products to benefit all. He left his life savings to Tuskegee Institute. So I don't know how you can say that these inventions aren't the result of creationism since the man who invented those products lived his life according to the principles of creationism, the bible and the God he believed was the author of life.","commercial-products-creationism","09:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","58"

It say's nothing at all about the truth of creationism and the eternal truths it is based upon. Throughout his life, Carver maintained that the master analyst needs no book; he is at liberty to take apart and put together substances, compatible or non compatible to suit his own particular taste or fancy. Nevertheless, his reliance on divine revelation instead of scientific methods often put him at odds with the scientific community. His deep religious faith was also important. In his speeches and interviews, he almost always referred to the Bible and divine guidance. His accomplishments, he was fond of saying, were not his doing but were the work of God. As he told a reporter for the Atlanta Journal who questioned him about the permanency of the clay paints he had developed: Why should they not be permanent? God made the clay in the hills; they have been there for countless generations, changeless. All I do is prepare what God has made, for uses to which man can put it. It is God's work-not mine. For him to make a statement like that, that God made the clay in the hills; he obviously believed that God made everything. Made it for mans use and all George did was utilize what God had given us. Had he not been a creationist, he wouldn't have thought that way and may have remained just another unknown oppressed ex-slave for his lifetime. My point is that as a result of his creationist convictions, the world of possibilities opened to him regarding the products he created from things like clay, peanuts, soybeans and sweet potatoes. And had he just invented a couple of products from each of these food sources, that in itself would have been impressive, and he still would be famous considering that he was born a slave. But he invented hundreds of uses for each product becoming an industry unto himself. No oc, to claim that Carvers creationism beliefs played no part in his inventions from natural products, or that he was a true scientist rather than a creationist, contradicts what he himself believed and said when he openly told anyone he lectured that he was only finding the uses God designed in creating the food products He gave us.

Carver undoubtedly interpreted everything he did and saw according to his creationist beliefs. It even seems likely that they inspired him to look for uses for things. Is that enough? Does that make his inventions commercial products of creationism? I'm teetering between yes and no, and here's why: Aerodynamic theory tells us what to expect if we construct an aircraft with a particular wingspan and profile etc etc - and it's a good theory because it works: we get the results we expect. Creationism led Carver to believe that if he looked he would find many applications for natural products, and that also turned out to be true. So in very, very general sense one could claim equivalency. On the other hand... if a belief that there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow leads you to spend all your time chasing them across fields, and as a result you spot a valuable Roman coin jutting out of the soil which turns out to be part of a vast treasure, is it correct to describe your find as a commercial application of a belief in pots of gold at the ends of rainbows? Sounds tenuous, doesn't it? Because if the Romans hadn't dropped a load of coins in that field, no amount of belief in fairy gold would have enabled you to find them. Conversely, you could have been in that field for any reason at all and still spotted the coin - or you could just as easily have found a dinosaur fossil instead of a coin. So the causal linkage between belief and outcome is really flimsy. About the most we can say is that if a belief encourages you to have an enquiring mind, it deserves some credit for what that mind achieves. Are those achievements commercial products of that belief, in the same way as planes are commercial products of aerodynamic theory? I think I have to say no: planes work because aerodynamic theory is in fact correct, whereas Carver's inventions were the product of him behaving as if his beliefs were correct. To put it another way, his beliefs didn't actually need to be correct in order for him to achieve what he did, whereas if aerodynamic theory were wrong planes built according to its principles would fall out of the sky.

Clever atheist scientists seem to do this often - blend micro vs macro evolution so they can seamlessly switch back and fourth to confuse facts from one to support theories for the other. Carl Wieland uses this example; Has AIDS evolved? ""Are the observed changes, on analysis, heading in the right direction? That is, are they the type of changes which, given enough time, would be capable of producing a massively complex organism like a horse from a one-celled creature?"" The horizontal hopping of evolution has produced things like flu vaccines. The vertical hopping of common descent has produced nothing. (so far in this thread anyway) There are worlds of difference between the two. To try to blend them is misleading. How long will the demands keep coming, while we see no examples of common descent evolution as a science being commercialized? Is this an indicator of how science in general makes demands of ID that are far above and beyond what they require of common descent evolution? Since evolution has been the dominant theory of biology for more than a century, it's a safe statement that all of the wonderful innovations in medicine and agriculture that we derive from biological research stem from the theory of evolution. Recent, exciting examples are humanized antibodies like Remicade for inflammation and Herceptin for breast cancer, both initially made in mice. Without our knowledge of the evolution of mice and humans and their immune systems, we wouldn't have such life-saving and life-improving technologies. Another specific example is resistant bacterial infections, one of the scariest threats to public health. The ones that are resistant to antibiotics are more reproductively successful than their non-resistant relatives and pass the new resistance genes on to more offspring. Just as Darwin said 150 years ago. The creationists have devised a tortuous work-around for this phenomenon, which endorses natural selection and survival of the fittest, but says that evolution doesn't explain the original development of species. The problem is, there are hundreds of genes that occur in both bacteria and humans. It's hard to see why a designer would do it that way, since having the same genes in bacteria and humans makes infections harder to treat: drugs that act on bacterial gene products act on the human versions as well, so those drugs could kill both the bacterium and the human host. Talk about throwing the baby out with the bathwater. So evolution has some pretty exciting applications (like food), and I'm guessing most people would prefer antibiotics developed by someone who knows the evolutionary relationship of humans and bacteria.","Peeling","334158","The idea that there could be two 'kinds' of evolution has long baffled me. The plain fact is that the chimp genome, for instance, and the human genome differ by a finite number of base pairs - or more correctly they both differ by finite numbers of base pairs from their common ancestor. What do you think would happen if we took chimp DNA, manually made all the individual changes so as to make it identical to human DNA, and grew an organism from it? That's right: you'd get a human . And since we also know for a fact that every single one of those changes can occur naturally, the idea that there could be a micro/macro divide is absurd. Yes. Single celled organisms have been observed to evolve 'clumping' behaviour in the lab, which is a plausible first step towards multicellularity. Even that is pretty remarkable, when you consider what Carl fails to take into account: that there are almost certainly no cells around today like those which evolved into multicellular creatures half a billion years ago. That ship has sailed and we're on it. On the contrary, to pretend that there is a difference is misleading. I could change chimp DNA into human DNA one base pair at a time, and at no point would you be able to stop me and say 'ah ah, that was macro evolution'. Of course, in reality chimp and human DNA both diverged from the DNA of a common ancestor; one did not change into another. But I could in principle 'rewind' the genetic changes experienced by chimps, one at a time, and then wind forward those experienced by humans, one at a time, and turn a chimp into a human via their common ancestor using 'micro' evolution alone. No, marc, it isn't. I explained quite a few posts ago the relationship between evolutionary theory and common descent. Mushing the phrases together into 'common descent evolution' is like demanding a commercial application for 'relativity GPS'. GPS has commercial applications, and its accuracy is made possible by our understanding of relativity and the speed of light. Similarly, evolution's commercial applications are possible because the appreciation of common descent - knowing what problem the theory had to solve - guided the development of the theory and led us down the right track. And in return, evolutionary theory made predictions that confirmed common descent and allowed us to make progressively better and finer judgements as to the shape of the tree of life. From the link above: Every modern product of biotech owes its existence to our appreciation of the fact of evolution. Every hardy or disease-resistant strain of crops, too. Not to mention the banana - although we didn't really understand what we were doing back then, we still grasped the basic principle of keep and breed what you want and discard what you don't. Nature supplied the tasty mutation, and in its environment - consisting of lots of hungry people - that mutation thrived and is now the world's most popular fruit. Spin-offs of evolutionary theory are rendering the graphics on your monitor as you read this text: today's computer chips are not designed, but evolved using the principles we observe in nature. But ok, let's try and find a commercial application for common descent specifically. It's actually not all that hard: paleontology. Fossil hunting is made more efficient in terms of both time and money by our understanding of common descent: it tells us where to look to stand a chance of finding the fossils we're interested in. I believe the challenge - delivered in lieu of an answer to the original question posed by this thread - has been well and truly met. Any chance of getting that answer now?","commercial-products-creationism","08:52 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","72"

Im not necessarily singling you out personally - you seem to be one of many who prefer to speak of biological evolution as one process. As Wikipedia tells us; The idea that there could be two 'kinds' of evolution has long baffled me. The horizontal hopping of evolution has produced things like flu vaccines. The vertical hopping of common descent has produced nothing. "" Almost certainly""? (no cells around like those which first evolved into multicellular creatures) Almost is good enough in handgrenades, horseshoes, and evolution? (rewinding and winding chimps into humans via common ancestor) So if you start with the assumption of a common ancestor and work backwards from that, micro vs macro is moot? It gets more and more dominating all the time doesnt it? Is the day almost here when we can throw out the word biology like we largely have with micro and macro, and just call it all evolution? The more broad the term, the easier it is to use it as a weapon against religion, right? Todays computer chips are not designed? Did you really say that? No wonder everything we see and do is evolutionary. I shudder to think of what life on earth would be like if we didn't reject the book of Genesis. fossil hunting is all you have? The word commercial involves business, profits, sales to the general public etc, not methods of study. Is the answer youre looking for a commercial product of creationism? Everything Archangel showed you has been thrown out? In post #67, you said you were teetering between accepting/rejecting what Archangel proposed about George Washington Carvers creationist products. Since my post #70 (that you are responding to with this post) may have upset you to some degree, did that figure in your decision to reject what AA said about Carver? Would it be safe to say that being upset with someone or some group could increase the chances of rejecting something that they would favor? That evolutionists being upset with creationists could influence their decision to reject ID as science, more than it would if there was an unemotional interest in scientific inquiry? A completely unbiased interest in finding out what the truth is? But on to your question about a commercial product of creation, how about this one Wine. To close, I can show you what is probably the most influential, highest dollar commercial product of evolution of all, This report describes and evaluates animal biotechnology and its application in veterinary medicine and pharmaceuticals as well as improvement in food production. Knowledge of animal genetics is important in the application of biotechnology to manage genetic disorders and improve animal breeding. Genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics are also being applied to animal biotechnology. Transgenic technologies are used for improving milk production and the meat in farm animals as well as for creating models of human diseases. Transgenic animals are used for the production of proteins for human medical use. Biotechnology is applied to facilitate xenotransplantation from animals to humans. Genetic engineering is done in farm animals and nuclear transfer technology has become an important and preferred method for cloning animals.","Peeling","334496","I appreciate your helpfulness, but I think maybe I wasn't sufficiently clear earlier: You spoke of micro and maco evolution as if they represented motion in two independent axes - you even used analogies to that effect: But micro and macro evolution are matters of degree, not direction. That's why I said there aren't two 'kinds' of evolution. That's why I said there's no micro/macro divide. That's why I said I could rewind/wind a chimp into a human without you ever being able to stop me and say that the change I just made was ""unobserved macro evolution"". Do you understand? I'm not sure what you want from me here, or why you think this is significant. There may be cells around very similar to those ancestral to multicellular organisms, but it seems unlikely given the timescales and mutation rates involved. Not being personally acquainted with every single-celled organism on the planet I feel it would be presumptuous to claim absolute certainty No, that's not it at all. I was just being careful not to propagate the myth that chimps evolved into humans. You demanded commercial applications for evolution. I gave them to you. Now our understanding of evolution has been... too useful? I'd call it paranoia if I didn't know you only say these things to wind me up I appreciate that the debunking of Genesis looms large on your personal horizon, but it's hubris to suppose that was anything other than an incidental by-product. You're like the guy stuck in a traffic jam railing against the police cars and ambulances up ahead who are making you late. As for computer chips, the latest 'designs' really are the product of evolutionary algorithms. Their complexity is so high and the tolerances so fine that - short of actually building them - simulating them at a very low level is the only way to judge their performance. In order to reflect reality accurately enough, the computer model of the chip becomes so complex that the only way to predict if it's going to be good is to simulate it working - and the effect of small changes are also so subtle and complex that the only way to predict the result of making them is, again, simulation. In other words, the notion of trying to work out how to make the chip better evaporates because that 'working out' inevitably becomes a process of simulating alternatives. Does a map have commercial applications? Not according to you it doesn't. The time and fuel it saves lorry drivers because they don't have to drive down every road in the country looking for their delivery address doesn't count, apparently Yes. Yes. And you'll note the conclusion I reached: that while his creationist beliefs could be credited with fostering within him an enquiring mind, it is not equivalent to the credit due to the principles of aerodynamics for commercial air travel. Specifically, Aerodynamic theory has to be right in order for commercial air travel to be possible. Carver's creationist beliefs did not have to be right in order for his investigations to yield the results they did. No. I didn't even reject it; I merely drew what I think is a valid distinction between theories that need to be right in order to yield useful results, and those that need not. The credit due to the theory in each case is, I hope you would agree, of a different nature. Of course. I thought I'd agreed as much long ago! What I disagree with are the illogical leaps you proceed to make from that observation: that because emotion can influence decisions the decision to reject ID as science must be entirely emotional and, furthermore, must be wrong . Neither is true. A decision made for emotional reasons can still be, upon sober reflection, logically correct. Also, a person can be emotionally motivated to logically disprove something, which provides a sink for the emotions you claim run so high in the 'evolutionist camp' without compromising the validity of their arguments. I don't think you appreciate almost all of the negative emotion provoked by creationism and ID within the scientific community is professional rather than philosophical in nature. You simply assume that because you are primarily angered philosophically by evolution, the same must apply in reverse. The raison d'etre of science is to produce theories that work. It doesn't matter how much you love or hate an idea, or why, your emotions can't force it to yield good predictions. It will only work if it's genuinely a good theory. Right now, ID doesn't work, and that's why it's excluded from the science classroom. The fact it ticks emotional boxes for you, while evolution might tick emotional boxes for some hypothetical idea-of-god-hater, is irrelevant. And I'm not, by the way. An 'idea-of-god' hater, I mean. It's just that none of the gods I've heard about make any kind of sense when put in context (as a real thing, that is; they make perfect sense as conjured reflections of our own nature), and I think if there is such a thing as god it should make sense. I think this falls into a similar category as AA's examples: the bible doesn't have to be right in any important respect (Genesis least of all) in order for it to have influenced the sales and development of grape-based beverages. It was at the very outside an inspiration for more people to apply what are, in the end, scientific methodologies to the improvement of wine-making.

Destroying religion is the not an incidental by-product of evolution - it's in first place on evolutions 'to do' list. (evolutionary design in industry) And we would have never been able to figure this out without a belief in common descent of living things? Hunting LEADS TO maps. If youre giving evolution sequential leeway like that, I wouldnt have problems coming up with products that the creation story has come up with in the Bible. Gods creating things led to mans motivation to create things. Noah built a pretty impressive ship. Without the creation story, would we not know how to build ships? Thats just a s ridiculous as your implication that we wouldnt be able to build computer chips without billions of year biological evolution. The Wright brothers didnt have to know a thing about evolution to make their first plane fly. Neither did those who improved on it over the future decades. If evolution inspires the development of a commercial product, the evolutionist who was inspired didnt have to know for sure if it was right - all it may have been was an inspiration to try it. And it could have been just an ideological inspiration that didnt really require the first hypothesis to be right. Billions of year evolution doesn't have to be right for small changes to be utilized in the development of computer chips. I don't think it's that easy to draw that distinction. I think were coming to the conclusion that a belief in evolution can inspire commercial products to a very comparable extent to the way a belief in creation can inspire commercial products. Ive never said they must be, Ive said they may be. No, I see it in evolutionists, and I provided the proof above. If I continue to provide evidence of self motivated (not reactionary) political action by evolutionists, Different people have different definitions of what works. The Biblical account of creation, male and female - how they relate to each other - works pretty well. Its a worldview thing. That all the good and bad, the twists and turns, the complications of this one little planet happened as a cosmic accident with no purpose doesnt make a bit of sense to me at all.","Peeling","335006","I apologise; I spoke unclearly. There is no micro/macro divide in the sense you used earlier, in terms of genetic or phenotypic changes: there is no 'lateral' and 'vertical' evolution of which we see one but not the other. I refer you to the same diagram as I did with AA: Macroevolution concerns changes at the species level and above. That doesn't mean it refers to genetic changes that turn organisms into new species. Do you appreciate the distinction? When part of species 'A' migrates, becomes reproductively isolated, and undergoes microevolution to the point it no longer can or does interbreed with other descendents of 'A' even when they encounter each other, speciation is said to have occurred, and that whole process constitutes macroevolution. One might as well ask why it took so long to come up with something as simple as E=MC2 It might seem obvious after the fact, but a lot of careful science lies behind our current understanding of the processes of speciation and the vital role played by factors like reproductive isolation. That's irrelevant. I wouldn't need to make one single change of a type not already observed occuring naturally in the lab. I would be 'intelligently' mimicking natural events - the outcome would be the same either way. That's absolutely fair comment - which is why I tried to remember to say 'in principle' I have no idea what the series of microevolutionary changes would be to rewind a chimp and wind the common ancestor forward into a human being. However, we do know that 1) none of the differences are impossible to achieve naturally, and 2) there's overwhelming evidence that parallel evolution from a common ancestor did in fact happen. Imagine you're shown the following evidence: two guys going into a room carrying a deck of cards and a wad of cash each. Then several snapshots from inside the room, showing the guys playing poker and one of them with a bigger and bigger stack beside him. Finally, you see both guys leave, one with all the cash and the other with none. You know perfectly well what has happened, even if you can't reconstruct every single hand dealt. That's analogous to the situation we find ourselves in with human evolution: we see an inarguable fossil convergence of human and primate lineages, backed up to the hilt by analysis of genetic differences between us and the other great apes. Well, no, because it's an impossible demand and a meaningless exercise to boot. DNA evidence helps convict murderers who might have been convicted on the strength of other evidence anyway. It's not possible to say for sure exactly which convictions depend utterly upon DNA evidence, but we can say it leads to more successful convictions. Similarly, would our knowledge of biology be as advanced as it is now without an understanding of evolution? No. Having read hardly any of the books you listed, I couldn't say - although if The God Delusion is a representative example I'm happy to go along with the premise that analysing the shortcomings of religion is a central theme. Even so, they too are little more than a corollary; a sideshow - just like our discussion here. There the focus is clearly upon rebutting creationism in its various pseudo-scientific guises, not upon pulling apart Genesis. As are the others you linked: Of course it's reactionary. But it's not a reaction to a philosophy, it's a reaction to the published results of a methodology and the fact those results are contributing to lots and lots of successful science. It's often said evolution encroaching on religious territory, but that's not true. It merely falsifies narratives of natural history you've decided to entangle with your spiritual beliefs. Science doesn't get to choose which theories agree with the universe, and it doesn't get to choose what is written in the bible. If the universe contradicts the bible, there's only one possible source of error. If the bible had contained an accurate narrative of the natural history of Earth, science would have confirmed it - or at the very least, it would have confirmed that it was within the bounds of possibility. Has the bible's inaccuracy proved a boon for atheists? Yes, but I don't think it's justified in the final analysis. God's existence (or otherwise) does not depend upon the accuracy of what we believe about him or about the way he's done things. I think the human race will eventually come to terms with the reality of common descent, and everyone will carry on much as they did before, no doubt downplaying the significance of the whole embarrassing affair, much as we do now with Galileo. It's impossible to say 'never' with certainty, but I think it very unlikely. Would we have developed flight if there were no birds or winged insects to put the idea in our heads? A truly vast proportion of what we now take for granted as 'human inventions' can be traced back to the observation of a natural phenomenon, which tends to suggest that inspiration from nature was required for our development of evolutionary algorithms. I think you're wandering off topic here. You demanded a commercial application for common descent. I pointed out that our knowledge of common descent saves paleontologists time and money by helping them focus their efforts. That's a direct consequence of a very specific bit of knowledge, which has to be right in order to achieve the benefit it does. It doesn't matter what 'lead to' the creation of maps; the point is that maps have direct commercial application. I'm not invoking any sequential leeway at all. One could as easily say that man's habit of creating of things motivated him to invent a god who created things. Even if we don't go that far, it's only necessary to believe god greated things in order to be inspired to emulate him. That belief, unlike the contents of a map or our knowledge of common descent, does not have to be correct to yield the benefits described. That wasn't my implication. Evolutionary principles allow us to make modern computer chips, just like relativity enables us to make accurate GPS. The exact same universal principles Darwin perceived operating in nature. True up to a point - but not any more. These days plane designs are modelled, varied, filtered - evolved in a simulator, in short, before ever going into production. Evolution is a way of making things better than we can design them to be via other methods. I even explained why in our other recent thread. Now you're getting the hang of it You're correct that we don't need to have evolved, although we do have to be able to evolve - evolutionary principles do have to work - in order for better computer chips to emerge from the same process. But I never claimed that computer chips were a direct spin-off from our understanding of common descent, only a commercial spin off of evolutionary theory. I'm sure you'd love to come to that conclusion, but in reality there is a clear and straightforward distinction between beliefs that need to be correct in order to bear fruit, and those that do not. So far, every single 'product of creation' has been a 'product whose development was inspired by a belief in creation'. I'm not detracting from the value of that in the slightest - I'm quite prepared to be convinced that belief in god has inspired humanity. But inspiring is not the same as enabling . Aerodynamics enable the construction of working aircraft. Evolutionary principles enable the design of modern computer chips. Our understanding of common descent enables efficient paleontology, as well as inspiring the discovery of evolutionary principles. On the contrary, on several occasions you have laid down your reasoning as to why it's 'clear' that ID is not being excluded on merit, and that reasoning has explicitly excluded any consideration of ID itself. To you, ID is a black box, and it only matters who thinks its empty, not what's actually inside. 'Continue'? When did you start? Books by atheists pulling apart religion don't count at all. If you sincerely believe your neighbour is selling snake-oil, isn't it a reaction to attempt to warn people off? In what sense? You mean in the sense that woman was created for no other purpose than to keep man company? That she wasn't worth creating in her own right? Sorry, I'm just not following what's supposed to 'work' about that particular narrative. Does it continue to 'work' when you factor in the gill slits we develop as embryos, or the tail we grow and (usually) reabsorb? And that's absolutely fine - I wouldn't dream of claiming that you are certainly wrong. Now, me personally, I don't see that postulating a god for whom we serve a purpose solves anything, because it only begs the question: if you need to be created for a purpose in order to have one, what's god's purpose? After all, a common anti-atheist slippery-slope argument is to say that if there's no god, then all our works are ultimately purposeless so we might as well not bother. But our works serve our purposes; if that isn't good enough, then us serving god's purpose isn't good enough either, unless he has a purpose, defined by something else - and so on. And if you say it's sufficient for us to have a purpose, that so long as there's a rung higher than us on the ladder, we can be happy in our place - well, society occupies that higher rung, just as you occupy the rung above the individual cells of which your body is composed. The core issue, though, is that all this philosophical 'worldview' stuff regarding purpose has nothing to do with the literal truth of genesis, which is a (so far as we can tell, fictional) narrative of natural history . Let's forget evolution for a moment, and stop pretending that it's a black-and-white choice between it and biblical literalism. Just examine genesis on its own. I'm sure you'll agree that as a narrative it could be wrong in every respect, and yet god could still be responsible for our existence, still take a personal interest in our lives, still judge our behaviour, still have sent Jesus to us. So why should the fact that it is wrong in most respects give you a moment's pause? I would hazard a guess that you simply like believing you possess an infallible spiritual manual, by which you can live your life and everything will be OK. I think that in the end it's that you're loath to abandon, and everything else is a convenient and plausible-sounding distraction.","commercial-products-creationism","08:05 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","89"

It's an impossible demand because of what I said in my previous post You dont have to carefully read each book to come to the conclusion that they analyze the shortcomings of religion - the titles of them, and internet reviews and comments clearly tell us that. They also clearly tell us that analyzation isnt the only motive of the books, they tell us that moving on / disregarding religion is in society's best interests. I have a copy of Stenger's ""God Delusion"" book - in the final chapter he gets around to put downs of US Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia, as well as president Bush. The innocence of the science of evolution can quickly get into one-sided politics, it seems. It all makes sense, except for one little problem; Why do all these Christians say nothing when evolution is used as a weapon against their religion by atheists? They're just passive like that? I'm supposed to really believe that? It's completely impossible for them to be pretend Christians? (Various social issues supposedly caused by evolution) Do you deny that these things are happening? (Universe vs Literal Genesis - only one loser) Theres no possible source of error in those humans who are observing the universe? It's impossible to say with certainty what commercial products we wouldn't have (if any) because of Darwinism. We don't need it to observe birds and get ideas about flying. As the wedge document introduction said, the belief in the God of creation gave us the bedrock principles on which Western civilization was built. Atheists don't agree of course. It's subjective. Inspire vs enable? Evolution inspires AND enables, and creation/religion only inspires? And sometimes I'm told that science and religion are completely unrelated. Why don't they ""count""? The double standard is amazing! I ""started"" when I showed that evolutionists are angered philosophically by religion!

I think you've grabbed the wrong end of the stick here. The 'snapshots' in the analogy represent the available evidence from the natural world. The deduction that the men were playing poker for money is the narrative we construct to tie that evidence together. If you wanted to bring Creationism into the analogy, it would be an alternative story about what went on in that room, one which didn't mention cards or poker at all No, it's impossible because you can't always second-guess what might have happened had things been other than they are. And do you think that opinion should be suppressed? That religion should be exempt from analysis or criticism? I don't think that is what you're angling for, but if not that, what? I haven't read the put-downs in question so I can't comment on their nature. Did Stenger say evolution proved Bush's foreign policy was terrible? Probably not You're still failing to grasp the core truth in all this: the fact of common descent could not be used against religion if that religion got it right in the first place. If the bible or any other religious manual had told a story that matched what we can plainly see around us, the scientific confirmation of evolution would have been a massive boost. jyoshu doesn't say nothing Seriously though, I don't think it's impossible for a person to be a pretend Christian. But I do think it's stretching things somewhat to suppose that every single person who isn't taking up arms against evolution is faking their faith. It seems far more sensible to me to suppose they are following Saint Augustine's advice: preserving the good name of their church and holy book by speaking out against a vocal minority who would shackle its precious spiritual lessons to falsified narratives of natural history. Or consider it thus: as Christians who are also intellectually convinced of the truth of common descent and evolution, what are they supposed to do? Lie? Deny something they themselves understand to be true, in order to score points against atheists? Is that the way it should work - ends justifying the means? I don't think so. I think they understand the way to nullify evolution's potential for use as weapon against religion (a potential, don't forget, that exists only because it is clearly and demonstrably true ) is to show that religion can accommodate it, that evolution isn't a weapon against spiritual beliefs after all. Doesn't that make sense to you? Before anyone can use the truth of evolution as a bludgeon to destroy faith, one must first believe evolution contradicts faith. And what are you and other creationists busy doing? Telling everyone who'll listen that evolution contradicts their faith, and that anyone who says different is a 'pretend Christian'. Way to go I read a fictional book recently where a man - a staunch public critic of modern lax morality and the 'culture of victimhood' - was presented with a dilemma. He was shown two doors and told that behind each was a killer, both of whom had been led to believe that he had provided the evidence that convicted them. The man behind door A had done ten years' hard time as punishment, the one behind door B had been given counselling and rehabilitation. To escape, all the man had to do was pick a door, and make it past the killer on the other side to freedom. Which door do you think he picked? Anyway, once again we are wandering off the topic. Whatever social lessons anyone's tried to derive from the fact of our evolution, whether they were correct or not and what effect they've had, is a fascinating subject but not one for this thread. What I will say is: if you're going to criticise secular efforts at building a better society, you need to appreciate that from my point of view, all such efforts are ultimately secular, including the bible, the quran and all other spiritual manuals. The only difference is, they employ loyalty to a deity, rather than loyalty to a country or some other intangible ideal, to bind people together. I have an open mind as to whether that's a good or bad thing, in whole or in part; I'm not obliged to scorn it just because I don't think a personal god exists to be believed in. After all, there are many things we rely upon that exist only by common agreement, money being the classic example. Sure there is. But when mistakes are made, theories don't work - and when they do work, you know you're on the right track. That's how we know the humans who wrote Genesis made mistakes. I didn't say we did. I said that we know about flying because nature did it first, and because that's very often the case with our 'inventions', it's reasonable to suppose commercial products of evolutionary principles also owe their existence to our inspiration from nature. You're right about it being subjective, and the interpretation being worldview-dependent, but you're wrong about why and how. I'm quite happy to be convinced that the principles upon which western civilisation were founded can be traced back to one religion or another. I'm even ready to be convinced that they can be traced back to a belief in a god of creation. I'm not obliged to deny that just because I happen to be an atheist. My view is simply that such a belief, or indeed any religion - just like socialism or communism - is a construct of the human mind. We are their authors. The god of creation doesn't have to actually exist for a belief in him to have the social consequences it allegedly did. That's hardly what I meant Our observation of common descent in nature, like our observation of flying creatures, inspired investigations resulting in the discovery of evolutionary principles, which in turn enabled derivative commercial products. Perhaps the word 'inspired' is wrong; it seems to you to have philosophical and emotional overtones which I didn't intend to apply. 'Clued us in', maybe? Not the same kind of 'inspiration' a fervent belief would supply, anyway. Sorry about that. Except you didn't show that. You showed some atheists are angered by the - to them undeserved - influence religion continues to have over moden thinking. Of course these atheists are evolutionists - but that's not why they write those books. They write them because they believe their neighbour is being sold snake-oil. I'll ask you again: doesn't that count as a reaction? Could you be more specific, maybe? What exactly does Genesis, uniquely, tell us about men and women that has relevance or application? Ooh, bad choice of example! You really think evolution has less to say about the sexes liking and trying to impress each other than the bible? But why? Explain it to me.

"12-10-2008","11843",7,"marc9000","336080","For example, if we got a group of the best scientists on earth - yet foreign to the U.S. and unaware of its history - to search for scientific evidence about details of the U.S. civil war (digging up and examining soldiers bodies, asking their relatives today what they know about the conflict etc) I have no doubt theyd come up with something radically different than the historic writings that have been maintained on it. Over in the other thread, I showed the quotes of one of the Dovertheistic evolutionists who claimed that science cannot touch theology. If science is used as a weapon against it by any prominent figure whatsoever , it really is touching it! Did Stenger say evolution proved Bush's foreign policy was terrible? Yes, on page 246, he said Bushs belief in God caused poor foreign policy. I still believe it, and so do millions of other Americans. Stenger seems to think that it goes without saying that we shouldnt have gone into Iraq. If it were possible to undo all that weve done in Iraq - never have gone in - put Hussein back in power etc. - I think the world would be worse off, and so do millions of other Americans. Just because the good that was accomplished there goes largely unreported in the media doesnt mean it didnt happen. We cant plainly see common descent around us. It may get more and more plain in the minds of those who choose to believe it, but not to everyone. (Theistic evolutionists and their motivation) Yes it does make sense, but only if they completely disregard 2Timothy 3;16, and drop the Bible down several hundred levels, to the point that it becomes equal to human endeavors - subject to human falsification. (Creationists are forcing people into a false dichotomy by saying evolution is incompatible with Christianity) Were telling everyone that some evolutionists can contradict their faith - that there may be some pretend Christians involved. Several places in the Bible warn against false teachings, stressed to the extent that I believe goes further than just a two-way, right-wrong, heaven/hell thing. 2Timothy 4; 3,4; ( The Door Dilemma ) Looks like liberal propaganda to me. Hed pick door B, because that person would be nicer to him since he didnt hold him accountable for his crime. The person he originally killed wasnt important. He was just an accident of evolution. Now if the rehab worked, we can move on and just forget the original victim. If it didnt, hell kill someone else. You dont agree? Most atheists wouldnt, and most theistic evolutionists wouldnt. Maybe there really is something to Timothys warning above. I basically agree, but what I highlighted in your post is very important - loyalty has to be somewhere . If a persons number 1 loyalty isnt with God, then it has to be channeled somewhere else. Maybe in evolution, maybe in global warming alarmism, but quite often in a person, usually a tyrant. Thats what worries me most about atheists - where is their loyalty, and what does the object of their loyalty want from me? (theories that work prove we're on the right track) I dont think thats always true. Fallacies can spawn a whole row of attractive looking things. How far can they go before they fall apart? Sometimes a long way, longer than many people might see in their lifetimes. (It's fair to say observation of common descent and evolution in nature was a necessary prerequisite subsequent understanding of evolutionary principles) Then theyre not exclusively evolutionary! If we can be inspired by things that many people believe God has done, especially if confirmed by the Bible, evolution cant say its contradictions to the book of Genesis provided that inspiration. And its the same with evolution! Common descent didnt have to actually happen for an application of slight, countless modifications to result in computer chips that we have today. You dont agree? Whats the difference? Again, I dont see a bit of difference if faith in evolution clues us in, or if faith in God clues us in. (What exactly does Genesis, uniquely, tell us about men and women that has relevance or application?) That they are unique from animals. The basics in Genesis about man/woman relationships are more detailed in several other places in the Bible, like most of the last (31st) chapter of Proverbs, or most all of the book of Song of Solomon. Yes, a lot less! The Bible shows a distinct elevation of mans behavior over animals - evolution shows no distinction at all. And I think it was a good choice of example! How would ""commercial-products-of-male/female-relationships-as-described-in-the-Bible"" look alongside of commercial products of evolution? Its in that link I gave. But to sum it up as briefly as I can, Genesis says that when things were first created, they were very good. Theres little thats very good about evolutionary development, mostly pain, misery, ghastliness.","Peeling","336176","It's interesting you think that. Excluding the 'asking relatives' part, which would unquestionably introduce personal bias, and assuming the historical accounts are indeed accurate, I can't think of any reason why a scientific investigation of the evidence would contradict them. Can you? Sure, such an investigation might well fail to unearth evidence backing up every single documented historical fact, but that's not the same thing as finding evidence that actively refutes what's in the history books. Like I said to AA, I really don't think we have to agree to disagree here. There are circumstances where you would not hold historical accounts above other kinds of evidence, and I do not automatically take absence of evidence as evidence of absence. If you say you went shopping yesterday, I'll believe you, even if you can't provide the receipts. On the other hand, if I say I flew to the moon yesterday, you'd want some pretty convincing supporting evidence to back up that historical, eyewitness account. Or if I said I went to work yesterday, but you had CCTV footage of me going to a football match, which would you believe? So no, I don't think you can pretend this is a cut'n'dried worldview difference concerning historical testimony, about which we just have to 'agree to disagree'. You extend the bible in particular special treatment. Oooh, no; that's completely wrong. Whether or not something can be leveraged to change or reinforce someone's perception of an issue is quite seperate from whether it has any genuine logical impact. And it works both ways, too: I've long ago lost count of how many completely irrelevant anti-evolution arguments are presented here as 'the last nail in the coffin of a dying theory'. The entire creationist campaign is based on such argumentation. Well then no, he didn't say evolution proved Bush's foreign policy was terrible, did he? Nor did he even say Bush's belief in God caused poor foreign policy. Based on the quote, he said that Bush's belief that he was doing god's work invading another country, and the public's fellow-feeling to that effect, caused and abetted poor foreign policy. It's an appalling misrepresentation on your part, to claim that Stenger sat down and applied 'evolution' to politics. Off-topic, but I think it's wrong to pretend the only alternative to doing exactly what was done was to do nothing. Perhaps an invasion was necessary, perhaps toppling Saddam was necessary. Was it necessary, when a celebrating Iraqi people sponteneously called elections in the wake of the invasion, to veto their choices and install a government hand-picked for their willingness to allow the country's state-owned infrastructure and resources to be strip-mined by American businesses? Was it necessary to put hundreds of thousands of Iraqis out of work, letting their factories and refineries stand idle while using Iraqi state money to pay foreign contractors to import raw materials and services at several times the cost? Contractors who weren't vetted, often had no experience or realistic chance of completing their work, and who scooted out of the country leaving hospitals unbuilt and unequipped as soon as the money ran out? The insurgency was not a response to the invasion, but to the vile economic rape of a country already suffering after years of sanctions, conducted at the point of American guns. Obviously your mileage is going to vary here I think it's true to say that to anyone without a vested interest in common descent not being true, the evidence is clear-cut. I'm not saying it's without consequence. I'm just saying you can do it without being a 'pretend Christian'. What freaks me out a little, still, is how you talk as if the theistic evolutionist's decision to treat the bible as allegorical in some respects, or your decision to treat it as literal truth, makes it so. The bible doesn't become literally true just because you decide to act like it is, just because you think it would be nicer that way. Nor does it become allegorical because of the theistic evolutionist's decision, or become an imaginative secular work because of mine. It is what it is - all we can do is try to make the best possible judgement. And I think it's fair to say that biblical literalism involves the unwarranted exclusion of far, far more evidence than theistic evolution. Ok, but I'm right to say that you both hold and strongly evangelise the view that evolution and Christianity are incompatible, yes? That's an extremely ugly worldview you have there. Demonising atheists and humanists below the point of even qualifying as human. It's quite frightening to know that's what you think of me, and you believe yourself to be my moral superior for thinking like that. Damn right I don't agree. I'd take the time to correct your insulting and offensive characterisation, if the thought of prostrating myself for your approval wasn't too demeaning to stomach right now. Most gods have been tyrants - or rather, that's how the priesthoods have wielded them: obey or suffer. The Christian god is a tyrant. Talking about being 'loyal' to evolution or global warming strikes me as a bit of a non-sequitur though. It's not always possible to just yank one word out of a sentence, cram in another, and still make sense It was something of an epiphany, though, reading the bolded words above. So much about the way you view the issue clicked into place for me. You think of atheists as a collective. It honestly never occurred to me before now to look at things with that particular filter installed. If one assumes atheists are a collective, like Christians or Muslims, it begs the question: where is their manifesto? Where is their bible? Their statement of common purpose? They must have one, because that's how collectives work. So the fact they aren't actively advertising it means it must be sneaky, stealthy and underhand - and the ones who say there is no such manifesto must be lying to cover it up. You summed it up neatly: to what are they loyal, and what does it want from me? And of course one thing most atheists have in common is an acceptance of evolution, making it a convenient lightning-rod for your suspicions. Except... thinking of atheists as a collective is like thinking of people who don't support Manchester United as a collective. It's fundamentally wrong; there's no commonality of purpose, no 'agenda'. Sure, within that sprawling, disparate mass you'll be able to pick out genuine collectives, some of whom (eg the supporters of other teams) might be actively antithetical to Man U, but to assume they're representative of the whole is... well, it looks like paranoia, to those who haven't made the mistake of imagining the collective to exist in the first place. That's why I've been so baffled when you start with evolution and segue off into politics and worldviews and all the rest of it. I haven't the first clue what the political views of other atheists might be, whether they're communist, capitalist, socialist - being an atheist is a decision not to join a collective. Nor am I wedded to evolution, or any particular flavour of it. As the leading explanation for our present form of existence, with plenty of compelling evidence to support it, I find it extremely convincing - but it's not a defining property of my life. I speak up in its defence here, on these forums, partly because I enjoy the mental workout, partly because I appreciate the value of the methods by which evolution was discovered, and partly because I don't like to see collectives with unconvincing manifestos trying to trick people into signing up by propagating misinformation. How very true! Not a terribly compelling argument for hanging onto things when they have fallen apart, though... Sorry, but I really don't understand what you're trying to say here. We saw common descent and evolution in nature, and from that deduced evolutionary principles. It's nothing to do with genesis. What are you trying to say the bible is responsible for, exactly? I do agree. I've been agreeing for several posts now. You just don't seem to be listening Common descent in nature inspired the search for and discovery of evolutionary principles, which in turn enabled commercial products like modern computer chips. If you want me to say it another way, I will: I credit the evolutionary principles with commercial products like modern computer chips. I credit common descent in nature with inspiring the discovery of those principles. Two completely seperate things. Clear? Argh! I'm not saying there is a difference, so long as we're talking about inspiration! The difference is this: a belief in god can inspire someone to accomplish something even if god doesn't exist. The belief can be right or wrong and it makes no odds. An understanding of aerodynamics, on the other hand, can only enable manned flight if the understanding is correct. Imagine a child is about to walk out into traffic without looking. He thinks he hears someone calling him, and stops to look back - narrowly avoiding being run over. Imagine another child, who carefully looks both ways before crossing safely. Neither child got run over, but do they deserve equal credit for this feat? No. The first child didn't have to be right : he just got lucky. Well, the rest of the bible isn't Genesis, so that's hardly relevant to the matter in hand. As for being distinct from animals... for one, that's nothing to do with the relationship between men and women, and for two, we are distinct; obviously so. How is sharing a common biological ancestor with other creatures, in a tree of life ultimately spawned by god, any more demeaning than us all emerging from the mind of the same designer? Who, by the way, clearly re-used all kinds of cobbled-together stuff from other animals in our construction, including any number of broken bits? If the bible said we were created by a different god than the other animals, I could understand the aversion, but this just baffles me. We're still drawing a blank on the relevance of literal genesis to the relationship between men and women. Put those goalposts back where you got them You talked about men liking and wanting to impress women, and women liking and wanting to impress men. Elevation of behaviour over other animals wasn't mentioned - and even if it had been, you're utterly wrong to say that evolution implies we've no reason to behave 'better' than animals. On the contrary, it helps to show us that we are different from animals, physically and mentally, because of the development of that behaviour. Our empathy, our cooperation and commitment to one another, even to complete strangers, is intimately connected with our success and intellectual development and enlightenment as a species. We have morals because morals work. We should endeavour to overcome our base impulses because that path really does lead down to the degradation of the human race - we know because we've spent a million years or more struggling up it Remember what I've been saying, how if the bible was correct science would confirm it? How ironic that it's the bible's spiritual message science has confirmed, yet you're dedicating your free time to insisting that it is wrong. Also, I presume you're referring to marriage as a commercial product inspired by the bible? Fair point - with the caveat that, once again, the bible in no way has to be right for that particular commercial enterprise to succeed. It just has to be believed. Going back to common descent and evolution, you are right that common descent need only be believed in order to have inspired the discovery of evolutionary principles, but those principles have to be correct in order for commercial applications based upon them to succeed. That's the distinction I'm drawing. Which, if they were part of creation, were good. To say otherwise is to second guess god; to apply your human standards to his behaviour and judge it unworthy. If god is perfect it is because he defines perfection, not because he jumps through your hoops.","commercial-products-creationism","12:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","95"

I do extend the Bible special treatment, Ill admit that, but its no different than the way evolutionists extend special treatment to Darwinism. I know the claim is that if something better came along that Darwinism would be abandoned by science, but its not a believable claim in light of the fierce support of Darwinism. Ive lost count of all the anti-creation arguments presented here as the last nail in the coffin for creationists. Peeling: If one assumes atheists are a collective, like Christians or Muslims, it begs the question: where is their manifesto? The Humanist Manifesto Do you have a basic disagreement with it? I do. Its amazing to me that science can claim authority on human behavior.","lesz","336601","There is so much wrong with this screed, that I'll leave it to poor old Peeling to refute at his leisure.... That was about the only thing I agreed with. Yes, Virginia, you can't have evolution without death. You can't have life without death, and you cannot have life without evolution. Let's look at a couple of odd comments: Well, I wouldn't expect a reactionary religious fundamentalist to believe it, because these guys do not think the same way scientists think. But actually, yes... had the scientific evidence accumulated over the last 150 years disproved Darwin, then no biologist today would be a Darwinian. Instead, all biologists are Darwinians because Darwin seems to have got it basically right. Oh, there's things Darwin didn't get right, and there have been developments in non-Darwinian theories of evolution that are important, but Darwin's insight into the power of natural selection to hone design from random variation remains central to biology. Some corpses don't have the sense to stay decently dead! I guess I must not be a ""real"" atheist! I've never read the Humanist Manifesto. Perhaps it's because I have a distrust of documents with ""Manifesto"" in their title, probably because British political parties produce them before elections. Or at least they used to, and they became a bit of a joke. I have read Dawkins and Dennett, of course, but I have also read Hans Kung and Ken Miller. (The meatier manifestos of the American religious right are generally too stomache-churning to attempt.) But there is about as much agreement amongst atheists on political issues as there is among Christians. Atheists are found on the left and the right, and they generally do not base their political philosophy on Darwinism, Social or otherwise. It is actually pretty ironic to see far right apologists condemn evolution for being the source of excesses on the left and right! Apparently, Darwin was the devil incarnate, omnipotent in his ability to corrupt all human endeavor of every political persuasion. Scary, but totally devoid of logic. How can Darwin be responsible for Communist collectivism AND fascist Social Darwinism at the same time? Makes no sense, but then, not much from that corner does. It seems to me that the American religious right, deprived of the godless Commie devil by the economic and political collapse of the former Soviet Union, and the conversion of China to a form of state capitalism, have been casting around for something to get paranoid and sweaty about. So they invent an atheistic monolithic giant whom they can frighten their children (and not incidentally themselves) with. That, and/or gays. They need an enemy to be against. It is amazing to me that anyone can think such twaddle. It's true that scientists are researching human behaviour, and finding evolutionary explanations for some of it. But only an authoritarian mind would leap to the paranoid conclusion that this other monolithic myth, capital-S ""Science"" or scientism, is trying to control behaviour, or claim authority over it. Science, in fact, stands for the antithesis of authoritarianism, which is why the authoritarian mind, especially if it is a religious one, finds science so awkward to handle. Science thrives on skepticism, on challenges to authority. Almost every scientific advance has been built on the corpses of older and more established theories. Science is frequently revolutionary in nature (though of course that isn't its only characteristic), some revolutions being quiet and scarecely noticeable and some upsetting and almost violent. Current scientific orthodoxy regularly gets radically modified or overthrown, only to grow into an orthodoxy in its own right, till the next big idea comes along. The authoritarian mind instinctively revolts against revolutions. It abhors change. It is suspicious of novelty. It fears reform. It adheres rigidly to the status quo, and defers slavishly to whatever it has set up as an authority. In the case of Creationists, the authority they have set up is their interpretation of their bible. It is no wonder they are so resistant to the wonders revealed by science -- science does challenge their chosen authority, and challenges it very effectively. I have not yet read Stenger's book, as I am wary of claims that science can disprove something as evanescent and mythical as a deity. Science might as well try to disprove there's an invisible dragon in Carl Sagan's garage. But Stenger is surely right if he points out that science is incompatible with certain types of religious beliefs, such as those held in America by the right-wing fundamentalists. The book of Genesis cannot be held as literally true, yet compatible with scientific revelation.","commercial-products-creationism","05:26 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","98"
"12-14-2008","11843",7,"marc9000","336591","Yes - the asking relatives part would be very similar to the way scientists seek each others opinions today. Same applications of personal bias. Also, if they missed something important that actually happened, it could cause them to veer down erroneous paths, and come to false conclusions. They could have taken note of how strong the Confederacy was at the beginning, while somehow missing the Unions strengths at the end - missing.General Shermans march through Georgia, etc. Whatever. I do extend the Bible special treatment, Ill admit that, but its no different than the way evolutionists extend special treatment to Darwinism. I know the claim is that if something better came along that Darwinism would be abandoned by science, but its not a believable claim in light of the fierce support of Darwinism. If only you would allow intelligent design to live that double life! Stenger; science shows that God does not exist. Rehm..science cannot touch theology Youre saying that theyre both right? The word science is so vague that it can be applied either way depending on the situation, blended either way, switched back and fourth at will? Logic tells us that at least one of them is wrong! Yet if one person uses intelligent design to forward religion, then ALL of intelligent design is religious, and is thrown out of the scientific realm! Some of intelligent design can be used to promote religion, but scientific searches for specified complexity and evidence of design are separate from it, in exactly the same way that Stenger and Rehms differences are separate. Yet ID is painted with only the religious brush, while science cant be painted with the atheist brush. The double standard is crystal clear. If theres no agreeing to disagree above, theres no agreeing to disagree here, is there? It sure does work both ways! Ive lost count of all the anti-creation arguments presented here as the last nail in the coffin for creationists. Let me put it this way - Stenger was clearly implying that if Bush had a godless worldview, that he would have practiced better foreign policy. I have a copy of Stenger's ""God Delusion"" book - in the final chapter he gets around to put downs of US Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia, as well as president Bush. The innocence of the science of evolution can quickly get into one-sided politics, it seems. But you give the standard Godless political opinions of U.S. involvement in Iraq, so its not a problem. (Influence of theistic evolution) Im not saying it makes it so, Im saying it gives it political power. There is a difference. (You believe evolution and christianity are incompatible) It depends on the ever changing definition of evolution. If I say that common descent and Christianity are incompatible, most evolutionists will immediately shout that I think changes within kinds dont happen, therefore all creationists are scientific illiterates just like me! (The killer dilemma)It looked like the author of your book was wracking their brain to try to find a scenario - no matter how unrealistic - to place a staunch public critic of modern lax morality and the 'culture of victimhood' in an uncomfortable position because of his traditional, conservative views of justice. Your view (there is no god) and the theistic evolutionists view (god is weak and irrelevant) Maybe some psychiatrists would feel compassion for the car-murderers I described above, and seek to rehabilitate them with public money. I dont agree. Its just my opinion. There are exceptions to every rule of course, some non-militant atheists have very conservative political views, but not many. There are several minor, and one or two major collectives for most atheists. The Humanist Manifesto Do you have a basic disagreement with it? I do. There are many - Origin of Species, Dawkins books, Stengers books, Harris books, Dennets books. A lot of variation, but they obviously dont disagree with each other in basics. Theres no covering up going on! Theres little if any attempt made by websites like Talkorigins, NoanswersinGenesis, Pandas thumb, American Atheists, many others, to distinguish themselves from each other. That makes them loyal to science and scientists! It leads to tyrants like Al Gore, and he wants a lot from me! He doesnt like the fact that I use an internal combustion engine to make a living. I see less diversity in atheism than I do Christianity. Your not knowing about political views of atheists is simply the result of your not paying attention. I was thinking about Piltdown man. He got started in 1912 and didnt get exposed as a fraud until 1953. That means a child born around 1900 learned about Piltdown man as a teenager, and, if he/she lived long enough, finally found out the truth after becoming a grandparent in most cases. If they died young, well it was the truth for them their whole lives. But many of us still kept hanging on to evolution, didnt we? We see a God that created, that loves, that likes beautiful things, etc. It was an inspiration to do the same, in whatever capacity we are able. You havent been exactly agreeing. Youve been saying that inspiring (creationism) isnt the same as enabling (evolution) Im saying that inspiring vs enabling are too close to distinguish between, that they are equal in creation inspiration/ enabling vs evolutionary inspiration/ enabling. Yes, and I credit creationism for inspiring one man and one woman to go to an extra effort in many cases to be loyal to each other for an entire lifetime, and I credit the teachings of Christ, as well as Proverbs, Song of Solomon, others, with providing guidelines on just how to do it, enabling so many to successfully do it. So this thread starters attempt to elevate evolution above creationism by using commercial products alone pretty well failed for him, didnt it? A belief in the accomplishments of small, progressive change doesnt have to be true in biology for it to enable the design of computer chips. We dont see dogs and cats and mice and rats and countless other animals picking out their mates at an early age and going to great pains to remain loyal to that mate for their whole lives. We wouldnt see humans do it near as much without Genesis, the foundation for the entire Bible. The foundation - the ministry AnswersinGenesis has that name for that specific reason. That if a person has questions about most anything in Christianity, how we should live, why does any part of the Bible say what it says, why we are like we are, the answers to our questions are always in Genesis. When our discussion leads to new thoughts of the inspiration/enabling of commercial products in creation, my calling it out isnt moving goalposts. Its amazing to me that science can claim authority on human behavior. (marriage) Its an arrangement that works, its been proven, it has to be correct to have stood the test of time that it has. Im not applying my standards to it, Im applying His as explained throughout the Bible. In the beginning, before the first man sinned, there was no pain, no painful toil, no thorns and thistles, and no death! You cant have evolution without a lot of death.","Peeling","336712","You really do commit some grievous sins against analogy, you know. Even if scientists did do as you claim, it still wouldn't be equivalent to soliciting biased opinions from the descendants of those involved. You're proceeding from the assumption that scientists completely disregard all historical documents. They don't. They look for further evidence that could support or disprove the documented events. So the claim they would 'miss' something so prominently recorded has no teeth. Except that many advances have been made since Darwin. The theory is far more sophisticated than he ever knew it to be. He was still right as far as his theories went, but he didn't see the whole picture - couldn't have done, given that genes were unknown in his day. It's good that we agree it is the bible, rather than documentary evidence in general, to which you attach special importance. That fact will come in handy later. But I do, and it does! I've said all along, I would never oppose the scientific investigation of ID. Nor would I try to prevent Dembski et al publishing their abysmal pop-science polemics. So to say I employ a double standard is clearly wrong. The point where my opinions of ID and evolution diverge is the science classroom, in which evolution has earned its place and ID thus far has not. I don't recall ever saying they were both right. As I said, I haven't read Stenger's book and I'm not acquainted with his arguments. Perhaps he's perceived something I haven't and I will end up agreeing with him; perhaps not. ID is thrown out of the science classroom because it is, right now, ####. The fact it is being used to forward religion takes on special significance because it is ####. That's why so many religious teachers and scientists oppose it: it is harming the reputation of their religion. Like I said, there's no double standard. Stenger and Dembski can both write their philosophical treatises, and can both pursue scientific careers. If ID was any use, its religious affiliations would be meaningless. And yet you remain unconvinced, yes? So my point is proved: whether something can change your mind or not is unrelated to whether or not it is logically correct. Good - so you won't be making any more claims that evolution is a weapon against religion just because some people try to swing it like one. Based on the quote, he wasn't actually saying that either. After all, a godless Bush remains a thundering XXXXX, so it wouldn't be all plain sailing Seriously, though, I generally agree that is what Stenger was angling for. But let's track back. You said: So I asked if evolution was used to criticise Bush. You said yes. Which is wrong, isn't it? Stenger made a straightforward criticism of religion's influence on politics. If you think they're opinions, you need to do some reading around the subject. Or perhaps it just risks undermining the overweening political influence of your preferred version of Christianity? I really don't know who you're talking to when you bang on about evolution changing definitions. I'm pretty sure it can't be me. You know perfectly well that evolution is both an umbrella term used by the layman, and has a specific biological meaning. If you're uncomfortable with that level of subtlety, why not stop complaining about it and start using more specific terms? I asked if you thought evolution and Christianity were incompatible. It wouldn't kill you to simply say ""Common descent is out, but allele frequency change is OK."" You know, answer the question? Certainly the scenario threw matters into sharper relief than one would expect in everyday life, but I don't think there's anything unrealistic about having to co-exist with convicted criminals. I note you still picked the rehabilitated offender, even if you did concoct a self-serving excuse for it. One can only presume this 'third way' came about because you couldn't think of any way of justifying a decision to pick the 'hard time' door Just because you don't appreciate the elegance required for god to have used evolution to create humanity doesn't mean those who do think less of god for doing it. I understand the sentiment. You just want to keep it simple: it was their choice, nobody else's, to do those terrible things, so let's just lock them up or stick a needle in them and make them go away. But you need to stop thinking that anyone who disagrees you on this is a bleeding-heart liberal. I would make every effort to rehabilitate those offenders, not out of compassion for them, but in order to learn . What contributed to them becoming such failed experiments in humanity? I don't want to absolve them of blame; I don't want to make them victims. I want to know why they were killers , so that maybe we can steer even a few other people away from that route in life. Even if external influences only put a few percentage points of slant on their decision to do as they did, isn't that valuable information if we can translate that into a few percentage points fewer offenders, and thus victims? If the Democratic party were dependent upon atheists for their vote, they would never poll higher than 20% That's a manifesto for religious humanism, not atheism. If you want to say that religious humanists have got it in for traditional religion, based on that manifesto I'd agree. But the fact remains that being an atheist does not entail joining a collective. I really ought to have put /rhetorical around my words This is demonstrating my point exactly: because you've decided atheists are a collective, you've decided they must have a manifesto (so you picked one that suited your needs) and they must have a bible (so you picked some that suited your needs). And you won't be told otherwise Perhaps it doesn't occur to them they might be confused for one another? I sympathise with the difficulties you must be facing, but I can't help but imagine the manufacturers of asbestos felt much the same way, once upon a time. Was getting rid of that all a bunch of earth-worship, too? Quite possibly. I find politics too depressing to take much of an interest, most of the time. And the fraudulence of Piltdown Man impacts evolution... how, exactly? Does anyone still 'hang on' to the truth of Piltdown Man? No? Then your example has no relevance. It was debunked, and abandoned. Literal genesis has been debunked, yet its adherents remain obstinate. Like I said, I'm not arguing about inspiration - even if I do think you have it backwards But creationism doesn't enable anything. It doesn't have to be right to accomplish what is has. It just needs to be believed. Aerodynamics keep planes in the air because they're correct, not because we think they're correct. Evolutionary principles produce better computer chips because they work, not because we think they work. When you can produce evidence of a product of creationism that requires creationism to be correct, you'll have shown equivalence. Great! So the marital guidence is sound (according to you anyway). Does Genesis have to be literally true for that advice to work? It's certainly not as clear-cut as it first appears, because as you and AA rightly pointed out, people do act upon their beliefs and accomplish things as a result. I still think it's not the same as devising a theory whose commercial utilility derives from its correctness, but then the OP wasn't that specific. Evolutionary principles of inheritable variation, competition and selection do have to work in order for it to be possible for us to evolve better computer chips. Just as E=MC2 ties matter and energy together, showing they are interchangeable, so Darwin's principles of evolution tie design and testing together to prove that they are interchangeable. Well... yes we do, actually. Life-pairing does occur elsewhere in nature. All you keep saying (and linking to) is that if we disbelieve literal Genesis it's harder to take the rest of the bible seriously - which would be true no matter what Genesis contained. You're not meeting the challenge; you're not showing anything relevant specifically in genesis itself . Fair enough. It derailed the subtopic under discussion at little, that's all. That's a truly frightful strawman All I said was that science has confirmed that we really are different, that we really do need morals to be the creatures we are. And you're still not happy. Monogamy? Sure. Does genesis have to be literally true for monogamy to be a good fit for the modern human psyche? No. Well, if it's as explicit as you say, that bit must be wrong too; sorry There has been a lot of death; a hell of a lot. Far more than could ever occur in a global flood, however catastrophic. It's just one more fact we have to deal with. I'm going to propose we call an amicable halt at this point. I think it's clear we more or less agree upon the matter of the original topic, as it was phrased anyway. A stricter application of criteria, such as I imposed, yields a different result but I don't think I was justified in reading that into the OP.","commercial-products-creationism","10:55 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","99"

If one stipulates that to qualify, a commercial product must depend for its success upon the correctness of the underlying theory, then no: creationism and creation science are barren ground. But it's perfectly possible for something to have commercial application without needing to work . Music, for instance, or Harry Potter. The point of this challenge was to highlight the difference between evolution and creationism in terms of productive science. And there is a vast difference in that respect, no question of it. But extending that argument to the commercial arena weakens it substantially, because people aren't obliged to spend money only on stuff that works. The commercial success of homeopathy is testament to that. Heck, the very foundation of commerce itself is a shared delusion: that a coin or a piece of paper or a few electrons whizzing through a computer is somehow 'worth' as much as food you can actually put in your mouth or a roof you can actually shelter under. So in respect of its purpose, I think this thread fails: it leaves science's comfort zone (stuff that has to actually work) and tries to tackle religion on its turf (stuff that just has to be appealing).","commercial-products-creationism","05:55 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","102"
