A machine works as it does regardless of it's origin. We only know to expect homology when we see homology but to exult evolution supporters will wire that through common descent to give the impression that common descent gave some useful insight. Those who literally think evolution has some kind of practical use need to be told that you can wake up in the morning without calling the ceiling evolution. They have to say insane things like inheritance is evolution and since we need to understand inheritance we must understand evolution. In fact the best example someone could possibly give to that point would be researchers considering the adaptation of bacteria to anti-biotics. To explain that they would need rational evolution, but why do they need to explain it? As everyone keeps telling me it makes no predictions, all they can do is say that the thing might change again in the future.... so much for the foundation of all biology.","evolution-religion","02:50 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution",187

Once we thought that life could exist under certain circumstances, whether that's between a minimum and maximum temperature or particular acidity. So as we've explored the planet and reached places where we didn't expect to find life because it was too cold, we found life. Whenever we've looked and not expected to find life, there it is.

Do you know what a question is? In the English Langauge, a question is meant to gain clarification. My question clearly did not accuse you of saying such, only requesting clarification to whether or not you believed creationists used dishonest tactics. Perhaps you should enroll in a English Comprehension course at your local college? See above. Google is a good tool for finding such classes. Keep insulting me. Not only will it get you warnings, but it keeps proving my point. You have no argument. Only insults.","CashBurnRate","331873","I never changed the subject. The ""i'm right cuz i say so"" argument is getting old. Because if I support a theory, I've got to agree with everyone else who supports the theory, right? No matter how asinine their arguments are? I have yet to see a single thing you've posted that would be indicative of any intelligence. Just because someone agrees with you on an issue doesn't mean they have to agree with every asinine thing you say Your question implied it. ""So basically you're an #####?"" is not asking for clarification, it's an implied statement. You resorted to insults when all I did was disagree with you. don't use insults if you can't take it","why-creationists","11:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution",133
