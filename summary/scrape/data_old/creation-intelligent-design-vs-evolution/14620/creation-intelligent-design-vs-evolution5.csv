When one finds a contradiction, one says, ""You've contradicted yourself,"" and then points out how somebody is saying two entirely opposed things.

I have big problems with baptizing a position ""common sense,"" for exactly the reasons I pointed out already. As you used it, ""common sense"" -- rather than logic -- seemed to spy a contradiction between a record-cold winter in Phoenix and global warming. And if you used logic to study things like the fallacies of composition and division, you would recognize that what is true of wholes is not necessarily true of their parts, and vice versa -- and hence would understand why your ""common sense"" judgment about the implications of the Phoenix winter amounts to precisely nothing.","debating-creationist","07:18 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","64"

None of the arguement about common sense was about me. It started only because you guys said there is no way someone without comprehensive knowledge of a subject could argue anything.

Logic without comprehensive knowledge of a subject is basically common sense because it is sense that is common to all people. I did not use it. I merely pointed out the absolute knowledge of a subject is not necessary to find a flaw. It was a comment beside the debate. I also did not only talk about a the winter in Phoenix. The scientists behind ""global warming"" were shown to have manipulated information (a.k.a. they lied).","debating-creationist","04:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","68"

I know what Evolution teaches and have seen its flaws through study. Look back. I never said ""many areas of evolution"". You added the word ""evolution"" because you wish that I had said it.

"09-28-2010","14620",5,"Freedom","413972","Well I have no idea what it is called but I would deduce that the only way for that to happen is isolating a population, which means the term probably contains that word in some kind of conjugated latin form? Perhaps combined with genetic drift as the term for unselected genetic change? I do not think knowledge of terminology is necessarily the definer of knowledge of a subject even if it is an excellent way to detect formal education on the subject. Not to mention it is very difficult to carry on a discussion when complex concepts are often shortened to one scientific term. Assume you could not look up ohm's law. Do you remember it of the top of your head (I do), if the answer is no does that render you ignorant of electricity?","Bennedict","413978","very close, you know what it is because you and i have talked about it before. its not terminology, its an important aspect of evolution and answering it would be an indication of knowledge about the subject. SHH! its not for you! if you didnt know anything about ohms law, you would not build a guitar amp. thats my point.","debating-creationist","11:36 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","74"

Point taken, that was actually a terrible example. What I meant to ask was 'if you knew ohm's law but couldn't remember it was called that....' The point I was trying to make was conceptual grasp as opposed to specific nomenclature or case knowledge is a more accurate proxy of knowledge. In my work I certainly look up many formula and answers on a routine basis, They wouldn't do my any good without the conceptual glue to frame them into a coherent venture so I see that conceptual glue as superior. To support this I also have the fact that few people remember everything they learned in school or even college, yet they still keep teaching it because once you learn the conceptual identities any particular element of reality the damage is done (damage meaning the ability to understand and put to productive venture in this case).","debating-creationist","11:47 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","75"
