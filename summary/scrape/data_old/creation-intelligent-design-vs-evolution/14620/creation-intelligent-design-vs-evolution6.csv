What I meant to ask was 'if you knew ohm's law but couldn't remember it was called that....' The point I was trying to make was conceptual grasp as opposed to specific nomenclature or case knowledge is a more accurate proxy of knowledge. In my work I certainly look up many formula and answers on a routine basis, They wouldn't do my any good without the conceptual glue to frame them into a coherent venture so I see that conceptual glue as superior. To support this I also have the fact that few people remember everything they learned in school or even college, yet they still keep teaching it because once you learn the conceptual identities any particular element of reality the damage is done (damage meaning the ability to understand and put to productive venture in this case).","Bennedict","413985","yea, and once taught, even if you forget it you can easily be refreshed right away. ohms law is a great example, the easy to remember triangle comes back to me.","debating-creationist","12:27 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","76"
"09-29-2010","14620",6,"fartingle","413915","Noone just declared ""It's common sense"". Logic without comprehensive knowledge of a subject is basically common sense because it is sense that is common to all people. The scientists behind ""global warming"" were shown to have manipulated information (a.k.a. they lied).","Matthew","414000","Sadly, logic is far from common, even among the general run of people, let alone among all of them. Bollocks. "" The "" scientists who advocate have not been shown to have done any such thing. Even the East Anglia email controversy was a matter of distortion (which the allegedly ""liberal"" media did nothing to repair, and everything to promugate). And even if some had, this would be a far cry from demonstrating that there is a serious flaw in the global warming hypothesis. Your reasoning fails to impress, fartingle.","debating-creationist","08:49 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","77"

"09-29-2010","14620",6,"Freedom","414025","Do you wish to argue anthropogenic climate change science only?","Matthew","414029","No. I merely think the ideas that (a) global warming is happening, and that (b) human activity plays a significant though be no means exclusive role in it, are completely non-controversial. Denying them is every bit as ill-informed as denying evolution. Regardless, I'm content to let the matter drop, ad to return everyone to their regularly scheduled evo-vs-creo debating. I'd rather discuss the latter, anyway.","debating-creationist","03:32 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","79"

The number of people who get suckered by bad reasoning on a daily basis -- even after studying introductory logic -- is far greater than the number who reason well. ""So you, and only you, say.""
