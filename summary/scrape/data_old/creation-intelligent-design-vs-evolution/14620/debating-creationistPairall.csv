I most certainly am male and therefore have testosterone. Is that why I am doing this? Not in the least. I do this because I am forced to spend 2 hours a day in a computer lab as I wait for my little brother to finish classes. I came into this knowing that it is impossible to convince anyone to change their viewpoint in an online forum. What I aslo know is that ""iron sharpens iron"" (a Biblical reference. I know you could never have known that) and the more I do this the better I will become for the time when I see one of you (you meaning an evolutionist) in person, I can be far more eloquent and have answers ready instead of attempting to figure things out mid-conversation. I hope this clears your apparent fog, --Fartingle","Bennedict","412622","i get the feeling that you are young yourself, probably still in grade school, correct? in response to ripskar, i disagree slightly, i think a creationists doesnt have to be male or adolescent. on this forum, yes but most of the people who post here are dudes. i think creationists dont necessarily fit any mold, just people who have been brought up from birth to think that the bible is absolute truth and you cannot question it, and they retaliate when people do question the bible, and as evolution indirectly questions the bible, creationists are born. and with all things that people learn at a young age, the older the creationist gets, the stronger their position on creationism becomes despite being wrong. so hopefully fartingle is not in the group of old people that cant change their way of thinking despite being incorrect. I HAVE HOPE FOR YOU!!!!!","debating-creationist","07:11 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","166"

All I am met with is ""this guy said that..."" or ""look at this page on wikipedia"" and ""because some 'expert' once said it, it is therefore true"".","debating-creationist","01:33 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","49"

But most articles posted on the internet are claims (nothing more) that are stated as fact. I believe that even you could look closely enough to see the holes. Edit: the ones that make REAL sense are usually not the ones saying ""...and therefore evolution."" To be fair, he was a Catholic. And Roman Catholicism holds as much water as a cup without a bottom. It does not even stand against Biblical scrutiny. Perhaps when you are looking for a material explanation you can find one here, but I meant to argue Christianity (because I truly believe the theology in addition to creationism) the phrase ""nobody cares how much you know until they know how much you care"" comes into play. Believe it or not, caring for the well-being of a person's soul is not easy to get across the internet.","debating-creationist","02:08 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","186"

I have been told that I am wrong many times, but that lacks merit. There are many articles and books presenting ""global warming"" as a fact even though it has been proven wrong and driven by scientists wanting to make money. So articles by ""experts"" and ""scientists"" that are being paid to make things up are not valid until expiraments are done, repeated, and shown to others. But it is a necessary part of Christianity. If I present straight facts, they are denied as ""religious bull"" and I am disregarded.","debating-creationist","03:19 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","113"

The temperature trend graphs that were changed to make it seem as if a warm period was new? The real satelite pictures of the ice caps? Besides those, do you not go outside? I believe it was the 70's when they saw a new ice age coming. Where I live had a record cold winter this past year (admittedly that does not mean it was that cold, but we did get below freezing in Phoenix!). Common sense is adequate for something so blatently false. Again, the scientists were paid more and more when they ""found evidence"" supporting it.
