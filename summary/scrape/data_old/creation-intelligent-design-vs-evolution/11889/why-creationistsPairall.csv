I've never seen such an idiotic comment. All you've done is resort to personal attacks. You're an embarrassment, but I assume you already know that.","obvious_child","331840","In normal debates, one side makes a point, the other tries to refute it. In evolution vs literal creationists, literal creationists make arguments and then refute themselves And I fully know you won't attempt to actually refute me.","why-creationists","10:44 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","43"

You claim that my statement about the dishonesty of creationists is wrong., specifically you argue that creationists don't use fallacies Then you go and use a fallacy of changing the subject. Seriously. People may think I'm in cahoots with you. I say predict and BAM you go and prove it.","why-creationists","10:56 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","59"

I stated this: Fair enough. You have yet to argue for literal creationism. So you'll admit that creationists do use dishonest methods? You're reported. Enjoy. Btw, thanks again for proving my prediction true.","why-creationists","11:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","50"

You said I stated something in which I clearly did not. you're the one who resorted to personal attacks first. Don't dish out what you can't take. It's clear that you're a liar and that you have no defense.","why-creationists","11:11 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","70"

I could reply with gibberish. You apparently missed the post where you claimed that creationwiki had refuted talkorigins. As Talkorigins supports the TOH, and since you think that that TO is incorrect, well, you do the math. Do you know what a question is? In the English Langauge, a question is meant to gain clarification. My question clearly did not accuse you of saying such, only requesting clarification to whether or not you believed creationists used dishonest tactics. Perhaps you should enroll in a English Comprehension course at your local college? See above. Google is a good tool for finding such classes. Keep insulting me. Not only will it get you warnings, but it keeps proving my point. You have no argument. Only insults.","why-creationists","11:16 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","160"

The ""i'm right cuz i say so"" argument is getting old. Because if I support a theory, I've got to agree with everyone else who supports the theory, right? No matter how asinine their arguments are? I have yet to see a single thing you've posted that would be indicative of any intelligence. Just because someone agrees with you on an issue doesn't mean they have to agree with every asinine thing you say Your question implied it. ""So basically you're an #####?"" is not asking for clarification, it's an implied statement. You resorted to insults when all I did was disagree with you. don't use insults if you can't take it","why-creationists","11:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","133"
