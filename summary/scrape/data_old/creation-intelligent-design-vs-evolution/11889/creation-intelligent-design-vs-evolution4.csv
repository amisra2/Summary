"11-27-2008","11889",4,"Darn Republican","334558","Simple, since the obvious escapes you entirely. There happens to be no scientist who is taken serious who discards the the global flood, why? [pray tell] Because their is ample evidence to for the flood. So even the secular world has to start there ... The same fossil tables here, are the same in Russia, Israel.... and are Sumatra. Secondly... the [just to throw this in] the pyramids of Giza, Egyptologists tried to suppress find the skeleton of a manatee in the upper chambers one of the larger pyramids, because they are Muslim ... and what would that finding lend credibility to? Making blanket denials is no way to engage a debate... try offering evidence to support your positions, I do for mine.","T.Q","334566","No, I'm pretty sure i'm able to grasp the obvious... Actually, scientists who discard the global flood are taken seriously. No, there isn't. No, they don't Define ""fossil tables"" Uh-huh, yeah, ok... What was Muslim? The pyramids? The egyptologists? The manatee? My guess would be nothing. Oh yes, just look at all the evidence present in this post. Yeesh. BTW, if ID has nothing to do with religion, why, when asked a question about ID did you immediately bring up the Noachian flood? EDIT You apparently posted while I was writing my reply. Just so you know Sparky, saying ""Nuh-uh! Did too!"" is not ""offering evidence to support your positions"" FFS...","why-creationists","05:12 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","48"

You can be skeptical all you want, but the empirical evidence is overwhelming for a world wide flood, a global cataclysm... as I stated earlier, you're not even taken seriously even in the secualar world of ""science"" if you try to refute the flood record, the flood is solid and is not privy to question. Enoch built the first pyramids, and his were superior in quality to he knock-offs of later days. The flood has been dated to have occured about 4400 to 4600 B.C.","why-creationists","05:33 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","50"

Or; 3) if they were built after, explain where the population came from to support such an engineering project. 4) Explain why China has records dating back to before the supposed date of the flood And, try answering the other questions I asked. Oh, and if the flood is ""taken seriously"", and is ""solid and is not privy to question"" in secular science, see what kind of references you can dig up on it from reputable scientific publications","why-creationists","05:37 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","51"
"11-27-2008","11889",4,"Darn Republican","334555","You mean Intelligent Design, and straight forward logical, rational, common sense arguments that require reason to move to the next step, instead of ideological consensus... huh? go figure... Proponents of ID usually don't argue religiosity or scripture, they let the empirical evidence prove it, funny... that is what true science has always done. Verify the obvious, not ignore it in favor of some mindless postulations [oddly] convenient to how someone wants to live their life; amazing how that works out...","trebor","334577","You mean, intelligent design, which has been proven in court to be not science, and to be a front for certain religious agenda's, and straight forward arguments based on ignorance of the evidence and logical fallacies. If you look at the organizations that push I.D. , you will see they have a religious agenda . The discovery institute is funded by religious organizations, and every one of the board will admit they thing the 'intelligent designer' is the Christian god.

You constantly make the most blatantly ignorant and irrational statements which have no basis at all in reality, yet you actually think you are being intelligent. (Note childs quote in my siggy, below.) And you really should look up definitions before using words when you have no idea what they mean. Didn't you start a thread about that, hypocrite? You are talking to a person who accepts Intelligent Design as a rational explanation for Mans origin, yet you are so ill informed that you allege he is aligned with a belief in animism, when animism was founded in pagan religions and asserts that pretty much everything has a soul and spirit. Animism (from Latin anima (soul, life)[1][2]) commonly refers to a religious belief that souls or spirits exist in animals, plants and other entities, in addition to humans.[3] Animism may also attribute souls to natural phenomena, geographic features, and even manufactured objects. Religions which emphasize animism in this sense include Shinto, Hinduism and pagan faiths such as folk religions and Neopaganism.

You are talking to a person who accepts Intelligent Design as a rational explanation for Mans origin, yet you are so ill informed that you allege he is aligned with a belief in animism, when animism was founded in pagan religions and asserts that pretty much everything has a soul and spirit Psychiatrist Sigmund Freud thought that ""primitive men"" came up with the animistic system by observing the phenomena of sleep (including dreams) and of death which so much resembles it, and by attempting to explain those states.... Some theories have been put forward that the belief in animism among early humans were the basis for the later evolution of religions. In this theory, initially put forward by Dr. E. B. Tylor, early humans initially worshipped local deities of nature, in a form of animism. These eventually grew into larger, polytheistic deities, such as gods of the sun and moon. Eventually these evolved into a belief in one, monotheistic God.","obvious_child","334701","Rich coming from you: http://www.4forums.com/political/308894-post5.html Not to mention you can't tell the difference between elements, molecules and compounds. You really shouldn't be talking. Nice take on superficiality. Look up the earliest form of Animism. Look what I can do, I can read your article too! The principle fundamental basis of Animism is to explain things unexplainable now by crediting supernatural beings/things. Early human Animism explained the seasons and rains by crediting them to a Rain God. We see this even today in the native American's cultural rain dances to appease and worship the specific God to bring rain to their crops. If you want to win an argument, move beyond the superficial.","why-creationists","04:33 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","58"

He insulted me for arguing that increased O2 caused huge insects and argued that it was Co2 that did the growth. Apparently he still has no clue what the role of oxygen plays in cell growth. It's not hard to shrug off the insults from someone like Arch. It's much harder then the person making the insult actually knows what they are talking about. ID is animism in its simplest form. What we cannot explain now is therefore credited to a God. Only that instead of rain and lightning, it's the origin of life and complex organic organs and compounds.","why-creationists","04:34 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","59"
