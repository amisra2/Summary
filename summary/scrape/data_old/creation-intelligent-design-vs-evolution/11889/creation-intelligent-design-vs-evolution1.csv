"11-01-2008","11889",1,"None","None","None","Symbiote","330799","Generally creationists follow an ideology which forbids questioning of beliefs, sometimes explicitly, sometimes implicitly. That said, creationists are not the enemy. Many people hold beliefs of dubious merit with great passion. Many martial arts students believe in some variation of eastern mysticism which is scientifically baseless. Many people believe in astrology or crystal healing or some other placebo. Even in businesss, the psychometric tests employed to predict who will make the best employee are often groundless. Even on this board, many people hold a similar faith in global warming. The only reason creationism is even an issue is because the public school system makes it impossible for these kinds of beliefs to be resolved in a voluntary manner. It is public schooling, not creationism per se that needs to be dealt with.","why-creationists","10:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","2"

I wrote in a similar thread that creationists who attempt to change the subject and that would show they had nothing. Then marc posted trying to change the subject. Seriously.","why-creationists","03:46 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","4"
"11-02-2008","11889",1,"None","None","None","iangb","330821","Creationism attempts to deny observable reality with the power of faith, while maintaining a logical faade. The only way to do this is to never follow any point through to it's ultimate conclusion, as it will be shown as false. Instead, the best tactic is to attempt to bury opponents under an ever-shifting, ever-repeating argument in an attempt to persuade them that because you have so many arguments, you must be right - and because you never stay on-topic, none of your points are ever completely wiped of the map, so you can revisit them and force them to be debated from the start again. This is why the Index to Creationist Claims is so handy, because it allows most arguments to be wiped out from stage one. Hence my personal Creationist Challenge - if someone can come up with an argument for creationism that I cannot answer with a single link to the Index, I will take that person seriously. But yes, the above could apply to anyone who is 'blatantly wrong' (to put it tactlessly).","why-creationists","07:58 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","5"

Although I have obviously encountered many of these fallacious ""arguments"" in the past, it's impressive to imagine the self-sacrificing commitment involved in sifting the dross in order to index it for the convenience of others.","why-creationists","08:19 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","7"

That fact goes without saying. But remember this ian, just because your side is capable of creating lies in order to refute reality, it doesn't make anything you say true in any way, shape or form.
