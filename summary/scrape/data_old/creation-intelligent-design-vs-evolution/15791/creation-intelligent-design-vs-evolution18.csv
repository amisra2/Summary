Let it be known that I have a 5100 page response to anything you might possibly say that I don't like but since you wouldn't understand it I won't post it. (Gosh that really is easy, you should write 'how to argue for dummies' pandion ) Just in case that wasn't clear, I see your post as a fancy <flush>.","pandion","454233","I knew that you would not understand my point. You seem to lack the education. Oh, well. Doesn't change the fact that in science, theories are explanations of observations that have been tested. Scientific theories aren't guesses as the uneducated believe.","evolution-religion","01:13 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","256"
"05-03-2012","15791",18,"charlemagne","453825","Yes; Evolution is a religion, an atheistic religion. I think it would be fair to say that people who hold to the belief of evolution affirm the non-existence of a divine being. Though it's interesting to point out, the illogical view of atheism. What the atheist is really saying is: ""there is no being with omniscience in the universe and I know it to be true by virtue of my own omniscience."" A scientific theory summarizes a hypothesis or group of hypotheses that have been supported with repeated testing. Why is evolution still just theory? Because it can only be tested at the microevolutionary scale. It isn't observable at the macroevolutionary level because it's to slow. This is where evolutionists go wrong and put down all their proofs and evidences, and take up faith (as defined as, assurance of things hoped for and conviction of things not seen). So we treat evolution as if it were a law, because we can test it at one level. Since it is true on that one level we have faith that it is true on the next level. I think it's interesting to point out that in the thousands of years of written history there is no proof of any macroevolution. Especially in today's day and age with bacteria. "" For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power, and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse. Romans 1:20""","pandion","454236","Idiotic. Evolution is scientific theory based on observations of events that conform to a scientific definition. It has nothing to do with religion or any sort of religious mythology. I think it would be fair to say that you are ignorant of science in general and evolutionary biology in particular. In general, evolutionary biologists neither affirm nor deny the existence of a magical being. But atheists deny only one more god than you. Atheists don't believe in Zeus, Odin, Thor, Athena, Jupiter, Mars, Apollo, Eros, Cupid, Isis, Quetzalcoatl, Wakan Tanka, or endless others. But you believe in a god without evidence. Instead, you believe in a mythology of bronze age, nomadic herdsmen that is quite similar to the mythology of all of the other gods mentioned. You believe without evidence and yet claim that disbelief in your mythology is illogical. WOW! That's just plain stupid. Only a fool would claim that an atheist claims omniscience. Exactly! Because evolutionary theories (there are many) summarize and explain observations of phenomena that conform to the biological definition of evolution and have been supported by repeated testing. Only the ignorant believe that scientific theories grow up to be facts. Anyone who understands science and how it works understands that the facts are the observations and the theories explain the facts. What does that mean? Was that an actual English sentence? Actual observations of macroevolutionary events aside, have you ever heard of paleontology? In what science class were you taught that science was defined as the assurence [ sic ] of things hoped for and conviction of things not seen? That is, indeed, the definition of faith. But science is based on observations of reality. In science, it doesn't matter what is hoped for, if an idea isn't supported by evidence, it is rejected. Don't be so ignorant. Evolution is a scientific definition, observations of events that conform to the definition, and explanations (theories) of the events. Scientific laws are observations that make up part of scientific hypotheses and theories. Right! In the level of observable reality. That's meaningless gibberish. It isn't even a complete English sentence. You only display your ignorance. I think that it is interesting to point out that there has never been presented any proof of a god, especially in this age of science. Look into the nylon eating bacteria - obvious (even to the most stupid) of macroevolution. Idiotic quotes from mythology are not any sort of evidence or proof (except of blind faith in mythology).","evolution-religion","02:04 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","258"
"05-17-2012","15791",18,"Freedom","454234","I knew you would not answer. It seems even the uneducated can catch someone so well versed as yourself in a contradiction if they pay attention. This excuse doesn't change the fact that you refused to give the explanation for a phenomenon when you had already claimed there was an explanation. Then perhaps you will help pandion out, and explain gravity. Nice to see someone admit it. It does become tiresome to criticize the theory and be called ignorant of evidence due to this annoying dual use of the word.","pandion","455276","But, there is not answer to meaningless gibberish. Entirely possible. But you haven't. Your gibberish isn't even meaningful to the discussion. I can't do anything about it if you lack the ability to understand. I have been trying to teach you but you don't seem to be able to learn. But gravity isn't evolution. Please try to pay attention. Don't be stupid. It is a matter of language that words have multiple meanings. Only the ignorant don't understand this fact. Since you are so ignorant of the topic, and refuse to make any effort to educate yourself, it is understandable that scientific terms that have different meanings from those that you understand are annoying. Any intelligent person is aware that dictionaries list several different meanings for a single word.

Points for foresight, not intellectual honesty. You linked to a book on amazon, you call that trying? I did ask you about gravity though. Splendid! First I am ignorant because I supposedly don't understand that theories explain, and are not facts; now I am ignorant because I don't realize that words can have different senses of meaning depending on context. Are you noticing any pattern here? Shall we look back and see which of us happened to make a universal statement about what theories are? Do you happen to know a possible fallacy that arises from using the same word in an argument in two different senses? Don't worry my teaching is better than yours, I'll actually answer my own rhetorical question for you. It's call equivocation. And to what discussion is this diatribe meaningful? Just to be clear, you are saying that if understood scientific terms, I would know that something like gravity or evolution would be both theory and observation?","evolution-religion","03:27 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","260"

I do notice a pattern. It seems to be that you are ignorant and refuse to make any effort to learn. Scientific theories are tested hypotheses that explain observed facts. Of course, you use the word theory to mean a wild guess without basis. That is not the meaning of the word in science. In fact, that isn't the meaning of the word in law either. The term ""theory"" carries different meanings in several disciplines. Only the ignorant don't understand this and continue to try to apply the wrong meaning of the word in a discussion. OK. It was you. You tried to apply the vulgar, uneducated meaning of the word as ""a wild guess made without evidence"" to the specific meaning of the word used by scientists. And from what school did you earn you degree in philosophy? I earned mine from St. Mary's College, CA. But you make a good point. I have never used the term ""theory"" in any in any discussion of science to mean anything other than as a theory of science. The problem is your inability to understand. I never used the word ""theory"" in two different senses - you did. Ah! Is the light dawning? Again it seems to be a problem of a failure to understand a word that is used with more than one meaning. Yes, it depends on context. Gravity can refer to a definition of physical effects, observations that meet the definition, and tested explanations of those explanations. Evolution can refer to a definition, observations that meet the definition, and tested explanations of those observations. Thanks, Databed, for the advice. But I am aware that Freedom is unwilling to learn. I'm not sure that anyone who is so clouded with religious fervor can actually recognize reality.","evolution-religion","01:49 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","263"

Right... because words have different meaning! I can learn! thank you so much pandion, it's like you've opened the world to me. Such as? I had enough on you before, now not even xcaliber could pull up from this nose dive. To try to prop myself as an authority would fundamentally undermine the policy I have had for eight years of online debating, namely; I argue issues not credibility. As you should not care where I got my degree, I do not care where you got yours. So when you said theory of gravity, you did not mean explanation of gravity? You were referring to the 'theory', not the observation. Problem is there is no theory, just the observations distilled to laws which have been subject to some conceptual shuffling true, but not explanation. So clouded with religious fervor? See databed would not make that mistake because he has learned that guessing usually leads to a strawman with me.","evolution-religion","09:05 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","264"

Additionally, your overuse of punctuation is disorienting. If you are going to use so much punctuation, please read up on how to properly place it. Yes. And no one has yet offered a shred of evidence that contradicts these interpretations. In addition, there is no competing theory. Perhaps, if you can come up with a theory that is equally valid, there will be doubt cast on current understanding. However, try as you might, that will not happen. In this case, we have the correct theory and there really is no debate at all. Humanity motivates science. Humanity rewards science. However, science is not colored by humanity. Science is the same everywhere there is intelligence to put it into process. Science has no color. It is in the best interest of scientists to search for the answers.
