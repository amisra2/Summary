"10-23-2011","15791",3,"None","None","None","MrWriteLA","441455","A great quote I found on James Randi's skepticism blog: ""Objectivism is the cult of spoiled self-centered immaturity. It has formalized the whining of brats against their mommies, and called it a 'philosophy'. It claims to respect and even demand rational thinking, except that it rejects applying critical thinking towards its own pseudo-religious tenets.""","evolution-religion","06:48 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","32"

"10-24-2011","15791",3,"Freedom","441462","Randian is a made up term, if you're talking about objectivists they will admit they are wrong when they are wrong which is a whole lot less often than leftist or 'conservatives'. Nor is this brand of scholarship restricted to Rand herself. Her closest followers embrace it as well. Consider Peikoffs article, The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy. This article, said to have been published first in 1967, contains the sweeping claim (p. 89) that It [the analytic-synthetic dichotomy] is accepted, in some form, by virtually every influential contemporary philosopher pragmatist, logical positivist, analyst, and extentialist alike. Well, consider please the following: But, for all its a priori reasonableness, a boundary between analytic and synthetic statements simply has not been drawn. That there is such a distinction to be drawn at all is an unempirical dogma of empiricists, a metaphysical article of faith. (W. V. Quine, Two Dogmas of Empiricism). My copy of From a Logical Point of View has an initial copyright date of 1953. The original paper appeared in The Philosophical Review in 1951. Look folks, it simply is not possible for anyone who was aware of what was happening in Anglo-American philosophy in the 50s and early 60s to claim with any honesty what Peikoff does in the quote above. So was Peikoff dishonest or ignorant? Take your pick. He had to be one or the other. If one were forced to select a single paper of Quines that had the most impact on contemporary philosophy it would have to be Two Dogmas. But Peikoff appears ignorant of both it and its impact on the field. Further, it appears that Peikoffs article appears only in the second edition of IOE, published in 1990. Certainly by this time someone should have noticed Two Dogmas and at least conceded in a footnote that Peikoffs claim was unsupportable both now and when it originally was made. Peikoff, like Rand, goes to great lengths to claim (I would say make a case, but no genuine evidence is ever introduced) that he is proposing a novel approach where all other philosophers have failed. In the case of the analytic/ synthetic dichotomy Ive got news for Peikoff: It was done 15 years earlier, and it was done better. But, for all its a priori reasonableness, a boundary between analytic and synthetic statements simply has not been drawn. That there is such a distinction to be drawn at all is an unempirical dogma of empiricists, a metaphysical article of faith. (W. V. Quine, Two Dogmas of Empiricism).","Matthew","441469","""Randian"" is indeed a ""made up term."" It was made denote the followers of Rand's bad ideas. ""Objectivist"" is also a made up term. It was made by said followers to make it sound like the gave a damn about objectivity. Consider, for example, Leonard Peikoff his article on the analytic-synthetic distinction is one of the most incompetent things I've ever had the misfortune to read. Gary Merrill offered some excellent thoughts on the complete scholarly incompetence of Randians at Merrill on ITOE , from which I cite: It could also be noted that Quine was merely the most famous critic of the distinction. There were many people criticizing the distinction. Some, like Quine, had pragmatist roots -- oops! did Peikoff describe critics of the distinction as adherents to it? nuts. Others came from existentialist backgrounds, like Nietzsche -- oops! again. Well, Peikoff never claimed to be an expert -- oops!... Anyway, if Randians were so interested in correcting themselves, then surely by now, this incompetent essay would have been removed. But nope. Read the whole link for further examples. Rand and Randians are really convincing about philosophy -- if, and only if, you don't know philosophy except through the lens of Randian thinking. If you know what philosophers from Aristotle to Kant and beyond actually say, Randians are the opposite of impressive. And their claims that everybody else is wrong, while they're the real experts, ring utterly hollow. -- Which, come to think of it, is exactly like the situation of creationists with respect to biology: compelling only to those who don't know any better. But hey, there's a sucker born every minute.","evolution-religion","01:09 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","35"

There is plenty of discussion of the article out there on the web already, and you can check it out if you're interested. In addition tot the link already provided, see The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy - Objectivist Living , where poster ""dragonfly"" provides some excellent criticisms and gives some great responses to someone defending Peikoff's view. See also http://objectivism-criticism.blogspo...dichotomy.html , which is not very good, except that it does correctly make the hilarious point that the analytic-synthetic distinction is utilized within Rand's own work all the time. Personally, I feel no need to lend credibility to a work that is so historically ill-informed and argumentatively sloppy. It would be like debating a young-earth creationist about the age of the earth, as if that view of the earth deserved any hearing at this point. The article is terrible on every level. Quine's ""Two Dogmas of Empricism"" already showed how the distinction didn't work two decades before Peikoff tried to. And it did so very effectively, because it was historically well-informed about the nature of the problem, and then logically rigorous in developing both the argument criticizing the distinction (and also the other ""dogma,"" reductionism) and the argument about the implications of letting go of the dogmas. Real philosophy at its finest. If you want to discuss that , well then hey, let's go over to the philosophy forum and examine the essay, section by section. But I have no desire to waste my time discussing Peikoff's essay. It just isn't worth the effort.","evolution-religion","12:19 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","39"
"10-24-2011","15791",3,"Matthew","441504","Not interested in discussing it.","Freedom","441512","That's what I took out of your post. If you are looking for a pattern, here it is; critics of objectivism are more than willing to dismiss it publicly, to claim it's hypocritical and irrational, but they never want to argue; or when they do, do so for only a short time claiming their objectivist opponent won't see reason even though they have been proven wrong. Do you seriously think that matters to us? The assurance that if we were actually capable of understanding the so called logic used against it we would see how wrong we are? To claim something is irrational but not be wiling to argue the point, to claim one's opponents are unable to meet your attacks, while refusing to provide attacks is the height of hypocrisy . You spoke of 'validating' objectivism by arguing against it. You sound like you've had experience with objectivist so you should know quite well that these beliefs will stand without your input quite well enough. There are three possible scenarios for your input: 1. You don't say anything. 2. You dismiss objectivism but will not argue 3. You dismiss objectivism and will argue (with bad logic) 4. You dismiss objectivism and will argue (with good logic) 1. will produce no change, 4. will reduce validation; 2 and three will only increase it. By choosing anything but 1 and 4 you are sending the message that all you have is 2 and 3. Which only makes us more confident, the only thing you could do more to validate objectivist is to imply that you are familiar or expert in philosophy at the same time as 2 and 3.","evolution-religion","02:55 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","40"

The fact is, I consider Objectivism to be an already defeated position. With regard to the specific essay in question: When Peikoff claims in ""The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy"" that ""virtually every influential contemporary philosopher"" accepts the distinction, this claim is (to speak in objective if not Objectivist terms) entirely false. The most influential philosophical paper of the twenty years prior to Peikoff's essay (Quine's ""Two Dogmas"") criticized that very distinction. And in fact such criticism was quite widespread at that time, especially among mid-20th-century thinkers of pragmatist (e.g. Quine himself) or existentialist derivation, whom Peikoff inexplicably includes among his brief rogues gallery of people who support the distinction. How seriously am I really supposed to take such staggering ignorance of the field in which the man claimed expertise? I feel no need to discuss the essay any further at this time. I've done so in the past, and others have done so before and after me. Much of the criticism is available on the web for anyone inclined to look. I've linked to some of it, and there's plenty more out there. So all in all, I have better things to do. Charges of hypocrisy don't bother me, not where Objectivism is concerned. Done my time.","evolution-religion","04:07 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","41"
"10-24-2011","15791",3,"Bennedict","441386","Do you have a dog, Theo? You wouldn't if macroevolution were false, because dogs were created by selection. A St. Bernard doesn't reproduce with a weiner dog (because a weiner dog is small and a St. Bernard is big; biologically they could, but they don't naturally), and under the description of speciation, that makes them different species. Here's the thing about those who believe in micro but not macroevolution - there is no ""glass ceiling"" as I call it. If you recognize that an organism can change genetically even a little bit, there's nothing stopping it from changing so much over a large period of time, so that it can no longer reproduce with other organisms it's related to. There is no line separating micro and macroevolution; enough micro changes adds up to a macro change.","Theophilus","441532","If you remove the BRAF gene from a human, is it still human? Yes.

Think not in terms of individuals as members of species, nor even in terms of species as essential types, but in terms of populations and the genes flowing through their gene pools. That is the real key to understanding what Darwinian evolution by natural selection is all about.","evolution-religion","06:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","43"

But the argument you make with reference to said video still commits the fallacy of arguing from incredulity. The fact that a given individual finds an idea difficult to believe has no bearing at all on whether or not it is true. And the point about microevolution and macroevolution has already been addressed. It's a spurious distinction, albeit a distinction that is very commonly made by creationists.","evolution-religion","06:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","45"
