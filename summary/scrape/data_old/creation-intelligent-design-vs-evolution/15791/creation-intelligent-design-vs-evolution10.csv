Scientific arguments are a subset of arguments, and I fail to see the significance of that qualifier.","Bennedict","444046","In most cases, yes. A claim or argument made regarding the nature of anything in the universe is considered a scientific claim or argument. Your argument along with the arguments made by evolutionists, and the arguments made by creationists and even religion in general, focus on the nature of something in the universe, thus making them scientific arguments or claims. Now you can begin to see why evidence is significant, with literally an infinite number of hypotheses about the nature of the universe. Without evidence, your argument holds as much weight as a creationist's, which is none in the scientific sector. So, a philosophical argument for example does not require evidence, because philosophy often deals with intangibles, and thus all arguments are equally valid. In science, an argument is only valid if it is supported. Which in turn means to say, either produce some evidence or don't expect to be taken seriously by any scientific intellect. Judging by your ""tone"" (if I am able to judge such a thing over the internet), being taken seriously is something you would like very much, otherwise you wouldn't spend so much time explaining your position over and over. As it stands, you want to be taken seriously for your scientific claims, yet you refuse to produce any evidence, and that's why we roll our eyes at your argument.","evolution-religion","11:52 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","136"

Then all sound and cogent arguments are scientific arguments rendering the term superfluous. As I said the need for evidence is automatically protected by the rules of logic. If philosophical arguments are not scientific arguments they are all equally false according to your definition of scientific argument. I have all the evidence I need. Perhaps I mean it when I say that debate is important to advance human knowledge and cooperation. As for explaining myself over and over again, it's either that or ignore people. If you wish to be ignored please inform me. You roll your eyes because you are ignorant, you do not even know what the nature of logic is to think it can be decoupled from evidence.","evolution-religion","01:03 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","137"

Not all arguments are scientific arguments, because not all arguments deal with the nature of the universe. Abortion, drug war and gun control debates deal with human practices; politic debates deal with societal structures; an argument with your wife about how to spend your year's bonus is not pertinent to how items in the universe work. Scientific debates work differently than any other for a number of reasons. For one thing, you need hard, empirical evidence to support your arguments. Without any, you have a scientific assertion when attempting to put forth your idea as a viable argument. Logic is used in a scientific argument to piece evidentiary evidence together to make some sort of inference, and an interpretation which would support your argument. Saying you base your scientific argument on logic alone without evidence is like saying you build your cabinets using carpenter's glue alone, without wood. Get yourself a Google and find it.","evolution-religion","06:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","138"

Once again you are ignorant. All arguments rely on evidence; they're called premises. There is nothing extra or needed just because you tack on your prefixes like some religious apologist. Then you will no longer contest my statements on the quality of definition.","evolution-religion","07:13 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","139"

I never said ""not all arguments deal with something in the universe"", I said ""not all arguments deal with the nature of the universe."" Not all arguments rely on evidence. There is no evidence in political debates, because politics is a subjective topic. Right and wrong do not exist in subjectivity. Science is very much objective, so there are good and bad interpretations of evidence. Once again, I can see you are no scientist, and being an engineer does not make you one (lol). You have a misunderstanding of what scientific evidence is. Of course, I won't be able to convince you of this due to your inherent stubbernness. Unfortunately, no one here has been able to convince you of anything, as your bloated ego is crafted from weapons-grade titanium, despite you delivering consistently incorrect information, many of which pieces have been pointed out as being false.","evolution-religion","09:56 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","140"

"12-04-2011","15791",10,"Freedom","444116","All sound and cogent arguments rely on premises which on a global scope are always evidence. a premise is an assumption that something is true.

Please find some examples.","Bennedict","444124","I'm afraid not. Premise - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ... Not synonymous with ""evidence."" Evidence - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ...

Every source available? Try asking someone who understand formal logic. I will give you no more leniency here than I have before, you must make your own case using your own arguments. If you want to use wikipedia for premises go ahead, but I may challenge those premises. I am still correct and this is perhaps the only time that I have seen someone literally attack the nature of logic to try to get a point past me! Let's see if you can survive how right you are (you love this strategy btw): If not all sound or cogent arguments are scientific arguments (by your definition) find me one that isn't a scientific argument (by your definition) Further find a sound or cogent argument that isn't based on evidence on a global scope.

Another one: ""Obama's health care plan would harm America's economy rather than helping it."" There is no incorrect answer here; in fact, both are true. There is no better or worse interpretations of evidence, because evidence does not play any important role in this discussion. These arguments deal with the political and economic strategies of a new health care proposition in the US. You could argue that this is all encompassed in the universe, and that fits into the description of a scientific argument, but the description of a scientific argument is not ""an argument dealing with something in the universe"". You appear to have misunderstood, and are too egotistical to accept that. In fact, you are probably too egotistical to accept that you are even egotistical at all. Both of the arguments above make no assumptions, either. Indeed the free health care plan would affect the economy negatively, and would improve health care accessibility. These are obvious effects that would definitely happen if the health care plan were to be implimented.","evolution-religion","12:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","146"
