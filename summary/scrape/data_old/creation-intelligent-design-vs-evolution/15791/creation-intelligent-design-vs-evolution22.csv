And for the last 2,000 years Christ hasn't walked the earth. Now, where's the Big Foot skeletons and their pile of scat?","evolution-religion","10:25 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","318"
"06-24-2012","15791",22,"Freedom","457619","Why won't God speak to me and save me from my sin?","Easyrider","457659","He might. But it's more probable he's waiting on you to finally do a respectable due-diligence and intensely study the New Testament, leaving your biases behind you. ""You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart."" - Jeremiah 29:13 I don't think you've sought him will all your heart. Pray to the Lord that he will give you wisdom about Christ, and he will. He showed up for me and plenty of my friends big time. p.s. Don't wait too long. You aren't guaranteed tomorrow.","evolution-religion","10:08 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","321"
"06-25-2012","15791",22,"Freedom","457665","Not too bright in the epistemology department huh? Patterson Gimlin Film - YouTube Analysis: Patterson Gimlin Bigfoot Film- Bill Munns Analysis - YouTube God is all merciful, God is all just... for one. It wouldn't contradict any laws of nature if they did. Gigantopithecus - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Check your ears. No, that's incorrect. Evidence which has other plausible explanations is still evidence. There is evidence for a monotheistic God if only the stories and 'eyewitnesses'. If he wants me to do something, why doesn't he talk to me now? If he said it in the book he can say it to me directly right?","Winston Smith","457674","Is that the best you can do? apart from ad hominem No contradiction that doesn't make it probable Add to your mental confusions this : you confuse probable with possible. Neither logic nor epistemology is your forte it says clearly extinct and for a long time ad hominem. couldn't refute me, I see evidence is fact not explanation. check your dictionary Your conception of God is antropomorphic","evolution-religion","03:22 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","323"
"06-25-2012","15791",22,"Freedom","457492","Because I do not ridicule in place of debate. The context in which you introduced big foot was a hypothetical disagreement, specifically whether it was 'worth' debating. It doesn't matter if I think it's ridiculous, at the end of a proper debate there is no question left as to whether a conclusion is wrong. I will use terms like absurd, ridiculous, or silly but only to convey how much I disagree with something, never as an argument. I can't remember the last time I saw you do anything more than ridicule another's opinion. No I don't think it's ridiculous by the way.","Accipiter","457677","Bigfoot is not ridiculous? How about astrology, is that not ridiculous also?","evolution-religion","04:07 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","324"

"06-26-2012","15791",22,"Freedom","457745","So your position is circular, as I thought.","Easyrider","457752","Jeremiah 29:13 is hardly circular.","evolution-religion","12:28 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","329"
"06-26-2012","15791",22,"Easyrider","457752","Jeremiah 29:13 is hardly circular.","Freedom","457755","The reason God can't tell me the truth himself is that he said in a book that the book is the truth and he doesn't come to people until they are already repentant and ready to believe whatever the book says... i.e. at the point where him showing up wouldn't actually change my mind. Has he shown up for you? Or does he not need to because you have faith?","evolution-religion","01:01 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","330"
