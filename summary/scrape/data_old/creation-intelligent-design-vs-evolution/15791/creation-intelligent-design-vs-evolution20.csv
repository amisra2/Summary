If a person believes the scientific establishment on something but do not know why it is true themselves, they rely on trusting the scientific establishment. If they believe the scientific establishment on something, and they know why it is true themselves; they can still have trust but they are not relying on it. A person who relies on trust will not be able to argue that this thing is true beyond an appeal to authority. A person who does not rely on trust will be able to argue using the reasons that have them convinced. A quick note on the difference between faith and trust. Faith is belief regardless of reason, trust is belief based on a high regard for someone's authority. They overlap when it is irrational to hold an authority in high regard, and it isn't for most scientist on most issues, while it certainly is for a God which can only be accessed through personal hallucination. Now what is the measure of authority? One might be tempted to say ""how often it is right"", but that could be a matter of luck or manipulation when the only check of whether they are right is them. A rational person (by definition) holds that reason is the only proper way to acquire knowledge, thus to told an authority in high regard is to consider it competent to carry out sound and cogent reasoning and to accurately report conclusions. There is a need for trust every day of our lives, and given to many people; but one of the places trust does not belong is debate. Debates occur when a disagreement makes it apparent that the reasoning of both sides needs to be evaluated for one or both are wrong. It makes no difference whether the reasoning used is from the individual or from some authority he/she trusts but it is the reasoning which must be evaluated. Attempting to debate by evaluating the quality of an authority (appeal to authority) is superfluous and circular because of the above mentioned fact about what constitutes the quality of an authority. i.e. the quality of the authority is it's ability to reason correctly, to determine whether it reasoned correctly one needs to evaluate it's reasoning. Now if people agree on the mechanics and by implication understand the mechanics to some degree, they will be able to argue in favor of their beliefs based on that understanding. When I see appeals to authority and nothing else I infer that the individual does not posses any understanding (correct or otherwise) and is simply relaying that they believe this or that because they trust an authority. When I argue I do not appeal to authorities, as a consequence I have had to deal with the extreme irony of being accused of having no authorities to appeal to as if that were a negative point against my argument. (ex. ""and who else thinks that?..."") Getting back to the original subject, the mechanics of AGCC aren't just wrong; they are too vague to evaluate. It doesn't even qualify as a hypothesis because crucial links between postulates are simply missing or so abstract that the number of assumptions divorces the result from any hope of accuracy. This is very similar to the fallacies implied by irrational evolution, there is a great amount of equivocation between observation, analysis, and explanation. Every little part of both AGCC and irrational evolution is on it's own valid and provable, the parts simply don't fit together to the whole that they are claimed to. This is very dangerous because scientist are highly specialized today compared to the polymaths of as little as a 100 years ago. As long as the part each scientist understands from his/her field is internally consistent no red flags will go up, that does not mean they poured over the whole body of assertion and confirmed it's validity. If everyone who agrees with AGCC could explain the whole thing consistently and clearly, and then present the repeatable experiments which prove it; it would obviously not be false. That is not the case, the junk science that goes flying around on politically charged websites, high-school text-books, and TV documentaries is the substance of this hoax and not a veneer over some properly executed scientific investigation. The actual reasoning is a very simplistic piece of circular logic. The predictions the result of a surprisingly few scientist using computer models based on their circular reasoning. Defensible argument about what? I think we've been over this, in fact I have been over this with just about 85% of the people who disagree with me. If you are unwilling to argue you should not say that you are right, and someone else is wrong no matter what you think about their beliefs personally. Obviously they think they are right and you are wrong, and if they would not argue with you; you would have no defense because there would be no attack. I endure dismissals only in hopes that one day those who issue them (wink nudge) might realize this.","evolution-religion","02:33 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","288"
