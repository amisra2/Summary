Find me the dictionary.com link which shows that. At base level, all things are dealt with scientifically. Politics involves the soft sciences of psychology, social sciences, etc. but a political debate does not deal with these things. Political debates are subjective confrontations. Politicians do not debate scientifically, using evidence, breaking down the nature of another politician's platform using scientific research. I wish they would conduct debates that way, but watch any political debate and you'll know this doesn't happen, yet each party retains a subjective validation for their arguments. Okay. So Easyrider walks into the offices of Nature scientific journals and proposes that creationism is true, and evolution is false. He actually has a pretty decent proposal, which makes logical sense. Would you accept this as a scientific proposal, if you worked at Nature, despite the fact that he produces no evidence whatsoever? If an argument dealing with a scientific field does not provide evidence (as is the case with yours), it shouldn't be considered a scientific argument. The evidence is okay - Behe misinterprets this evidence, takes it out of context and misuses it to support his argument. I am talking about the work of David DeRosier. Well, if you did want Christians to take you seriously for a theocratic interpretation, lets say, you would need to reference the bible to convince them! Good analogy, Freedom. You wouldn't be able to convince a priest that Jesus condoned homosexual behavior without referencing the bible, using only logic, in the same way you wouldn't be able to convince the scientific community of your argument without referencing evidence, using only logic. This is because the priest and the scientific community will want to see support for your idea. The Sun, being the source of all energy on Earth, must have existed before 20 million years ago, as fossil evidence shows that energy was being accessed far earlier than that, as can be seen with the dating of dinosaur remains, which predate the proposed 20 million year lifespan of the the Sun. Why are we talking about this?","Freedom","444623","Pertaining, dealing with are synonymous to regarding. The is no difference between reference to the nature of and a direct reference because you used the term regarding in the context of argument, indicating a conclusion and thus a subject. This does not meet the challenge. So you walk into the most fundamentalist church you can find with any scientific theory. Do you think they care about evidence or logic? There is no arbiter of truth but reason. It is not my responsibility or anyone's responsibility alter their idea to conform to any demands but those reason. I do not need to deal with what Nature or any other article or community may require to accept an idea, I need only establish it's truth. Evidence is automatically dealt with via premises. Irrational evolution is a misinterpretation at best. The support is the premises. You hand-picked that example, the bible is one of the few sources on Jesus. What if I wanted to prove to Christians that the earth was round? You don't have radioisotope dating yet.","evolution-religion","04:03 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","181"

But don't worry! I won't refuse to talk to you until you've apologized, lol. You are proposing your scientific idea here to a group of a number of scientifically educated people, confronting a heavily supported scientific fact, to establish what you consider to be the truth, without evidence? Some call this trolling. Others call this a waste of time on your part. In logic and other types of arguments, yes. In science, no. I don't care. This is another red herring. Stop it. It's an analogy. A priest would expect you to support an idea regarding something in the bible; this is easily seen. The scientific community would expect the same of your idea.

Interpretations of that evidence. However, scientific evidence requires an in depth exploration of the subject, using and collecting laboratory and field data. My guess would be that you will not be able to find any evidence to support your argument, because your argument violates many principles that make up a scientific theory, as is outlined by the scientific method. I would not be able to refute it without future research and technology, but I can make the argument that there isn't enough evidence to support such a claim, which would discredit it. In our situation, I am saying exactly that. You haven't got enough scientific evidence to make this claim as a scientific truth. Now, these two situations are not equivalent. You may be right, you may be wrong, but you are neither until you can provide a falsifiable hypothesis - and you need to accept it when your hypothesis is falsified, something I think you would have quite some trouble with. The number of people who tried to discredit Darwin was extensive, however Darwin garnered so much evidence to support his theory, that it stands as the strongest explanation for natural phenomena today, by far. To have a scientific theory which stands up to over 150 years, it needs a massive amount of evidence. That's why Darwin's theory has stood up for that long, and that's why the 20 mya Sun theory has not.","evolution-religion","12:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","195"
