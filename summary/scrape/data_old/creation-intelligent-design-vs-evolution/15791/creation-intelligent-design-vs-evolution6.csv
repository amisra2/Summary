"11-25-2011","15791",6,"Freedom","443490","Why irrational evolution is wrong. Foundations of modern biology Much of modern biology can be encompassed within five unifying principles: cell theory, evolution, genetics, homeostasis, and energy.","Accipiter","443500","So the purpose of your work is to disprove evolution? Do you really think that modern biology can survive if they dismiss evolution?

Do you really think that modern biology can survive if they dismiss evolution?","Freedom","443501","I think modern biology would be totally fine without rational evolution much less irrational evolution. A machine works as it does regardless of it's origin. We only know to expect homology when we see homology but to exult evolution supporters will wire that through common descent to give the impression that common descent gave some useful insight. Those who literally think evolution has some kind of practical use need to be told that you can wake up in the morning without calling the ceiling evolution. They have to say insane things like inheritance is evolution and since we need to understand inheritance we must understand evolution. In fact the best example someone could possibly give to that point would be researchers considering the adaptation of bacteria to anti-biotics. To explain that they would need rational evolution, but why do they need to explain it? As everyone keeps telling me it makes no predictions, all they can do is say that the thing might change again in the future.... so much for the foundation of all biology.","evolution-religion","02:50 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","79"

Why the need to explain it? Because that's what science does. What you are suggesting is that we drop our extensive knowledge of evolution and biology in substitution for ""we don't need to explain why things happen the way they do"", which essentially removes the science portion from a distinguished scientific field.","evolution-religion","11:50 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","82"

That quote convinces me that I did the right thing by putting Freedom on ignore. Why bother arguing about better and worse explanations for natural phenomena with someone who sees no need for explaining them?","evolution-religion","01:45 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","83"

Yes, environments might change again, and those changes would be reflected in the organisms in that environment. This is a prediction.","evolution-religion","02:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","84"
"11-26-2011","15791",6,"Freedom","443576","That being said evolution hasn't really had any practical purpose yet, that explains both why it hasn't been tested by the reality of failure nor is Accipiter's point relevant.","Ripskar","443580","False: It is used in immunology, conservation, land management, animal husbandry, plant breeding, pest control and any number of more academic purposes.","evolution-religion","06:36 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","86"

Agricultural evolution (land management and faunal production) Animal and plant domestication, and how evolution is and will be used in this work Some information about the role of evolution in pest control and other agricultural fields Now, you asked, so you better read these, at least part ways. We all know your tendency to ask for evidence but then stick your fingers in your ears when we give it to you. You often try and use logical deviants to circumvent reading the information we try to give you, which is unacceptable. Research is slightly more powerful than your logical assertions.","evolution-religion","08:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","89"
