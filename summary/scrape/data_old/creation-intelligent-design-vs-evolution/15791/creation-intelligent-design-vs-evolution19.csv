Science is the same everywhere there is intelligence to put it into process. Science has no color. It is in the best interest of scientists to search for the answers.

There is science in finding patterns of human behavior, and yes, it may uncover some of what you speak of, but to say that the entire scientific community has been corrupted is just being naive. If anything, the natural selection you brought up only serves to keep them honest as there is much competition within the scientific community. One of a scientist's favorite things to do is debunk his competitor, and none of them want to look stupid. I challenge you to find an accepted yet false (or at least that you may believe is false) scientific conclusion that was falsified because of funding - and please don't bring in evolution...","evolution-religion","10:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","277"

"06-02-2012","15791",19,"Accipiter","456441","I thought it was money that motivated these scientists to lie.","Freedom","456456","Let me clarify, no money is being offered to tell lies; no scientist think of themselves as liars. I should not have said lying, I should have said many scientist are breaking with the scientific method in part because of the political and economic forces surrounding AGCC. The effect is produced because money is offered into researching mans effect on global climate change. This attracts scientist who expect a correlation, or who more specifically consider 'no clear correlation' as a failure of their research. I know the philosophical forces behind the hope that AGCC is correct but many cannot as they are mired in the same currents to some degree. It has gotten to a point where many colleges and universities offer specific courses on 'environmental science', which simply assumes the assertions of AGCC to say the least. I know you understand this affect because you see it in people like easyrider, if you go to school with people who all assume something is true beyond doubt; and study subjects like theology which would have no meaning without these assumptions, you are likely going to be irrevocably biased if asked to conduct research based on the skills you learned at school. Now biased people can be good scientist, because science doesn't operate off of personal authority; it operates off of objective evidence and sound reasoning. I am not saying it is appropriate to dismiss anything AGCC scientist say. It is appropriate to dismiss 'expert' opinions, not arguments or the data (premises) for those arguments.","evolution-religion","01:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","282"

The bias is in the form of strong belief based on trust in authority, namely their professors and professional colleagues. It's a self-supporting structure, individually they draw their confidence from the confidence of the whole, and their personal confidence contributes to the confidence of others. That's one of the reasons appeals to authority are so insidious. It's one of the main reasons religions get big and powerful. It's why otherwise rational people can get caught up in communist or fascist parties. The proper attitude of a scientist or in fact anyone following the correct epistemology is to have confidence only in good arguments.","evolution-religion","05:42 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","284"
