As I said in the scientific conspiracy thread, an unconscious one yes. The kind that forms when any group of associated people believe firmly in something. The same kind that formed around Rand & her novels during her life. You've got to understand that it's not sinister to make plans if you don't believe what you're doing is wrong. It's like saying a school board meeting is a conspiracy to educate children. Yet I would characterize the behavior of religious education as a concerted effort to condition faith into students, borderline brainwashing but I couldn't very well accuse them of malice unless I were to doubt their own belief in the worth of faith. That's a bit of a silly question as you addressed the answer at the top, their motivation is that they want and hope it to be true so that they can have a supposedly working theory of life. For anyone who believes in the false dichotomy between ID and evolution, it's a philosophical requirement to replace a creation myth with a scientific theory before they can abandon belief in the supernatural. The motivation is the age old temptation of explaining something you aren't actually able to via intellectual shortcuts. I think we both agree that the origin of religion is essentially a mental short-circuit in which people simply (and probably unconsciously) became frustrated with their ignorance, especially about the truth value of morality and concatenated stories that 'explained' the world around them and most importantly explained themselves. Why would someone say god may the heaven's and the earth? What was their motivation? Why is sickness caused by an imbalance of the elements? Why would someone draw a map of a flat planet when they've never seen the edges?","Accipiter","443677","So are there parts of the theory you agree with or do disagree with the whole thing?

It does not adapt an operating system to new opportunities, that is a novel opportunity. It is not the revival of an ancient system which also accomplishes the function. If you want an example of an observed change that cannot be explained, I have none for we have not observed novel changes. Yet we know that since all systems have not always existed they must have come into existence and thus had a formation event. To that end a specific example is every single operational biological system.","evolution-religion","08:10 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","113"

African and Asian elephants can, in theory reproduce biologically, but they do not due to a geographical separation, which is an example of allopatric speciation. They are classified as two different species because of this. Essentially Freedom, you again aren't making a scientific argument. All of these novel systems in which you are concerned with have developed many billions of years ago. We have no evidence for whether or not these novel systems have evolved in the same way everything else in biology has; no evidence doesn't mean it didn't happen. We infer that it did based on theory and comparative morphology. You are presenting an infalsifiable hypothesis which cannot be based on evidence. This than fails the requirements for a scientific theory, or argument in this case. Not my words, the words of Carl Sagan. You are making an assertion once again.","evolution-religion","08:16 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","119"
"12-01-2011","15791",8,"Freedom","443887","bio-technology as in the systems and well... technology; is there a better word to describe it? Machines which accomplish various tasks by taking advantage of physical laws. Systems and technology produced and used by living things. If you don't know what the hec I'm talking about how could you identify evidence for it? sigh... anytime a creationist talks about species turning into each other there is a march down main-street of all the evolutionist eager to correct them, that at the point of divergence almost no differences exist they build up over time in isolation. I have long sense abandoned the species oriented way of talking about life it's simply ill-defined and not very useful. When you name a specific species that of course implies exactly the number and type of systems it possesses but it's still just an arbitrary grouping. The closest thing we have to a hard definition of species is no inter-breeding but even that has not been perfectly observed in taxonomy. Talking about speciation we are essentially talking about the measure of one variable. Genetic divergence between two reproducing populations. It is the exact same phenomenon as different breeds and sub-breeds just on a larger scale. What a breed is to a species a species is to an order (or other higher taxonomic classification). Divergence is an associated by not proportional measurement to novelty. Two species could break off from an ancestor, become genetically very different; enough so that they cannot reproduce, and still not advance. While on the other hand a species could remain a unified gene pool and yet advance greatly with no new species or observable divergence (except to ancestral forms). What is a dinosaur and what is a bird that I can guarantee that a bird is more advanced? I cannot name you a single system in a bird that we are sure did not exist in theropods to some degree. If you want to draw the line at flight be my guest, but why not just say flight? It's the system not the name that's important in the end.","Accipiter","443897","What about un-advancement, is it possible that something can evolve in to a less advanced form?","evolution-religion","08:29 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","120"
