You are truly priceless (or worthless - one of the two).","Accipiter","453918","ez is a robot, he seems to post a small group of fairly generic messages, his program rearranges the order of the words to give the illusion that he is a real human. If he is not a robot then he must be a very simple person.","evolution-religion","10:14 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","241"

If a theory must explain then evolutionary theory is no theory at all. I heard that was a single point mutation.","pandion","453936","I assumed that when I said that the theory of gravity explains the observations of gravity I had been clear enough. The observations are the facts. The theories explain the facts. Why don't you try to educate yourself about science before you speak. All scientific theories explain, by definition. theory: A set of statements or principles devised to explain a group of facts or phenomena. - American Heritage Science Dictionary and theory: An explanation for sets of phenomena that is developed by observation and experimentation. - Dictionary of Modern Biology I know the concept is pretty difficult for you to grasp, but try. Not really. It was a gene duplication and an alternative long open reading frame of an internally repetitious coding sequence. There does not appear to have been a point mutation. However, this is macro evolution since it created a new species (Flavobacterium Sp. K172). The actual new gene is located on the pOAD2 plasmid. It produces a 392-amino acid-long-residue bacterial enzyme. The original reading of the sequence produced a 472-residue-long protein sequence. I believe that the original gene still produces this protein sequence.","evolution-religion","01:19 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","242"

Description is not explanation, even when one is able to describe as a single universal principle. Alright, why do masses exert attractive forces on each other? Confusion in general nomenclature (as evidenced by the varying and sometimes contradictory definitions presented for scientific terms [up to and including science and scientific themselves]) does not translate to my ignorance simply because I recognize them. Then give me 'the theory' of gravity. Interesting, so you are saying that this thing lost 240 base pairs of data and then it could metabolize a byproduct of nylon which has like a three functional group similarity with lysine. I am really feeling the novelty. Oh and species is a badly defined term for sexually reproducing life forms, for prokaroyotes? It means nothing in this context.","evolution-religion","03:56 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","243"

OH YE OF GREAT FAITH!!","smiley","453992","I am always perplexed, though not surprised, by your ability to take the fact that someone may not know something as evidence in favour of your own view. There is so much evidence of links all over the place. Just because one of them is still missing does nothing for your cause. You would have to actually produce evidence for your view to achieve that - something that neither you nor anyone else has ever done. Every time a new specimen is discovered to close a gap, you say "" Aha! Look, now there are two gaps where there used to be one ."" Your god of the gaps is getting very small indeed, and it appears that he is not the only thing round here that is very small indeed.","evolution-religion","06:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","247"

"05-01-2012","15791",17,"charlemagne","453825","Yes; Evolution is a religion, an atheistic religion. I think it would be fair to say that people who hold to the belief of evolution affirm the non-existence of a divine being. Though it's interesting to point out, the illogical view of atheism. What the atheist is really saying is: ""there is no being with omniscience in the universe and I know it to be true by virtue of my own omniscience."" A scientific theory summarizes a hypothesis or group of hypotheses that have been supported with repeated testing. Why is evolution still just theory? Because it can only be tested at the microevolutionary scale. It isn't observable at the macroevolutionary level because it's to slow. This is where evolutionists go wrong and put down all their proofs and evidences, and take up faith (as defined as, assurance of things hoped for and conviction of things not seen). So we treat evolution as if it were a law, because we can test it at one level. Since it is true on that one level we have faith that it is true on the next level. I think it's interesting to point out that in the thousands of years of written history there is no proof of any macroevolution. Especially in today's day and age with bacteria. "" For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power, and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse. Romans 1:20""","Databed","454051","First off, you have no clue what a theory is. If you did, you wouldn't have written the above. Secondly, you don't need to see macro evolution to prove it - just as we can't see the life cycle of a star, plate tectonics, the erosion of a mountain, the formation of a mountain, etc etc. The fact is we are smart beings and can deduce things, test our hypotheses and come to conclusions. If you're not smart enough to understand the process, don't come waving your beliefs which have absolutely no support whatsoever. BTW, anyone who thinks evolution is a religion is a complete dufus.","evolution-religion","01:24 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","251"
