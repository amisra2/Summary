"06-26-2012","15791",23,"Freedom","457755","The reason God can't tell me the truth himself is that he said in a book that the book is the truth and he doesn't come to people until they are already repentant and ready to believe whatever the book says... i.e. at the point where him showing up wouldn't actually change my mind. Has he shown up for you? Or does he not need to because you have faith?","Easyrider","457776","That's not true. God came into Saul's (Paul's) life on the Road to Damascus before Saul / Paul repented of persecuting Christians. Christ also came into the disciple's lives when they weren't expecting it. Freedom, He's spoken to me, spoken to my nephew (which spooked him so bad he almost ran out of his kitchen), and he's spoken to others. He's shown up big time in my life on numerous occasions. Just ask God to reveal Christ to you. He will in time. Don't wait on this. There is a hell and a final judgment. The Bible is clear on that.","evolution-religion","08:45 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","331"

Here's something just for you - one of the most famous sermons in history: Select Sermons - Christian Classics Ethereal Library Repent, before you fry!","Penfold","457812","I was passing, and thought I might dip my toe in the crazy for a while.

"06-27-2012","15791",23,"Freedom","457864","Ah, so God has been willing. Why not I? Ask him why he won't speak to me. God is all knowing which means he's aware of the contents of this forum, he is also all powerful which means he could respond to this question on this forum and provide proof for any doubters of his nature. @God, reveal Christ to me; reveal yourself, tell me everything, prove everything, and then answer my questions. I asked, now shall I receive?... or shall I learn from someone as enlightened as you that it ""doesn't work that way"".","Easyrider","457879","When you get serious about seeking God with all your heart, then you'll find him. But I doubt you're going to debate your way into his Kingdom. And if you've already SINCERELY asked God to reveal Christ to you, in due time he will. Watch for it.","evolution-religion","10:00 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","336"

You can give no reason why he won't speak to me. You admit he has changed the course of others who were not 'seeking with all their heart' nor have you explained why God would possibly wait for my proactive emotional state to save me from you claim are terrible consequences.","evolution-religion","04:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","337"

You can say, ""If you indeed do exist, God, please reveal the reality of Jesus Christ to me."" If you can't at least do that I can't help you, except to say study the New Testament more.","evolution-religion","04:27 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","338"
"06-30-2012","15791",23,"Theophilus","441302","Many Christians, such as myself, will often argue that Evolution in itself is a religion. One of the definitions from Merriam-Webster of religion is, ""a cause, principle, or held to with ardor and faith."" I would argue that in order to believe the theory of evolution it takes ardor and faith. You must have faith that intelligent design did not cause the origin of life. You must also have faith that species have evolved, etc. I am interested to know what everyone else thinks.","kowalskil","458135","The idea (theory) of Evolution is scientific, not spiritual.
