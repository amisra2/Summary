Natural selection is the differential reproductive success of individuals that have advantageous traits. Sexual selection is the differential reproductive success of certain individuals who are attractive to the opposite sex because they possess certain physical characteristics, even though those characteristics are actually a hindrance to survival. Look into it. Learn before you speak.","Freedom","459277","So you're saying that if an individual achieves above average reproductive sucess because it attracted more mates, it's not sexual selection if the mates were attracted by what you consider advantagous traits?","evolution-religion","01:34 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","361"
"10-14-2012","15791",25,"Theophilus","441302","Many Christians, such as myself, will often argue that Evolution in itself is a religion. One of the definitions from Merriam-Webster of religion is, ""a cause, principle, or held to with ardor and faith."" I would argue that in order to believe the theory of evolution it takes ardor and faith. You must have faith that intelligent design did not cause the origin of life. You must also have faith that species have evolved, etc. I am interested to know what everyone else thinks.","ipetrified","464221","Evolution is not the product of faith. It is a theory that was the product of reason, logic, testing etc... It takes no faith to not believe in something. It takes faith to believe in something. Intelligent design was the creationists way to stick god back into an equation that effectively kicked him out through the course of time. Since their 9,000 year old Earth theory was ridiculous, they took evolution and stuck god into it. However, ""god"" is outside the scope of science. Since apparently, he is omnipotent, he is inherently infinitely complex. So science cannot solve that mystery. However, many things were perceived to be infinitely complex a few centuries ago; those same things are being understood today.","evolution-religion","12:35 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","362"
"10-14-2012","15791",25,"Easyrider","458582","""Article 11"" merely says that the government of America is not founded on the Christian religion, as in a theocracy. This does not mean that the majority of Americans were not of the Christian faith, and it certainly doesn't address the numerous Judeo-Christian principles upon which our country was founded. In those respects, it falls short in describing America. The sentence that you and other liberals love to draw upon means nothing but our government isn't a theocracy not that the Christian principles of the Bible aren't its foundation. That treaty, written in Arabic, was translated for the Senate and President Adams by Joel Barlow. The following from the Yale Law School Web site may enlighten our liberal friends. There IS NO Article 11 and this is a FACT: ""... the Barlow translation is at best a poor attempt at a paraphrase or summary of the sense of the Arabic ... Most extraordinary ... is the fact that Article 11 of the Barlow translation, with its famous phrase, 'the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion,' does not exist at all. There is no Article 11. The Arabic text which is between Articles 10 and 12 is in form a letter, crude and flamboyant and withal quite unimportant, from the Dey of Algiers to the Pasha of Tripoli. How that script came to be written ... as Article 11 ... is a mystery and seemingly must remain so.""

Islam is a ""works"" oriented religion and Christianity is salvation by grace and faith in Christ. Not only that but Allah is a pagan moon god while the Biblical God is not. They're not the same God. Judaism doesn't recognize Christ as divine or Savior.

"10-14-2012","15791",25,"ipetrified","464259","Sorry let me rephrase that. All 3 share same values, key events in the story line (the qu'ran, savior figures etc.. Islam fully accepts Jesus as the messiah.. but only with regard to him as a savior via his teachings not himself.) Of course the 3 will have their differences, otherwise they wouldn't be 3 different religions. But the similarities of the religions also makes them competitive with each other. Islam and Christianity belittle Judaism for not accepting the ""newer"" scripture.","gansao","464284","Sharing the same values is no indicator that religions are identical or different faces of the same thing. Buddhism and Christianity share a huge amount of values ( indeed some say that Christ was a Buddha) on the surface but the reason of having these values are polar opposite. The premise of Christianity was that Christ was an extension of the creator God which is considered blasphemy to Muslims. Both stances are irreconcilable.Even though Islam and Christianity share many values those values are based on completely different premises.","evolution-religion","01:27 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","367"
"10-15-2012","15791",25,"ipetrified","464259","-An inscription to Mithras reads: ""He who will not eat of my body and drink of my blood, so that he will be made on with me and I with him, the same shall not know salvation."" (1) -In John 6:53-54, Jesus is said to have repeated this theme: ""...Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day."" (1)J. Goodwin, ""Mystery Religions of the Ancient World,"" Thames & Hudson, (1981), Page 28. Shall I continue with the parallels?

Goodwin gives no reference for his claim, and it is actually quite false: no such inscription exists. The real fact behind the falsehood is that Franz Cumont, the founder of Mithraic Studies, in an article mentioned a Garshuni manuscript that attributed this saying to Zoroaster. The manuscript is Mingana ms. 142, and is a medieval Arabic Christian text. I had the work translated, so you can find it online (I can't post a link). Another manuscript of the same kind, quoted but not referenced by Cumont in a posthumous article, is Mingana 481. Again I had this translated, and it is here (ditto): The ""quotations"" are all fictional, and the works belong to the genre of medieval sacro-profane sayings literature, where quotations from pagan figures predicting Christ are assembled as a counterpart to the Old Testament. It would be better not to: for I'm not sure what you would hope to achieve by pasting rubbish off the web (without giving your real source, I notice, since you did not mine Goodwin for that material yourself). But if you are claiming that two things must be connected, indeed one must be derived from the other, if any resemblance can be seen or claimed between the two, then perhaps you would offer a proof of this claim? It is, of course, untrue, and a rather strange mistake to make. It is the same mistake that Atlantis cultists make, when they argue that pyramids in Mexico and pyramids in Egypt prove the existence of Atlantis. In reality it proves that gravity affects piles of blocks in similar ways, and that human beings tend to do similar things under similar conditions. Anyone can find ""parallels"" between any two things, if they try hard enough. Be sceptical.

Let us dissect Christianity for you.

In essence, Christianity was probably influenced by Paganistic thoughts/symbols/theology/ideologies more so than Islam due to its founding date being later around 600 AD. Where the Pagan religions had lost a great amount of influence","Easyrider","464409","Just Google ""Allah pagan moon god,"" and you'll see a number of websites that go into detail on it. Dr. Edwin Yamauchi dismisses this (Mithra) hypothesis in stating ""Those who seek to adduce Mithra as a prototype of the risen Christ ignore the late date for the expansion of Mithraism to the west (cf. M. J. Vermaseren, Mithras, The Secret God, 1963, p. 76)."" Norman Geisler states, ""We do know that Mithraism, like its mystery competitors, had a basic myth. Mithra was supposedly born when he emerged from a rock; he was carrying a knife and torch and wearing a phrygian cap. He battled first with the sun and then the primeval bull, which then became the ground of life for the human race.""7 In comparison, Geisler points out that ""the foundation stones of Christianity are patently taken from the Old Testament, Judaism generally, and the life of a historical figure named Jesus."" Did Christianity Steal from Mithraism? Did Christianity Steal From Mithraism? - Come Reason Ministries ""Exaggerations and oversimplifications abound in this kind of literature. One encounters overblown claims about alleged likenesses between baptism and the Lord's Supper and similar ""sacraments"" in certain mystery cults. Attempts to find analogies between the resurrection of Christ and the alleged 'resurrections' of the mystery deities involve massive amounts of oversimplification and inattention to detail."" - Ronald Nash (Christian Research Journal, Winter 1994, p.8) As a number of scholars have noted, the alleged ""parallels"" between pagan 'gods' and Jesus are only seen in history AFTER the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. In the vast majority of cases people have either blended the religions together or borrowed from Christianity. It's clear in the Bible (actual Old Testament scriptures are referenced) that the origins of Jesus are from the Old Testament. They don't need pagan origins. And if you think you have some spectacular pagan parallel then document the PRE-B.C. source (the original document) as part of your claim.","evolution-religion","10:37 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","369"
