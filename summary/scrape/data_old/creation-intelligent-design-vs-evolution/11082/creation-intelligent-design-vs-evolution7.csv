Much like the average evolutionist is today.","Penfold","309693","Such harsh words from a delusional unquestioning dupe of the world's biggest pyramid scheme!","expelled-expelled","06:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","91"

Shall we ask admin to do an IP check to see what your last handle was Penfold? Now why don't you contribute substance instead of trolling attacks so we don't have to bring him into this.","expelled-expelled","06:16 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","92"

Predictably, once more you cry wolf and run to daddy for support. If not your petty godling, then you substitute the admin, pleading your special ""victim"" case for help if anyone presumes to reply to you in kind. It appears to be little more than a conditioned reflex, as evidenced by your pattern of behaviour. I have no ""last handle"", your paranoia is as rampant as your ignorance. That is at such stultifying levels that reading one of your diatribes effectively reduces the reader's IQ by several points. Mercifully the toxic effect is not enduring. Various posters have patiently attempted to educate you on the elementary principles and functions of the scientific method, only to be rebuffed with a response which content serves to underline the impossibility of their task in explaning something to someone who lacks even a rudimentary understanding of the concepts involved.","expelled-expelled","09:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","93"

So far, I'm me, obvious_child, T.Q, Collin, pandion, a couple others I don't remember... Hopefully one day I'll be good enough to be accused of being Peeling.","expelled-expelled","09:49 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","95"
"04-25-2008","11082",7,"Archangel","309702","You're right; I do need to be more gracious, It makes perfect sense why you're so angry and bitter. If I were like you, I would be bitter too. So I wont contact admin about your IP address unless you challenge me to do so, because I really don't want you to get banned again. I just want you to actually contribute to debates that you break in on and stop trolling with mindless attacks. Do you think you can do that?","jyoshu","309727","Don't you know? It's all the fault of creationists that he can't contain his anger. He's not responsible for his behavior, because creationists have had bad behavior too, so that absolves him and he can be as spiteful as he wants. Why, he has no control over himself whatsoever ! I say let these reactionary evolutionists and ID'ers have their fits. No need to get in to gutter with them. If these evolutionists want to share that gutter with the ID'ers out there who insult and be part of that ilk, then let them go ahead. They can all be miserable together!","expelled-expelled","09:45 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","96"

But it must be true that you're me because you actually spelled my handle with lower case. I'm the only one I know who does that, so you must be me. I must say, though, how I really admire my knowledge and logic...ur...your knowledge and logic. But maybe you're not me. Maybe Penfold is me...or I am Penfold...or we are Penfold -- well, you know, kind of like a trinity; The Penfold, the electrolyte, and the holy pandion.","expelled-expelled","09:59 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","97"

I just want you to actually contribute to debates that you break in on and stop trolling with mindless attacks. Do you think you can do that? And regarding your personal attack on my intelligence over the scientific method. If memory serves, I have never seen you debate it at all. So you see, the fact that I debate it is ample proof that I do understand the concepts being discussed; I just don't agree with them which is where our disagreements lie. So no matter how many big words you try to use, it isn't going to impress anyone if all you can do is troll around the forums contributing nothing, but attacking people who are trying to debate the issues.","Penfold","309732","You mistake contempt for anger, and ridicule for bitterness. Your debate technique consists of a chaotic melange of personal attacks, cherrypicked quotemined cut-and pastes, and endless regurgitation of previously discredited creationist talking points. Debate requires that the participants at least consider the viewpoint of the others. You consistently show a singleminded disregard for any view but your perversion of ""THE TRUTH"" as you see it. As with everything else peculiar to yourself, the fact that it consists of a ragbag of terminological inexactitudes escapes you.","expelled-expelled","10:30 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","98"
