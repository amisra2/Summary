"03-22-2008","11082",2,"jyoshu","306580","See the comments section on the blog entry I linked to, particuarly Stuart's own comments ... ""Yes, you registered online, but the initial invitation was by invite only. You registered who was coming in your invited group, not just first come, first serve. There's a lot of discussion there on that issue. But it really doesn't matter--a private screening of a film is a private screening--they can boot anyone out that they want. I didn't say anything about anyone 'breaking the law.' I'm just showing you a different perspective of the events from a witness--you know, giving you MORE information from which to draw conclusions. Or did you only WANT your information limited to one version of the story, mainly from the account of the one who got booted?? I think it was simply a private screening, and the people running the private screening didn't want them there. That's their prerogative, as it was obviously a private screening and that's the way it works. Again, read the comments on the blog I linked to as they include comments from people who were there, including more from Stuart and at least one by PZ Myers himself.","trebor","306596","Hey, as Collin said, P.Z. registered, and got it. I would say that booting him out is the height of hypocrisy. It confirms to be that it is based on a lie, and the producer knows it. The movie was making a claim that the 'opposition' was silencing I.D., and the presentation of alternate ideas. Yet, what do they do? They kicked someone out they INTERVIEWED for the movie (based on false pretenses to be sure, but they did pay him for appearing in the movie). That sounds that THEY are the ones trying to suppress opposing ideas, not science. Yes, they had the legal right. But, boy did it put egg on their face, considering everything. It shows them to be hypocrites and liars.","expelled-expelled","08:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","17"
"03-22-2008","11082",2,"Collin","306587","So, you wouldn't describe yourself as opposed to Islam's treatment of women? You simply hold your views on this subject? Sorry, but nothing says people who don't have a religion can't oppose religion. It's also important to remember that ""militant atheists"" like Dawkins and Myers aren't opposed to people having religion. What they are opposed to is creationism and the intelligent design movement, the religious indoctrination of children, the attempt to subvert the separation of church and state, and the amazing amount of violence that comes about as a result of religious conflict.","jyoshu","306597","It's no less wrong-headed to oppose people being creationist or ""indoctrinating their children"" (which EVERYONE does in various ways). There's nothing morally wrong with being a creationist. People should be left alone to believe whatever they want, just as you want religious people to leave you alone to believe whatever you want. Creationism may not be scientific , but that doesn't mean it's morally wrong . It's not morally wrong to believe the moon is made of cheese, either. If creationism is something you're a militant toward, then with all due respect I'd seriously suggest finding yourself a much less benign thing to oppose--maybe something that is a serious problem. I also find it fascinating (and frankly rather irrational) that you would lump the likes of ' creationism ' in with ' religious violence ' in terms of what you support being militant toward. I also disagree with you that people like Dawkins aren't opposed to people having religion. They may not be out to legally infringe upon people being able to do things like worshipping, but do you actually believe they would not prefer the world be atheist? Clearly, they are opposed to religion. Atheists like Richard Dawkins and Chris Hitchens all too often aren't careful to make the distinction between religion and fundamentalism. ""Religious violence"" comes about due to extremism , not religion , because religion usually exists without violence and there are very good things that have come about by people claiming to be inspired by religion. At the LEAST, reason dictates that it is BAD religion rather than religion in general out of which bad things like violence comes about. I certainly hope you will continue to be opposed to the likes of extremist violence--many religious people themselves are opposed to such things as well. But please be careful to remember that religion is not really what is at the heart of those things--it's fundamentalism and extremism. After all, we've had people like William Wilberforce, ML King Jr, Desmund Tutu, Bono, and many others standing for peace having been inspired by religion, according to their own words. You see, the phrase 'militant atheism' should be somewhat oxymoronic, or at least unrelated. If a- theism is nothing more than a lack of belief in God (as so many atheists insist that it is in response to religious apologists arguing that atheism ITSELF is a belief), then your militancy really has nothing to do with you being atheist. Therefore you assert to be 'militant' over problems like violence, but that's no different than many religious people doing the same thing as well. It's certainly noble of you to oppose ""religious violence"" (which is really just extremist ideological violence), but there's no more of a moral high ground in being an atheist when it comes to opposing it, than in anything else. In a sense you're just joining in with all sorts of people who AREN'T atheist who oppose such violence as well. Call it a form of pacifism , perhaps, that goes beyond whether one is atheist or not. The somewhat modern aggressive movement in atheism (a la Hitchens and Dawkins) to make atheism some sort of rallying cry and religion out to be a villain rather than blaming 'BAD religion' is fascinating, but very wrong-headed and irrational. These very public atheists have moved past just merely no belief in god to being activists against religion from a PR standpoint. It's a strange form of atheistic evangelism, to some extent. So by all means, oppose the bad things in the world like violence. Again, many religious people opposed violence down through history and do so now. But please don't do what I've seen all too often among atheists and blithely chalk things up to ""religion"" as if it were a one-size-fits-all villain. That's more along the lines of an approach that Falwell would take. And again, I totally disagree with your approach of viewing creationism as something to be militant toward. As well as ""religious indoctrination of children"". What if religious indictrination for a particular parent involves teaching the ethic of reciprocity? (And I hope you realize that it very OFTEN does.) For that matter, many parents (at least if they're decent ones) indoctrinate their children with something . They're instilling values. I suspect the real problem here is just that you don't like the fact that some people instill the values of religion , 'cause you just don't like religion. Which is kind of strange since so many parents instill GOOD values out of their religion. Why would you be opposed to something like that? Again (same as the other issue), what you should be opposed to is parents instilling BAD values, not necessarily religious ones. Sorry for the long post. But you touched on some very major and complicated issues here for which simplicity is not really an option.","expelled-expelled","08:47 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","18"
"03-23-2008","11082",2,"jyoshu","306582","And do you seriously think that if Richard Dawkins' name was registered on the website they wouldn't have noticed that? I find that pretty hard to believe.","ShadowPikachu","306612","From my understanding of it, Dawkins DID register. He registered under his legal name (the name on his passport): Clinton Richard Daw kins . Don't know 'bout you, but when I see that name I think of Bill or Hillary or a friend of mine with the last name Clinton, not of Richard Dawkins the ""militant atheist"". 'specially if the list ended up listing first and last name (i.e. Clinton Dawkins) So no, it isn't really any bit of a stretch to believe. Especially because the last place I (and I believe I would be safe in saying most EVERYONE) would expect the Englishman Richard Dawkins to be seeing a movie is in Minnesota .","expelled-expelled","01:34 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","20"
"03-23-2008","11082",2,"Collin","306611","""Militant atheist"" is a misnomer. When Dawkins and PZ say they're proud to be militant atheists, they envision absolutely nothing having to do with military action or violence. The term has simply come to represent atheists that are assertive about their beliefs. Okay, fine. Dawkins and PZ are ""opposed"" to religion just like all Christians are by default opposed to atheism, Islam, and Judaism even though they're perfectly fine with letting such live amongst them as coworkers and friends. That's nothing new, and nor is it something to be ashamed of. Along the exact same lines of reason: Even though I tolerate rap music and people who listen to it, I think the world would be a more pleasant place without rap music, so I am therefore opposed to rap music, apparently. The religious belief is what facilitates the fundamentalism. You can't have religious violence without religion. There are two necessary conditions for violent religion: violence and religion. Hitchens specifically does make the distinction between people who are non-violently religious and people who are fundamentalists, and the conclusion he draws is that if the passively religious people were to stand up and tell the fundamentalists to #### off like he is, we wouldn't have to deal with fundamentalism in the first place. The criticism towards ordinary, harmless religion stems from the lack of effort towards extinguishing fundamentalism. The fact is that non-violent people with religious beliefs greatly outnumber the fundamentalists, and if they were to work at it, we could get rid of fundamentalism. This isn't happening, though. But perhaps militant atheism as a term is contradictory or nonsensical. Well, so what? Do you think ""militant"" atheists -- many of whom have probably never touched a gun in their life -- actually consider themselves militant ? Do you think atheists coined a term that does so much damage to their position? But the other necessary component of violent religion can be properly set aside to where to belongs. Religion has no place in government, it has no place in the science classroom or science academia, and it has no place warfare. ""Militant"" atheists want religion gone from those three areas, but unfortunately, there are huge swaths of people in both this country and the world abroad that want it everywhere and more. It's not a problem that will be fixed by ""holding back one's beliefs"". It means having to offend people in the process of fighting back. If you don't feel it's reasonable to be assertive against the degradation of America's already dismal science education, I have to ask why . ... to summarize Dawkin's presentation at the American Atheists conference that he gave here in Minnapolis two days ago, what he wants to see is a heightened consciousness towards religious indoctrination. By this, take for example the sentence, ""Man is stronger than tiger."" Feminists raised humanity's consciousness to this issue, and now we say, ""Humans are stronger than tigers"" in order to refer to females as well. In much the same way, Dawkins wants to see the whole idea of ""Christian children"" gone. He finds it ridiculous to refer to a child in a religious regard in much the same way he finds it ridiculous to say ""that child is a socialist"" or ""that child is a Reagan conservative"".","jyoshu","306642","I agree, and I don't mean it in a 'military' sense. I was just using the same language PZ Myers had used. No. Sorry, but these atheists are not just staying content to limit their opposition to being 'perfectly fine with letting such live amongst them'. They're writing books doing things like calling these peoples' views 'delusions', and intentionally insulting leaders of these movements after they've died and can't speak for themselves (as Hitchens did of Falwell post mortem). A better analogy would be if someone not only disliked rap music, but wrote whole books against it, went around the world doing conferences about it, likening it to being delusional and therefore stating something downright offensive about it. It goes beyond the picture of benign tolerance you're trying to paint here. That's not to let religion off the hook either, but this isn't a comparison. Religion shouldn't be intolerant either. But the point is that atheism as a movement is getting some of the same unfortunate tendencies, and Dawkins and Hitchens are fueling that fire. It's the wrong way to refer to it though. It's really simply extremist violence. Calling it ""religious violence"" is like saying ""patriotism violence."" There's nothing wrong with patriotism per se; it's when it goes bad and turns into extremist nationalism or some other bastardization that it becomes violent. That's the way religion is. You could just as easily say you can't have patriotic violence without partriotism. So what? It's beside the point because patriotism isn't the problem. Just as it's not really religion that's the problem. It's extremism. Do you understand what I'm saying here? Yes, that's what often happens--they can't blame non-violent religious people so they resort to blaming them for the NON-action of something rather than action. It's yet another irrational approach, though--you see, people are independently religious. It is no more the responsibility of religious people to 'reign in' badly religious folks than it would be for atheists to reign in the likes of Stalin and Lenin or even admit such examples of extremism (rather than resorting to the unfortunate approach of trying to tie even THEM to religion by implying it's some sort of 'religion of the state' or something, as is the silly defense that's often given). And for that matter, there are plenty of religious folks that DO stand up to the likes of Falwell and other fundamentalists. Hitchens should know better--it doesn't take much effort at all to see that. Oh but it is. Fundamentalism is much less entrenched and in control than it was years ago. Evolution is taught in schools now, and is pretty much the norm in acedemia and even broader culture in terms of understanding the natural world. It wasn't that way as recently as 20 years ago. And let's be honest: ' Christian ' violence is pretty rare. How many churches do you know of that call on it's members to go XXXX themselves up in crowded marketplaces? Not only is fundamentalism not so entrenched any more, its danger is really overstated to begin with. What you call religious violence happens more in Islam, simply because extremism is more prevalent in that particular religion. But the problem is still extremism, because plenty of Muslims don't practice violence at all. Nevertheless, I have to take issue with the idea that it's somehow religion's responsibility to stop fundamentalism and extremism. Extremism should be opposed independently of whether one is religious or not. Religion is not some card-carrying membership; it's more like an ""ism"" itself--ideology. It's like saying ' patriotism ' should reign in violence. It just doesn't work that way. Again, I agree with you here. I never intended it to be in the sense of 'military' or violence action. I'll use a different phrase to avoid confusion. Do you actually think removing religion from govt. and schools will stop violence? I agree religion and govt. should be kept apart, but having ID taught in the classroom has nothing whatsoever to do with what you call 'religious violence.' You're conflating a lot of issues here that aren't necessarily related. I'd also have no problem with any of that, except that it all too often doesn't stop there. There's an unfortunate culture afoot in the scientific world to condescend toward any scientist who even IS religious, much less somehow 'brings it into the classroom.' Right now there is a dangerously growing movement of prejudice and discrimination toward Christian scientists, and there shouldn't be. Especially considering that some of the greatest scientists down through history were religious. The idea that religion and science can't co-exist is downright fallacious; it certainly can and as a theistic evolutionist myself I know firsthand that it can do so. In no way is science compromised in my thinking just because I believe there is ultimately theism behind it. If you oppose the ID movement, then fine. But let's keep it at that, rather than saying something far more broad like 'religion has no place in the science classroom.' Seriously, how is anyone actually harmed if a teacher happens to mention he is religious or happens to be a theistic evolutionist? Oppose bad where there is BAD, not where there is no bad. Then good luck, because you're just going to infuriate people. When you decide to take the tact of being offensive toward people over something they consider dear to them, you're making a serious mistake. You're ceding the moral high ground, and neglecting the high road. Offending people over their religion will do more harm for atheism than it will ever do good. Because it's a shotgun approach. The approach being taken is just to take anything that might resemble religion and call it 'bad', rather than being rational about it and find out where the REAL problem areas lie. Again, if ID is the problem, then oppose ID. But not just 'religion'. It's not religion that's causing the problem in America's education system--again, (just like the other issues we discussed above), religion can go either way. What if, suddenly, religion started espousing evolution? Would you THEN be anti-religion and say it doesn't belong in our classroom? What if evolution WERE a religious belief? I realize that's a hypothetical, but it's to make a point: that religion is just a broad term that can be any number of beliefs. It's the bad ones that cause the problems. Not all of it. If not, the we wouldn't have had the likes of Issac Newton or Lord Kelvin. The question becomes 'does he mean we shouldn't teach our kids religious values?' That's the bottom line. If he does, then it's an absurd position that will never get anywhere and is a waste of time, frankly. If he simply means we should not categorize kids in that way in terms of how we refer to them, then fine, I have no disagreement with that. I suspect though, that he really believes kids shouldn't be taught religious values--(what he calls 'indoctrination', which of course sounds more ominous! ) The question then becomes--what values are ok in religion to teach and which ones aren't? And that's the crux of everything. Sorry, but if so, Dawkins and others will just have to go right on dealing with the fact that my children are Christian children in the sense they've been taught good values (like the ethic of reciprocity) FROM that religion. And yes, I know that ethic is not limited to Christianity, but nevertheless it IS the belief system out of which my children were taught it. If that's bad, then go right on considering me guilty.","expelled-expelled","02:34 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","22"
"03-23-2008","11082",2,"electrolyte","306657","Creationism isn't scientific, so saying that it is scientific is lying. Isn't lying morally wrong? Lying (and lying and lying and lying and lying some more) seems to be these people's only avenue of argumentation. Why aren't True Christians arguing against these hacks instead of supporting them? I consider ignorance of the facts a serious problem. In all my time spent in labs, I have never seen religion made an issue among researchers. Mentioning in passing isn't really a problem. There should be nothing that even resembles, however, an endorsement of any religious (or irreligious) position as a science teacher. But religion really does have no place in the science classroom due to the very nature of science. Science does what it does independently of religion.","jyoshu","306669","Maybe because they aren't as paranoid as you are. They don't think the sky is going to fall because of ID. No offense, but there simply are bigger problems out there. Yes, lying is wrong. But you forget that most ID people really do believe what they say. Usually, it's not considered a lie unless there is INTENT to deceive. By your standard, anyone unconvinced of something is lying if they don't accept it. I agree with you in terms of evolution--I'm certainly no six day creationist. But most of these people aren't lying. They just don't believe that we are correct. They'll come around eventually, or die off, whichever comes first. Depends very much on the consequences, on a case by case basis. Good for you. I hope that's correct. I've know religious scientists who very much believe they've been denied opportunities and memberships due to be openly religious. I see no reason to doubt them. Then you must understand that not everyone gives a rat's XXX (as you say) that a teacher might be openly religious and therefore ""endorse"" a religious position. To me, it looks like a paranoid position on your part. I agree with you here, and have argued the same thing in these forums. But understand that saying they are independent of ea other means that people have to be accepting of the idea of a religious scientist.

But allow one thing to breach the wall between science and religion and there's no point. Either the scientific method is a productive way of learning, or we stop researching when we don't have an immediate answer. I know this, and you know this, but let's call a spade a spade. When Ben Stein and his producer purport to be making a documentary so different than their actual intent that they have to lie about what it is, it's lying. There is intent to deceive. When the writers of Of Pandas and People claim that the book has no basis in traditional creationism even though a draft has ""cdesign proponentsists"" as a transitional form, there is intent to deceive. Let's face it: many of the bigwigs know perfectly well that there is lots of lying going on on their side. Don't get me wrong: I unquestioningly accept that some people are just too dumb to know that the claptrap of standard creationism is just that: claptrap. People like Kent Hovind claim to have a real science Ph.D when they have nothing of the sort. I'm going to sit in on a lecture on Tuesday by a guy who claims he's a Nobel Prize nominee, even though the names of nominees aren't made public. This is blatant lying specifically designed to dupe people into believing that these hacks are more qualified than they really are. And you can look at this forum for more examples. Time and time and time again, I've provided marc with irrefutable information that counters his arguments. Yet (in the past, mind you; I recognize that marc has cleaned up his sloppiness to a major extent) he has many times presented the very same refuted arguments as if he had no idea. Either this is lying, or it is willful ignorance. I see this all the time with creationists, even in person. My freethinker group crushed a local creationist at a seminar because he presented the same arguments we crushed last time. One can't present probability figures based on randomness if one acknowledges that a process is not random, yet this guy kept doing it. When I called him on it, he got defensive, insisted that he knew about non-randomness, and proceeded with the argument without addressing my point. Being willfully ignorant of a point while claiming to address all of our scientific knowledge is lying . Let's make a distinction here. If somebody is nuts enough to believe stuff not only without evidence but also in spite of the evidence, then that's their right. But such people can't be spouting off ""reasons"" for their beliefs if they really believe that they have no reasoning to support their beliefs. As soon as somebody makes an argument for believing as they do, they open the door to getting their reasoning countered. If someone says, ""I believe that the moon is made of cheese,"" I'm bothered by that person's disconnect from reality. If someone says, ""I believe that the moon is made of cheese, and you should believe that, too,"" I get to ask why. If someone says, ""I believe that the moon is made of cheese, and you should too because our NASA missions actually brought back samples that were mistaken for gouda,"" then I get to beat that person's XXX with the Truth Stick of No Mercy. The fact that evolution has been accepted by the scientific community -- and for good reason -- for decades and decades, and creationism isn't really dying off, coupled with my knowledge of many of these people, convinces me that you're wrong. Me neither. I just don't see the evidence for a huge push to oppress religious scientists. It's a legal position. You need to differentiate between holding a belief and presenting it as endorsed by the school system. My personal belief doesn't appear to be a state endorsement if it never comes up. It doesn't appear to be a state endorsement if I make it absolutely clear that my personal belief is only my personal belief. It does appear to be an endorsement when the curriculum is shaped by that teacher's belief. Maybe you think it's paranoid, but it keeps me from having a ""there's no convincing evidence for God"" lesson just as it keeps Ms. Creationist from having an ""evolution is a lie because God said so"" lesson. It must be hit and miss. I know a few who are largely indifferent. I figure I'm one of the more extreme ones on this forum. I'd be more active about it in real life if it wouldn't (a) cost me my job and (b) be fruitless in the heart of the Bible belt. It's not really that I'm intolerant of religion, I'm intolerant of anti-reason, promotion of stupidity, and willful ignorance. The fact that religion often involves these things just doesn't bode well for religion.","expelled-expelled","10:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","25"

I find it interesting that you seem to be taking an approach that will ASSUME endorsement by default, rather than assuming it's personal , by default. I think your view of this is, frankly, unrealistic. Teachers often are more involved with their students (at least some of them) than just a distant and sterile form of teaching that would actually make such effort to avoid the appearance of 'endorsement' by the school. If a teacher is really engaged with his students, he's going to influence them in many ways--that's just reality.

A professor or teacher's views, even their religious ones, are likely to rub off on the students sooner or later.

But it's very difficult to draw that line all the time, particularly in universities like Oxford where the professors are pretty involved with the students outside the classroom and teaching dialog goes on continuously . American schools tend to put a 'wall' up between the teachers and students. But elsewhere, they don't do that. And guess what: it's OUR education system that tends to be inferior. That's no coincidence IMO. And even in school settings where that 'wall' is there, it still happens more than one might think just on the basis that students are often looking to teachers as role models and observe their every move. It's just asking too much for a teacher to have to take a no-religious influence policy. Again, they have to be allowed to be human . In terms of being pro-atheist and possibly anti-religious?

I agree, but if I chose to ""influence"" my students with my religious beliefs (or lack thereof), parents would be calling for my head . The most I could see myself doing is sponsoring a freethinker group, but even then I think (a) there's no ""clientele"" (b) someone will want me fired... or dead. And here I'll take a page from your book: If I'm going to influence my kids, it's going to be on something more important that religion, like work ethic, appreciation for science, or -- god forbid -- an understanding of the universe. I trust that the school district trusts me. Hellbent nutjob parents might not. My point is that this is true especially in science because of its touchy nature with anti-science religio-bots. Frankly, I don't really see any difference in principle with other subjects. We don't inject religious diatribe into the derivation of the quadratic formula. The word big isn't an adjective ""because God said so."" The content should be devoid of religion (except for history/philosophy classes where religion(s) is obviously topical). I think it's a hell of a lot easier to distance oneself from presumed endorsement if the discussion doesn't even happen in the classroom setting. If I go to the coffee shop to help my kids prepare for a test, it's on my own time, and the kids know that. Any comments there probably would be fine... (not that I'd make them without a second thought.) Partially because of all the impropriety and alleged impropriety which seems to be on the rise. Speaking of which, I should take this opportunity to point out that I am extremely cautious about these sorts of things. A teacher friend of mine thinks I'm ""too"" cautious. But I have no desire to lose my job because someone didn't like a religious comment or because some prom/drama queen thought that I leered at her. (What happens is that when I break the uptight kick and cut loose with a joke, the kids really like it.) Correlation does not show causation. Our education system sucks because we keep mucking with it. We can't teach kids what they should know because we're too busy trying to teach kids how to pass dumbass tests. Maybe it's because I'm not very religious, otherwise it's because I'm not human, but I don't think that's asking too much at all. A teacher shouldn't be volunteering that information when it's not on topic.","expelled-expelled","03:02 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","27"

I know this, and you know this, but let's call a spade a spade. When Ben Stein and his producer purport to be making a documentary so different than their actual intent that they have to lie about what it is, it's lying. There is intent to deceive. When the writers of Of Pandas and People claim that the book has no basis in traditional creationism even though a draft has ""cdesign proponentsists"" as a transitional form, there is intent to deceive. Let's face it: many of the bigwigs know perfectly well that there is lots of lying going on on their side. I shouldn't argue that science disproves the existence of God, And you can look at this forum for more examples. Time and time and time again, I've provided marc with irrefutable information that counters his arguments. Yet (in the past, mind you; I recognize that marc has cleaned up his sloppiness to a major extent) he has many times presented the very same refuted arguments as if he had no idea. Either this is lying, or it is willful ignorance. I see this all the time with creationists, even in person. My freethinker group crushed a local creationist at a seminar because he presented the same arguments we crushed last time. One can't present probability figures based on randomness if one acknowledges that a process is not random, yet this guy kept doing it. When I called him on it, he got defensive, insisted that he knew about non-randomness, and proceeded with the argument without addressing my point. Being willfully ignorant of a point while claiming to address all of our scientific knowledge is lying .","marc9000","306708","Is the wall between science and religion of the same height as the wall between science and atheism? You said this above; and I'm sure you'll say that you don't do that, but you constantly argue that science disproves the book of Genesis, or other parts of the Bible, or just about anything it wants of Christian claims. When I bring up the title of Stengers book ""HOW SCIENCE SHOWS THAT GOD DOES NOT EXIST"" you never take much exception to it. Claims of what science can and cannot show vary all over the place. Do evolutionist bigwigs know perfectly well that there is lots of lying going on on their side as well? It probably won't be possible for you to have much of a discussion here with anyone without kicking my name around, will it? Was your biggest refutation when you called me a chickenlover? Or was it when you told me to go #### myself? What you should work on, is making a distinction between a factual refutation, and a worldview difference. You have presented the latter a LOT more times than you have presented the former. If you don't recognize that, it is either lying, or willful ignorance. So it was a group, against one? How many were in the group? Have you ever, as a lone freethinker, faced a ""group"" of creationists? Do you know the difference between ""crushing"" and ""bullying""? Was he being hammered on by 5 others at the same time? Were you calling him a chickenlover?","expelled-expelled","07:58 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","28"
