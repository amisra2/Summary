What's greater is that they opened themselves to ridicule: he's a good source when his statements can be edited and removed from context, but FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T LET HIM SEE THE MOVIE!","expelled-expelled","12:54 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","2"
"03-21-2008","11082",1,"None","None","None","Collin","306548","I was actually there with PZ and Dawkins. It was pretty scary at first. Dawkins came in with me and the gf, but the associate producer, Mark Mathis, spotted PZ and ordered him removed. I was shaking and sweating when we sat down, and the film just made me angrier. On the other hand, PZ simply went downstairs to the Apple store in the mall and wrote up a blog post. Right now, reporters from national newspapers keep calling our hotel room. It was pretty awesome at the end of the film during the Q&A when Dawkins stood up and asked, ""Why did you EXPEL Dr. PZ Myers when he was featured in your film, thanked in the credits for his participation, and paid for the interview?"" My take: Mathis lied a lot .","expelled-expelled","05:14 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","3"

"03-22-2008","11082",1,"None","None","None","jyoshu","306575","Here we have a case of an event where we definitely need some objective reporting. I suspect this was simply intended to be a PRIVATE SCREENING of a film. Private screening are extremely common in the film world. The whole idea of a private screening is that ... well, it's private . Meaning, only some people are allowed to the screening. If they were rejecting people at the door, it was obviously a private screening, so one has to wonder why these guys were trying to get in to begin with if they weren't invited. This doesn't sound like a case of anyone trying to bring science in to challenge something, but rather someone trying to crash a private screening of a film. So essentially, someone who's eager to play the hypocrisy card blogs about trying to sneak into a private screening of a film, but getting kicked out while his celebrity companion managed to get in. Big whoopin' deal. Since there doesn't seem to actually be any objective reporting done on this event, here's a different blog entry of the event that presents it in a different (and probably more realistic) light ... Did Richard Dawkins just crash the party at a screening of Expelled? Some of the comments in the comments section there also shed light on the incident.","expelled-expelled","12:44 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","6"

The producer specifically stated that PZ Meyers was not to be allowed in, on threat of arrest. PZ's friends and family were allowed in with no problems whatsoever, one of whom was Richard Dawkins. Now, if it was ""invite-only"", why was PZ's family allowed in, but he was barred and told if he didn't leave he would be arrested? Jyoshu, why are you trying so hard to spin this to make it look like PZ was trying to break the law, when he was attending an open advanced screening of a movie he participated in, was paid for, and in which he was thanked in the credits? Wait, the guy who says ""this is the best documentary of 2008"" is an ""objective"" observer of events? Every critic that has seen the film so far has labeled it as inaccurate, misleading, derogatory, and all around ####. And these are not scientists, these are movie critics and journalists. Try again Jyoshu, the spin just ain't gonna happen on this one.","expelled-expelled","01:00 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","7"

""Yes, you registered online, but the initial invitation was by invite only. You registered who was coming in your invited group, not just first come, first serve. There's a lot of discussion there on that issue. But it really doesn't matter--a private screening of a film is a private screening--they can boot anyone out that they want. I didn't say anything about anyone 'breaking the law.' I'm just showing you a different perspective of the events from a witness--you know, giving you MORE information from which to draw conclusions. Or did you only WANT your information limited to one version of the story, mainly from the account of the one who got booted?? I think it was simply a private screening, and the people running the private screening didn't want them there. That's their prerogative, as it was obviously a private screening and that's the way it works. Again, read the comments on the blog I linked to as they include comments from people who were there, including more from Stuart and at least one by PZ Myers himself.","expelled-expelled","01:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","9"

It helps to give a much more balanced look at what happened that night. Here's a link to Mathis discussing the making of the movie, the process they utilized and how they didn't quote the scientists interviewed out of context at all. The scientists even got the questions they would ask in advance when requested. http://intelligentdesign.podOmatic.c...15_39_42-08_00","expelled-expelled","01:26 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","10"
"03-22-2008","11082",1,"Collin","306579","Since I was there, I'll give you an objective rundown: 1.) Dawkins didn't ""crash"" anything. He watched the movie without saying a word and participated in a Q&A session with the producer at the end --a session that the producer deliberately started . 2.) There was no ""sneaking"" on any level. PZ, his daughter, and I all registered our names over the internet for the event and selected the option to have up to three guests come with us. We registered our real names, our real addresses, our real telephone numbers, and our real emails, and we all received confirmation emails approving our registration. 3.) What possible reason did they have to deny PZ a viewing of the film? Dawkins and I pressed the producer Mathis on this issue, and he said it was about money -- he wanted PZ to come back in a month and pay his $10. But this makes no sense. PZ was paid $1,200 for his interview. They thanked him for the interview in the credits. If money was a concern, they could have paid him $1,190 and given him a free reservation. Just the fact that he was in the film should have been enough to warrant a seat at a pre-screening event. This all begs the question: What in God's name are they so bloody afraid of?","jyoshu","306582","Well, I was just giving a different perspective from a witness who was also there, so obviously not everyone sees the events the same way. The thing is though, if they were booting people for being biased against the movie, or because they would object to it's message, it stands to reason they wouldn't have let anyone in PZ Myer's party in as well. And do you seriously think that if Richard Dawkins' name was registered on the website they wouldn't have noticed that? I find that pretty hard to believe. It stands to reason there were other perhaps un-related reasons Myers was booted than his objections to the content of the movie. Furthermore, if the producer deliberately started a discussion, then it only further stands to reason he didn't mind opposing viewpoints toward the movie.","expelled-expelled","01:28 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","11"
"03-22-2008","11082",1,"Collin","306583","Of course. The makers of Expelled were within their right to expel the very same people that they were attempting to demean in the film. It's perfectly legal, but it was also a rude, hypocritical, and stupid PR move that is rightfully being criticized.","jyoshu","306584","Again, maybe there were private reasons for him being ""expelled"" that had nothing to do with Myers views about evolution or the movie. They let Dawkins in and Myers' party, as well as initiated discussion at the end (according to your own statements) so obviously they weren't against having other views expressed there. Something's iffy here--it doesn't add up. It makes more sense there were private and unrelated reasons he was not allowed in.","expelled-expelled","01:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","13"

PZ once called in to a radio show that was talking with Mathis , and by the end of the show, Mathis was so infuriated and desperate that he screamed, ""Go to his website! Myers is an atheist! He's an atheist!"" Of particular irony is that during the show, Mathis claimed PZ ridicules students for their religious beliefs in his biology class (which, if I may say as one of his students, is not true), and then Mathis goes on to ridicule PZ for his. Mathis hates PZ on a very private level.","expelled-expelled","01:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","14"
"03-22-2008","11082",1,"Collin","306585","Mathis hates PZ on a very private level.","jyoshu","306586","If that blog is any indication, looks like there's a serious personal thing between BOTH these guys. Anyone who says he proud to be a ""militant atheist"" has issues--if they're out to intentionally OPPOSE religion rather than simply hold to their views, then they are no better than the Pat Robertsons or Jerry Falwells of religion. Atheism shouldn't be an aggressive force out to oppose something. After all, we've been told here time and time again that it's an ""ism"", merely a lack of belief in God. Frankly this looks like two fundies from two very different views having it out, and putting on a big show while they're at it.","expelled-expelled","02:42 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","15"
