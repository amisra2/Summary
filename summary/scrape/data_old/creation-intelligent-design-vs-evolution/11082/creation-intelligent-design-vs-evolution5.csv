"04-13-2008","11082",5,"obvious_child","308342","You act like that matters. Marc doesn't understand evolution. He never did. He can't even define the terms we use. It is quite obvious that is a true believer of whatever he wishes to believe. If he believed that the Moon was truly the Sun and the Sun the Moon, it wouldn't matter if God told him he was wrong. Marc will believe whatever he wants regardless of reality.","marc9000","308541","This thread is about a movie that takes issue with those who claim that academia is perfectly honest and fair with open inquiry, concerning controversial sciences. Have you seen it? Do you plan on seeing it? Or, even if it clearly shows some problems with open inquiry concerning scientific studies, you won't belive it, because you don't want to believe it, regardless of reality? You're good at accusing others of your own characteristics.","expelled-expelled","03:12 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","64"

Just keep making up whatever you want to be the truth rather then look at the truth. Being dishonest since the 50s eh? The New Scientist is clearly not discussing Stein. Stein gets mentioned twice within the whole article and is largely just the reference for who made the movie. The science blog, which you obviously refused to read, is about how specific people are being lied to to prevent them from attending. How is that honest? Or should I even be asking someone who has no concept of what honesty is? Good job on maintaining your fantasy world where everyone who disagrees with you is an atheist and no one can make good arguments against your crazy ideas.","expelled-expelled","03:15 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","66"

Such as? I'm not the one who failed to read any links and then substituted what I believed they wrote and then attacked them on it. I fully understand intelligent design. In fact I make fun of it regularly. What remains to be seen is if you understand evolution. After several formal debate, that is still in question.","expelled-expelled","03:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","67"

"04-13-2008","11082",5,"None","None","None","Collin","308559","There have been plenty of reviews on the content of the movie, including the one by Dawkins. From all the hype, you don't even need to see the movie to know by now that it's nothing more than ""These evil oppressors won't give us money to investigate invalid ideas like Stork Theory, and if we do investigate, they laugh at us!"" Oh, and the other half of the movie, which is ""Darwin = Holocaust lol"".","expelled-expelled","06:16 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","70"

I have seen you use the logical fallacy of equivocation sometimes, but I have not seen any comprehension about you about what biological evolution is. I have seen clips of the movie.. which are available online. Now, when it comes to some of the major tactics of the movie, I claim 'Godwin's law'.","expelled-expelled","10:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","71"

Oh wait, you won't because you need to maintain your fantasy land where everyone who disagrees with you is an atheist.

"04-14-2008","11082",5,"trebor","308580","No, as far as I have seen, you have not. I have seen you use the logical fallacy of equivocation sometimes, but I have not seen any comprehension about you about what biological evolution is. But unlike mitosis, protein synthesis, or signal transduction, evolution almost begs for extrapolation. The success of the natural sciences have led one analyst after another to extend Darwinian thinking into a series of distinctly nonbiological enterprises, even into the study of religion. Marc himself acknowledges that 'evolution' has many shades of meaning, from the biologically specific 'change in allele frequencies over time' to more general terms describing gradual change in any system. I have seen clips of the movie.. which are available online. Now, when it comes to some of the major tactics of the movie, I claim 'Godwin's law'.","marc9000","308672","It was very thoroughly done in my formal debate with Peeling. I'm sure however, like obvious_child and others, since I ""lost"", that makes anything I said absolutely worthless. That's like saying since the Patriots lost the superbowl, they CANNOT play football in any way, shape or form. Since nothing I said was worth anything in the formal debate, how about if I repost what I quoted Kenneth Miller as saying in post #1 of that debate? Or how about if I repost what Peeling said in post #3 of that debate; ""Many shades of meaning"" - ""extending Darwinian thinking"". In post #4 I referenced how another thread on these forums quickly moved from biological evolution to geology and paleontology, in the interest of attacking religion. So you may say that I haven't shown it, but what I've done is let others show it for me. You can call it the ""fallacy of equivocation"" if you want. I call it ""REALITY"". ""April 16th"" - ""Godwin's law"", are you and electrolyte speaking in codes now?","expelled-expelled","08:45 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","74"

I'm going to flame you for not seeing the movie, which may not be available where you are, thus I'm attacking you for not spending considerable sums of time and money to go find a theater showing it but I'm not even going to bother to read links given to me even though all the effort I need to do is click on the link! I don't even need to get out of my chair, but your the bad people because YOU won't spend the time and effort to go see the show in what may require several hours of driving! Hypocrisy anyone?","expelled-expelled","11:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","75"
