Thats what I have been saying...if the answer is not to your liking it must be incorrect...not that the poster does not want to answer to your liking...","there-point-evolution","03:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","76"

I expect that if I said I love my fellow man you would ask if that includes ..lets say..black people. Then if I repeated that I love my fellow man you would complain that I have not answered your question. The answer is there in full in the first line of post 61 All you need is the wit to apply it","there-point-evolution","03:52 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","78"

I want you to explain how it is possible to respect what you do not believe is true. So far all you have basically said (and this is implicit and not even explicit) is that you do respect things you do not believe in, so long as it is not something that says not to respect something others believe in. That is not an answer, by that I do not mean it is not an answer I like or approve of; I mean it is not an answer as it still leaves the question, i.e. it does not provide the information requested.","there-point-evolution","05:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","79"

"09-11-2010","14586",6,"Freedom","412115","Some would say that about evolution since the publication of origin of species.","Accipiter","412155","Yes that is correct, modern evolutionary biology has not progressed at all since Darwin.","there-point-evolution","06:07 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","81"

Will you stop being obtuse?..answer yes or no","Freedom","412202","Precisely the point I have been making! If the answer is neither yes nor no, to a yes or no question it is not an answer. I do not require that you answer any questions nor make any claims about you if you do not. What makes me upset here is that you claimed you did. You could explain why the question is not a valid one, or why it is partly right and partly wrong but you must admit it was a yes no question. Do or do not, there are no other alternatives. If you are implying that other peoples views = the right of a person to have their own judgement that was almost exactly the question!","there-point-evolution","12:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","88"
