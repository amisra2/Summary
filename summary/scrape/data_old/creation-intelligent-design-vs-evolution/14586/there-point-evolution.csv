Things that are better at surviving survive, and that's it, at the core. It is an observable natural phenomenon in the present. Traces in the material world also indicate that it has been going on for quite a while. As for why bother with it, mostly, because it's useful. Understanding the world around us gives us the ability to control it or adapt to it better, and that understanding also applies to the past history of the world and its inhabitants and to the processes and where they might lead in the future. Lastly, why bother if death is the end? Well, for one thing, there's this thing called life before it, and it sure matters. For another, one may recognize that even if they themselves die, they may leave a legacy, the same way that we have inherited, or rather, ARE, the legacy of our ancestors. As for religion, religions are applying restrictions on us. Whether it be a global thing like disallowing certain research and medical procedures I could benefit from or local, like my petty gripe with every village in the area deciding they just HAVE to buy a new set of church bells, out of sheer prestige, and me personally knowing that I HAD to contribute money to our own new set of bells or be ostracized - money that could well have, at the time, been spent on things like finally finishing the canalization that had been waiting for further funds.","there-point-evolution","04:15 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","3"

In fact, there aren't even theories of what happens after you die, because there is no observed phenomenon.

I also noticed that Japan has over a 90% acceptance of evolution and is less than 5% Christian.

The truth is that there are christians who believe in God and afterlife, and acknowledge evolution as fact. Besides that, you may not believe this, but in many ways theists, with all their morals, display more disregard for their fellow humans than atheists. Religious followers have a history of violence and oppressive dogma that they put into practice whenever they get the opportunity. There are probably more wars initiated by religious dogma than secular reasons. Plus, because religious followers are programmed to believe that death is their ticket to an existence much better than their life on earth, they are willing to die in sacrifice for their religious cause, getting to go to heaven, and leaving a legacy of martyrdom for their follow religious followers.

I could be wrong so bear with me. It appears to me that you are suggesting that for the non theist ToE fulfils the same conceptual space as religion does for the religious. I subscribe to ToE in the same way I subscribe to Germ Theory or Thermodynamics. It has no bearing on how I approach life or people, but nor does the fact I also subscribe to the Fundamental Attribution Error being real. Further down you post something along the lines that by subscribing to ToE as a theory for allele change over time that one has to throw out morality. I subscribe to ToE and to be fair, I think I'm a pretty decent person. I'm a therapist and I'v spent the last 6 years helping other people through traumatic times in their life. All that and still subscribing to ToE. This alone voids your point, I hope you can see. As you can see by some of the other posts there is no point to ToE any more than there is a point to Boyle's Law. ToE is not a reason or cause for organisms evolving it is a description of natural history; very much like Boyle's Law describes volume and pressure of gases. Basically when organisms change over myriad generations ToE tells us how. It does not pertain to origins or morality or religion: it describes a phenomena as best as we can at this point in time. And yes, it is subject to change because scientist acknowledge that we could be wrong. Best wishes, Larni.","there-point-evolution","11:11 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","15"

What an bizarre and ignorant idea. Further, the study of biological evolution doesn't attempt to teach that there is nothing more than the material. You, apparently, haven't bothered to learn the difference between philosophical materialism and methodological materialism. Philosophical materialism is a philosophic view of the world. Methodological materialism is a method of investigation that proposed natural explanations for natural events. To whom are you referring? Certainly not scientists. There are many theistic scientists who believe in an afterlife. Moreover, such concepts have no application in science, at least until the day that you can offer some non-supernatural evidence for such afterlife.","there-point-evolution","01:44 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","16"

"09-06-2010","14586",2,"None","None","None","unkerpaulie","411706","Fartingdale, if you stop and think about it, theistic morality is no different from atheistic morality. The underlying roots are the same, even though it may seem that the motivation is different on the surface. From an evolutionary perspective, man is a social animal that seeks survival and reproduction just like any other animal. However, we have highly complex social orders. It is in the best interest of humans to be ""kind"" and ""love your neighboors"" because it cultivates a safe and comfortable social environment. However, there are individuals that would think to seek their own interest at the detriment of the group. You might call them sins, but really they are actions that cause legitimate threats to social order and harmony. So laws are put in place. In religion, violating these laws could send you to hell, so people are convicted by self-induced guilt or by their local peers, and possibly ostracized from their church group. Its a damn good system, though not perfect, it saves a lot of overhead. In the secular arena, violators also face public rejection and go through the self-induced guilt of knowing they've done something wrong. However the consequences are faced while you are alive, for serious offences, rather than after you die. Like I said, on the surface, the motivation seem different. Rather than doing what is socially beneficial because you fear unimaginable eternal suffering in hell, the non-religious do what is right because they appreciate the natural benefits of a peacful and orderly living environment. Fartingdale, you are saying that somehow religious morality is above that of atheistic morality because the threat of hell (which is the only difference) makes your system better. In fact, you seem to think that if people are not programmed to believe in a supernatural judgement hanging over their heads in the afterlife, they are incapable of self-directed moral action. The reality is, believing that you are doing what is right in the hope of getting a grand reward for yourself eventually does not in any form make you morality superior to the person that does what is right because the welfare of himself and his social community depends on it.","there-point-evolution","06:48 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","21"

"09-07-2010","14586",2,"Freedom","411723","They are fundamentally different, theistic morality is absolute. atheistic morality (as you mean it) is not absolute, it has exceptions because as long as morality is a means to an end it is only valid so long as a person believes a specific case will lead to that end. If Joe thinks that his creator and ruler of heaven and earth commands him not to kill bob, there is no circumstance nor case nor argument he could make to himself to defy that. If Joe thinks that the general gene frequencies of his species typically benefit from cooperation he will not kill bob so long as he doesn't convince himself bob is no longer beneficial to the race provided he even cares about the race. and those who truly believe this will act as animals. You say they will not and point to the fact that they do not but I say that is only because we yet have laws that recognize no exception except the slow process of democratic change.","unkerpaulie","411730","Thank you for illustrating the point I was going to make to counter what you said about absolute morality. God's commandments are absolute and unchanging, unless God decides to change his mind, which God reserves the right to do at anytime without notice or explanation. Theistic morality is directly given by God (as long as you are totally convinced that God told you so), and always absolute, except when God tells you to do the opposite, which is also absolute. In the bible every one of the commandments, which are all absolute, had exceptions. God commanded his people to kill numerous times, encouraged the Israelites to steal just before they left Egypt, and never penalized Abraham or commiting adultery. And we don't even have to talk about keeping the sabbath. So you're right, there is a fundamental difference. In your example, Joe doesn't need to rationalize why he should kill Bob, he only needs to be convinced in his mind that God told him to kill Bob. And that's why theistic morality is far superior to atheistic morality, because obeying God's orders (that you tell yourself is God's orders) is much better than using your own reasoning. I don't say we won't act as animals. We do. We act as highly socialized animals instinctively motivated by survival and reproduction. And we pursue these motivations by very complex methods. Part of the method is the establishment of legal, judicial and government systems. And yes, its complcated, slow, and basically imperfect. Maybe you're not aware of this, but religion is also one of the systems established to attempt to control our natural behavior. It is an ancient version of our legal, judicial and government system, and in some places is still followed. Its simpler, quite inaccurate, and basically imperfect as well. If you think that your system of behavioral control is superior to mine, I'd like to know why.","there-point-evolution","09:47 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","24"

The only time it changes is when it says not to purposely offend other people because different people are offended by different things. I said before not to throw all ""religions"" into a group. I would never consider Islam a standard for anything. They are if you are a Christian. The Bible claims to be inerrant so it must either be truth or lies, not parables (except those that Jesus specifically used). Yes on multiple levels. I would also call them liars for having a pope, teaching extra-Biblical ideas (infant baptism, confession to a priest, Mary worship, rosary beads, ""holy artifacts"", works based salvation, ...the pope), and all such things. Are you saying self-contradiction can be correct? Actually, you just come to hate your own evil. It is not out of fear. I also hate the evil of others. Not the person, but only their sin. I think it has been Easyrider's mistake to promote the ""turn or die"" idea (though I do agree with it) in this way. To make an anecdote (or parable, if you will), it is like having the cure for cancer. Imagine you have the cure and you see someone dying that you could save. Now when you bring it to him, he smacks it out of your hand saying ""I don't have cancer"". Now Easy's approach has been ""YES YOU DO!"" while the correct way to go is to do your best to convince him of his sickness. (slightly off topic because of the ""fearing hell"" comment, but now you understand our position a bit more). When you play a game that is free-for-all only one person wins, right? Now put it on a much grander scale. You now have far more losers with how few winners you have. Eventually the people who say, ""Well that's not fair!"" will come together and appoint someone to enforce ""equality"". Yet it never happened in the Bible. The commandment says not to ""murder"" which is killing people in cold-blood. The Israelites were attacked by most of the people, and the rest were nations of people who worshipped idols that demanded warfare and child sacrifice (ex. Baal, Molech, and Ashera) The Egyptians willingly gave silver and gold so the Israelites would hurry up and leave. It was common back then to have a wife and concubines to produce an heir.

Well in that case, we have good grounds to throw all religions into a group [Quote]They are if you are a Christian. Except, of course, when the inerrant account of the bible has been found to be errant, such as the creation account. In that case, it becomes obvious that such account was also written as a parable. Hmmm..... And that's because driving a tent stake through a sleeping man's head, calling bears to maul kids, or executing a man for not impregnating his sister-in-law are all legit acts of war. And we're not even talking about corporal punishment for things like disobeying your parents or cheating on your husband. And let's look at the wars themselves. When moses sent the armies into war, he commanded the soldiers (well, he told them God said, of course) to kill everybody and everything. Not just defeat the soldiers on the battle field, but to the residences to kill the women, kids, animals and even crops and property (often they spared the virgins and kept them as captives, apparently they were the exceptions to the exceptions). The passage in exodus 32: 25-29 is particularly interesting. Moses tells the israelites to choose if they wanted to follow him or not. Some chose to follow, some chose not to. Then Moses tells the following side to arm themselves and kill the non-followers, even if they were family to the following side. He even blessed the men that slaughtered their family members for the cause. So if you ask someone to borrow their stuff, and have no intention of returning it, its ok, as long as they willingly gave their stuff to you at the time. Well you must have a different definition of adultery than me then. It was precisely about not doing work.

Under a purely theistic system, if Joe murders Bob, rapes his wife, steals his money and torches his property, then claims that God told him to do so, he cannot be condemned, nor will he go to hell, because his obedience to the word of God overrides the judgement of mankind. In fact, he probably would be considered blessed to go to extreme lengths to exercise his faith, and be given more authority, so he can motivate others to have more faith in God like he does. In an atheistic system, no such garbage of an excuse is accepted, and you'd get fried for you antisocial behavior, and as an example to the rest of the community that while nobody can stop you from acting on your whimsical desires, the consequences will surely follow.

The bible has changed translations so many times it has been historically proven the meanings of some sentences have been changed. Is the king james bible the inerrant one or is the Greek version which was first translated to other languages the inerrant one? Is God a man of war? That's in the bible. Did a Jewish forefather wrestle with God? That's in the bible. Is God jealous of the Hindu gods? that's in the bible. Does god practice inheritable punishment? that's in the bible. As I was raised catholic I am in a good position to speak about their practices. 1. They don't consider the bible the absolute source of truth, which somewhat explains why they setup a clergy to preserve 'the truth'. 2. It is quite expected that they would not treat the bible as the originator of christian religion as they originated the bible. The people who wrote the bible had a pope, had child baptism, had priests. They chose what to put in the bible, how could they possibly be worried about using extra-biblical ideas? 3. Every major institution in the catholic church has a reason which inevitably is tracked back to Christ himself. They do not see themselves as making up anything new. 4. No catholic has ever worshipped marry. 5. works based salvation, to this day I can only laugh at that conflict. What are the 10 commandments for? Will God send you to hell if you disobey them? Then one is not saved merely by believing in Christ is he, he must follow his teachings too? 6. I think the catholic church has the most virtue of any christian sect for one reason, it's greatest philosophers had the courage to identify exactly what religion is. Thomas Aquinas knew what faith was and knew what reason was and he laid out exactly where reason ended and faith began. His works incited several heresies and he was criticized by his bishop. Yet he is still considered a doctor of the church. Protestants on the other hand don't really care. They reject all institutions in favor of an admittedly purer form of self-delusion. Just as God will enforce equality on judgement day. All you mean is that without theistic communism people will reproduce a secular form. Thank you for illustrating the above point about making whatever you want equal Gods word.

Historically proven? The Bible was copied so carefully that it was preserved through time. If you mean the NIV, NASB, etc. it is because they need simpler versions for children in the coming, less intelligent, generations (an unfortunate outcome of society nowadays). Yes. The translation was so careful that it says the exact same thing. All-powerful being who leads his people to triumph? Yes. Isaac/ Israel? Yes Jealous as in He does not like His people following false idols? Yes. Exodus 20:5b ""...punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,..."" It is obvious that the actions of men have an affect through time. So again, yes. Not necessarily. You must know Christians who do not know all that the Bible says. Extra-Biblical. They did not ""originate"" it, they merely put together the pieces. No, there was no pope. They call Peter the first pope because he organized the church, but he was never called that in te Bible. Not child baptism, only circumcision as a sign of obedience. They had priests, but they did not have to go and confess to them. They were just the teachers. They used what was already written and threw out the Apochrypha (some of which has been put back in by the Catholic church) which was easy to identify. Only perversions of what the Bible says. Rosary beads and saying ""Hail Mary""s (Mother of God and Virgin, rejoice, Mary full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, for thou hast given birth to the Saviour of our souls.) That is why the Bible makes it clear that we do not have the ability so help ourselves, but that only God can help us. The Catholic church made people buy indulgences to be saved until Martin Luther came along. You mean they are intolerant of other beliefs? For a Christian, to be tolerant is to knowingly let people walk through the gates of Hell. I would rather not do that. This is not really based on anything. Not all will go to Heaven, and Those in Heaven will be rewarded for their good works (but as the Bible says, ""My works are as fithy rags before Him"", it really means rewards for furthering His message and helping others be saved).

Except, of course, when the inerrant account of the bible has been found to be errant, such as the creation account. In that case, it becomes obvious that such account was also written as a parable. And that's because driving a tent stake through a sleeping man's head, calling bears to maul kids, or executing a man for not impregnating his sister-in-law are all legit acts of war. And we're not even talking about corporal punishment for things like disobeying your parents or cheating on your husband. And let's look at the wars themselves. When moses sent the armies into war, he commanded the soldiers (well, he told them God said, of course) to kill everybody and everything. Not just defeat the soldiers on the battle field, but to the residences to kill the women, kids, animals and even crops and property (often they spared the virgins and kept them as captives, apparently they were the exceptions to the exceptions). The passage in exodus 32: 25-29 is particularly interesting. Moses tells the israelites to choose if they wanted to follow him or not. Some chose to follow, some chose not to. Then Moses tells the following side to arm themselves and kill the non-followers, even if they were family to the following side. He even blessed the men that slaughtered their family members for the cause. So if you ask someone to borrow their stuff, and have no intention of returning it, its ok, as long as they willingly gave their stuff to you at the time. Well you must have a different definition of adultery than me then. It was precisely about not doing work.

Now Onan was the second son of Judah, and was given his brothers wife because his brother (Judah's first born) was killed for being wicked. After Onan was also killed, the wife was supposed to be saved for his 3rd son, who wasn't old enough yet. Now, if that wasn't enough drama, after Judah's wife died, Judah went to hang out with his buddies and picked up a hooker, got her pregnant, and later caught her and planned to have her killed for being a whore.

""Cold blood"" is not just about whether or not a person is attacking you. More like attacking. People back then were not the non-violent protest type. Having an heir was one of the most important things in life for them. It was the law that the next brother must help produce an heir for a dead brother. You say it was condoned but the son was killed. She blackmailed Judah because he had lied to her. Instances like this, the descendants always become a thorn in the side of Israel. Breaking the law always has consequences. When those gods cause you to sacrifice children and the prophets bleed themselves as worship, and it is a viral pagan religion that immediately infects Israel unless the evil is destroyed.
