Therefore I respect Fartingles view but disrespect your implication that one can only respect views that one agrees with. This demonstrates that I can and do disrespect views that I do not agree with.","there-point-evolution","05:44 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","61"

We just don't want to discuss it because there's friction with our biases and beliefs. People may have different views but only one view is scientific. One view that is logical. One view that is most consistent with facts. That's what I want to know: which one? I found this interesting site: cosmicfingerprints. Pretty convincing actually though I'm not biology major or something (I'm an Accountant). But the logical explanation on this site is really strong. It's says - there is evolution but it's not random. It is designed within the DNA code. This destroys materialism and neo-darwinism belief because the equation goes something like this: Random Mutation + Natural Selection = Extinction Engineered Mutation + Natural Selection = Evolution The complexity of the ""language"" inside the DNA cannot arise from chance about 99.9999999999999999% (put as many 9s as you like). Please look it up. Now I'm comfortable with science alongside religion. One complements the other I guess.","there-point-evolution","08:05 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","62"
"09-11-2010","14586",5,"None","None","None","gansao","412106","Random Mutation + Natural Selection = Extinction Wrong..no evidence that this is correct ,plenty of evidence that suggests that this is wrong. There is no evidence for an engineered mutation that occurs naturally . The mutation occurs in the dna..the' engineering' is done at the fetal stage..at bottom up as the fetus grows not as an engineered plan to fit into a matrix. Ther mutated creature has or has not an advantage to pass their genes on to their offspring due to the mutation. Its random , it works","there-point-evolution","10:17 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","63"

Basicly they reinterpret the evidence to support their preconceived hypothesis which is by definition unscientific. As such it just isn't particularly persuasive.","there-point-evolution","10:57 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","64"

To a large extent it's a guess that no one can prove mathematically or otherwise. Something else you should consider is that Intelligent Design has not progressed much since1987, there are no new discoveries, no new arguments, no nothing new, it's stagnant.","there-point-evolution","12:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","65"

In my lifetime we have discovered such profundities, such huge principles. When I was an undergraduate, I went to the professor of geology and said, ""Would you talk to us about the way that continents are drifting?"" And he said, ""The moment we can demonstrate that continents are moving by a millimetre, I will consider it, but until then it's sheer moonshine, dear boy."" And within five years of me leaving Cambridge, it was confirmed, and all the problems disappeared why Australian animals were different that one thing changed our understanding and made sense of everything. Some moonshine!","there-point-evolution","02:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","70"
