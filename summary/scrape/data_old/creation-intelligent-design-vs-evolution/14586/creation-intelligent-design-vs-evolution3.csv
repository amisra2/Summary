EVERYTHING that you can claim God tells you do can be changed to the exact opposite by you simply claiming that God told you the opposite. ""God moves in mysterious ways."" There's no algorithm, no requiired precidence, no need for justification or explanation. To say that atheistic morality is whimsical is hysterical. Under a purely theistic system, if Joe murders Bob, rapes his wife, steals his money and torches his property, then claims that God told him to do so, he cannot be condemned, nor will he go to hell, because his obedience to the word of God overrides the judgement of mankind. In fact, he probably would be considered blessed to go to extreme lengths to exercise his faith, and be given more authority, so he can motivate others to have more faith in God like he does. In an atheistic system, no such garbage of an excuse is accepted, and you'd get fried for you antisocial behavior, and as an example to the rest of the community that while nobody can stop you from acting on your whimsical desires, the consequences will surely follow. An atheistic system isn't lawless, its just godless.","there-point-evolution","12:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","31"

His whole point was about how life would be better. Medical science is not held back by a few Jehovah's Witnesses refusing blood transfusion. If all people believed evolution then obvious problems would arise. The ""eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we die"" attitude would be rampant. There would be absolutely no point in helping your fellow man because this life (wich you have wasted far too much of arguing for evolution) is all that there is and you must make the most of it. There would be no sense of morals left in life because, heck, everything is relative right?

"09-08-2010","14586",3,"Freedom","411773","Or catholics? or Hindus? or Buddhist? or Jews? No, particularly insane protestant activist claim the bible is inerrant. The bible has changed translations so many times it has been historically proven the meanings of some sentences have been changed. Is the king james bible the inerrant one or is the Greek version which was first translated to other languages the inerrant one? Is God a man of war? That's in the bible. Did a Jewish forefather wrestle with God? That's in the bible. Is God jealous of the Hindu gods? that's in the bible. Does god practice inheritable punishment? that's in the bible. As I was raised catholic I am in a good position to speak about their practices. 1. They don't consider the bible the absolute source of truth, which somewhat explains why they setup a clergy to preserve 'the truth'. 2. It is quite expected that they would not treat the bible as the originator of christian religion as they originated the bible. The people who wrote the bible had a pope, had child baptism, had priests. They chose what to put in the bible, how could they possibly be worried about using extra-biblical ideas? 3. Every major institution in the catholic church has a reason which inevitably is tracked back to Christ himself. They do not see themselves as making up anything new. 4. No catholic has ever worshipped marry. 5. works based salvation, to this day I can only laugh at that conflict. What are the 10 commandments for? Will God send you to hell if you disobey them? Then one is not saved merely by believing in Christ is he, he must follow his teachings too? 6. I think the catholic church has the most virtue of any christian sect for one reason, it's greatest philosophers had the courage to identify exactly what religion is. Thomas Aquinas knew what faith was and knew what reason was and he laid out exactly where reason ended and faith began. His works incited several heresies and he was criticized by his bishop. Yet he is still considered a doctor of the church. Protestants on the other hand don't really care. They reject all institutions in favor of an admittedly purer form of self-delusion. Just as God will enforce equality on judgement day. All you mean is that without theistic communism people will reproduce a secular form. Thank you for illustrating the above point about making whatever you want equal Gods word. Yea, just like those corrupt first Christians made up all the institutions of the church.","fartingle","411826","Catholics= Christianity+ whatever the pope says+ Mary as co-mediator with Christ= not Christainity ""Jews"" today are not the same as in the Bible, but are extremely legalistic and are not all even ""religious"" Hindus don't even know if they are mono theistic or polytheistic when they have thousands of gods. Buddhism makes less sense... believing that everything is imaginary but it seems real because we desire things... None of them are the same as Christianity. 2 Timothy 3:16-17 16""All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, 17so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work."" Historically proven? The Bible was copied so carefully that it was preserved through time. If you mean the NIV, NASB, etc. it is because they need simpler versions for children in the coming, less intelligent, generations (an unfortunate outcome of society nowadays). Yes. The translation was so careful that it says the exact same thing. All-powerful being who leads his people to triumph? Yes. Isaac/ Israel? Yes Jealous as in He does not like His people following false idols? Yes. Exodus 20:5b ""...punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,..."" It is obvious that the actions of men have an affect through time. So again, yes. Not necessarily. You must know Christians who do not know all that the Bible says. Extra-Biblical. They did not ""originate"" it, they merely put together the pieces. No, there was no pope. They call Peter the first pope because he organized the church, but he was never called that in te Bible. Not child baptism, only circumcision as a sign of obedience. They had priests, but they did not have to go and confess to them. They were just the teachers. They used what was already written and threw out the Apochrypha (some of which has been put back in by the Catholic church) which was easy to identify. Only perversions of what the Bible says. Rosary beads and saying ""Hail Mary""s (Mother of God and Virgin, rejoice, Mary full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, for thou hast given birth to the Saviour of our souls.) That is why the Bible makes it clear that we do not have the ability so help ourselves, but that only God can help us. The Catholic church made people buy indulgences to be saved until Martin Luther came along. You mean they are intolerant of other beliefs? For a Christian, to be tolerant is to knowingly let people walk through the gates of Hell. I would rather not do that. This is not really based on anything. Not all will go to Heaven, and Those in Heaven will be rewarded for their good works (but as the Bible says, ""My works are as fithy rags before Him"", it really means rewards for furthering His message and helping others be saved). Not at all, it is not my opinion that that was a custom. Such as?","there-point-evolution","04:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","36"
"09-08-2010","14586",3,"unkerpaulie","411783","And even this absolute rule about exceptions to absolute rules has exceptions, because Jesus purposefully offended the scribes, pharisees and money changers in Jerusalem on several occasions, doing the will of his father. They are if you are a Christian. Catholics= Christianity+ whatever the pope says+ Mary as co-mediator with Christ= not Christainity ""Jews"" today are not the same as in the Bible, but are extremely legalistic and are not all even ""religious"" Hindus don't even know if they are mono theistic or polytheistic when they have thousands of gods. Buddhism makes less sense... believing that everything is imaginary but it seems real because we desire things... None of them are the same as Christianity. Except, of course, when the inerrant account of the bible has been found to be errant, such as the creation account. In that case, it becomes obvious that such account was also written as a parable. And that's because driving a tent stake through a sleeping man's head, calling bears to maul kids, or executing a man for not impregnating his sister-in-law are all legit acts of war. And we're not even talking about corporal punishment for things like disobeying your parents or cheating on your husband. And let's look at the wars themselves. When moses sent the armies into war, he commanded the soldiers (well, he told them God said, of course) to kill everybody and everything. Not just defeat the soldiers on the battle field, but to the residences to kill the women, kids, animals and even crops and property (often they spared the virgins and kept them as captives, apparently they were the exceptions to the exceptions). The passage in exodus 32: 25-29 is particularly interesting. Moses tells the israelites to choose if they wanted to follow him or not. Some chose to follow, some chose not to. Then Moses tells the following side to arm themselves and kill the non-followers, even if they were family to the following side. He even blessed the men that slaughtered their family members for the cause. So if you ask someone to borrow their stuff, and have no intention of returning it, its ok, as long as they willingly gave their stuff to you at the time. Well you must have a different definition of adultery than me then. It was precisely about not doing work. After the order God established with the creation week, God rested on the sabbath, did no work, and made it a special day. Read exodus 20: 8-11 again.","fartingle","411830","The verses I was talking about were in the context of offending other Christains (such as drinking around those who think it is wrong to drink (though it is really only wrong to get completely drunk (or hammered (lots of parenthetical comments )))) Jesus only called out their blatant evil (wrong teachings created by pharisees and the money changers cheating people in the temple). [QUOTE]Well in that case, we have good grounds to throw all religions into a group Only if there is ever a viable explanation besides it. The sleeping man was also the general of an army that had killed thousands. In the origional language it can mean up to 18-19 year olds, and they had thrown Elijah out of the town before pursuing him. I am not familliar with this. Please specify the passage. Nearly nobody did either in the time it was written, and they were considered far worse offenses than in today's society. If you read what happened when they spared people the reason becomes obvious. Whenever they spared people, no matter who, they would begin to corrupt the Israelites to the extent that they would begin to worship Ba'al and set up Ashera poles. They were definitely not exceptions because they were punished every time they did such things. Do you really believe he wanted it? It happened because they were practicing pagan worship of idols that would have led the etire nation astray. I am sure they hated that they had to do what they did. The blessing was for having the strength to do what had to be done. Where does it ever say ""borrow""? It was more like a ""hurry up and get out of here because we would like to stop the plagues now"" present. Let me go back. This was about Moses being with his and his wife's servants, but it was never condoned anyway. He was punished with Ishmael whos decendants were always at war with Isaac's. Still, there was no law against having multiple wives in their time. There is one now in America and the Bible says to follow the laws of your country as long as they do not contradict the Bible so you would not see it now. Not doing work to the extent of resting and going to the temple (tabernacle) on that day. The pharisees made it against the law to even help someone out of a pit.","there-point-evolution","04:37 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","37"

Therefore even though the bible is supposed to be inerrant, when we find errors we call them parables or allegory, to continue the delusion that the bible is inerrant. Therefore killing in cold blood is ok if the person you're killing is really evil. Therefore its ok to kill people for chasing you and teasing you. Our good friend Onan (gen 38) was killed because he practiced pulling out as birth control. Now Onan was the second son of Judah, and was given his brothers wife because his brother (Judah's first born) was killed for being wicked. After Onan was also killed, the wife was supposed to be saved for his 3rd son, who wasn't old enough yet. Now, if that wasn't enough drama, after Judah's wife died, Judah went to hang out with his buddies and picked up a hooker, got her pregnant, and later caught her and planned to have her killed for being a whore. The whore in question ended up being his very daughter-in-law (who he had promised for his son) in disguise. And the clever woman kept his personal belongings as a bargaining chip, just in case Judah tried to have her killed, which is exactly what he did, and it saved her life. So let's see.... Murder your kids, fornicate with your in-law, lie to your son, sleep with a whore. And none of this displeased God. Therefore, anything you do is ok, as long as you tell yourself God told you to do it. Therefore its ok to kill people for a made up reason if you estimate that hardly anybody (relatively, I suppose) is gonna do it. Therefore its ok to kill people that worship a different God than yours. Therefore its ok to kill people, even family members, if some guy says God said to do it Read exodus 12:35-36 again. They were instructed by moses to ask for gold and silver jewelry and clothes from the egyptians, and that was before the final plague. Moses knew fully that he was instructing them to ask for items they had no intention of returning. This was how they plundered egypt on their way out. So therefore its ok to steal if a guy tells you that God said to do it. You mean Abraham, and yes that's what happened. The act of adultery wasn't what God punished him for, but the lack of faith that his old wife would bear him a son. The adultery itself apparently God really didn't have a problem with. From what I know, adultery is being married and sleeping with somebody else. Abraham wasn't married to his wife's maid. If the commandments are absolute, then wouldn't the sabbath commandment, which instructs us to do no work on the sabbath, be still in force? Or is it ok to not observe the sabbath? Maybe I'm still a little confused about this absolute morality thing....","there-point-evolution","06:12 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","40"
