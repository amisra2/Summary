You have not answered my question and I will hear no more of it until you admit that to yourself and give me a boolean answer to a boolean question.","gansao","412184","The question has been answered. The stubbornness is all yours.","there-point-evolution","05:16 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","12"

Will you stop being obtuse?..answer yes or no","Freedom","412202","Precisely the point I have been making! If the answer is neither yes nor no, to a yes or no question it is not an answer. I do not require that you answer any questions nor make any claims about you if you do not. What makes me upset here is that you claimed you did. You could explain why the question is not a valid one, or why it is partly right and partly wrong but you must admit it was a yes no question. Do or do not, there are no other alternatives. If you are implying that other peoples views = the right of a person to have their own judgement that was almost exactly the question!","there-point-evolution","12:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","130"

I am pretty sure at this point you are just amusing yourself by refusing to communicate reasonably and that you have no alternative, that you think it is a yes or no question and that you are simply wasting time as some kind of sick play with the freedom game. You have answered every question with a foggy near mystic answer even ones where that could not possibly be sublime.","there-point-evolution","08:08 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","77"
