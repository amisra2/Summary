"04-02-2010","13783",14,"Archangel","396826","It doesn't matter which analogy you use to outline the choice or lack of choices you have J, all I am doing is telling you how it is in reality. And the fact is that you either choose LIFE in the Lord or by default you choose Death apart from Him in eternity. You may not consider that fair but that is the reality of the situation and nothing you as the creature can do to change it. God created us for personal and individual fellowship with Him in this life and anything we do apart from that single act is wasted effort. He even makes clear in the gospel passages I posted above that we are sinners and can never be good enough on our own to reach His Holy Standard to enter heaven so He came and became Man to die for our sins so that He Himself paid the price to redeem us. Now, all we must do is accept what He did for us to be saved. It couldn't be any simpler a process, yet you atheists get hung up on the fact that you're a sinner who can't reach Him any other way. You act like Him doing all the work to redeem you isn't good enough for some reason, and is actually wrong on His part somehow. This verse says it all whether you like it or not. Matt 12:30 He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.","JWilliam","396851","The problem is that He created us. Why would he create a species so imperfect that they cannot be in His graces? And then condemn them for being the way He made them? Yes, the simple resolution is to to just go with it. But for an athiest it's not a matter of simplicity but principle. What does it say about someone who accepts God just to avoid hell? This wouldn't really be an acceptance of God but an avoidance of hell. And further what does it say about the person who placed us in this situation? Additionally, the athiest has a hard time accepting the idea that someone who they have never met has full reign of their life. Nevermind the fact that we are not certain that He even exists and the only way to find out about Him is from others of this ""imperfect species"" or from a book written by them. (and I'm talking about who was holding the pen not the inspiration).","delusion-atheists","08:11 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","198"

He did create us in His image and therefore perfect. If you remember the words of the book, He used to walk with Adam and Eve in the cool of the day before they chose to disobey His ONE warning to them not to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. He understood that eating of it would cost them their innocence and therefore their holiness and sinlessness. It was that simple act of disobedience which separated Man from God and required a redeemer to wash our sinful nature clean so God could once again fellowship with us. You will undoubtedly ask why God would place such a stumbling block in the Garden and the answer is that if God placed us in a world which allowed no choices at all to disobey Him, then of what value would the power of free will have on us? Without the opportunity to disobey God, free will would be an illusion. All Adam and Eve had to do was believe God when He said don't eat of that fruit or you will surely die. The deceiver thought God meant a physical death, but He actually meant a spiritual death which you are a reflection of right now. We who have been born again have over come that spiritual death which is why the bible says we are foreigners here and aliens who belong to another world. Again you are completely wrong about our motivation for seeking God. I desired to know if God really exists and cried out at 14 years old in the darkness of my bedroom one night even though I had no clue at the end of the prayer if anyone heard me or not. But I fervently prayed in the hope and belief that if He exists then He would reveal Himself to me. This is why I said that everyone must seek God personally and not take any mans word for anything. Only God can meet you where you live and remove the scales of unbelief from your eyes. But you must seek Him because if you trust any Man to reveal God to you, you can be sure that you will buy into a cult, a fraudulent view of God and a lie created by some Man in order to gain some power over you. I can confidently tell you that my salvation came from God Himself and no man so I know that who I fellowship with is my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ who is truly the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. There is no other way to the Father but through Him who is the perfect mediator between God and Man, Amen... Seek Him and you will find liberty indeed.","delusion-atheists","09:21 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","199"

Beside, He is the author of life so how dare you question His methods in how He applies justice. And did you completely miss the part of free will requiring a real choice in order to be more than a theoretical concept or an illusion? Do you realize that we are the only creatures God ever created which have free will? Even satan himself doesn't possess that characteristic in his nature or else fallen angels could be forgiven for their rebellion against God. But they can't, only we can since we were deceived in our innocence but the fallen angels rebelled after spending untold millennia in Gods presence. Wrong again, the tree didn't cause Mans spiritual death, disobedience to God did. All we had to do as a race to spend eternity in a perfect Garden and fellowship harmoniously with our Creator would have been to live in the presence of one tree which we all knew we must never touch. Beside that one thing which was a test of our free will, everything else in the world was at our disposal. And we couldn't do that with only 2 people on Earth. Everything else God has done with this human experiment has been designed to reunite us to our former state so He can fellowship with us once again which is why He created us originally. All I have done throughout this exchange is explain why! I couldn't be more clear if I wrote it all again so if you haven't gotten it yet at least on an intellectual level if not on a spiritual level, I truly feel for you. When I prayed that night I wasn't a believer at all. I was a 14 year old moslem kid who prayed as generic a prayer as I could think of. I referred to every god I could imagine and asked if either of you is the maker of my soul, the real and living God who knows and defines absolute truth, if absolute truth even exists, then please reveal yourself to me and I will follow you. But I want the true and living maker of my soul if you actually exist at all, or will I just live this life, die one day and become nothingness? If you exist, I want to know you. The bible say's ""to those who grope out into the darkness, I (God) will find YOU"". That is precisely what I did as an innocent teen who hungered to know if God was real or just a myth. All I can assure you of is that although it took 7 years, I met Him in Jesus Christ at around 21 years old. I wasn't going to church at all but was running into believers who witnessed to me at every turn. The wisdom of this world is foolishness to God, my friend. It doesn't matter how enlightened you think you are from a fleshly perspective, your understanding is folly compared to the wisdom which comes from the living God via His Holy Spirit which indwells all believers. We are tapped into the only true source of wisdom and knowledge. Wisdom which is far beyond our capacity to fully appreciate or understand beyond His grace to allow.","delusion-atheists","06:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","206"

You reveal your arrogance by questioning and then rejecting His plan for how we must live. And God wasn't making an ultimatum as you say, He warned them not to eat of a tree which held fruit that would steal our innocence from us. There were very real consequences from eating that fruit beyond disobedience to God and that was the awareness of evil which we were created innocent of. Also, for the third time in this exchange, without a choice to disobey God, free will would have been an illusion for Adam and Eve and nothing more that a theoretical concept. What God gave them by placing that very real tree in the center of the Garden was an opportunity to know a choice existed and to turn away from it by faith that they could believe their Father who visited with them daily and had warned them that eating of that tree would lead to their deaths. You keep blaming God for the selfishness and disobedience of Man. Is it beyond you people to take personal responsibility for our own actions? Bunk, once again, and it has been clearly explained directly above. Once again you ignore the fact that we are all related to each other through Adam and Eve. We inherited the sin nature via the blood line of humanity, therefore it is through the shed blood of Messiah which redemption and forgiveness of sins is accomplished. Lev 17:11 'For the life [fn] of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood by reason of the life [fn] that makes atonement.' This passage from Leviticus which was speaking to animal sacrifice for the temporary forgiveness of the sins of Jews perfectly and concisely extends Gods future plan to sacrifice His own blood as ""Messiah,"" the perfect Lamb of God for the propitiation of all of the sins of Humanity, once and for all time. If you are able to appreciate and make this connection between the Old and New Testaments, it could lead to the eternal salvation of your soul. Now, in regard to the alleged sin of your baby, when did I ever say that God held him responsible for his sin nature? There is such a thing as an age of accountability when God considers us old enough to know right from wrong and therefore take personal responsibility for our actions. That age is believed to be anywhere between the ages of 11 and 14 depending on the maturity of the average normally developed child. What we call special needs or children of retarded growth will be treated accordingly by God and may never reach the age of accountability. So, in response to your bolded slanderous assumption, it isn't I who is insisting God is evil, it is you who is since you believe the humanist lies which misrepresent how God actually deals with innocent children, in reality.","delusion-atheists","06:29 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","208"

This is something you can't refute and no one can as has been proven ad nauseum here in this thread and many others. Regurgitating quotes from an ancient collection of writings by ancient primitive people doesn't change the fact that God is Evil. He put evil in the angels who acted accordingly, he put the snake in the Garden of Eden and he put there the tree and its fruits also; and he knew because he knows past, present and future that Adam and Eve would eat of the fruit. So much for free will. By the way, if a person is convicted of a crime are also his descendants sent to jail? No one but Adam and Eve ate of the fruit but we according to your fantasy (beliefs) have also been punished. But, wait a sec. didn't He send his one and only son to atone for Adam and Eve's actions? if so how come nothing has changed, no garden of eden in sight. How can people be so stupid as to believe in that XXXX? Imbecility is boundless and eternal. You are an Evil person Archie, as many power hungry believers are who think that by quoting from the Bible they can hide their hateful evil nature.
