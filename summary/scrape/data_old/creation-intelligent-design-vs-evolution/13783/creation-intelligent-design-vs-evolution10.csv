That's one of the most well attested to facts in ancient history, whether you want to casually sweep it under the rug or not. Many skeptics set out to prove the story of Christ to be a fairy tale. You guys are playing with absolute fire. If you're wrong (and you are), you're screwed big time. Big time and forever. Do you feel lucky? Well, do you?","electrolyte","388197","Reason. Evidence. Need me to look up those words for you? No he didn't, and no it's not. The source of the information is itself inconsistent. You might recall that I posted Ralph Nielson's challenge to recount all of the information in one coherent narrative with no contradictions. Nobody even tried. Bullspit. The alleged evidence for it in the first place is terribly insufficient. The burden of proof is not upon the skeptics. Pascal's wager. A failure for multiple reasons. See a non-exhaustive list here . Note that Easy's post is in response to my pointing out how stupid it is to make an argument that already assumes he's correct. In this post, he uses Pascal's wager, which argues based on a consequence that Easy is correct. About the same as always.

"03-12-2010","13783",10,"Databed","385932","Wow marc. You spent some time thinking about this video. Just a question for you - hypothetical What would happen if we took a bunch of people, stuck them on a planet with no access to any knowledge of God or Christ - and say we left them there for a couple hundred thousand years. Are they more likely to come to the conclusion that Genesis 1 & 2 happened, some other random story of religious creation, or something a little closer to what scientists have come up with? Be honest!","MightMakesRight","394413","Well I think that the geology of the planet would influence everything. From religions to morals and scientific progression. Because long ago on our planet Europe not only thought the world was flat and they could fall over at the edge into an abyss but Europe generally didn't have knowledge of the Asian cultures until the silk road was active. If the asian and european cultures were not so greatly distanced from each other history would have been greatly changed to the extent that compared to our world would be pretty loopy","delusion-atheists","04:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","144"

That is unless God came back again, spoke his word into a book through the scribblings of random religious scholars. If you accept that this is inevitable, you are delusional. The most likely thing would be for humans to come up with an entirely different religious doctrine. I would be willing to bet that it would pass through polytheism into monotheism as more information became available and eventually we would end up right where we are now. The problem with this scenario is that evolution would probably never be confirmed since our biological history would not be apparent. We would come up with theories that God made us and perhaps even some screwballs would say we were all part of an experiment and were placed on the planet by our ancestors a couple hundred thousand years prior.","delusion-atheists","10:19 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","145"

Even if the Christian nation supporters can prove that the intentions of the founding fathers of America was to create a nation that promotes the prosperity of Christians above all, they still have failed to show why it matters. What additional rules must we adopt to be in compliance with the Christian scriptures? Are we to oust all non-believers or anyone who follows a different God. What about Jews and Muslims? They still worship the same God they just don't believe you must go through Christ to reach Him. (Remember the 10 Commandments mention nothing of Jesus). The federal government still cannot impose any legislation that forces people to follow a specific set of religous ideals. To enact any laws that are Christian in nature violates everyones freedom of religion, including Christians. Just because you already believe doesn't mean you won't be affected. At this point the government would be taking the position that they know how you should love and honor your God better than you do.","delusion-atheists","01:35 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","149"
