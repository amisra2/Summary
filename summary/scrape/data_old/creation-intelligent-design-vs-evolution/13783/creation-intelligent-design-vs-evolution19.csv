"04-22-2010","13783",19,"Archangel","399063","Spoken like a true atheist and heretic as you reinterpret history in order to satisfy your unbelief in the accuracy of the bible. You see, I have no reason to oppose or defend myself against your lies and misinformation since it is God whom you are attacking and not me. I can rest easy in knowing that on that final day when you enter eternity, you will instantaneously know the absolute truth and you will realize that you made yourself an enemy of God and His truths when you attacked His given word as false and libelous. You credit Eusebius as if he worked alone when he was but one of 318 members of the first council of Nicaea. How convenient for your preferred recreation of history; and which Eusebius were you referring to anyway, Eusebius of the city of Nicomedia, or Eusebius of Caesarea. And what evidence do you offer that he single handedly selected the 50 books which you attribute to him? Just like in our past debate, you lie and make stuff up as you go along since it sounds good to you but has absolutely no basis in fact at all from any sound theological source AT ALL!!!","daewoo","399066","Eusebius was at the council of Nicaea...but he came up with his ""sacred texts"" for constantine long before that and his selections ultimately became the ""bible"". The idea that the council of nicaea came up with the bible after debating it has absolutely NO historic backing. While they did argue dogma and what would become ""orthodox"" (a word that jesus would have cringed at) beliefs, there is no indication at all that they worked on the contents of the bible itself. Constantine pretty much mandated that based on what Eusebius came up with, which was by his own admission primarily designed to serve the church and the government first. You can play games with it all you want and try to split as many hairs as you want, and pretend you dont know which Eusebius I am talking about but at the end of the day it all boils down to the FACT that the ""TRUTH"" you claim to find in the bible is nothing but a bunch of garbage put together in order to control people. It has almost nothing to do with jesus.","delusion-atheists","10:11 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","271"

Yet the bible I know speaks of liberty and freedom from sin and makes no demands that I submit to any man other than to respect the laws of Man and God in their proper context. There is nothing evil or controlling in that at all. Here's how the OT describes what the spirit of Messiah would mean to the world. Isa 61:1 The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, Because the LORD has anointed me To bring good news to the afflicted; He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, To proclaim liberty to captives And freedom to prisoners; Here's how the NT puts it and they don't contradict each other at all for those who can see it. 2Cr 3:17 (NASB) Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty . Rom 8:2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death. Rom 8:15 For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, ""Abba! Father!"" Rom 8:16 The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God, Gal 4:6 Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, ""Abba! Father!"" 2Ti 1:7 For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline. You believe that by tearing down trust in Gods word that you accomplish something which edifies humanity while at the same time claiming a desire to know God. You deceive yourself and attempt to deceive others with your lies which destroy rather than build up Gods word for what it is, a good and positive source of wisdom for any and all who trust its wisdom for the guidance of their lives.","delusion-atheists","12:06 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","272"

""If your leaders say to you, 'Look, the Father's kingdom is in the sky,' then the birds of the sky will precede you. If they say to you, 'It is in the sea,' then the fish will precede you. Rather, the Father's kingdom is within you and it is outside you. When you know yourselves, then you will be known, and you will understand that you are children of the living Father. But if you do not know yourselves, then you live in poverty, and you are the poverty .""","daewoo","399141","Which is why the church was not allowed to run around killing people for heresy and why people dont show up in church on sundays, or tithe to the church. Get your head out of your rear end, archie. You are getting ridiculous here. Read back through this thread where you keep insisting that if we do not believe the particular truth that you are selling, we will all burn in hell. You have a REALLY WEIRD idea of what ""freedom"" and ""liberty"" are. No, I am tearing down trust in a book put together, by the admission of the guy who did it, to serve the interests of the church and the government. I dont have a desire to know god. I do know god. I generally trust in what we know of his word, I just prefer the version that was not admittedly put together in order to advance the agenda of a relatively few powerful people. You are the one deceiving people and others. I am not calling you a liar....I think you honestly believe most of the garbage that you post here. It just happens to be demonstrably false and frankly I dont think that you have enough integrity OR enough actual faith in your relationship with god to even examine that possibility. That is why you have not constructed anything resembling a logical argument to refute mine. I am not even asking for proof. I am more than willing to admit that proof may be hard to come by since it would be thousands of years old and frankly the church burned most of it. I am just asking for a logical argument. How can you possibly reconcile what we know about jesus with what is in the bible and what our religious leaders tell us to believe? Do you really not know enough about your own religions history to recognize that it has primarily been a tool to elevate a few men to positions of great power? Had it not ever occurred to you that when Jesus went looking for a holy man to baptize him he went to John instead of a priest? John the baptist was not only completely unorthodox, he was unorthodox to the point that many people thought he was a lunatic. If your relationship with god is based on the bible, or on a church, or on a priest or preacher, then you have none and I pity you because you so desperately want one. That is what all your religious blather is about. You know that you are not going to convince anybody here that you have even the first clue when it comes to god, but that is OK because you are trying to convince yourself, not any of us. And the funny thing is that if and when you finally do find that relationship with god, you will shut up because it is indescribable. It is like trying to describe what air looks like. IF you actually knew god, you would quit blathering on about the bible and about what a great thing modern Christianity is because you would understand that, in the words of Jesus: You dont need a book. You dont need a priest. God is not a coin operated vending machine where you perform the proper acts and POOF he is compelled to appear. Pouring water on a babies head does not do anything for god. Pouring water on an ADULTS head does not do anything for god. It is what that symbolizes in the recipients mind that matters. God could care less whether your head is wet or dry. Once you figure these things out, you can learn to sit quietly and listen for God and submit to his will. THEN you will know god. Right now you just know what man says about god, and that is about worthless. This is why jesus used so many terrible metaphors. He was trying to describe the indescribable in a way that people could understand. I know all the atheists out there are by now convinced I am mildly schizophrenic. I cannot contest that besides saying that I know they are wrong. I cannot build a logical argument for them being wrong. I cannot explain logically ho I know they are wrong. I just know they are and that is enough. Hopefully someday you will find God....REALLY find God....and you will know that kind of peace and freedom.","delusion-atheists","11:28 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","277"
