Most importantly Jesus was teaching that you are one of God's children and you only achieve righteousness through him. Doing good deeds is just not enough and not the message at all.","trebor","398832","That all depends on HOW is putting words in Jesus' mouth, and how the context is interpreted. There is a lot of disagreement between the various gospels about how true that is.","delusion-atheists","03:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","256"
"04-20-2010","13783",18,"trebor","398808","Considering that a lot of the Christian theology came from the Pharisees, that is rather amusing. Of course, if you read it in context, he is talking about a specific type of Pharisee. That is the 'hypocrite' that stands on the corner to pray so that all might see how 'righteous' he is. The ones that bow down to the letter of the law, and ignore the spirit of the law. The people whose personal ego's are greater than their alleged devotion to God. He is talking about the self righteous who think they are better than other people, because of their beliefs and station in life. Hum. Sounds like a few people right on this vary forum.","Easyrider","398845","Back that up, trebor. I'd like to know where you get this stuff. Sounds like you, trebor. You don't believe you need the righteousness of Christ (Romans chapter 3) at your Judgment, so you will have to rely on your own perceived sense of SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS. O self-righteous one.","delusion-atheists","05:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","257"

"04-20-2010","13783",18,"Archangel","398861","Since when is it necessary for ""you"" to believe something in order for it to be true?

I was asking a sincere and relevant question that is obviously way over your head, intellectually. (Now that was meant as an insult, and a properly placed one.) So let me take a shot at dumbing it down for you and explaining what I mean. Gods truths are eternal and irrevocable. They are absolute and undeniable no matter what any man says. You can deny that God and His truths exist for a complete lifetime just as untold millions of men have throughout the Ages, but none of the denials by all of the deniers has had any impact at all on Gods truths since they remain as absolute as they ever were. Get it? It's really very simple to understand for someone with even a most basic IQ.","delusion-atheists","06:23 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","264"

Despite the fact that there is pretty much no possible way ANYBODY could know what they are. The simple fact of the matter is that if you are looking for gods truths and are looking in the bible, there is almost no chance you are going to find them there. You can argue whether jesus existed or not. You can argue about whether he was the son of god or not. The one thing that is essentially inarguable is that the message he left was BADLY...HORRIBLY skewed by the MEN who put the bible together and were seeking to control others and gain power through their religious beliefs. Think about this archie. Jesus did not go to church every week. As far as we know for sure he was only actually in a temple twice. Once was when he was 12. they found him in the temple listening to the priests and asking questions. If he was the son of god, what kind of questions do you think those were? We can assume they were probably not questions about god because obviously he already knew about god. They were almost certainly questions like the one I just asked you...designed to try to get them to THINK and recognize the foolishness of their position. The other time we know for sure he was in a temple he trashed the place. And yet somehow we have ended up with a christian religion where people are expected to report to church weekly. Even if we restrict our conversation to the relatively watered down version of jesus life that is presented in the bible it is still hard to find any love for organized religion in there....and yet somehow we ended up in a situation where we are to take the book put together by organized religion and live our lives by it? You are wasting your life, archie. You are not serving god. At absolute best you are wallowing in the bastardizations of his truths like a pig in filth. Whats worse, by insisting that the bible is gods truth and that people should look there for them, you are helping to keep people from finding gods truth. Of course, as I point out above, the other option is that jesus, son of god, was mildly retarded and was about as worthless as teats on a boar when it came to being a savior. That seems to be your position.","delusion-atheists","08:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","266"

So we have now entered into the world or Archie population: one. Ok..... Guess I'll put the tin foil on my head to block out all the reason... Says a mortal who never physically met God, or seen God, or can understand the infinite measures of the universe... Got it.... So your covering your XXX basically by saying see!! No tagbacks! You can;t use logic here cause it's mans logic and opinion so I'm right!! *snore* Oh I'm sorry we're you saying something? The stupid in the air must have put me to sleep.... Yep.

As far as I can tell you have nothing AT ALL to teach me. You know NOTHING of god. You arrogantly proclaim that you know THE TRUTH but have apparently never stopped to really look at where the book you claim has THE TRUTH in it came from, how it came into being, other writings from the time, or even whether THE TRUTH actually lines up with what we know about jesus. THE TRUTH is that most of the things that you arrogantly proclaim to be THE TRUTH, jesus would probably have scorned. He would have laughed his holy butt off to see some self righteous, arrogant fool loudly proclaiming that THE TRUTH comes out of a book that was put together by a bunch of priests and makes zero sense when you consider what we know about Jesus. Let me close with a quote from Eusebius. Who is Eusebius? He is literally the guy who put your bible together. He was Constantines first appointed christian theologian. Constantine was preparing to reform the christian faith and he tasked Eusebius with producing ""50 excellent copies of sacred manuscripts"". Eusebius was given no instruction about what to include and what to leave out. There was later debate about his choices, but ultimately, 2000+ years later, his choices are still pretty much the ""Holy Bible"". The books he did not include were ultimately condemned as heretical or unorthodox. They were hunted down and destroyed and those who tried to shelter them were slaughtered....and the Church carried out that policy for the next 1500 years. That is not the act of a church that has ""THE TRUTH"" in a book. That is the act of a church trying desperately to cover up the fact that they have pushed an edited and incorrect view of Jesus life in people and were doing their best to destroy all evidence to the contrary. THE TRUTH does not need centuries of murders to destroy evidence to the contrary. Teach me? About god? You know NOTHING AT ALL of god. You wont respond because you CANT. You have been worshiping a lie and deep down you know it. You have pulled your understanding of god from a book that was designed to control you, not to bring you closer to god. A book that perverts the message of Jesus to something that is exactly opposite of what all evidence shows he preached. Let me know how that works out for you. Whoops. Never mind. You wont know until you are dead and roasting in hell for not only failing to understand the nature of god, but for steering people toward the false message that is contained in the bible that you venerate.","delusion-atheists","12:52 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","269"

You see, I have no reason to oppose or defend myself against your lies and misinformation since it is God whom you are attacking and not me. I can rest easy in knowing that on that final day when you enter eternity, you will instantaneously know the absolute truth and you will realize that you made yourself an enemy of God and His truths when you attacked His given word as false and libelous. You credit Eusebius as if he worked alone when he was but one of 318 members of the first council of Nicaea. How convenient for your preferred recreation of history; and which Eusebius were you referring to anyway, Eusebius of the city of Nicomedia, or Eusebius of Caesarea. And what evidence do you offer that he single handedly selected the 50 books which you attribute to him? Just like in our past debate, you lie and make stuff up as you go along since it sounds good to you but has absolutely no basis in fact at all from any sound theological source AT ALL!!!","delusion-atheists","09:52 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","270"
