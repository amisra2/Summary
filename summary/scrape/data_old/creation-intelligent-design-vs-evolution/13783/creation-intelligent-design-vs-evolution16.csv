The answer is no, he doesn't. What part of Love your neighbor as you Love yourself , do you say promotes or condones slavery? Have any of your atheist friends ever introduced you to this information? If not I wouldn't trust them with any of their anti-Biblical arguments going forward.","pappillion001","397720","ER why must you always post skewed information and try and pass it off as fact or addresses all objections? Your link, as usual seems to forget a number of verses that regulate slavery, not the bondsman or woman concept but slavery. Where children born of slaves will forever be slaves even if the parents are freed. Where slaves can be inherited as property are just two examples and there are more. The bible nowhere condemns slavery and Biblical application of Love thy neighbor, given the verses in Galatians and Corinthians, would not be set them free but be nice to them. If God didn't condone it then why would he not say don't do this instead of giving guidelines concerning who can be a slave and what you can do to them?","delusion-atheists","04:22 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","226"

Are they to to lose His love as well?","Archangel","397732","No, they will never lose His love. Even when God gives them the desires of their heart and sends them away for eternity, He will do it with sadness and a true sense of loss for children He created in His image, and loves. You just can't appreciate Gods sense of justice which must be respected according to His Law of Holiness. It is written: [Jhn 14:6 Jesus said to him, ""I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me.] Deny this verse if you will, but if you do, then you relegate yourself to nothing more than a pagan cultist who lived this life following a man made religion, or no religion at all, but not the true belief system given us by God which was based on a personal relationship with Him and redeemed Humanity once and for all time through the perfect sacrifice by the Holy Lamb of God who died once and for all of us.","delusion-atheists","09:05 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","227"

If you cannot, then there is no reason to believe the Bible unless you admit that the only reason you believe is that its just what you were told and have always believed. How can you expect someone to believe you when you have no evidence? It would be like me writing a book and then claiming God told me to write it and that it is the true way to salvation.

Ever notice that if you read the Bible, passages as a whole make no sense even in the context of their own time? They are often extremely off subject and could be taken to mean any number of things. This would explain why the Bible has been used throughout history to justify brutal actions and cruel treatment. The Bible also has been used to do good things for people, don't get me wrong, but its always, whether for good or bad, self promoting. I think God is pretty selfish if his way is the way of this book. So how can the Bible condone both good and bad actions? The answer is that it doesn't. People do by cherry picking and interpreting the Bible to mean what ever they want it to. You may argue morals and ethical behavior come from the Bible, but you'd be wrong. It comes from the reader, so trying to argue over what's right and wrong based on what the Bible says is as pointless as having your palm read. People need to grow up and have a little self respect and faith in themselves rather than some old out of date book.","delusion-atheists","02:59 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","229"

I tend to think the bible is more in the way of a collection of ideas about how large groups unrelated groups can co-exist. One major problem is the subscription ran out and it hasn't been updated. Instead a a group of hackers has been trying to make it work it a very different world. I don't disagree. Morality, ethics etc are learned behavior built upon 10,000 years of trial and error. The bible is not the originating source, but if you can pull the weeds from the garden what is left is a reminder of ways once tried and therefore not necessary to repeat. I disagree that the bible doesn't support/condone while at the same time opposes/condemns the same action. This is the result of social or circumstantial changes over time recorded by different people. The point I think being x was tried had a y effect, which in turn evolved into z. I do agree that man has the potential to be better than religion thinks he is capable of being. I find it discouraging that our creator so poorly made us that we must rely on sympathy from one being to encourage pity from another so that we can be given a gift we openly admit we don't deserve, because we don't have the self esteem or self worth or will to try and become self sufficient and something that a creator might be pleased with.","delusion-atheists","04:43 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","230"

Is it also the word of god?? It is foolish to believe that the bibles longevity is proof of its validity. Complete and utter foolishness. If that REALLY seems logical to you, you should really get some professional help. In reality, the bibles longevity is probably more the result of various governments pushing it on their people because at the end of the day if you are looking for a religion to create a dumb and compliant population, Christianity, with the bible at its center, is pretty hard to beat.

And it doesn't even claim to be a holy book so your question is foolish. Nice job redefining and thus distorting the point I very clearly made as you misrepresent my argument in order to mock me. So let's get back on track, shall we? I'll quote my previous statement in order to show how you have misrepresented my point. Here's what I said: It is Gods inspired word and that is proven by its very ""survival as an authoritative source of wisdom"" in a world which has always hated it for its everlasting truths. So it isn't just a matter of longevity but is a matter of remaining relevant in a world which is steeped in spiritual darkness and hates the truth it offers. Speaking of hogwash, this paragraph defines it. The bible has been banned in more MAJOR countries in just the 20th century than it has been allowed to be owned in. Just look at China, the USSR, Saudi Arabia and most all of the militant islamic countries, and the dedicated communist countries in the world where it has been banned for so long throughout the 20th century. Now name for me the Christian countries which forced bibles and christianity on people under threat of death over the past 100 years. This I want to see as you must not just rewrite history, but must invent it in order to make that assertion.","delusion-atheists","04:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","236"
