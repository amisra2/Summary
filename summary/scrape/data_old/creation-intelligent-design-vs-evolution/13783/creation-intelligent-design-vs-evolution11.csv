Archie and the rest believe and therefore if you believe in hell you do your utmost to avoid ending up in there so their behaviour is rational. I understand them but that doesn't make me a believer. So be a good boy and do as Archie does and one day you will be talking with God up in heaven or wherever it maybe apart from your imagination","delusion-atheists","04:34 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","162"

Really, while Easy's god is quite terrifying on his own, do keep in mind his devil is still worse.","Easyrider","396510","He's not just ""MY"" God, He's everyone's God. And it's either his way through Jesus Christ or the Highway to Hades. God will be nice to you forever when you choose Jesus. But you'll be in big trouble if you don't. And that will be YOUR CALL, so if you fail to repent and wind up in the Pit, don't blame God. Blame yourself, because you were warned.","delusion-atheists","03:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","165"
