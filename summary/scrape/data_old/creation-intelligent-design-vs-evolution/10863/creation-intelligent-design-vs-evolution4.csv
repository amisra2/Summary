How else could anyone make such a mess of what I said. Either you are drunk or you are dishonest. As for evolution, over the years I have used at least three different meanings of the word, and so did my associates and students. But the use is so routine and so common that it wasn't necessary to distinguish between the meanings. It is almost always quite clear from the context of discussion between educated people. Someone even pointed out a fourth meaning to me once. But all of those meanings were within the context of evolutionary biology. Always, the first meaning is the definition of evolution. Not the definition of the word, but the definition of the phenomena that constitute evolution.

I had never heard of the term 'evolutionist' until I joined these boards and had the word hurled at me, so I've never really given it much credence. Like I said: interesting question. I think on reflection I'm irritated by 'evolutionist' because of the implication that one is motivated to defend evolutionary theory specifically, rather than the scientific method that produced it.","jyoshu","310048","Indeed ... what term do you suggest people use to describe someone who holds to the view of evolution, if not ' evolutionist '?

"04-28-2008","10863",4,"Peeling","310027","'Equally likely' is tricky. Certainly it's possible that a naturalistic methodology will miss supernatural influence or design, but to estimate the likelihood of that one would need to know the odds of supernatural influence being present in the first place. On the other hand, how can we gauge the odds of our being ignorant of some naturalistic process? All we can say with certainty is that there have been many natural forces and processes of which we have been ignorant, historically; the hypothesis of ignorance has a proven track record of success.","trebor","310108","Let's see.

"04-28-2008","10863",4,"Peeling","310002","I double checked, and all anyone asked was that that be the definition used in the debate. Doesn't that request in itself imply knowledge of other definitions, necessitating such a clarification? The OP concerns people's motives for propounding their views, and juxtaposes evolution with creationism. The only context in which such a contrast is meaningful is the layman's use of 'evolution' to refer to common descent. Allele frequency change, after all, isn't incompatible with creationism. Mmm. Thing is, a lot of what we know about evolution (common descent) is derived from paleontology and geology: dating of strata tells us timescales and confirms the ordering of the nested hierarchy of forms. So we know evolution (common descent) happened, we know it took a long time, and we know the order in which forms developed, all of which are incompatible with literal genesis. How we know those things involves paleontology, geology and so on, but what it adds up to is information regarding evolution. Probably not, because there's nothing to notice. Our picture of the evolutionary history of life on earth is informed by many branches of science, from chemistry and physics to paleontology and geology - even cosmology has a few words to say regarding the source of certain necessary materials. So what? Wouldn't geology and paleontology refuting evolution be a bigger story than those sciences contributing complementary useful data? Well, no, frankly. If I ask 'How long did common descent take to reach this point? Can we confirm the nested hierarchy of forms to be sure of the order in which they arose? Where did these chemical elements come from?' and turn to other sciences to corroborate or inform my understanding, I'm not blending the word evolution with anything. And if I use the word evolution (change over time) to describe the development of the cosmos post big-bang, I'm not 'blending' anything either. I'm using an appropriate term with an applicable dictionary definition. Conflating those terms, ignoring the differences in meaning, and trying to paint a picture of something insidious overtaking science - that's the job of a politically and religiously motivated creationist. If you're skeptical, bear in mind that of late, in response to just this kind of accusation, I've done my best to explicitly delineate meaning and avoid the generic term wherever possible. You'll also notice my arguments haven't otherwise changed in the slightest - could I do that if my 'agenda' genuinely depended upon the equivocation you describe? And do you think you achieved something worthwhile? You showed some atheists talking about evolution, and you showed some scientific sites explaining that evolution was not atheistic, which you interpreted as evidence - not of disagreement , but of intent to dissemble. But you'll concede that such a 'test' can only be negative in form, yes? Logically, you cannot positively test for something if you have no idea what it looks like. If you ask me ""Is there a sploing in this room?"" I can't actually look for a sploing, can I? I can only itemise the contents of the room and hazard a guess that anything I can't identify might be a sploing. But even if I find something unidentifiable, how can I know it's a sploing? That's I.D in a nutshell: holding up unidentified items and declaring they have found what they were looking for. First it was the eye, then haemoglobin, then bacterial flagella - the claims have got more sciencey-sounding, with numbers and impressive terms like 'specified complexity' to make it sound like they're on the same page as real science, but at the end of the day it's Paley's watch all over again: pick something biological for which no naturalistic history yet exists, construct some arbitrary 'random chance' scenario cherry picked to exceed their own universal probability bound, observe that it does exceed that bound, and declare that they have detected design. Do you appreciate the weakness of that reasoning? If your 'random chance' scenario is bull, either because of bias or honest ignorance, your detection of design is bull. Go back to the Giant's Causeway example - if you pick a 'chance' scenario based on random freeze-thaw cracking, it'll exceed the universal probability bound with ease. Therefore, design. Same applies to Dembski's treatment of flagella: he assumes that the only possible naturalistic history is the spontaneous and simultaneous formation and integration of all parts as-is, calculates some odds for that and thus 'detects design'. Don't take my word for it. Watch I.D evolve over the next few years. The examples of design they're using now will quitely be retired as their naturalistic formation is explained by hard-working scientists, and new ones will take their place.","marc9000","310114","Not clarification, elimination . If they had knowledge of other definitions, they werent seeking to focus on only one to clarify the others, they were seeking to eliminate the others. I was seeking an overall, broad definition of evolution, because thats what the questions for both sides thread was about, it was what obvious_childs subsequent taunt thread was about, and it was clearly what my challenge thread was about. My challenge directly followed obvious_childs taunt thread, and his taunt thread directly followed the questions for both sides thread. Thats it exactly, allele frequency change doesnt go into the controversy concerning worldviews like common descent does, because common descent gets involved with questions of man not being one bit different than animals, of their being no defined time or place of original sin, no Adam and Eve, etc. Its what makes the word evolution so slippery, when someone like myself wants to explore all the ideologies and extrapolations of evolution concerning politics, someone immediately wants to reduce it to a biological discussion only. And this is how worldviews are formed and maintained, in your words, concerns peoples motives for propounding their views, and juxtaposes evolution with creationism. It was that thread, the questions for both sides thread, that inspired the evolutionists to taunt me about evolution being atheistic, and consequently inspired me to start the above referenced challenge thread, where it was insisted that change in allele frequencies over time was the only definition acceptable in any debate with me about evolution being atheistic. The dishonesty on their part was clear. Well, the possibility of them refuting evolution isnt really the issue since no one is saying that, its the current way they compliment it that makes them part of the issue, when having discussions like the questions for both sides thread. It works both ways! Conflating those terms, and trying to paint an innocent picture of evolution, is often the job of a politically motivated evolutionist. The proof is in my above referenced challenge thread. Your earlier example of what creationists were doing was no more dishonest than what certain evolutionists were doing here in trying to dishonestly narrow the definition of the word evolution. Ill concede that youve done that somewhat, and its helping make our little discussion here interesting, dont you think? You said you didnt want to rehash that debate, and I dont either. The main thing I achieved was an enjoyable experience of putting it together and seeing what I could do with it. Of the 5 formals Ive done, I thought it was one of my best if not THE best. Yet I was criticized for it far more than I was any other. Not necessarily a bad thing in something so divisive and emotional, especially considering that Im seeing several points I made being corroborated in a movie made one year later. No more of a negative form than tests made by evolutionists. Evolutionists dont know what naturalistic origins look like either. And youll tell me that evolutionists dont directly test for them. And Ill tell you that IDists dont directly test for a designer. I think youre misrepresenting UPB. Whatever happens from freeze thaw cracking isnt going to result in something as complex as life, something that has so many parts that have to work together perfectly, or quickly, completely deteriorate. We shall see! Again, its interesting to me that Michael Behe wasnt in the expelled movie. I honestly believe its because he is working hard, and is not going to allow a public appearance like that to cloud what he may be able to unveil in the future.","creationists-science-modern-world","09:35 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","52"

Here are 10 reasons why theistic evolution is a deception and a lie. http://christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c015.html 10 Dangers of Theistic Evolution The atheistic formula for evolution is: Evolution = matter + evolutionary factors (chance and necessity + mutation + selection + isolation + death) + very long time periods. In the theistic evolutionary view, God is added: Theistic evolution = matter + evolutionary factors (chance and necessity + mutation + selection + isolation + death) + very long time periods + God. In the theistic evolutionary system, God is not the omnipotent Lord of all things, whose Word has to be taken seriously by all men, but He is integrated into the evolutionary philosophy. This leads to 10 dangers for Christians.1 Danger NO. 1 Misrepresentation of the Nature of God The Bible reveals God to us as our Father in Heaven, who is absolutely perfect (Matthew 5:48), holy (Isaiah 6:3), and omnipotent (Jeremiah 32:17). The Apostle John tells us that God is love, light, and life (1 John 4:16; 1:5; 1:1-2). When this God creates something, His work is described as very good (Genesis 1:31) and perfect (Deuteronomy 32:4). Theistic evolution gives a false representation of the nature of God because death and ghastliness are ascribed to the Creator as principles of creation. (Progressive creationism, likewise, allows for millions of years of death and horror before sin.) Danger NO. 2 God becomes a God of the Gaps The Bible states that God is the Prime Cause of all things. But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by Him (1 Corinthians 8:6). However, in theistic evolution the only workspace allotted to God is that part of nature which evolution cannot explain with the means presently at its disposal. In this way He is reduced to being a god of the gaps for those phenomena about which there are doubts. This leads to the view that God is therefore not absolute, but He Himself has evolved - He is evolution.2 Danger NO. 3 Denial of Central Biblical Teachings The entire Bible bears witness that we are dealing with a source of truth authored by God (2 Timothy 3:16), with the Old Testament as the indispensable ramp leading to the New Testament, like an access road leads to a motor freeway (John 5:39). The biblical creation account should not be regarded as a myth, a parable, or an Allegory, but as a historical report, because: Biological, astronomical and anthropological facts are given in didactic [teaching] form. In the Ten Commandments God bases the six working days and one day of rest on the same time-span as that described in the creation account (Exodus 20:8-11). In the New Testament Jesus referred to facts of the creation (e.g. Matthew 19:4-5). Nowhere in the Bible are there any indications that the creation account should be understood in any other way than as a factual report. The doctrine of theistic evolution undermines this basic way of reading the Bible, as vouched for by Jesus, the prophets and the Apostles. Events reported in the Bible are reduced to mythical imagery, and an understanding of the message of the Bible as being true in word and meaning is lost. Danger NO. 4 Loss of the Way for Finding God The Bible describes man as being completely ensnared by sin after Adam's fall (Romans 7:18-19). Only those persons who realize that they are sinful and lost will seek the Savior who came to save that which was lost (Luke 19:10). However, evolution knows no sin in the biblical sense of missing one's purpose (in relation to God). Sin is made meaningless, and that is exactly the opposite of what the Holy Spirit does - He declares sin to be sinful. If sin is seen as a harmless evolutionary factor, then one has lost the key for finding God, which is not resolved by adding God to the evolutionary scenario. Danger NO. 5 The Doctrine of God's Incarnation is Undermined The incarnation of God through His Son Jesus Christ is one of the basic teachings of the Bible. The Bible states that The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us (John 1:14), Christ Jesus was made in the likeness of men (Philippians 2:5-7). The idea of evolution undermines this foundation of our salvation. Evolutionist Hoimar von Ditfurth discusses the incompatibility of Jesus' incarnation and evolutionary thought: Consideration of evolution inevitably forces us to a critical review of Christian formulations. This clearly holds for the central Christian concept of the 'incarnation' of God .3 Danger NO. 6 The Biblical Basis of Jesus' Work of Redemption Is Mythologized The Bible teaches that the first man's fall into sin was a real event and that this was the direct cause of sin in the world: Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned (Romans 5:12). Theistic evolution does not acknowledge Adam as the first man, nor that he was created directly from the dust of the ground by God (Genesis 2:17). Most theistic evolutionists regard the creation account as being merely a mythical tale, albeit with some spiritual significance. However, the sinner Adam and the Savior Jesus are linked together in the Bible - Romans 5:16-18. Thus any view which mythologizes Adam undermines the biblical basis of Jesus' work of redemption. Danger NO. 7 Loss of Biblical Chronology The Bible provides us with a time-scale for history and this underlies a proper understanding of the Bible. This time-scale includes: The time-scale cannot be extended indefinitely into the past, nor into the future. There is a well-defined beginning in Genesis 1:1, as well as a moment when physical time will end (Matthew 24:14). The total duration of creation was six days (Exodus 20:11). The age of the universe may be estimated in terms of the genealogies recorded in the Bible (but note that it can not be calculated exactly). It is of the order of several thousand years, not billions. Galatians 4:4 points out the most outstanding event in the world's history: But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son. This happened nearly 2,000 years ago. The return of Christ in power and glory is the greatest expected future event. Supporters of theistic evolution (and progressive creation) disregard the biblically given measures of time in favor of evolutionist time-scales involving billions of years both past and future (for which there are no convincing physical grounds). This can lead to two errors: Not all statements of the Bible are to be taken seriously. Vigilance concerning the second coming of Jesus may be lost. Danger NO. 8 Loss of Creation Concepts Certain essential creation concepts are taught in the Bible. These include: God created matter without using any available material. God created the earth first, and on the fourth day He added the moon, the solar system, our local galaxy, and all other star systems. This sequence conflicts with all ideas of cosmic evolution, such as the big bang cosmology. Theistic evolution ignores all such biblical creation principles and replaces them with evolutionary notions, thereby contradicting and opposing God's omnipotent acts of creation. Danger NO. 9 Misrepresentation of Reality The Bible carries the seal of truth, and all its pronouncements are authoritative - whether they deal with questions of faith and salvation, daily living, or matters of scientific importance. Evolutionists brush all this aside, e.g. Richard Dawkins says, Nearly all peoples have developed their own creation myth, and the Genesis story is just the one that happened to have been adopted by one particular tribe of Middle Eastern herders. It has no more special status than the belief of a particular West African tribe that the world was created from the excrement of ants.4 If evolution is false, then numerous sciences have embraced false testimony. Whenever these sciences conform with evolutionary views, they misrepresent reality. How much more then a theology which departs from what the Bible says and embraces evolution! Danger NO. 10 Missing the Purpose In no other historical book do we find so many and such valuable statements of purpose for man as in the Bible. For example: Man is God's purpose in creation (Genesis 1:27-28). Man is the purpose of God's plan of redemption (Isaiah 53:5). Man is the purpose of the mission of God's Son (1 John 4:9). We are the purpose of God's inheritance (Titus 3:7). Heaven is our destination (1 Peter 1:4). However, the very thought of purposefulness is anathema to evolutionists. Evolutionary adaptations never follow a purposeful program, they thus can not be regarded as teleonomical.5 Thus a belief system such as theistic evolution that marries purposefulness with non-purposefulness is a contradiction in terms. CONCLUSION The doctrines of creation and evolution are so strongly divergent that reconciliation is totally impossible. The theistic evolutionists attempt to integrate the two doctrines; however such syncretism reduces the message of the Bible to insignificance. The conclusion is inevitable: There is no support for theistic evolution in the Bible.","creationists-science-modern-world","11:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","56"

Which puts us in the slightly awkward position of not being able to call anyone anything That given, I'd say the same thing to marc but in a different way: Marc, whenever someone voices concern about religion, the first thing you seem to do is check whether that person also accepts evolutionary theory. From this correlation you fallaciously assume causation. Unless you can positively link evolutionary theory with the concerns voiced, you have no grounds for slotting the speaker into your 'evolutionary atheist agenda'.

"04-29-2008","10863",4,"marc9000","309909","They have every right to do that, but it needs to kept completely in the philosophical realm. Should we let atheists add facts plus theories and get facts, and not allow religious people to do the same thing? Ive seen that claim from only one other poster here before, in a similar vague way. Id like to see some detail, explained in laymans terms, about exactly which products we have, that we would not have without theories about RM-NS evolution. In a thread on these forums from two years ago, there was this thread about an expedition to find Tiktaalik roseae"", it appeared to be an atheist, evolutionist dream. Id like to know what that exploration did to provide return on investment more than ID studies would. If you were an atheist administrator in a university, would you fire someone who thought junkets in search of Tiktaalik roseae's just might be a waste of public money? If some scientists declare themselves judges of pseudoscience, other judges with equal scientific credentials (even if theyre in the minority) have a right to examine the prevailing opinion of science, and make conclusions about its possibility of pseudoscience. And ID does not speak of a designer. Its not insubstantial, but its not substantial enough to not be questioned. Thats a tricky analogy, the one object used by a person in a crime, with all his intentions and thought processes, is far more irrelevant than origins are to evolution. Could be easier to name one that has produced results, and has been blocked from the classroom. No matter how much they lie, the biological community is still coming to terms with Michael Behe's work. But the fact remains that ID fails regularly to get the recognition it seeks in court case after court case. As long as there is scientific uncertainty, there is going to be unscientific propaganda. I would rather see competition and debate between the propaganda of evolution and the propaganda of ID It matters if enough people think it does. If enough people think the question of origins justifies exploration of other yet unexplored paths Im sure you do. Many times when conservatives or Christians have a good argument about something, a fallacy is made up and applied to it. When creationists get tired of hearing how detrimental religion is to society, and clearly show how Darwinist thinking harmonizes with Nazism, it's simply called argumentum ad Hitlerum and then the debate about it is over! There is no such thing as argumentum ad anti-religionum, we dont recognize that one! In 20 or 30 years, when theistic evolutionists are no longer useful for godless evolution, it will become an advantage for evolutionists to declare that NO TRUE EVOLUTIONIST COULD BELIEVE IN GOD, and the No True Scotsman fallacy will be out dated, switched off.","Peeling","310138","I'm not sure what you mean by this. Surely the point of an attempt to objectively debunk religion's alleged value is that it be objective, cite facts, perform studies, apply the scientific method, rather than merely making philosophical pronouncements. For instance, the study that showed the almost global invariance of moral values regardless of religion, and also showed that children were far less likely to tolerate or approve of an <insert holy book here> description of atrocity if it was stripped of its 'holy' hallmarks - isn't that relevant information? Can I broaden the topic to include the rest of the Modern Synthesis, or must I talk only about applications involving RM and NS? If the latter, it's very likely parts of the computer you're using to read this were developed using RM/NS principles derived from observations of nature. When a problem is too complex to solve by design, we turn to evolutionary processes. In terms of increasing our scientific knowledge about our own natural history, and robustly confirming our theories of common descent, it was a triumph. The solid kicking it gave YEC is a triumph for science over pseudoscience, not atheism over religion. It's worth making the effort to appreciate that distinction: that creationism/ID (apologies to jyoshu but I haven't had time to come up with an alternative term) is neither religion nor science, but a deceitful PR exercise whose failures should be celebrated by science and religion alike. Why would I need to be an atheist specifically, and in what possible scenario would firing someone be on the cards? Most puzzling of all, though, is your utter disregard for the significance of the finding of Tiktaalik. It seems that to you, it's all about whether the decision to look for it was biased in some way, and who its discovery pleased most - what earthly relevance does that have to the find itself? It was a huge vindication of evolutionary theory, period. Absolutely. But it doesn't make them automatically right , which seemed to be your implication. Anyway, I'm happy to agree that all science is and must be open to challenge, so if that's all you meant to say, we can leave it at that. That depends where you look Depending upon the audience, its advocates can be quite candid on the subject. However, that's only relevant to establishing the political/religious underpinnings of the movement, not to its status as bad science. Ironically enough, their careful omission of any specification of a designer is one thing that prevents it from being favourably compared to sciences like archaeology, as we've already discussed. In principle, certainly - nothing should ever be held inviolate. In practice, however, a truly immense volume of evidence has accumulated in favour of - say - common descent, evidence that is routinely confirmed and reconfirmed on a daily basis by scientists applying the theory in their day-to-day work. In the judgement of pretty much all professionals in the field, the widespread and continual application of the theory is sufficient safeguard against undetected errors. Let me be clear: I'm not saying it must be true just because it's popular. Imagine you build a machine, and you test it and test it and test it and it passes every test, and then you sell millions of them and they get used every day without failing - which is the more stringent test? Clearly the latter, yes? Ask any massively multiplayer game developer. So it is with common descent and evolutionary theory. They were not formulated and then put on a pedestal to be admired, they were formulated, tested, and put to work, and that day-to-day application is far more likely to expose any inherent weakness than further bouts of 'testing'. I agree it's hard to find the appropriate analogy - so try this one instead: imagine I'm a member of some remote tribe living at the south pole, totally cut off from civilisation. One day I encounter a modern SUV out in the snowfields. My utter incomprehension as to its nature, purpose or origin, or that such a concept as a 'factory' even exists, would not prevent me from observing the tracks it left and surmising that it came from over there. Evolution is the journey life has been on; we've followed the tracks in the snow. Maybe we'll one day find the factory; maybe the tracks will become too faint. Doesn't matter: the evidence of the journey itself is incontrovertible. So they have to be lying in order for you to be right? Seems to happen a lot, that Behe's work on irreducible complexity is fundamentally flawed because it ignores proven evolutionary pathways by which IC mechanisms can form. You can download simulations of just such processes - I'll look them up for you when I get a chance. These simulations apply mutation and selection, always favouring the fittest, and flag up when IC solutions arise. How does it work? In essence, an increasingly complex solution evolves stepwise, and then evolves - again, stepwise - into a simpler and ultimately IC form. Picture a ball in a bucket, hanging somewhere high up. Behe argues that since the bottom of the bucket is solid, the ball could not have originated lower down and moved up into it, but must have been created where it is now... For which there are two explanations: either it's not, in fact, good science, or there's a conspiracy to suppress it which includes the judiciary. I can try and nudge you in the more plausible direction, but I can't force you. The appeal to 'fair play' is hard to ignore, isn't it? But the fact remains, evolution achieved its dual status of fact and theory through sheer hard graft and rigorous, punishing testing and peer review. Not lightly or whimsically is it foisted upon schoolchildren. I.D. wants to circumvent all that, avoid doing good science or producing results, yet claim equal scientific status. I.D is welcome in a religious or philosophical class - that is its place. It is no more appropriate for the science classroom than it is for the gym - it's simply not earned its place there. What's unexplored about the 'path' that says 'god did it'? I just explored the sum total of it in three words, and what did we learn? Why don't we ask the more interesting question how did god do it, and look for evidence to support our hypotheses? See, it's not about whether god exists or was involved, what you don't like is what science has to say about how it happened. It's not your christianity or conservatism that makes you vulnerable to fallacious reasoning. Fallacies are nothing more nor less than logical errors in reasoning or argument. And Hitler's frequent Christian exhortations in his speeches, his leveraging of religious fervour to incite his people, and the long-established concept of a 'favoured people' throughout the bible are just irrelevant details? It's an interesting topic; I'd love to discuss it in depth sometime. Rest assured, the fallacy to which you refer is not how such discussions end, it is how spurious and hysterical connections with Hitler in an effort to smear an opponent are dealt with. Why? It's still a logical fallacy, because evolution does not prohibit the existence of a god.","creationists-science-modern-world","06:43 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","58"
"04-29-2008","10863",4,"marc9000","310114","I was seeking an overall, broad definition of evolution, Thats it exactly, allele frequency change doesnt go into the controversy concerning worldviews like common descent does, because common descent gets involved with questions of man not being one bit different than animals, of their being no defined time or place of original sin, no Adam and Eve, etc. Its what makes the word evolution so slippery, when someone like myself wants to explore all the ideologies and extrapolations of evolution concerning politics, someone immediately wants to reduce it to a biological discussion only. where it was insisted that change in allele frequencies over time was the only definition acceptable in any debate with me about evolution being atheistic. The dishonesty on their part was clear. It works both ways! Conflating those terms, and trying to paint an innocent picture of evolution, is often the job of a politically motivated evolutionist. The proof is in my above referenced challenge thread. Ill concede that youve done that somewhat, and its helping make our little discussion here interesting, dont you think? No more of a negative form than tests made by evolutionists. Evolutionists dont know what naturalistic origins look like either. And youll tell me that evolutionists dont directly test for them. And Ill tell you that IDists dont directly test for a designer. I think youre misrepresenting UPB. Whatever happens from freeze thaw cracking isnt going to result in something as complex as life, something that has so many parts that have to work together perfectly, or quickly, completely deteriorate.","Peeling","310140","Why? Is there an overall, broad definition of the word 'might'? You presume the existence of that which you seek to prove: a definition of 'evolution' which encompasses atheism. Then you should have started the debate 'Common Descent is Atheistic', and I'd have won that one instead I don't think it's unreasonable for people to want to know what they're going to be debating. You saw what happened when I went in blind - I expected you to at least start to formulate a definition in your first post, and when you didn't I had to try and cover every interpretation I could think of. You're revising history again. You were explicitly offered evolutionary theory as an acceptable debating point in addition to the biological definition. How is distinguishing between terms conflating them? This is nonsense. Thanks - and yes, it is. Possibly because it denies you your favourite soap-box I can see why you might think that, but you're confusing origins with history. Evolution doesn't speak to origins. I.D doesn't speak to origins either, because it talks about where life's 'information' came from while ignoring the question of where the inferred designer's 'information' came from. Rather, both speak to part of the history of life. I.D postulates a discontinuous natural history, one in which living molecules were shaped by an entity or entities unknown, with capabilities and motivations unknown. No positive test for such interference can be made, because you don't know what you're looking for. All you can do is seize upon events or formations for which no plausible naturalistic history yet exists and hope you're right. Evolutionary theory postulates a continuous natural history of life - just as all scientific theories postulate a continuous natural history of their subject, out of necessity. Hypotheses as to how a particular structure or creature formed - what its natural history was - can be positively tested. Tiktaalik was a positive test. I.D. could never have predicted the existence of that fossil: a designer of unknown capacity and motivation has no rules by which he must abide, so there was no requirement for that species to have ever lived. Evolutionary theory, on the other hand, required that species to have lived. Thus a positive prediction was made (according to our theory, we will find X if we look in Y), and confirmed. I.D's predictions are unfailingly negative: we will never find a naturalistic explanation for X. But that's exactly the point! I.D. doesn't work, numerically, unless you factor in your own prejudices as to what is and is not designed. You've just said as much: I shouldn't 'break' the UPB by feeding in values that make the Giant's Causeway look designed because it wasn't designed. On the other hand, it's ok to feed values into the UPB that result in life looking like it was designed, because life was designed. There's nothing in I.D. to stop me feeding in values that make the Giant's Causeway look designed other than my pre-existing knowledge of a naturalistic process that could produce them. So why shouldn't the same apply to Dembski's analysis of living structures?","creationists-science-modern-world","07:36 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","59"
