You seem to be heaping scorn on those who would scream 'religion in disguise' just because a concept is complex and includes subcategories.

"04-26-2008","10863",3,"obvious_child","309515","Marc, explain to me why you'd apply a philosophical definition of evolution, or a business definition of evolution in place of the biological definition of evolution in regards to life.

"04-26-2008","10863",3,"Peeling","309525","Quite the reverse: you had trouble finding an opponent precisely because you weren't prepared to agree in advance which of the various meanings and usages of the word 'evolution' the debate was about. Nobody was saying the word only had one meaning; they just wanted you to pick one. They said that biological evolution has a simple scientific definition, and they were right. That term is often shortened to simply 'evolution', especially by practicing scientists - just as the word 'grip' is used without confusion on the set of a film, despite it having a different meaning to that employed in other fields. The fundamental problem was this: you wanted to argue your case based on vague popular or layman's usages of the term. But the word evolution is 'popularly' used by creationists to refer to everything up to and including cosmology and the big bang, and among them holds strong connotations of atheism. They're wrong to use the word like that, but they do , which makes it a de facto usage of the term. What you were effectively demanding was that your opponent prove the word evolution has no atheistic connotations to anyone, which is clearly impossible, and utterly irrelevant to the question of whether biological evolution or common descent - the real issue creationists care about - is atheistic or not. Although this superficially sounds like a reasonable argument, it isn't. When archaeologists unearth a curiously shaped object, they have a very clear idea of a) the natural forces at work in the vicinity, and b) the capabilities, motivations and thought-processes of the potential 'designers' they're interested in: humans. If they find a stone arrowhead, for instance, they can recognise the signs of tooling and sharpening, they can recognise a familiar purpose, and simultaneously discount the various known naturalistic processes from having produced it unaided. They are not detecting design, they are detecting the hand and mind of a specific, known designer - in effect, they are positively detecting a particular kind of known naturalistic force (human ingenuity) at work.","marc9000","309902","If you'll read the challange thread youll see that they did not acknowledge various meanings and usages in any way. They only had one definition, change in allele frequencies over time. Because what inspired my argument/debate challange was the Questions for both sides thread, it was full of vague/popular laymans usages of the term, and you cant blame only me for it, since I didn't start the thread, and since I was only about 1/10 of all the broad usages of the term going on in that thread, the rest were coming from evolutionists. Please read its opening post (by an evolutionist) youre not going to find much about biology there. So youre saying creationists are the only ones who do that? Check out this thread the first 12 posts were all by evolutionists. Post #1 was only about biological evolution. Post #2 touched on biology, and quickly moved on to geology and paleontology, in a seamless and unnoticeable fashion. Poster #1s response in post #4 made no reference to it Im sure he didnt even notice it. If this looks slightly familiar to you, its because the last three sentences before this one were just copy/pastes of what Ive shown you before. So it seems that evolutionists dont always have a monopoly on endlessly, repeatedly, patiently, and as time goes by, less patiently explaining things in excruciating detail. Creationists arent the only ones that blend the word evolution with cosmology, the big bang, geology, paleontology, or even worldviews and philosophy. Will you admit that or not? I was seeking a discussion about evolution being atheistic concerning its general use and understanding to everyone, as we see that anyone is likely to introduce it/use it in a general way, a way that encompases all its sub-catagories. I got what I wanted, you and I did it, and its there for anyone to read. Ill partially concede that point. Youre saying that archeologists know more about the capabilities, motivations, and thought processes, of the people of ancient civilizations, more than Christians can know the capabilities, motivations, and thought processes of God. Many Christians can make a pretty good case for knowing the capabilities, motivations, thought processes of God by Bible study, but a good case can be made that it's not comparable to the history of ancient civilizations. The Bible explains nothing about Gods mechanical methods to a comparable degree of our knowledge of past generations mechanical methods. But I still believe the ID community can explain how design can be detected in biology, without any knowledge of the designer.

"04-26-2008","10863",3,"Peeling","309525","In the past, false 'design' positives have inspired myths of supernatural or superhuman beings. The Giant's Causeway , for instance, is so anomalously regular as to look designed - until you discover the naturalistic process that produces it. And that's I.D's failure in a nutshell: it's method of 'detecting design' is nothing of the sort. What it 'detects' might be design, but it's much more likely to be 'detecting' lack of knowledge on the part of the person performing the test. If that person doesn't currently know of a naturalistic process that could produce what they're observing, the test will 'detect' design. That's why I.D. is not analogous to archaeology: human activity is a known process and its hallmarks can be identified. I.D claims to be able to positively detect the hallmarks of an entirely arbitrary designer, whose motivations and capabilities are completely unknown - which is logically impossible. If you don't know what this designer could or would do, you can't possibly construct a positive test to detect his activity. I.D. would have detected design in the Giant's Causeway had its real origin not already been known. If you don't know the natural process that produces it, it's trivially easy to frame the problem such that the odds against the formation occurring by chance exceed the 'universal probability bound' - thus design is proved. At which point, I.D declares the case closed: design, therefore designer. I.D. isn't a religion. It's not a science, either, but it's not a religion. It's a PR tool being used by certain religious people, with the publicly avowed intent of injecting Jesus into the scientific mainstream and inducing a sea-change whereby everything in science is interpreted through a scriptural filter. It's similar to parasitism: get inside the body of a healthy host where it's warm and safe. In a way, you're presenting a false dichotomy. Science isn't atheistic by default, just because it's not religious. A doughnut isn't religious; that doesn't make it atheistic either. Science is a methodology for learning about the natural world, and a highly effective one at that. Our evolutionary history is written through this planet like words through a stick of rock - therefore, science can speak to it. What consequences that has for your spiritual beliefs and their underpinnings is not science's fault. marc, the debate is over. We rested our respective cases; I do not intend to rehash the whole thing now so you can work through your 'should have saids'. If anyone is saying that the word evolution - not biological evolution - only has one meaning, point them at a dictionary - or me for that matter - for correction. What, you mean atheists really exist? And they say things? Are they... are they outside, right now? Interestingly, I just read this little snippet in a review: Imagine you are raised by your mother, who tells you your father was a great man who accomplished many things but died not long after you were born. Later on, you try to find out about this great man but can detect no trace or mention of him or his alleged deeds. It looks very much like your mother was having you on. Clearly you did have a father, but the father you thought you had doesn't exist, and never did. He could still, coincidentally, have been a great man and accomplished amazing things, but that doesn't make your mother right; she was just making stuff up. That's one possible perspective: a continued belief in a god but treating the universe itself as his holy book, learning from that rather than the works of men. Personally, I'm content to be an atheist. I think if there is a god, he's far too well hidden for us to detect, and if he wants us to think he doesn't exist, who am I to argue? When I watch the news, and see someone interviewed, I'm always mildly irritated by the little caption they attach: ""Joe Bloggs, smoker""; ""Jane Middlemiss, motorist"" - like these titles somehow define the person. Stenger is a person, who has personally come to certain conclusions by using his brain and the scientific method. I'm quite sure he is convinced by the evidence supporting evolution - so what? So's Jyoshu. His views regarding the detrimental influence of religion are nothing to do with evolution and everything to do with the influence of religion. If religion did nothing but give out free pies on a Friday afternoon, I'm sanguine he wouldn't have a bad thing to say about it.","marc9000","309906","Is it not equally likely that by disregarding design or any possibility of the supernatural, the lack of that significant thought process takes the evolutionist down only one path thats narrow enough to make it trivially easy to theorize that everything happens by nothing but naturalistic processes? At which point, science declares the case closed? Naturalism, therefore, no God, God is irrelevant, or, last but not least, I believe in some god (wink wink, nod nod). I know the worn out response thats all science can do and that would be acceptable, if science was building on something as testable and repeatable and observable as naturalistic origins, something it cant do. And I know the worn out response to that too - no evidence that it didnt arise naturally, so God must have done it, is the God of the gaps fallacy. As Michael Behe has said, all that is is a question begging insult meant to stop the flow of argument before it has barely started. There seem to be a lot of magic wands for silencing discussion of ID. I understand that its an effective one, some sub-catagories of it that is. And other sub-catagories, or broad generalizations of it, can also be a PR tool used by atheists, with the intent of injecting atheism into the scientific mainstream and inducing a sea-change where many things political are interpreted through an atheistic filter. Its mocked as the EAC by atheists, but that doesnt mean it isnt happening. Physicist Steven Weinberg; I personally feel that the teaching of modern science is corrosive of religious belief, and Im all for that. If scientists can destroy the influence of religion on young people, then I think it may be the most important contribution that we can make. E.O. Wilson; If religioncan be systematically analyzed and explained as a product of the brains evolution, its power as an external source of morality will be gone forever. I know that's only their personal opinions, but those opinions aren't staying in their own little worlds. Open minded people can read between a lot of lines and see it throughout evolution. Thats only your worldview. I can switch your words around to show another worldview, but I wont bother.. Where did I say anything about what I should have said? You asked me for an example of where you expended less-than-considerable effort in the service of clarity, and I showed you where it was . That particular debate is over, but the subject isnt going away, in fact it is evolving, considering the number of books, and now a movie, that have appeared since we had our debate. All I did was repeat the very true phrase from the movie; evolution is a slippery word, and it wasnt directed at you, but you came a-running. You may be confusing what you consider my should have saids to my responses to new information, and changes concerning the subject. Youve implied that only creationists make the slippery word slide, and this thread alone makes it so clear how evolutionists do it too. Well then maybe Ive accomplished something here by inspiring you to do that, because you sure werent doing that a year ago, to the authors of posts 3, 4, 5, 6,7, 9, 10, etc etc etc in this thread. Yes, theyre outside, theyre in academics, theyre writing books, theyre teaching very small children, theyre lining politicians pockets, theyre filing lawsuits challenging tradition and morals, theyre in a lot of places. That would be fine if science were the only source of knowledge. Thats one of the things about this subject that seems to be evolving more and more scientists seem to be thinking that it is, making them the top-dogs, giving them more and more authority over the lives of the non-scientists. He may not be that hidden, if you'd look somewhere besides science for him. If he wanted us to think he didn't exist, he may have avoided allowing the 66 book Bible to be the most carefully preserved writings in all of history, or his Son to be the most written about person who ever lived. But what he is doing is taking evolution (considered a ""fact"") adding it to a theory (there is no god) and trying to convice his reader that he has added; fact + theory = fact. Evolution seems to do that in it's subcatagories. How do we distinguish the difference between the validity of when it's done in a subcatagory vs when it's done concerning the general term? Do you get equally irritatied by the little captions under the names of Kent Hovind, or Michael Behe, or Ben Stein, or William Dembski? Why the double standard? Why not let them be individuals also? Why not let them come to certain conclusions without attacking captions, or ideologies? Why the fear in letting future generations be exposed to their path of thinking? Wrong, as E.O. Wilson made clear above. They have plenty to do with evolution if evolution can be used as a weapon against them .
