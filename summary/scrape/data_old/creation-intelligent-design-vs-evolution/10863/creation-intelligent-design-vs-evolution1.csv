Actually, as an evolutionary biologist I would agree that evolution can't be proved - Proof is a matter of law, math, or alcoholic beverages. In fact, evolution has been observed. We can see evolution in progress, and that makes evolution a fact. The observations of evolution are some of the facts upon which the theories of evolution are based. Why is it that only creationists who are scientifically illiterate talk about science and proof in the same sentence? I guess it is much better to believe the mythology of ancient, bronze age, nomadic herdsmen and postulate a magical being for which there is no evidence.

Or 'faith', for that matter. I do have to wonder: are you genuinely, heart-attack serious in your belief that the multiple meanings of the word 'evolution' are sinister in nature and purpose? Because it strikes me as odd that members of a conspiracy dedicated to the misleading use of a term would endlessly, repeatedly, patiently (and as time goes by, less patiently) explain in excruciating detail the important differences between the uses of that term. Take me, for instance: are you prepared to tell me to my face that I'm being deceptive when I talk about evolution? Can you point to anything I've ever written on the subject that seems intentionally misleading? Have I equivocated - or have I rather expended considerable effort in the service of clarity? The feeling I get is that it doesn't matter a wet slap what anyone says or does, you'll interpret it according to the requirements of your pet conspiracy theory. So when people say evolution isn't atheistic, you see it as proof that it is atheistic and evolutionists are liars. When umpteen independent scientific disciplines all corroborate the tentative predictions of evolutionary theory, it's proof that evolution has pervaded all of science and that all scientists are liars. When scientists say that I.D. is religiously motivated pseudoscience and produce documentary evidence to that effect, it's proof that I.D. is really good science and scientists want to suppress it because they're scared. Just for a moment, pretend your conspiracy theory is nonsense. Doesn't all the wealth of evidence admit another explanation? That common descent is a fact, evolutionary theory is robustly supported by multiple scientific disciplines because it's right , that I.D. has no demonstrable scientific merit, isn't widely supported, is religiously motivated, and hasn't earned its place in the science classroom alongside E=MC2? Compare the two scenarios, and ask yourself: which demands the existence of the fewest conspiratorial liars to prop it up? And in which scenario do the conspirators have the clearest, most obvious, and self-declared motivation to behave as they are? Seriously, now: you're prepared to take the utter lack of atheist trappings within evolutionary biology as evidence of a vast, silent conspiracy, so why ignore the public statements of sites like AIG and I.D organisations to the effect that they have an agenda of bringing religion to the forefront of scientific endeavour? They come right out and announce their unscientific bias and conspiratorial intent! It's the foundation of their recruiting drive!

How many other words have evolving definitions such as this word does? I would never call you deceptive or intentionally misleading at all Peeling. But I do consider you a victim who is a true believer in the great lie of evolution. Just as we make certain leaps of faith that although certain aspects of Creation can't be proven scientifically, so do evolutionists do the same exact thing. Only they do it under the guise of a constantly evolving science, thus the constantly changing definition. Just as you make certain assumptions that never change regarding evo, so does the Creationist hold that certain absolutes exist regarding Creation, such as a personal God created all that is. We understand science can't prove God which is a huge stumbling block for the evolutionist, but isn't one at all for us because we can see the spiritual which evades the scientific perspective at all levels of understanding. And ID would insist that it is evolution that's the atheistically motivated pseudo science, so we will continue to disagree there also. If the foundation upon which evo is based is false, such as the age of the Earth and the interpretation of fossil information. Then all of the conclusions that are derived from those original faulty conclusions is as wrong as wrong can be, and as deceptive as deceptive can be. So common descent is not a fact at all. It's a hope that is pursued with a vengeance. But in no way is factually provable at all. This argument is totally fallacious Peeling, as it attempts to promote a motive to deceive by the Creationists while stating that evolutionists could have no such motive due to the alleged impersonal nature of the scientific endeavor. Consider that scientific GRANTS and pay increases for these scientists are based on making new and previously undiscovered claims that forward the science. That is the greatest motivation to lie, cheat, create and falsify evidence which adds to the scientists personal wealth and further promotes a false science that is rife with selfish motivations to preserve, protect and promote it. The reality that you are blind to what believers see so clearly is that apart from Christ, it is impossible to see the spiritual battle humanity is fighting. So we understand the deceptions that evo offers are designed to keep people like you focussed on Mans intellect rather than believing God through faith in His scriptural promises found in the bible. I consider your beliefs (evolutionists) as shallow and juvenile as they can be because you're actually simple enough to trust mans intellect regarding things that happened 14-20 billion years ago allegedly, as you admittedly base them on scientific predictions which are derived at by doing experiments which are set up and based on other predictions, simply because you know that no real and confirmable evidence exists from that time period. You base everything you believe regarding evo on the big bang first happening. But you can't prove the big bang actually happened at all. But based on certain assumption which are based on certain predictions. Now I realize I've taken my argument back to the big bang belief in the beginning of time. But I could just as easily skip that aspect of your scientific assumptions and start at 300 million years ago, or 200 million years ago, or at 65 million years ago when you predict the great dino extinction that's assumed to have been caused by a huge comet impact. It doesn't really matter where we start with the imaginary predictions you rely so faithfully on for your World view, as they are all based on ABSOLUTELY UNPROVABLE ASSUMPTIONS WHICH ARE DERIVED FROM MAKING ABSOLUTELY UNPROVABLE CONCLUSIONS WHICH ARE BASED ON ABSOLUTELY UNVERIFIABLE PREDICTIONS THAT DETERMINE THE EXPERIMENTS YOU MAKE THAT CAUSE YOU TO COME TO YOUR FAULTY, AND VERY MISLEADING RESULTS.","creationists-science-modern-world","10:30 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","12"

I rarely read a post, blog article, or editorial where ID'ers aren't insulted and intentionally belittled. People are making heroes out of hateful people like Dawkins who seem to get a lot of glee out of belittling and insulting people. For some unfortunate reason, a lot of scientists seem to have moved from being fact-driven, objective observers to being what amounts to belligerent ideologues. I haven't seen Expelled yet, but I think that's part of what it's trying to get across, according to what I've read. This change in tact by scientists is too bad, because I think evolution and the facts would be better served by taking the high road. The facts don't NEED insults to be facts; science doesn't need evangelism and crusading to be science. If scientists think that it does, then these scientists must think it's pretty weak science to begin with. I think this new culture of ridicule among scientists is probably doing as much to hurt what they think of as a cause, rather than helping it.","creationists-science-modern-world","10:44 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","13"

Descriptions of events that conform to #1. 3. Tested explanations for the events of #2, known in science as theories. And that only covers the most simple and common uses in evolutionary biology. There are other uses both inside and outside of science. For example, astrophysicists talk about the evolution of stars or the evolution of galaxies. Linguists talk about the evolution of languages. And that goes on and on. The reason is that the word ""evolution"" was in use long before it was applied to biological processes. It is still used the way it has always been used to mean what it has always meant. In biology it has other meanings that are applicable only to biology. That wasn't so hard, was it? So do you think that the word ""creationism"" has a single meaning and always has had a single meaning? I can assure you that I have been told by creationists on many occasions that ""creationism"" and ""creationist"" has several meanings. Not only is ""creationism"" a slippery word, creationists are slippery people.","creationists-science-modern-world","11:44 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","14"

They need to take their religion back to their churches and practice it as they wish. They don't have a right to force me or my children to practice it, even passively. Some of what creationists post is so stupid that it would be impossible to discuss it without insult. I mean, after all, a big boat with 8 people and millions of animals? You've got to be kidding. Actually, scientists don't speak out enough about idiocy and ignorance. No. It's trying to convince the ignorant that ID creationism is somehow science and is being unjustly blocked from being taught as science in public schools. Stop reading creationist #### and read something from the other side. If you are educated enough about what science is and how it works, then see the movie. Without education you will be duped like all of the rest of the non-high school graduates. Do you know the meaning of the word ""tact""? I think not. I presume you actually meant a ""change in tack"", derived from the nautical term meaning to change direction. Actually, the high road is to point out the gross stupidity of creationism as science. You just think that it is insulting. It's not. That's true, and scientists are still doing science. The problem is that creationists aren't and they are claiming that they are being treated unfairly when science comes to conclusions that don't fit their dogma. The problem isn't scientists not doing science, it is creationists pretending that their mythology is science. When they do that, they are asking to be judged by science. No. They understand the science. What is the problem is the uneducated school boards and state legislatures, and even our idiot President, who have the scientific sophistication of a pickle. The think it is a good idea to present mythology as science and let the uneducated decide in classrooms that are meant to educate in the first place. There is no new culture. What have you been smoking. Scientists have been pointing out the idiocy of creation science for as long as I can remember, and that goes back a ways. It remember back to when creationists first adopted the flood geology of the 7th day Adventists as their own and started calling it ""creation science."" New culture?
