"04-21-2008","10863",2,"Archangel","309308","Regarding the bolded Peeling, I find it very telling that you admit there are various definitions for the word evolution. How many other words have evolving definitions such as this word does? I would never call you deceptive or intentionally misleading at all Peeling. But I do consider you a victim who is a true believer in the great lie of evolution. Just as we make certain leaps of faith that although certain aspects of Creation can't be proven scientifically, so do evolutionists do the same exact thing. Only they do it under the guise of a constantly evolving science, thus the constantly changing definition. Just as you make certain assumptions that never change regarding evo, so does the Creationist hold that certain absolutes exist regarding Creation, such as a personal God created all that is. We understand science can't prove God which is a huge stumbling block for the evolutionist, but isn't one at all for us because we can see the spiritual with evades the scientific perspective at all levels of understanding. And ID would insist that it is evolution that's the atheistically motivated pseudo science, so we will continue to disagree there also. If the foundation upon which evo is based is false, such as the age of the Earth and the interpretation of fossil information. Then all of the conclusions that are derived from those original faulty conclusions is as wrong as wrong can be, and as deceptive as deceptive can be. This argument is totally fallacious Peeling, as it attempts to promote a motive to deceive by the Creationists while stating that evolutionists could have no such motive due to the alleged impersonal nature of the scientific endeavor. The reality that you are blind to that believers see so clearly is that apart from Christ, it is impossible to see the spiritual battle humanity is fighting. You base everything you believe regarding evo on the big bang first happening. But I could just as easily skip that aspect of your scientific assumptions and start at 300 million years ago, or 200 million years ago, or at 65 million years ago when you predict the great dino extinction that's assumed to have been caused by a huge comet impact. It doesn't really matter where we start with the imaginary predictions you rely so faithfully on for your World view, as they are all based on ABSOLUTELY UNPROVABLE ASSUMPTIONS WHICH ARE DERIVED FROM MAKING ABSOLUTELY UNPROVABLE CONCLUSIONS WHICH ARE BASED ON ABSOLUTELY UNVERIFIABLE PREDICTIONS THAT DETERMINE THE EXPERIMENTS YOU MAKE THAT CAUSE YOU TO COME TO YOUR FAULTY, AND VERY MISLEADING CONCLUSIONS.","Peeling","309329","I'm pleased you find it telling, because I was in fact telling you something. What is there to 'admit'? Have I ever denied the fact? Have I ever been less than straightforward about the various uses of the word, from strict biological definitions to the catch-all layman's term? What exactly are you reading into this? And what word hasn't 'evolved' additional meanings? Cool. Bad. Slick. Shiny. Do we have to be careful about using the word evolution to avoid confusion? Sure, which is why I've tried to distinguish common descent from evolutionary theory, for instance. So what? The only people practicing equivocation are those seeking to lump abiogenesis in with evolution, or cosmology in with biological evolution: they're genuinely attempting to distort the meaning of the word in order to bring irrelevant and emotive argumentation into play. You are welcome to your faith, and you can use it to believe whatever you like, but this continuing misconception of yours that (on the subject of evolution) we're exchanging beliefs and opinions of equal merit can only be counterproductive. Evidence inevitably weighs in, and apart from a single chapter in a single book all of it is landing on my side. Either the whole world is lying to me, or that one chapter is allegorical, misinterpreted or just plain wrong. It does not require faith, bias or belief to be convinced when the evidence is overwhelming. You proudly proclaim you have the faith, the bias, necessary - that's fine; as I said you're welcome to it. But don't make the mistake of assuming everyone forms their opinions the same way. Such as? Please, name one: an actual assumption. Something I just take for granted that you don't. So it's not about what's scientifically correct - or in other words, the real natural history of earth as determined by multiple independent avenues of scientific endeavour. What's important is that we teach the correct spiritual message, regardless of accuracy - the correct message being... yours? Again, simple disagreement does not confer equal merit upon the contending opinions. I can link to documentary evidence - from the ID movement itself - that ID is religiously inspired and explicitly unscientific in nature. Can you do the same? Can you link to any valuable scientific results that have emerged from ID research? And if wishes were horses... You've no evidence, AA. None at all. Nothing in the natural world disputes the great age of the earth. Don't you find that in the least bit remarkable, if it really is a few thousand years old? Wouldn't something fail to jibe? Read my challenge in the debate section: why doesn't our earth look like the one in my thought experiment? I stated nothing; I merely asked you (or rather marc) to consider the options impartially and assess the scale and plausibility of the conspiracies each entail. Factor in the explicitly advertised intentions of the I.D movement and related sites such as AIG, and it's not hard to pick a winner. Either the small group of religiously motivated people saying they're engaged in an unscientific hearts-and-minds campaign to push religion to the forefront of science are engaged in an unscientific hearts-and-minds campaign to push religion to the forefront of science, or the vast, vast majority of scientists of all religions and none are all engaged in an unscientific hearts-and-minds campaign to push atheism to the forefront of science, despite vigorous denials, zero evidence, and no definable motive. Again, you make my point more eloquently than I could ever hope to achieve unaided. What relevance has this imagined 'spiritual battle' to the evidence of an evolutionary natural history? You're completely caught up in the righteousness of what you believe we should teach people is the history of life on earth, and don't seem to give a damn whether it's actually right or not. You don't care about truth, as derived from observing god's creation directly, only Truth, as defined by your belief in a book written by men. Um, no... We don't predict it, we observe it, in the fossil and geological record. And yes, you could start 300 million years ago, because the earth was here 300 million years ago, all six thousand million million million dinosaur-encrusted tons of it. And yet, and yet... all these unprovable assumptions and unprovable conclusions and unverifiable predictions, all this faulty and misleading nonsense based on nothing more substantial than a desire to deny the existence of god... keeps paying off.","creationists-science-modern-world","12:27 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","17"

And this is what gets so frustrating about debating with you because you're as slippery as the evolution you debate. And you can also be somewhat sanctimonious in you attitude also. So let's just get down to the built in contradictions that you constantly go between promoting and denying, depending on the arguments I give at any time. Here you are accusing me of wrongly lumping these other sciences in with evo as if I'm trying to confuse the situation, but here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_descent with the definition of common descent it say's, This theory is now generally accepted by biologists, and the last universal common ancestor (LUCA or LUA), that is, the most recent common ancestor of all currently living organisms, is believed to have appeared about 3.9 billion years ago. The theory of a common ancestor between all organisms is one of the principles of evolution, Doesn't this aspect of common descent clearly imply that since the earliest organisms appeared 3.9 billion years ago and we descended from them commonly that they are tied together with the separate science you now refer to as abiogenesis? Now go on and squirm out of that in your usual way Peeling. What is remarkable is that you believe the great age of the Earth without any absolute supportable evidence that is foolproof. What appears to be may not be as it appears at all. What I marvel at is that you ignore any questions you can't answer and assume you're right because of it. I never said anything about a conspiracy Peeling. I very clearly gave valid reasons to Consider that scientific GRANTS and pay increases for these scientists are based on making new and previously undiscovered claims that forward the science. That is the greatest motivation to lie, cheat, create and falsify evidence which adds to the scientists personal wealth and further promotes a false science that is rife with selfish motivations to preserve, protect and promote it. Yeah, right. Again you rewrite the definitions you previously relied on to define your science. Respond to this without just editing it out then, if you can, Peeling. http://www.infidels.org/library/mode...evolution.html One of the crucial ""predictions"" of evolutionary theory is that one should find a general progression of increasingly diverse and complex life forms when one traces the fossil record through progressively higher strata of sedimentary rock. And... A second ""prediction"" of evolution is that the fossil record should yield transitional forms. Interesting how first a crucial prediction, and then a second prediction is so forthcoming from a link who's content you will surely agree with on all counts. You continue to deceive yourself my friend.

If your arguments are failing to find purchase, there are other possible explanations Um, no, I think you just accused yourself. I didn't mention you and did not in fact have you in mind when I wrote that paragraph. But if you feel the accusation does apply to you, I won't argue the point. Are those fields related? In the same way as electricity generation and computer programming are related, sure. But just as computer programming concerns itself with what you do once you've got electricity, so evolution speaks to the processes by which first 'life' became what we see around us. It does not speak to the non-biological processes which brought about that first life - whatever they may have been. Don't for a moment think I'm washing my hands of abiogenesis - I'll happily natter on about that until the cows come home. Protocells in particular are just - well, let's say it's telling that when we hypothesise what conditions may have prevailed back in those early days, and reproduce them in the lab, we don't get nothing at all , which is what you'd expect if science was all the things you called it in your last post, but rather we get budding, self-replicating double-layered membranes capable of sequestering molecules from the environment. Interesting, but not evolution, which is the relevant point to take away. The estimated age of the earth itself is derived from multiple independent sources , not counting the vast array of 'lower bound' values derived from geological formations across the planet. What's marvellous here is your application of double standards. You find the painstakingly-verified, multiply-sourced estimates of the earth's age wanting, for reasons you never explain but insist are terribly convincing, yet invest absolute, unquestioning faith in an old book containing no less than two conflicting creation myths. You recently had ample opportunity to challenge the evidence and pose questions - did I ignore a single point, a single question? It's saddening and a little hurtful, frankly, after the hours I spent researching and composing the posts in that discussion, to see you revising history like this. I was friendly, polite, enthusiastic; I went into any amount of detail - yet here, to make some throwaway point you'll p*ss all over that time and effort without a second thought and call me 'slippery', 'shallow', 'juvenile' into the bargain. Thanks a bunch. To be fair, you kind of stepped into marc's shoes by deciding to answer for him. If you don't believe in a conspiracy, you might want to step out of them again It does happen - relatively rarely - and is inevitably exposed by other scientists looking to make a name for themselves by spotting inconsistencies, fallacies or fraud and doing better science. That's the beauty of the system; that's why it works, and that's why it ought not to be polluted by zealots seeking to preserve certain ideas as sacred; exempt from scrutiny. Go back and look at what my ""we don't predict "" statement was a response to. Here it is again: There's no ambiguity here: I was clearly talking about the cometary extinction event we observe in the fossil and geological record. Of course evolutionary theory makes predictions - very very good ones, which is why it's a good theory. I wholeheartedly endorse the quotes you provide. But the extinction of the dinosaurs isn't a prediction - why would evolutionary theory predict comets? Or is this me being slippery again, reminding you of the conversation we actually had ? ...typed the ever-so-slightly insufferable man into his multi-gigahertz desktop PC All joking aside, the scientific method really does work; the proof is all around us. And when we apply that method to investigating the natural history of this planet, it yields testable, predictive, useful results. If our conclusions about evolution were wrong, that wouldn't happen - just as your PC wouldn't work if we were wrong about the principles upon which it is based. What really puzzles me is why you even care. What on earth has evolution got to do with Jesus or the message of salvation propagated in his name? Why can't we be special for what we are, and never mind what we were ? Why are you so keen to shackle your valuable spiritual message to a useless millstone of a creation myth that can only drag it down into obscurity?","creationists-science-modern-world","07:33 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","22"

"04-22-2008","10863",2,"jyoshu","309311","You know, I'm an evolutionist too, but I do think there's entirely too much vitriol toward creationists out there right now. I rarely read a post, blog article, or editorial where ID'ers aren't insulted and intentionally belittled. People are making heroes out of hateful people like Dawkins who seem to get a lot of glee out of belittling and insulting people. For some unfortunate reason, a lot of scientists seem to have moved from being fact-driven, objective observers to being what amounts to belligerent ideologues. I haven't seen Expelled yet, but I think that's part of what it's trying to get across, according to what I've read. This change in tact by scientists is too bad, because I think evolution and the facts would be better served by taking the high road. The facts don't NEED insults to be facts; science doesn't need evangelism and crusading to be science. If scientists think that it does, then these scientists must think it's pretty weak science to begin with. I think this new culture of ridicule among scientists is probably doing as much to hurt what they think of as a cause, rather than helping it.","marc9000","309500","Well stated.

Why do they do that? Are they afraid of something? Do they have something to hide? Is there dishonesty involved? Surely you noticed it it was a big part of the problem in finding an opponent for the evolution is atheistic debate that you finally agreed to. Theyve said that evolution has a simple scientific meaning, and all the atheistic extrapolation from it is just personal opinions, and doesnt alter the definition. Intelligent Design also has a simple definition. It is a science that studies signs of intelligence - it purports to find signs of intelligence in biological systems. Immediately saying that studies for intelligence is not science is false, because its a basic in archeology, when the archeologist unearths a curiously shaped object. A first concern is to find out if it occurred naturally, or if it was intelligently designed by an ancient civilization. When evolutionists claim that ID is religion in disguise, they show their double standard. They dont allow anyone who extrapolates ID into religion the same free pass they give anyone who extrapolates evolution into atheism. That was your intentionally misleading statement, with some mocking thrown in. but the main problem I have is when the subject comes up now in the free-for-all forums, I am told that evolution has only one meaning, called names, and am required to prove it yet again. Its no wonder that in the 'trash Marc' thread in the ringside forum, one poster thought our formal debate should be deleted wasnt worth the bandwidth. Thats because since our formal debate, so far several atheist books, and one evolution questioning movie, have clearly shown that the pet conspiracy theory you attribute to only me, is actually a widespread FACT. Conspiracy is a little too much of an emotional word to be accurate. (Im sure thats why you use it) The word agenda is much more accurate. Heres how its worded on the back flap (book description) in the 2007 book God, The Failed Hypothesis, How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist; In God: The Failed Hypothesis, Stenger argues that science has advanced sufficiently to make a definitive statement on the existence or nonexistence of the traditional Judeo-Christian-Islamic God . He invites readers to put their minds and the scientific method to work to test this claim. So religion must be systematically abandoned and eradicated, not completely, just enough to be out of the public and political realm, leaving atheism as king. Its not my pet theory that evolutionists are saying that, its a fact that they are saying that. That is correct. Recent books and movies really are showing it. It always depends however, on what the definition of evolution is in any given week. Umpteen scientific disciplines can be dwarfed by emotion and money, both of which saturate evolutionary study. But not all scientists are evolutionists as you seem to suggest, it only seems that way, because many who don't bow at the altar of evolution suddenly seem to find themselves out of a job, and have a difficult time finding another. Its not necessarily proof that ID is really good science, it indicates that some definitions of evolution are motivated by atheism and deserve the same label of pseudoscience. To label ID as pseudoscience while permitting atheistic/evolution pseudoscience is a double standard. The wealth of evidence comes up short, no matter how hard I try, and the main reason is this; The more laughable (by todays standards) Darwins lack of knowledge of the simplest forms of life becomes / the more details todays science learns about the simplest forms of life becomes, the more glaring the scientific communitys inability to address origins becomes. That means less demonstrable scientific merit for evolution. Theres no way to keep human imperfection out of the equation, when it comes to speculation about origins. It is equal, because of the origins problem that looms larger and larger for evolutionists. You'd have to show me their announcements of bias and conspiratorial intent, before I'd agree that they are as bad as you imply, but I have no question that they admit the possibility of extrapolation of ID for religious purposes far more than atheists admit the possibility of extrapolation of evolution for atheistic purposes. Why? Because Christians have guidelines about lying. They do have beliefs in a higher power that could discipline them for it, in this life or the next. Atheism has no such guidelines, and its obvious that different atheists have a more broad range about the acceptance of lying among themselves. I know there are a few atheists who post here, and some more well known atheists who comment on these things (Michael Ruse for one) who really do take an avoidance of lying seriously. But there are other atheists who make careers of lying. Edward Current, Bill Maher, immediately come to mind.","Peeling","309525","Quite the reverse: you had trouble finding an opponent precisely because you weren't prepared to agree in advance which of the various meanings and usages of the word 'evolution' the debate was about. Nobody was saying the word only had one meaning; they just wanted you to pick one. They said that biological evolution has a simple scientific definition, and they were right. That term is often shortened to simply 'evolution', especially by practicing scientists - just as the word 'grip' is used without confusion on the set of a film, despite it having a different meaning to that employed in other fields. The fundamental problem was this: you wanted to argue your case based on vague popular or layman's usages of the term. But the word evolution is 'popularly' used by creationists to refer to everything up to and including cosmology and the big bang, and among them holds strong connotations of atheism. They're wrong to use the word like that, but they do , which makes it a de facto usage of the term. What you were effectively demanding was that your opponent prove the word evolution has no atheistic connotations to anyone, which is clearly impossible, and utterly irrelevant to the question of whether biological evolution or common descent - the real issue creationists care about - is atheistic or not. Although this superficially sounds like a reasonable argument, it isn't. When archaeologists unearth a curiously shaped object, they have a very clear idea of a) the natural forces at work in the vicinity, and b) the capabilities, motivations and thought-processes of the potential 'designers' they're interested in: humans. If they find a stone arrowhead, for instance, they can recognise the signs of tooling and sharpening, they can recognise a familiar purpose, and simultaneously discount the various known naturalistic processes from having produced it unaided. They are not detecting design, they are detecting the hand and mind of a specific, known designer - in effect, they are positively detecting a particular kind of known naturalistic force (human ingenuity) at work. In the past, false 'design' positives have inspired myths of supernatural or superhuman beings. The Giant's Causeway , for instance, is so anomalously regular as to look designed - until you discover the naturalistic process that produces it. And that's I.D's failure in a nutshell: it's method of 'detecting design' is nothing of the sort. What it 'detects' might be design, but it's much more likely to be 'detecting' lack of knowledge on the part of the person performing the test. If that person doesn't currently know of a naturalistic process that could produce what they're observing, the test will 'detect' design. That's why I.D. is not analogous to archaeology: human activity is a known process and its hallmarks can be identified. I.D claims to be able to positively detect the hallmarks of an entirely arbitrary designer, whose motivations and capabilities are completely unknown - which is logically impossible. If you don't know what this designer could or would do, you can't possibly construct a positive test to detect his activity. I.D. would have detected design in the Giant's Causeway had its real origin not already been known. If you don't know the natural process that produces it, it's trivially easy to frame the problem such that the odds against the formation occurring by chance exceed the 'universal probability bound' - thus design is proved. At which point, I.D declares the case closed: design, therefore designer. I.D. isn't a religion. It's not a science, either, but it's not a religion. It's a PR tool being used by certain religious people, with the publicly avowed intent of injecting Jesus into the scientific mainstream and inducing a sea-change whereby everything in science is interpreted through a scriptural filter. It's similar to parasitism: get inside the body of a healthy host where it's warm and safe. In a way, you're presenting a false dichotomy. Science isn't atheistic by default, just because it's not religious. A doughnut isn't religious; that doesn't make it atheistic either. Science is a methodology for learning about the natural world, and a highly effective one at that. Our evolutionary history is written through this planet like words through a stick of rock - therefore, science can speak to it. What consequences that has for your spiritual beliefs and their underpinnings is not science's fault. marc, the debate is over. We rested our respective cases; I do not intend to rehash the whole thing now so you can work through your 'should have saids'. If anyone is saying that the word evolution - not biological evolution - only has one meaning, point them at a dictionary - or me for that matter - for correction. What, you mean atheists really exist? And they say things? Are they... are they outside, right now? Interestingly, I just read this little snippet in a review: Imagine you are raised by your mother, who tells you your father was a great man who accomplished many things but died not long after you were born. Later on, you try to find out about this great man but can detect no trace or mention of him or his alleged deeds. It looks very much like your mother was having you on. Clearly you did have a father, but the father you thought you had doesn't exist, and never did. He could still, coincidentally, have been a great man and accomplished amazing things, but that doesn't make your mother right; she was just making stuff up. That's one possible perspective: a continued belief in a god but treating the universe itself as his holy book, learning from that rather than the works of men. Another is to ignore Stenger completely and continue to reconcile knowledge with faith as best you can. Heck, if you can accommodate the Trinity you can put up with pretty much anything Personally, I'm content to be an atheist. I think if there is a god, he's far too well hidden for us to detect, and if he wants us to think he doesn't exist, who am I to argue? Was he perhaps wearing a red cardigan when he wrote that? Because I have this pet theory that people with red cardigans are promoting atheism in the public and political realm, and I'd love to have it confirmed as a fact. When I watch the news, and see someone interviewed, I'm always mildly irritated by the little caption they attach: ""Joe Bloggs, smoker""; ""Jane Middlemiss, motorist"" - like these titles somehow define the person. Stenger is a person, who has personally come to certain conclusions by using his brain and the scientific method. I'm quite sure he is convinced by the evidence supporting evolution - so what? So's Jyoshu. His views regarding the detrimental influence of religion are nothing to do with evolution and everything to do with the influence of religion. If religion did nothing but give out free pies on a Friday afternoon, I'm sanguine he wouldn't have a bad thing to say about it. Translation: I have to give these square pegs a taste of the lathe and a good solid whack before they'll slot into the round hole. I really don't think you should be surprised, given the rather tense state of affairs at the moment, that some atheists are standing up and saying ""You know what, I'm sick of sitting quietly and minding my own business while religion hobnail-boots it all over the world whipping otherwise pleasant people into a state of violent hysteria. I'm sick of watching incompetent politicians profess their faith and preening under the adulation that elicits. Just what use is religion? Let's stop treating it as a given that religion is good and noble and worthy, and take a proper look at what it's achieved and the damage it's caused."" Because it works . How much money is pumped into microchip design and production? IBM engineers must be so corrupt; the temptation to lie about quantum theory so they can pretend to offer faster processors must be overwhelming! And don't get me started on the evolutionary algorithms they use - clear evidence of atheist bias and lying. As if evolution could design better microchips! Research based on evolutionary theory is well funded because there's massive potential for return on investment. Who funds ICR? If you're so keen to follow the money, at least do it consistently. I didn't say all scientists accept evolution. I said the vast majority do. Care to substantiate your other allegations? That said, I expect that in some very specific cases a disinclination to apply evolutionary theory would make a person incompatible with a particular role. But the same could be said for almost any stance. If your day-to-day job entails the forensic investigation of crime scenes, a fervent belief in poltergeist activity might impair your effectiveness somewhat At the end of the day, evolutionary theory has proved itself effective, and has opened up a rich vein of scientific enquiry that yields valuable results on a daily basis. Results are important to both businesses and academic institutions. Who do they want to fund and put in charge of equipment and lab space capable of mining that vein? Probably not someone who believes against all available evidence that the vein isn't there. I'd fire someone working in my gold mine if they didn't believe in gold. If they want to spend their time proving gold doesn't exist, they can find some other sucker to pay for it. Pardon? Because scientists say ID is pseudoscience, that indicates that some of evolution is pseudoscience too? If you say I smell bad, does that mean you smell bad too? And there it is in black and off-white: you can't find any fault with common descent or evolution, so you shoehorn in something to which evolution does not speak . Evolution is not about origin of first life. Take it off the table. Now look again. Earliest forms of life: single cells. Then simple agglomerations (sponges), then progressively more specialisation (flatworms), and on and on and on. Evolution. A nested hierarchy of forms and genetics. Atavisms. Vestigial features. The evidence is all right there, yet because we haven't yet reached back three and a half billion years and created an accurate pre-cellular picture (you really ought to check out protocells though) you declare the whole edifice insubstantial. That's like saying we should acquit a murderer because the tens of thousands of pieces of evidence indicating his guilt mean nothing if we can't tell how many cornflakes he had for breakfast. Ok, it's not quite like that. Obviously the origin of life is a fascinating subject and not an insignificant detail. Let me rephrase, then: the murderer commited his crime with a weapon whose origin is indeterminate. So far, nobody has a full picture of how the murderer came by this weapon. Fascinating, intriguing, important even - but irrelevant to the question of whether he commited the crime, for which the evidence is overwhelming. Irrelevant. The same could be said for any scientific discipline (scientists can get passionate about very obscure matters). So long as you forbid treating any hypothesis as sacred, there will always be someone willing to challenge it, either because they're neutral on the topic and feel it hasn't been given proper treatment, or have a different bias. It doesn't matter, because in the end they have to play by the rules: the scientific method. I.D abandons the scientific method. It has produced no useful results and largely refused to take part in the 'trial by fire' peer review process through which all scientific ideas - however oddball they may have seemed at first, like evolution - must pass. Instead, I.D. produces populist 'sciencey' books and goes straight for the classroom jugular. They go for the lay-person and the kids - I know you have your 'agenda' explanation for that, but isn't there a simpler and more straightforward one? One that tallies with I.D's avowed intent? Please, name one branch of science that has debuted in the classroom before ever producing results. Incorrect. See analogy above: it doesn't matter how first life got started because evolution only speaks to subsequent events. I feel a No True Scotsman coming on. Should I even bother to mention Hovind? I'm not going to engage you on this, marc, I'm really not. It won't matter how many Christians I show to be liars, you'll just say they can't be true Christians, because Christians have guidelines about lying - and round and round we go. I could equally say that no true atheist lies, because atheists have stronger inherent moral values - evidenced by their ability to behave themselves despite not believing there's a divine CCTV camera on them 24-7.","creationists-science-modern-world","07:28 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","30"
