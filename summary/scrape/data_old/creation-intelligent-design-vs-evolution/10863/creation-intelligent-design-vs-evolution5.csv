"04-29-2008","10863",5,"marc9000","310119","Id expect them to crash and raid the party of those toasting the Millers at all the atheist celebrations of Tikaalik roseae. Why is it far more likely theyd be wrong? Youre giving me the impression that you have discarded ID only by glancing very quickly at it, without checking on even the very basics of it. And it seems like most of science has done that. Its an imperfect human thing, not an open inquiry thing. As was pointed out in the movie Expelled, many in science want to make it appear like the thinking starts with science, and worldviews (usually atheist) result from it. But reality is that thinking starts with worldviews, and the scientific paths of study result from that. Thats where we have to agree to disagree. Those who represent science arent unbiased enough to say I dont know often enough. They launch into their personal ideology, often in a seamless and unnoticeable fashion. They do, you just dont notice. Here are five that Dembski lists; 1] Lay out reliable criteria for detecting intelligence In his detail of number 4, Dembski states; Intelligent design continues to look for function where nonteleological approaches to evolution attribute clumsiness or incompetence. Hes saying, and it makes perfect sense to me, that ID could continue a path of exploration that Darwinism would abandon. The difference is that intelligent design is only now being tried whereas evolutionary biology has been thoroughly tried and found wanting. Its a new kind of science. To declare that there cant be any, that we already know of all of them, is not open inquiry, and it should be in true science. But as I said, if it cant win in the courts, its a little ridiculous for non-scientist me to try to make a case for it here. But I have to wonder, does it fail in the courts ONLY because of the masterful way evolutionists constantly switch the definition of evolution around? And aggressive, anti religion atheism in its guise as evolution is a rallying point for concerned members of some general societies. How about; Gods record of creation displays a marvelous and clear consistency throughout. From the symphony of the creation week in Genesis to the promise of a new heaven and new earth in Revelation, and all the fulfilled prophesy in between, and characteristics of man today. What consequences that has for your Darwinist beliefs is not my fault, or Gods fault. You do have a lot of confidence in your 150 year old myth, in spite of all its gaps. Your same science and same results do seem to have their ups and downs however. Your gaps have narrowed some in that 150 years, but theyve also widened a lot in those 150 years. (complexity of life, origins) Its part of the dispute.","Peeling","310147","Nice You get the point though: where does 'considering' supernatural intervention or design get you? What do you do next? If it were some hitherto unknown natural force that was being proposed, you could devise tests to confirm your suspicions and explore its parameters. But when considering a supposed miraculous occurrence, there's no reason to believe the event can be recreated, or that variations to the initial conditions would translate into consistent variations on the output. All you can do once you've considered supernatural intervention is decide whether or not is has occurred, and the only tools at your disposal to help make that decision are naturalistic. In short you have to try and make sure that there are no naturalistic explanations. But that's exactly what you would have been doing even if you hadn't considered the supernatural: you'd still be pounding away trying to find naturalistic explanations. What it comes down to, then, is whether we should allow scientists to just decide, based on nothing more than personal preference, to stop looking and declare the case closed in favour of the supernatural. At the moment, we simply say that science doesn't yet have an answer for X - which is the literal truth. Anyone is free to take a chip at it and see if they can uncover something profound. If we alter the methodology as you propose, what authority or degree of certainty do we attach to these arbitrary cries of 'uncle'? How much value should we attach to inferences drawn from them? I can't see what value this change adds to the scientific method. All I can see are downsides, and a vast, vast increase in the potential for personal prejudice to send us down useless lines of enquiry - and no reason to ever end those lines of enquiry, since further miraculous intervention could always be invoked to plug the holes. Extrapolation of past experience. Then I must apologise, for such is not the case. I have devoted considerable time to understanding its claims and arguments, particularly from a mathematical perspective - a field with which I am not unaquainted. And you won't believe me if I demur, based on personal experience? I was brought up in typical Christian fashion, attended sunday school, happily accepted all the stories - I had no reason not to, after all. I didn't go to the trouble of believing them, any more than I went to the trouble of believing there was a table and four chairs in our kitchen; so far as I was concerned, that's simply what had happened. I prayed from time to time, and with complete sincerity. I won't bore you with the full story, but the upshot is that I realised I would rather appreciate what I know and what I don't know, and to what degree of certainty, and I saw no satisfaction to be found in religion. I see ignorance as an opportunity to learn, not convenient shelf-space to fill with imaginings. The shallowness and circularity of religion's supposed answers, the faulty logic and near-constant subliminal message to stop thinking and just believe were very offputting. At no point did I ever want there to be no god. But it became clear that whatever god might be, it wasn't to be found in the warped anthropological mirror of the bible or any other holy book. Emotional crutch, parasitic meme, method of mass control, catalyst of division and violent disagreement, repository of morals both sensible and silly - religion is many things to many people and none of them require the involvement of a real deity. Then how come you notice it? Seriously, though, I don't see that happening. Observer error, maybe, but I've read a lot of scientific papers without coming across it. Which he has thus far failed to do, which makes the rest of his list somewhat moot. That's not borne out by the evidence, however. A hypothesis of non-function is readily testable - excise the relevant material and observe the result. On top of that there are methods for estimating the likely presence of unknown function based on the principles of the Modern Synthesis, eg degree of genetic conservation. I.D's blanket presumption of function is a blunt tool indeed by comparison. Big words, for a man stuck in the starting blocks. By 'found wanting' he is merely reiterating the god of the gaps argument. Whenever we learn something, we inevitably discover there is more to learn about. Thus what we know, and what we know we don't know, both increase as a result of scientific enquiry. That doesn't mean we're getting dumber Science is a methodology. There aren't 'kinds' of it. There are different avenues of investigation, but they all apply the scientific method. That's what 'should be' in true science. Or maybe it's the paper trail linking creationism and I.D, its abandonment of the scientific method, and its enduring fruitlessness. You have to admit, it's at least possible. Aggressive, anti religion atheism, sure - there's certainly a dialogue to be had between the various parties. Maybe those atheists are right - I think it would be premature to give religion a free pass. But you're tilting at windmills with evolution. What, in both conflicting creation myths? See? That's not the same thing I said at all. The authority of a single book does not compare to that of nature itself, and nature speaks of an evolutionary history - a long, long evolutionary history. Burn your books and I'll burn mine, and we'll see whose truth remains invariant in five thousand years That would be 'rigorously tested theory', and it's not the 150 year old version I pay attention to anyway. Do I have confidence that it's perfectly accurate? Of course not; that would be mad. Do I have confidence it's a more accurate explanation than it was ten years ago, and will be more accurate still in another decade? Absolutely. Do I have confidence that common descent is a fact? Again, absolutely. There's a difference between a gap widening and us getting a clearer picture of how wide it always was. The former implies a decrease in knowledge whereas the latter is an increase. And seriously, check out protocells; they're brilliant. Ok *puff puff* I'll try and get to the rest of your posts tomorrow. Take care!","creationists-science-modern-world","12:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","62"
"04-29-2008","10863",5,"Archangel","310126","Danger NO. 1 Misrepresentation of the Nature of God The Bible reveals God to us as our Father in Heaven, who is absolutely perfect (Matthew 5:48), holy (Isaiah 6:3), and omnipotent (Jeremiah 32:17). The Apostle John tells us that God is love, light, and life (1 John 4:16; 1:5; 1:1-2). When this God creates something, His work is described as very good (Genesis 1:31) and perfect (Deuteronomy 32:4). Theistic evolution gives a false representation of the nature of God because death and ghastliness are ascribed to the Creator as principles of creation. (Progressive creationism, likewise, allows for millions of years of death and horror before sin.) Danger NO. 2 God becomes a God of the Gaps The Bible states that God is the Prime Cause of all things. But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by Him (1 Corinthians 8:6). However, in theistic evolution the only workspace allotted to God is that part of nature which evolution cannot explain Danger NO. 3 Denial of Central Biblical Teachings The entire Bible bears witness that we are dealing with a source of truth authored by God (2 Timothy 3:16), with the Old Testament as the indispensable ramp leading to the New Testament, like an access road leads to a motor freeway (John 5:39). The biblical creation account should not be regarded as a myth, a parable, or an Allegory, but as a historical report, because Nowhere in the Bible are there any indications that the creation account should be understood in any other way than as a factual report. The doctrine of theistic evolution undermines this basic way of reading the Bible, as vouched for by Jesus the prophets and the Apostles. Events reported in the Bible are reduced to mythical imagery and an understanding of the message of the Bible as being true in word and meaning is lost. Danger NO. 4 Loss of the Way for Finding God The Bible describes man as being completely ensnared by sin after Adam's fall (Romans 7:18-19). Only those persons who realize that they are sinful and lost will seek the Savior who came to save that which was lost (Luke 19:10). However, evolution knows no sin in the biblical sense of missing one's purpose (in relation to God). Danger NO. 5 The Doctrine of God's Incarnation is Undermined The incarnation of God through His Son Jesus Christ is one of the basic teachings of the Bible. The Bible states that The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us (John 1:14), Christ Jesus was made in the likeness of men (Philippians 2:5-7). Danger NO. 6 The Biblical Basis of Jesus' Work of Redemption Is Mythologized The Bible teaches that the first man's fall into sin was a real event and that this was the direct cause of sin in the world: Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned (Romans 5:12). Theistic evolution does not acknowledge Adam as the first man, nor that he was created directly from the dust of the ground by God (Genesis 2:17). Most theistic evolutionists regard the creation account as being merely a mythical tale, albeit with some spiritual significance. However, the sinner Adam and the Savior Jesus are linked together in the Bible - Romans 5:16-18. Thus any view which mythologizes Adam undermines the biblical basis of Jesus' work of redemption. Danger NO. 7 Loss of Biblical Chronology The Bible provides us with a time-scale for history and this underlies a proper understanding of the Bible. This time-scale includes: The time-scale cannot be extended indefinitely into the past, nor into the future. There is a well-defined beginning in Genesis 1:1, as well as a moment when physical time will end (Matthew 24:14). Danger NO. 8 Loss of Creation Concepts Certain essential creation concepts are taught in the Bible. These include: God created matter without using any available material. God created the earth first, and on the fourth day He added the moon, the solar system, our local galaxy, and all other star systems. This sequence conflicts with all ideas of cosmic evolution, such as the big bang cosmology. Danger NO. 9 Misrepresentation of Reality The Bible carries the seal of truth, and all its pronouncements are authoritative - whether they deal with questions of faith and salvation, daily living, or matters of scientific importance. Danger NO. 10 Missing the Purpose In no other historical book do we find so many and such valuable statements of purpose for man as in the Bible. For example: Man is God's purpose in creation (Genesis 1:27-28). Man is the purpose of God's plan of redemption (Isaiah 53:5). Man is the purpose of the mission of God's Son (1 John 4:9). We are the purpose of God's inheritance (Titus 3:7). Heaven is our destination (1 Peter 1:4). However, the very thought of purposefulness is anathema to evolutionists. Evolutionary adaptations never follow a purposeful program, they thus can not be regarded as teleonomical.5 Thus a belief system such as theistic evolution that marries purposefulness with non-purposefulness is a contradiction in terms.","jyoshu","310148","So? This begs the question. Why is the on-going process of evolution not 'good'? Because species die out? God uses bad events for longer-term greater purposes all the time. The Bible indicates that ""ALL things work together for good to them that love God and are called according to His purpose."" That includes tragedy, and it includes the fact that other species died out and now we're here. At some point, humankind started becoming accountable to God. You just need to get past your narrow view of how God brought human kind as we now know it into existence. The process demonstrated of Adam being created is a figurative way to represent the way humanity came about. This is flat out not true. Just because we can explain how God did something doesn't mean God is not the one behind it. In fact, your assessment is quite the very opposite if the way theistic evolution really is. We attribute other events in nature to God all the time--there's no reason we can't attribute evolution. Truth and literalism are not necessarily the same thing. It can be 'truth' without being a literal account of history in every way. Come on, Archie. Use your 'noggin that God gave you here, a bit. Do you really think the sun went backwards the sky during a battle (as the acct. in the Bible says)? That didn't literally happen. If it had, it would mean the earth suddenly and very quickly reversed its spin, and you can rest assured there would have been earth-wide cataclysmic effects if that had happened. Your approach seems to be to take everything the Bible says literally, and then indicate that it's only Real Truth(TM) if we take that approach. Literalism and truth are not synonymous. Heck, we KNOW some of the accounts in the Bible are figurative because Jesus told figurative stories. Who are you to say Jesus wasn't imparting Truth in his words just because they weren't literal events? You CAN'T 'understand' it that way and remain honest about it. As a story in and of itself, it is self-contradictory. 'Days' before the mechanism for days and nights are in place, in the story. And that self-contradicting nature should be a signal to you that God doesn't necessarily intend you to take it literally. It certainly undermines literalistic reading, yes, but Jesus never said you have to read it literally. That is a falsehood on your part. [Shrug] Jesus Himself used mythical imagery to teach Truth(TM). They were called parables. You're operating on the erroneous premise that using a figurative story to teach a lesson of truth is a bad thing. Only if you use literalism and Truth(TM) interchangeably, which, of course is a bad approach, cause by doing that you say that Jesus' own stories aren't Truth. No, sin is a reality whether there was a literal piece of fruit eaten or not. People do bad things, Archie. The story of the fruit is there to teach us that there is sin, not to teach us literal dogma of how sin came about. The reality of sin doesn't disappear by understanding the Adam and Eve story figuratively. What you are missing is that the figurative story teaches about sin, by using, well ... a figurative story. Just like Jesus taught about the Kingdom of God by using figurative stories (parables). So Jesus came as a man. The process of how God created humankind is a separate issue. How does evolution render these passages you quote ineffective? Be specific and pertinent, please. That's the literal approach, yes. I tend to think it's more reasonable to view the passage as a way to figuratively represent the sinfulness of humankind. You're missing the forest for the trees here. Sure it can. The only way it doesn't work is if you approach the creation event as lasting a real 6 days rather than a long, billions of years process. That's an emphasis you've added to the text. There's nowhere in the text that it says ""Hey, it's crucial for you to emphasize the idea that God creates out of nothing."" There's certainly nothing in the Genesis acct saying that's some central truth that needs to be elevated. But either way, evolution doesn't address the point at which matter and energy come into existence. This is nothing more than an example of begging the question. You say it misrepresents reality; I say it represents reality. You say potayto, I say potahto. Evolution as a process isn't out to answer the question of purpose. It's nothing more than an observable process. It no more misses ""purpose"" observing any other natural process. And I see no reason that evolution contradicts things like ""we are God's purpose in creation"" or ""man is the purpose of the plan of redemption.""","creationists-science-modern-world","12:47 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","63"
"04-30-2008","10863",5,"marc9000","310122","It was early in the debate, and it was before I clarified the definitions problem, something I dont think you expected me to do. Now that weve gotten beyond that in an even more clear way, we can say that when atheists joyously point towards the Catholic church and say see, they believe in evolution when they actually conditionally accept change in allele frequencies over time , not common descent as in no Adam and Eve, no difference between humans and animals, no original sin, no purpose, etc. that they (the atheists) arent being completely honest. I never accused Catholics of lying. To avoid saying something is not lying. The dispute between religion and evolution is more than just a matter of right and wrong. It involves worldviews, the nature of reality and the way members of a society interact with each other. I was interested in discussing the philosophy of evolution, not the mechanics of evolution. Just like the questions for both sides thread started out, before it got messy. And won?? At this place? You know full well that nobody but nooooooobody would have accepted a more specific resolution that I would have had a chance at winning. You dont even look with science, when it comes to some subjects. Love, hate, foundations of morality, etc. Were not robots, we can make our choices. As I said before, its all been written down, and not in a science book. Well, if what I said above is true, (about the worldview coming before the science) the evolutionist is motivated to defend evolutionary because they harmonize with his personal metaphysical or ideological evolutionary views. I understand that evolutionists dont like the word evolutionism, because it shows a relationship between the science they want to pursue, and their worldview. Its probably right. But politically progressive atheists is the right hole for most who oppose ID. Its a hole just as deep as the one occupied by Dembski & Behe. Too many evolutionists dont want to be pigeonholed, they want to be neutral & perfect, and have their brand of neutrality and perfection established in society established in political decisions. Again, you dont show enough open inquiry about ID. I'd like for you to address the claim that ID could explore scientific paths that evolution may abandon. Are you being slippery? You said his (Stengers) views regarding the detrimental influence of religion are nothing to do with evolution and everything to do with the influence of religion, as if evolution wasnt a weapon. I was referring to Stenger in a general way,","Peeling","310195","Obviously, anyone who tries to portray the Catholic church's position as indistinguishable from that of atheists is barking up the wrong tree; no argument there. But who exactly is doing that? Certainly I never have. Nor is the Church's position on evolution what you claim it to be. Worth a read: reconciliation of polygenism (multiple first humans) with Adam and Eve, standing firm on the origin of the soul while explicitly accepting hominid evolution from lower forms, explicit criticism of I.D as non-science. These are thoughtful and dedicated theologians convinced by their study of the evidence - is it really appropriate for you to hand-wave away their pronouncements? You accused them of dissembling, of appeasment, effectively betraying their faith for the sake of a quiet life. If that doesn't strictly constitute 'lying', it's certainly no better. I understand completely. The problem we have in engaging in such a discussion is that you seem locked into a belief that evolution is a product of a philosophy rather than a methodology. This prevents us amicably exploring the ways in which evolution can be co-opted by certain philosophies and accommodated into others, and how those philosophies interact in the wider world. So you were keeping things vague to give your opponent a chance? Nice of you Why not? The foundations of morality are a fascinating topic. Studies show that the world over, within all communities, exists more or less the same distribution of moral compasses. Religion overlays some tribalistic 'club rules' - war paint to aid identification of like by like, ritual bonding etc - but in terms of moral influence essentially just shuffles other people into the different mental categories to which our innate morals already apply. A peaceful, inclusive religion encourages believers to treat everyone as a friend and neighbour - others might foster a degree of aloofness. Well, I went down that path with Easyrider once: the innate incompatibility between freedom of choice and prophecy. Something for another time, perhaps. And if it isn't true? What if evolution is simply the product of a naturalistic methodology, not a philosophy? I don't know where you're getting your numbers - do you? I.D - or rather its undeserved insertion into the science classroom is broadly opposed by scientists of all faiths, on entirely logical, rational grounds. I believe I've done this now, in an earlier post. Um, no... we were discussing Stenger, as you freely admit: Which, by the way, is a non-sequitur. Evolution may be wielded however he likes - it doesn't make evolution responsible for his views regarding the detrimental influence of religion, which was the substance of my reply. My reply concerned Stenger's statements. If you don't believe they - and thus my reply - speak to the bigger picture, why post them? Now that I've caught up, I think we need to take a moment to regroup and focus. Based on everything that's been said, here's how I see our respective positions: You proceed from the assumption that evolution is a product of a particular 'worldview', specifically an atheist worldview. You've said as much several times, how 'the reality is' that worldview always comes first. Based on that assumption, you reason that 'evolution' must attempt to speak to origins, since atheism requires a naturalistic origin of life. Possibly you reason that since evolution is the product of atheism, its very foundation must be the naturalistic origin of life. You then observe that abiogenesis is very much in its infancy as a branch of science, and conclude that evolution is a sham: its most vital component is missing and therefore the whole glittering edifice is really nothing more than conjecture and wishful thinking. And from that you reason that its prominence in science cannot be based upon merit but instead be the result of an aggressive socio/political atheist agenda. Have I got that about right? Ok. While the reasoning you've applied to get from A to B is fine, your foundational assumption has led you astray - garbage in, garbage out. And because you refuse to question that assumption, you'll accept whatever outlandish or improbable conclusions you reach because you can't see any fault in the logic by which you arrived at them. Now let me show you a different picture, and you tell me if it fits the facts. Evolution (both the inference of common descent and evolutionary theory) is a product of methodological naturalism, the same tool willingly employed by all scientists, everywhere, of all faiths. It is the only tool we have which allows us to judge the confidence level of statements about the natural world - indeed, it is the tool one is logically compelled to use when you make that ability your primary requirement. It should not be confused with philosophical naturalism, which is a worldview. Like all widely accepted scientific discoveries evolution has weathered intense critical scrutiny, and won out on merit. Far from being a glittering abstract edifice, it is a well-worn tool employed every day by thousands of scientists. Modern biological science simply would not work if it were false. Despite its vulnerability to falsification, thanks to the sweeping predictions it makes about findings in genetics and paleontology, it remains evidentially uncontested. Evolution is not an extrapolation forward from a specific 'origin' of life, rather it is an extrapolation backward through history, informed by data from diverse scientific disciplines. The inevitable difficulty in constructing a firm picture of first life so very far after the fact does not undermine the value of its conclusions about more recent (relatively speaking) natural history. Common descent contradicts literal biblical creationism on a number of levels, from the timescales involved to the evolutionary history of humans (although it should be noted that genetics, all by itself, disproves the notion of a single couple ancestral to us all anyway). For this reason, the established fact of common descent is used by those critical of religion to undermine the foundation of infallible authority claimed by the bible (although again, it should be noted that it is far from the only fact thus employed). At the same time, several faiths have used it to inform their own interpretation of the bible. A small but vocal minority of religious believers are content neither to accommodate common descent in their beliefs nor ignore it in favour of concentrating on the spiritual, but have instead embarked upon a well-documented, tireless and progressively more sophisticated 'hearts and minds' campaign, applying political pressure to enforce the replacement of science with a theological system under which all discoveries must be filtered, reinterpreted or discarded according to their congruence with scripture. We must not be allowed to draw conclusions from our observation of the natural world if they are not in accordance with their beliefs. Initially - and somewhat clumsily - presented as Creationism or Scientific Creationism, the movement's 'wedge' was given a keener leading edge with the invention of 'Intelligent Design', a slick and well-funded operation intended to give Creationism a gloss of scientific respectability. By disavowing creationism (in public at least), presenting fallacious arguments at a level of complexity beyond the layman's ability to critically analyze, and endlessly restating the falsehood that evolution is 'a theory in crisis'* an illusion is created of genuine, widespread scientific disagreement, enabling the next stage: Teach the Controversy. To the only audience the I.D. movement cares about (ie, the general public), the scientific arguments for and against I.D are sufficiently rarified as to appear equally valid - thus the appeal to fair play and equal treatment of competing ideas is highly effective. However, the same has so far not held true in the courtroom, where I.D must live or die on its demonstrable merits rather than emotional appeal. Now, out of these two pictures, which one allows us to take the greatest number of people at their word? By that I mean people describing their own motivations and their own reasoning, rather than the motives they ascribe to others (which may not be a lie, merely wrong). In your version of events, only Creationists are being honest. Everyone else - theistic evolutionists, scientists, the Catholic church - all of them must either be lying or betraying their own principles. In my version of events, everyone is telling the truth about themselves . Creationists and the proponents of I.D. are being honest when they say their faith is the motivation for their work, and when they talk about their wedge strategy, its methods and goals. Scientists are being honest when they describe evolution as the product of methodological naturalism, when they say they are convinced by the evidence rather than prejudice. Judges are being honest when they throw ID's claims to scientific credentials out of court, and so on. A vast con - excuse me agenda of lies, or a few people simply being mistaken? Take your pick. * The same falsehood has been propounded for over a hundred years now, while evolutionary theory has gone from strength to strength in both explanatory and predictive power. I do not call it a lie because it need not be one - it is repeated with innocent conviction and likely arose from equally innocent conviction.","creationists-science-modern-world","11:08 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","64"
"05-04-2008","10863",5,"Peeling","310136","You're right, of course - I'm projecting my reaction to being called an evolutionist onto others. And you're right about the term 'creationist' being equally lacking in specificity - as much a problem for you as for me, given that you actually want the creationist label to apply to you. Which puts us in the slightly awkward position of not being able to call anyone anything That given, I'd say the same thing to marc but in a different way: Marc, whenever someone voices concern about religion, the first thing you seem to do is check whether that person also accepts evolutionary theory. From this correlation you fallaciously assume causation. Unless you can positively link evolutionary theory with the concerns voiced, you have no grounds for slotting the speaker into your 'evolutionary atheist agenda'. When I talk about Behe, Dembski and Hovind, I do not label them as 'creationists' (poor term thought it may be) lightly. All three have publicly declared their motivations, and I.D itself can readily be linked to biblical creationism via an explicit paper trail.","marc9000","310383","I think I usually can positively make that link, the evidence is seldom hard to see. Dont you notice that it happens the other way also, that when someone voices concern about evolution, many posters here quickly check to see if that person is a Christian? The fallacious assumptions go both ways. Since evolutionists are in the drivers seat concerning education, their fallacious assumptions are shouted much louder. The movie Expelled made it clear. In the same way that Dawkins, Myers, and Provine have declared their motivations? If the personal beliefs of Behe etc make ID what it is, why is it that the personal beliefs of Dawkins etc are just their personal opinion and have nothing to do with evolution? Is it because evolution has been around 150 years vs ID's only 30 or so? (that's not a sarcastic question) I'm guessing that you're going to say yes, that the 150 vs 30 years is important. Something to explore a little further, I'd say. But you're also going to say that when present day evolutionists write books saying How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist it just means the specific Judeo Christian God, not the many other possibilities of other gods. Its almost like Ben Stein reads at 4forums, because towards the end of the expelled movie, he was calmly asking Dawkins questions. (with Dawkins squirming and flashing three shades of crimson the whole time. ) Stein; Do you believe in ANY god whatsoever? Dawkins; NO, I DONT KNOW WHY YOU ASK ME SUCH A QUESTION, IT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS THAT I DONT BELIEVE IN ANY GOD AT ALL. (not a direct quote, just my paraphrase from memory) Its a switcharoo, just like evolution definitions. They rail against all religion with evolution, then when cornered, drop back to a more specific definition of just who God is.","creationists-science-modern-world","02:51 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","65"
"05-04-2008","10863",5,"Peeling","310138","I'm not sure what you mean by this. Surely the point of an attempt to objectively debunk religion's alleged value is that it be objective, cite facts, perform studies, apply the scientific method, rather than merely making philosophical pronouncements. For instance, the study that showed the almost global invariance of moral values regardless of religion, and also showed that children were far less likely to tolerate or approve of an <insert holy book here> description of atrocity if it was stripped of its 'holy' hallmarks - isn't that relevant information? Can I broaden the topic to include the rest of the Modern Synthesis, or must I talk only about applications involving RM and NS? If the latter, it's very likely parts of the computer you're using to read this were developed using RM/NS principles derived from observations of nature. When a problem is too complex to solve by design, we turn to evolutionary processes. In terms of increasing our scientific knowledge about our own natural history, and robustly confirming our theories of common descent, it was a triumph. The solid kicking it gave YEC is a triumph for science over pseudoscience, not atheism over religion. It's worth making the effort to appreciate that distinction: that creationism/ID (apologies to jyoshu but I haven't had time to come up with an alternative term) is neither religion nor science, but a deceitful PR exercise whose failures should be celebrated by science and religion alike. Why would I need to be an atheist specifically, and in what possible scenario would firing someone be on the cards? Most puzzling of all, though, is your utter disregard for the significance of the finding of Tiktaalik. It seems that to you, it's all about whether the decision to look for it was biased in some way, and who its discovery pleased most - what earthly relevance does that have to the find itself? It was a huge vindication of evolutionary theory, period. Absolutely. But it doesn't make them automatically right , which seemed to be your implication. Anyway, I'm happy to agree that all science is and must be open to challenge, so if that's all you meant to say, we can leave it at that. That depends where you look Depending upon the audience, its advocates can be quite candid on the subject. However, that's only relevant to establishing the political/religious underpinnings of the movement, not to its status as bad science. Ironically enough, their careful omission of any specification of a designer is one thing that prevents it from being favourably compared to sciences like archaeology, as we've already discussed. In principle, certainly - nothing should ever be held inviolate. In practice, however, a truly immense volume of evidence has accumulated in favour of - say - common descent, evidence that is routinely confirmed and reconfirmed on a daily basis by scientists applying the theory in their day-to-day work. In the judgement of pretty much all professionals in the field, the widespread and continual application of the theory is sufficient safeguard against undetected errors. Let me be clear: I'm not saying it must be true just because it's popular. Imagine you build a machine, and you test it and test it and test it and it passes every test, and then you sell millions of them and they get used every day without failing - which is the more stringent test? Clearly the latter, yes? Ask any massively multiplayer game developer. So it is with common descent and evolutionary theory. They were not formulated and then put on a pedestal to be admired, they were formulated, tested, and put to work, and that day-to-day application is far more likely to expose any inherent weakness than further bouts of 'testing'. I agree it's hard to find the appropriate analogy - so try this one instead: imagine I'm a member of some remote tribe living at the south pole, totally cut off from civilisation. One day I encounter a modern SUV out in the snowfields. My utter incomprehension as to its nature, purpose or origin, or that such a concept as a 'factory' even exists, would not prevent me from observing the tracks it left and surmising that it came from over there. Evolution is the journey life has been on; we've followed the tracks in the snow. Maybe we'll one day find the factory; maybe the tracks will become too faint. Doesn't matter: the evidence of the journey itself is incontrovertible. So they have to be lying in order for you to be right? Seems to happen a lot, that Behe's work on irreducible complexity is fundamentally flawed because it ignores proven evolutionary pathways by which IC mechanisms can form. You can download simulations of just such processes - I'll look them up for you when I get a chance. These simulations apply mutation and selection, always favouring the fittest, and flag up when IC solutions arise. How does it work? In essence, an increasingly complex solution evolves stepwise, and then evolves - again, stepwise - into a simpler and ultimately IC form. Picture a ball in a bucket, hanging somewhere high up. Behe argues that since the bottom of the bucket is solid, the ball could not have originated lower down and moved up into it, but must have been created where it is now... For which there are two explanations: either it's not, in fact, good science, or there's a conspiracy to suppress it which includes the judiciary. I can try and nudge you in the more plausible direction, but I can't force you. The appeal to 'fair play' is hard to ignore, isn't it? But the fact remains, evolution achieved its dual status of fact and theory through sheer hard graft and rigorous, punishing testing and peer review. Not lightly or whimsically is it foisted upon schoolchildren. I.D. wants to circumvent all that, avoid doing good science or producing results, yet claim equal scientific status. I.D is welcome in a religious or philosophical class - that is its place. It is no more appropriate for the science classroom than it is for the gym - it's simply not earned its place there. What's unexplored about the 'path' that says 'god did it'? I just explored the sum total of it in three words, and what did we learn? Why don't we ask the more interesting question how did god do it, and look for evidence to support our hypotheses? See, it's not about whether god exists or was involved, what you don't like is what science has to say about how it happened. It's not your christianity or conservatism that makes you vulnerable to fallacious reasoning. Fallacies are nothing more nor less than logical errors in reasoning or argument. And Hitler's frequent Christian exhortations in his speeches, his leveraging of religious fervour to incite his people, and the long-established concept of a 'favoured people' throughout the bible are just irrelevant details? It's an interesting topic; I'd love to discuss it in depth sometime. Rest assured, the fallacy to which you refer is not how such discussions end, it is how spurious and hysterical connections with Hitler in an effort to smear an opponent are dealt with. Why? It's still a logical fallacy, because evolution does not prohibit the existence of a god.","marc9000","310389","That inspires me to ask a question; Could it be that religion was requested (taunted) to apply the scientific method by atheistic scientists a few decades ago, and that ID was the result that we have atheists to thank for ID? The Lord does move in mysterious ways? Who did that study? I think a quick look at the news once a week would show a pretty clear variance in moral values around the world, always according to different religions, or lack of it. Whatever invariance is actually found, could probably be attributed to the fact that everyone was actually created by the same God. Pretty vague, seems to me you could name something specific. There is a difference between observations of nature and anti-Biblical evolution. Again, were not the taunts from evolutionists/atheists for religion to come up with something concerning their beloved scientific method one of the main inspirations for ID? Then when religion (beautifully) met that demand, it is called a deceitful PR exercise? I think the Tiktaalik discovery, and the irreducibly complex mousetrap thinking process of Behe, were both worthy of equal analyzation. If not equal, maybe roughly equal? Was there any similarity in the ways they were analyzed? Lets see, Tiktaalik was given a FREE PASS, the IC mousetrap thinking process was viciously attacked and shouted down. Not much similarity was there? One was one simple, one time historical claim by one small group with credentials or motives that no one seemed interested in checking or exploring, and one was a thinking process that anyone could apply, even though it inspired its originator to be personally attacked. Makes one think a little harder about applications of science vs pseudoscience. If the decision to look, the personal lives of the discoverers, and the find itself was ripped into like Behe was ripped into, Id bet a lot that it would have about as much significance as Piltdown man does by now. Id like to see examples of day-to-day application of common descent, what products and services it provides. And what products and services it provides now that would be blocked from being produced if we introduced future generations to ID studies. An excellent analogy! The evolutionist ONLY keeps trying to find out how it fell together from the rocks in that mountain over there, while the IDist checks it out for specified complexity and design! Only one slight fault with your analogy, the modern SUV is a mere tinker toy compared to the complexity of the human body. Thats a biggie that goes both ways. A lot of Christians would like to go to church on Sundays, maybe see the occasional 10 Commandments display during the week, and see traditional Christian morals applied to some things political. Without fights with evolutionists! Its often not Christians who are picking the fights, it seems that Christians often have to be wrong for evolution to be right. What leads me towards the conspiracy, is the manner that determined it was not good science. It was not determined by a result of a scientific method, it wasnt approached in a neutral way, it was approached in an emotional, knee jerk way. A case against it was built from a predetermined conclusion . As time went by, it was made to look convincing, as we see by what you are saying. Some of the first criticisms of it at the beginning of it were pretty funny. (its not irreducibly complex it doesnt need all of its parts it doesnt need the base you can put it on the floor) hahahaha Youre worse about conspiracies than I am. What evidence do you see that ID wants to circumvent anything? If ID gets the scientific status it seeks, why would evolutionary studies be restricted in any way? They could go forward the same way they do now, if they are as correct and non controversial as you say. I.D. would be an addition, not a replacement. Atheism hasnt earned its place there either. In a perfect world, neither would be there. But one IS. So if one is, both should be, if the members of a free society that is involved say so. Part of looking for the ""how"" should consist of more than just ""random"" and ""natural"". Design can be scientific. Do you think the fallacy of argument by personal charm that I linked was phony? No, but that doesnt end the debate. There is more to be said about it, one side shouldnt be permitted to proclaim that the other side makes a logical error, therefore its a fallacy end of debate. Like spurious and hysterical connections with Christianity? I'd like to discuss it in depth sometime too, but I'm getting a terrible urge to give my brain a rest from all this stuff during the summer of 08. I know, as long as it's a politically insignificant god.","creationists-science-modern-world","03:52 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","66"
"05-04-2008","10863",5,"Peeling","310147","Nice You get the point though: where does 'considering' supernatural intervention or design get you? What do you do next? If it were some hitherto unknown natural force that was being proposed, you could devise tests to confirm your suspicions and explore its parameters. But when considering a supposed miraculous occurrence, there's no reason to believe the event can be recreated, or that variations to the initial conditions would translate into consistent variations on the output. All you can do once you've considered supernatural intervention is decide whether or not is has occurred, and the only tools at your disposal to help make that decision are naturalistic. In short you have to try and make sure that there are no naturalistic explanations. But that's exactly what you would have been doing even if you hadn't considered the supernatural: you'd still be pounding away trying to find naturalistic explanations. What it comes down to, then, is whether we should allow scientists to just decide, based on nothing more than personal preference, to stop looking and declare the case closed in favour of the supernatural. At the moment, we simply say that science doesn't yet have an answer for X - which is the literal truth. Anyone is free to take a chip at it and see if they can uncover something profound. If we alter the methodology as you propose, what authority or degree of certainty do we attach to these arbitrary cries of 'uncle'? How much value should we attach to inferences drawn from them? I can't see what value this change adds to the scientific method. All I can see are downsides, and a vast, vast increase in the potential for personal prejudice to send us down useless lines of enquiry - and no reason to ever end those lines of enquiry, since further miraculous intervention could always be invoked to plug the holes. Then I must apologise, for such is not the case. I have devoted considerable time to understanding its claims and arguments, particularly from a mathematical perspective - a field with which I am not unaquainted. And you won't believe me if I demur, based on personal experience? I was brought up in typical Christian fashion, attended sunday school, happily accepted all the stories - I had no reason not to, after all. I didn't go to the trouble of believing them, any more than I went to the trouble of believing there was a table and four chairs in our kitchen; so far as I was concerned, that's simply what had happened. I prayed from time to time, and with complete sincerity. I won't bore you with the full story, but the upshot is that I realised I would rather appreciate what I know and what I don't know, and to what degree of certainty, and I saw no satisfaction to be found in religion. I see ignorance as an opportunity to learn, not convenient shelf-space to fill with imaginings. The shallowness and circularity of religion's supposed answers, the faulty logic and near-constant subliminal message to stop thinking and just believe were very offputting. At no point did I ever want there to be no god. But it became clear that whatever god might be, it wasn't to be found in the warped anthropological mirror of the bible or any other holy book. Emotional crutch, parasitic meme, method of mass control, catalyst of division and violent disagreement, repository of morals both sensible and silly - religion is many things to many people and none of them require the involvement of a real deity. Which he has thus far failed to do, which makes the rest of his list somewhat moot. That's not borne out by the evidence, however. A hypothesis of non-function is readily testable - excise the relevant material and observe the result. On top of that there are methods for estimating the likely presence of unknown function based on the principles of the Modern Synthesis, eg degree of genetic conservation. I.D's blanket presumption of function is a blunt tool indeed by comparison. Big words, for a man stuck in the starting blocks. By 'found wanting' he is merely reiterating the god of the gaps argument. Whenever we learn something, we inevitably discover there is more to learn about. Thus what we know, and what we know we don't know, both increase as a result of scientific enquiry. That doesn't mean we're getting dumber Science is a methodology. There aren't 'kinds' of it. There are different avenues of investigation, but they all apply the scientific method. That's what 'should be' in true science. Or maybe it's the paper trail linking creationism and I.D, its abandonment of the scientific method, and its enduring fruitlessness. You have to admit, it's at least possible. Aggressive, anti religion atheism, sure - there's certainly a dialogue to be had between the various parties. Maybe those atheists are right - I think it would be premature to give religion a free pass. But you're tilting at windmills with evolution. What, in both conflicting creation myths? See? That's not the same thing I said at all. The authority of a single book does not compare to that of nature itself, and nature speaks of an evolutionary history - a long, long evolutionary history. Burn your books and I'll burn mine, and we'll see whose truth remains invariant in five thousand years That would be 'rigorously tested theory', and it's not the 150 year old version I pay attention to anyway. Do I have confidence that it's perfectly accurate? Of course not; that would be mad. Do I have confidence it's a more accurate explanation than it was ten years ago, and will be more accurate still in another decade? Absolutely. Do I have confidence that common descent is a fact? Again, absolutely. There's a difference between a gap widening and us getting a clearer picture of how wide it always was. The former implies a decrease in knowledge whereas the latter is an increase. And seriously, check out protocells; they're brilliant. Ok *puff puff* I'll try and get to the rest of your posts tomorrow. Take care!","marc9000","310399","I dont really propose that we alter the methodology, but that we extend it. Cries of uncle come from both sides it is evolutionists who claim that evolution does not address origins. We dont have personal prejudice sending us down useless lines of enquiry now? With books titled How science shows that God does not exist? That's interesting, you'll see many evolutionists attack Dembski because he's not a biologist, he's a mathematician. (UPB?) Seems like mathematics can be used for or against ID. Your story is not unlike that of Francis Crick and Im sure, millions of other people all around the world. The reverse has also happened, though Im sure to a much lesser extent. When you refer to the shallowness and circularity, Im sure those who have experienced it in the reverse do the same thing you do. I think you may see shallowness and circularity in the presentation of religion to you by imperfect humans, not shallowness and circularity in Christianity itself. In the same way, those who have experienced the reverse, those who grew up without a Christian upbringing and became Christian, may have seen shallowness and circularity not in science itself, but in those imperfect humans (some scientists) who have presented it to them. Only if your worldview causes you to quickly rule out his two main points, one positive and one negative, the positive one is the criterion of specified complexity, and the negative one is the complete failure of naturalistic attempts to explain certain types of biological complexity. Cries of uncle, or give atheists more time, isnt acceptable to everyone. Id like to see a debate on that, between someone like Behe and Dawkins. I get the idea that most evolutionists would not like to see that debate. 150 years to 30 years? Is it really that significant? And its a good argument, despite the clanging of the oh-so-subjective fallacy bell. I agree, then what is wrong with saying that we have learned so much from biology, and therefore we have much more to learn about, including the possibility of intelligent design? Well then, ID is a new avenue of science. Sure, its possible. But the paper trail linking atheism and evolution, with an equal abandonment of some scientific avenues is equally possible, and can be a serious problem. And maybe religious people are right, maybe the recent spate of anti religion books by respected scientists show that weve been premature to give evolution a free pass. Maybe it's clear that not all atheists agree with you, that there is no dialog to be had. Therefore it's necessary to sometimes discriminate against religion in academia, as the movie Expelled clearly showed. That's another debate, they don't conflict. Youve got that 150 year to 30 year head start, a burning of the books and an equal start for both may not turn out as well for you as you might think. I think Darwins facts and musings would look a lot different if hed have known about the biological complexity that we know about today. Your opinions are noted. I will check out your protocells when I get time. I don't have much more time today, and am just about done till next weekend.
