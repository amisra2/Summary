"02-06-2009","12214",8,"Matthew","342838","But one very important thing you are missing is that organisms and their numbers change because their genes (and their numbers) change! And another important thing you're missing is... ...that these changes in gene frequencies across whole populations do not change by ""chance!"" That's the entire point of natural selection. You keep leaving this part out, which is the only reason you can characterize this is a contrast between chance or teleology. More than half actually, since ""genetic mutation"" is merely a subset of genetic variation, and since genetic variation need not be ""random"" in order for natural selection to occur. Give me a break. If that's so, then all use of technical language -- a phenomenon in which we philosophers have been known to indulge from time to time -- would be ""dishonest."" Plato, for example, would never have been to use ""eidos"" or ""morphe"" as terms in his own metaphysics. And the conventions of use don't necessarily pre-exist the terms, which is how neologism happens. ""Ignoring it"" hardly indicates that you're correct to think that paradigm ""vacuous."" All it proves is that you have no interest in even trying to understand it. Second, you did not initially say ""Aristotle."" You said ""an Aristotelian tradition ."" I therefore assumed that you were including various Aristotelian thinkers other than Aristotle himself -- including, rather pertinently, medieval theologians who explained all natural phenomena with reference to God's purposes. (Not, of course, to those purposes alone, but they were conceived to be a necessary portion of the explanations of natural phenomena.) But third, as to Aristotle himself anyway, I guess I had in mind the opening of Physics IV.8 (214b14): ""If each of the simple bodies has a natural locomotion, e.g. fire upward and earth downward and towards the middle of the universe...."" Now, while it might be thought that I am construing the ""naturalness"" of said locomotion in too teleological and purposive terms, there are more than ample reasons for thinking not. See for example Physics II.8 (198b10): ""We must explain then first why nature belongs to the class of causes which act for the sake of something...."" Or see the discussion of weather that follows, the point of which is made by 199a1-8 or so: ""We do not ascribe to chance or mere coincicence the frequency of rain in winter, but frequent rain in summer we do; nor heat in summer but only if we have it in winter. If then, it is agreed that things are either the result of coincidence or for the sake of something, and these cannot be the result of coincidence or spontaneity, it follows that they must be for the sake of something; and that such things are all due to nature even the champions of the theory which is before us [viz., a rejection of teleology] would agree. Therefore action for an end is present in things which come to be and are by nature."" As to the specifics, I doubt very strongly that Aristotle imputes volition or any other mental activity to the weather. Nonetheless, he finds meteorological (or perhaps climatological) phenomena to have final causes. For as to the general point, he finds everything in nature to have final causes. All the monotheists (Judaic, Christian, and Islamic) in his ""tradition of causation"" had to do was attribute the purposes of inanimate natural objects to the mind of God. (Or was that ""the psyche?""... ) Further discussion of the point would be off-topic here, though we could take it to the philosophy section if you like. But somehow I doubt we're going to find too much to disagree about concerning whether Aristotle thought there was purpose in nature.","jakers","342969","If an organisms genes and genone changes, then it is necessary to so that that organism has changed. So, they change because they change because they change because they change? You think not? Anything whose root cause is random, is random. Environmental events caused by climate change, earthquake, or whatever, are random. Ergo, any change in the populations of organisms affected by such random events are rabndom statistical fluctuations. AKA, ""NS"", ""Fitness"", etc. I have never ""left this part out"". This is interesting. How and when and why, in your book, is genetic variation not random, but mechanically determined? Not True. Aside from the fact that ontological metaphysics is categorically different, in its examination of abstractions, from science/biology [in its examination of corporeal entities], the words Plato chose did not radically diiffer from Greek usage of his time, and were therefore non-equivocal. I have never said otherwise. It is not the expansion and growth of language and vocabulary that I have objected to all along, even though you choose to think so. My objection is to a band of self-righteous true-believing materialists who have taken upon themselves the exclusive right to re-interpret standard English words and images in such a way that their equivocations make their philosophy easier for the general public to swallow when it comes to anything connected to biology,-- most importantly, to the differences between living and non-living things. No. What it means is, that short of returning to university and picking up a Ph.D. in molecular chemistry, I have spent many years thinking about it and reading about it, and after believing in it for most of my life, I was and am finally convinced, entirely convinced, that it is absurd. I think that you are semantically nit-picking, since I was clearly talking Aristotle's four kinds of causation, and not debating the existence of God. As an aside, if a creator god exists, then all things created necessarily exist to his/her/its purposes. If not, then not, but that another topic altogether. Big difference between smoke having a tendency to rise and smoke wanting, needing, and forcing itself to rise. Or at least, that's how I see it. In this case, a discussion of regularity, repetition, i.e., mechanics, is under discussion. That is, what is the nature of mechanical things, and how do they differ from random, accidental, spontaneous, coincidental things. No. He does not. He finds that they have final outcomes,[an action for an end], not final causes [a motivation to act in order to achieve an end]. It doesn't matter. Once you step beyond the limits of empirical science and into the abstract world of metaphysics, it is only rational to assume that any created thing was created for a purpose, rather than by accident. The trick is to not do what the materialists/positivists do, namely, assume that everything, including physical laws, were created by accident, and then assume that, ipso facto, everything else that follows is purely accidental. AKA, absurd. Moving away from this forum might be a good idea. Aside from you, Peeling, and Ian, I seem to have drawn a great deal of bile, bitterness, and insulting tone and language from far too many other participants. Id not need #### from strangers, so I no longer read their garbage. But it is getting so common that I have very seriously considered leaving this forum to its own devices. This is no fun. I'll take a look at Peeling's last and decide whether or not to post further.","intelligent-designs-black-box","08:16 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","106"

"02-06-2009","12214",8,"Peeling","342955","So, what is the real nature of this 'dependable, predictable regularity' of which you speak? It is the dependability of a die showing a six if it rolls a thousand times. It is the predictability of being dealt an ace if you play a thousand hands. It is the statistical inevitability of a low-probability event occurring, given a number of opportunities that dwarfs its improbability. What you call a plain statement of fact is nothing of the sort. There is a small but finite chance of any given single-step mutation occurring to any given bacterium during, for instance, cell division - a chance which can be increased via environmental mutagens, be they chemicals or UV light. In even modest colonies those tiny odds are overwhelmed by the number of opportunities for those mutations to occur, and from that arises the 'dependability' of there being at least one mutant of type 'X' already in the population when the environment changes in its favour. If the colony is very small, the outcome is far less dependable. There's nothing irrational about this, it's not a 'just so' story, you can't hand-wave it away. It's proof of nothing of the sort. The events are stochastic, while the outcome is statistically predictable because of the number of opportunities for the event to occur. This is just basic maths. The L&D experiment takes it a step further, settling the question of whether the events occur before or after the environmental change.","jakers","343027","That's not the probability and dependability I'm talking about.

Teleological is probably a molecular chemist, and I am no scientist at all, just an amateur philosopher, but what I can grasp from his material greatly strengthens and fortifies my conviction that evolution is no accident, but is very intelligent, purposeful, systematic, and productive. In short, is intelligently designed. Here is one of Teleological's links that quite intrigued me-- Model unravels rules that govern how genes are switched on and off I wonder what this says about the Luria-Delbruck thing?","intelligent-designs-black-box","07:06 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","115"

"02-11-2009","12214",8,"jakers","343107","(individual bacteria aren't 'resistant' or 'not' to antibiotic chemicals.) Not true . Individual bacteria cells, when confronted with a phage, antibiotic, bactericide, whatever, have 2 choices--live or die. <section moved for coherency> Tolerance levels do not apply to individual cells [as above]. My answer--and intrinsic ability within large groups of interdepent and cooperative bacterial cells to work together so that a/in the case of long-standing threats, set up a constantly ongoing defence mechanism against such repeated historical attacks, and b/ in the case of truly novel and original threats, experiment together using feed-back [intelligent] mechanisms until such time as new cells are developed that can survive the novel antibiotic, And as for novel antiobiotics, any new antibiotics that are test and found to have a pre-existing 'tolerance' never see the market. Why would they, since they are already ineffectual? So that statement is not true either. (bacteria exhibit variable tolerance to antibiotics) This is only an assumption, on your part. There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever to suggest that when any given population of cells is completly and totally and simultaneously exposed to a novel bactericide that neither they nor their ancestors have ever had any chance to deal with, if that novel bactericide is effective, and if all cells are simultaneously exposed to it, then each and every and all cells die. Fact. I don't like taking the blame for the 'expert's' ignorance of just how bacteria truly operate. (L&D experiment) If your assumption [that in 24 hours or less, a fortuitous gamma ray or horde of gamma rays, x-rays, whatever, is going to arrive and smack just the right gene in at at least one, maybe several individual cells at just the very propr time that their cell division will marvellously produce the very enzyme needed at that very moment] were true, then either a/ all cells would be unlucky, and die, or b/ several cells would ALWAYS be lucky and live.","Peeling","343692","I don't know where you got that idea but it's simply wrong. Any given bacterium will tolerate one concentration of an antibiotic in its environment, but not a higher concentration. This empirical fact is routinely used as the basis for experimentation and determining appropriate dosage. And how are they going to do that if they're all dead? You just claimed encountering the antibiotic was an all-or-nothing deal: how exactly are a bunch of dead bacteria going to intelligently develop anything? This is such a bizarre conversation! Regardless of how stupid you think the idea, every single antibiotic ever released on the market is and has always been ineffectual if administered at too low a concentration, because bacteria tolerate low concentrations. This is a fact; you will just have to deal with it as best you can. The empirical 'fact' is that different concentrations of any antibiotic - even novel ones under development - kill different fractions of any given bacterial population. It's just true. If that causes you problems, I'm sorry. ... There's really no answer to that I suggest you take it up with the drug companies, and explain to them how they've been getting it wrong all these years. Well, the enzyme (or whatever) need not be required upon the instant of its creation; the gene just needs to be in the population when the environment changes. And the statistical results are exactly as one would expect: if the colony is small then they usually do all die, because the odds of one possessing the gene are low. In larger and larger colonies you see more and more survivors. The L&D experiment made it possible to distinguish between a low-success-rate response to antibiotic, and a low-occurrence-rate mutation prior to the antibiotic being applied. Nothing we have learned since then has overthrown that result. What's noticeable, over the past few posts, is that you've never given any actual reason why random mutation can't do exactly what I'm saying it's doing. You pour scorn on the idea of gamma rays smacking just the right gene at just the right time in cell division to produce just the right mutation to help the bacterium survive an impending environmental change, but you haven't explained why it can't or wouldn't happen. As I said before, it's like pouring scorn on the idea of a snowflake just happening to fall on a particular blade of grass, by calling attention to how many things could go wrong along the way.","intelligent-designs-black-box","12:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","118"

Do you have a link? You must consider two situations. We'll start with the Luria-Delbruck situation. I'll call it the developmentally inherited mechanism. Here you have a kind of bacterium, e. coli., that over millenia has evolved a mechanism for resisting attacks by the phage [?]. That mechanism is that as the colony grows and its cell numbers increase, it reaches a point where a certain percentage of new members are always formed with the 'resistance' enzyme, so that any large colony always contains a few 'pre-attack' resistant cells, while the vast majority of cells, for the sake, of collective productivity and efficiency, do not show the defensive form. That way, when the attack does come again, as it has done millions of times in their mutual history, the bacteria always has enough resistant cells to recover afterwards. This is why Luria-Delbruck is weak. It first assumes that by whittling a colony down to the point where one division is completely wiped out, that a matching but unexposed division would be wiped out if it were exposed, and so the assumption is that this batch has no resistant cells in it, simply because the other portions of the batch it came from did not. Perhaps so, perhaps not, but it is still only an assumption, not an empirical observation. After taking this supposedly resistance free batch, allowing it grow large enough to be subdivided into several separate batches, the experimenbt assumes that during the cloning process that the bacteria had no hereditary developmental mechanism of self-protection whereby as it grew, it did not restore the old and time-honored device of creating a few 'resistant' cells, de novo. Therefore it is assumed that each and every sub-batch taken from this supposedly resistance-free batch contains the same number of resistant cells, i.e., none, or very very few that might have met with a gamma ray over nite. These divided batches are left to sit some more in order to give the su[pposed rdiation time to work its magic. Then all the batches are are plated and, guess what, they all show resistant cells that vary in number per batch as if they had formed at random. The conclusion is then worked out backwards--a/These resistant cells resemble a random distribution. B/ We know that a/ the batctch we started the test from had no resistant cells, and b/ we know that bacteria, when they clone have no developmental processes that could intelligently, albeit haphazardly re-generate resistant cells. Ergo we know that these cells acquired resistant cells prior to plating, but following the 'purification' process, and since they are incapable of helping themselves, the new resistance can only have been bestowed upon them from on high by passing gamma rays acting as fairy godmothers. This thesis is so riddled with illogical assumptions and leaps of faith and lack of empirical retesting that it is a blot on science, and a Nobel prizewinner to boot! It could be easily verified, but if it was, nobody told anyone. All you have to do is repeat the experiment exactly, only do it in a lead-lined room or deep in an old minr where the radiation is reduced to nil. If the same results are forthcoming, then random genetic mutation caused by radiation, [the long held assumption], is clearly false. If no resistance appears in the absence of radiation, then the original assumption holds. Easy for any scientist to do. Why has it never been done [so far as I know]? Next the second situation, which I call the e.coli intelligently design and evolve a novel method of combating phage. This act of evolution took place millions of years, and trillions of generations in the past, so details are blurry. This much is known. Bacteria have, unlike plants and animals, two sets of DNA. Their 'personal' kit, and 'plasmid' kit of genese they like to pass around and experiment with among themselves. Also, although each cell is or can be self-sustaining, bacteria are really homogeneous entity made up of millions of cells that co-operate and communicate [intelligently] with each other just as an army might do. It has been noted that when a toxin is applied to the outer perimeter of a large bacteria colony, the dying outer edge communicates its predicament to the back rows, triggering a thing called 'hyper-mutation', in which vast number of self-induced mutations are systematically generated in a trial and error fashion that is narrowed down by feedback as some mutated cells do better than others, until, given enough time and resources, immunity to the toxin appears and developmentally improves. This true act of evolution takes place every time a big drug company spends tens of millions to invent an antibiotic to which the chosen microbe has no resistance. But because bacteria do not wait for the gamma ray fairies to strike their genes with a magic wand [random genetic mutation] strains of bacteria always rapidly develop a specific immunity to that toxin. That's evolution, and it's an intelligent, volitional process. What, nobody has ever challenged your favourite assumptions before?!? Bacteria colonies tolerate low doses, individual cells do not, unless the dose is next to non-existent. And the reason why colonies, the larger the better, resist better, the lower the quantity of toxin the better, has just now been explained to you. If so much toxin hit the entire colony at once, there would be no chance for communication, induced hyper-mutation, and trial and error feedback information in the intelligent design of newly self-mutated resistant strains. As explained above. I do note that you have now dropped your original assertion of individual testing of single cells, and now agree that all such testing is always done on large co-operative groups of cells. Some groups may be much smaller than others, but they never get tested one cell at a time, as you seemed to be claiming earlier on. That is why it is bad science to think of single bacteria cells as 'the organism'. The 'organism' is a highly organised, highly communicative, co-operative society gather together and talking to each other chemically, while they play around, scientifically, with their varying kits of plasmid DNA. Explained above, developmentally,[systemically], as opposed to accidentally. It is incredibly difficult to 'overthrow' an article of faith. That's why religions can tell the same children's stories for thousands of years. In science I believe that such an overthrow is called , ""a paradigm shift"". But it you believe that microbiologists have learned nothing that overthrows the _assumptions_ drawn from Luria-Delbruck 65 years ago, and that developmental biology, even in bacteriology, has not torn huge holes in those antique assumptions, then perhaps you need to read as much as this non-scientist has already done. Take a look at some of the stuff provided by Teleological. He/she is probably a scientist and is much better able to converse with you on these matters at your own level. In logic it is impossible to prove a negative proposition, especially one as vaporous as just what is 'possible' and and what is 'not possible'. In science, on the other hand, the onus of proof is always upon the one who states his/her hypothesis in a positive manner, and does so affirmatively, not just as a possibility, but as a reality, an empirically testable phenomenon. Your premise is therefore stated thusly-- Evolutionary changes in the morphology and behaviour [and possibly trait function] of organisms has its start point where a mutagen effects a particular portion of an organism's genome, and that deformation leads mechanically to a novel trait in it's offspring, and its offspring's offspring. Now that is an hypothesis that needs to be be tested by the scientific method, not a bunch of assumptions derived from ignorance and a similarity to statistical outcomes. As above, it is not my responsibility to do any such thing. It is your scientific responsibility to demonstrate empirically, via the scientific method, that not only 'could', but actually _do_ what you claim that they do so often ans so consistently that they are to be considered the engine that drives biological evolution.","intelligent-designs-black-box","11:22 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","120"
