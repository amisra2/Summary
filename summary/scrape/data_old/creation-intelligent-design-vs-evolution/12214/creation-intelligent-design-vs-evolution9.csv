"02-12-2009","12214",9,"jakers","343805","I have never heard of testing dosages of toxins on single bacterial cells, one at a time. Do you have a link? You must consider two situations. We'll start with the Luria-Delbruck situation. I'll call it the developmentally inherited mechanism. Here you have a kind of bacterium, e. coli., that over millenia has evolved a mechanism for resisting attacks by the phage [?]. That mechanism is that as the colony grows and its cell numbers increase, it reaches a point where a certain percentage of new members are always formed with the 'resistance' enzyme, so that any large colony always contains a few 'pre-attack' resistant cells, while the vast majority of cells, for the sake, of collective productivity and efficiency, do not show the defensive form. That way, when the attack does come again, as it has done millions of times in their mutual history, the bacteria always has enough resistant cells to recover afterwards. After taking this supposedly resistance free batch allowing it grow large enough to be subdivided into several separate batches, the experimenbt assumes that during the cloning process that the bacteria had no hereditary developmental mechanism of self-protection whereby as it grew, it did not restore the old and time-honored device of creating a few 'resistant' cells, de novo. Therefore it is assumed that each and every sub-batch taken from this supposedly resistance-free batch contains the same number of resistant cells, i.e., none, or very very few that might have met with a gamma ray over nite. These divided batches are left to sit some more in order to give the su[pposed rdiation time to work its magic. Then all the batches are are plated and, guess what, they all show resistant cells that vary in number per batch as if they had formed at random. and since they are incapable of helping themselves, the new resistance can only have been bestowed upon them from on high by passing gamma rays acting as fairy godmothers. It could be easily verified, but if it was, nobody told anyone. All you have to do is repeat the experiment exactly, only do it in a lead-lined room or deep in an old minr where the radiation is reduced to nil. If the same results are forthcoming, then random genetic mutation caused by radiation, [the long held assumption], is clearly false. If no resistance appears in the absence of radiation, then the original assumption holds. Easy for any scientist to do. Why has it never been done [so far as I know]?","Peeling","343829","That isn't how it's done, obviously. Scientists measure the proportion of a colony killed by varying concentrations of antibiotic. Let me just stop you there. There's no reason to accept your version of events, because there doesn't need to be a mechanism. The 'few' and 'small percentage' you're talking about occur anyway through replication error. Except that the same attack hasn't come millions of times in their history, any more than the same 'flu strikes every year. The 'batch' is four or five cells from a colony. That's why none of them are resistant to start with (very little chance of picking a rare resistant one). Since your 'mechanism' is indistinguishable in its effect from stochastic mutation due to replication error, I can't see how such an assumption is relevant. The hypothesis is that if this first-stage growth is timed correctly, only one or two resistant mutants would occur at most - which is borne out by later results. The expected number in each sub-batch at this stage is zero, or just possibly one IIRC. The significant observation is of 'jackpot' sub-batches, indicating the rare occasions when the mutant arose early in the sub-batch's growth (the mutant had a lot of time to replicate before plating) as opposed to late in its growth (few or no opportunities to replicate before plating). So there is in fact no indication of a dependable mechanism. The bacteria do not wait until the colony reaches a certain size before generating a resistant sprinkling of mutants. It occurs at random during growth. Tagging 'intelligence' onto that is a just-so story. And since those 'fairy godmothers' are a perfectly adequate explanation for the observation, why should we invent another? Well... it has. Routinely. Only in reverse, by the application of UV light during growth to elevate mutation rates, which in turn elevates the number of mutants - of all kinds, resistant or otherwise. You can't actually reduce the mutation rate to nil because at those atomic scales the uncertainty principle prevents perfect replication ever being 100% certain. I think I'll leave it there for now and see how you want to respond.","intelligent-designs-black-box","12:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","122"

Well, that is your 'theory'. These two antagonists have existed side by side for millions of years. Don't say they haven't 'crossed swords' on a regular basis. Just as I said. The community has to develop to a certain size. I suppose back when boats stayed close to land and some people thought the world was flat, they probably said the same thing to those who claimed it was round. The issue between us is not 'when' a mutant arises, but 'how'. You say by random accident,i.e., inheritance and conservation system failure; I say by inherited developmental mechanism.

You do not test whether or not mutations are brought on by random mutagens, radiation, by increasing the amount of radiation exposure!! The only way to test the 'radiation as cause' hypothesis is to eliminate radiation. All of it, insofar as possible, and then compare results. There you have it. Look, you're convinced that your explanation is correct. I'm convinced that it is wrong, and have offered a counter-argument. Since your premise is under plausible attack, it is now made dubious, and so, scientifically, requires defending according to the time-honoured precepts of empirical observation and the scientific [predictive] method. There is simply no more to say on this issue without that empirical evidence, that scientific testing. Wiithout that we degenerate into an 'is so, is not, is so too, ' pointless wrangle .

But they haven't been the same antagonists all that time. They both evolve. The same resistant 'solution' wouldn't keep working. Empirically incorrect. The 'jackpot' colonies in the fluctuation test prove the the mutation occurs at random during growth, and not when the colony reaches a certain size. I know that. The problem with your version of events is that it doesn't fit the facts and mine does. I didn't say small batches were too small to survive, I said they were too small to be likely to survive, because the pertinent mutation is rare. The fluctuation test is empirical proof of that. Rare 'jackpot' sub-batches is indicative of the mutation occurring early in the growth of those colonies. That analogy is inept, because the earth cannot be both flat and round at the same time. Bacteria, on the other hand, can evolve mechanisms responsive to environmental changes and be subject to random mutation at the same time. The latter will always make itself felt, and can be detected via the fluctuation test. That's like saying the only way to test if bullets kill people is to not shoot them and see if they don't die. The simple empirical fact is that mutation rates vary linearly with radiation dosage. Rates have also been shown to be independent of the intensity of the dose: an intense, short burst produces the same number of mutants as the same amount of radiation delivered more gradually over a longer time. The best-fit model for those observations is that each energetic particle has a small but finite chance of inducing mutation, so delivering the same number of energetic particles has the same cumulative chance regardless of how rapidly the dose is applied. A bit like the way a short, intense snowfall will cover the ground just as deeply and just as evenly as a long, less intense one. No, you've offered an alternative explanation , one which requires bacteria to 'remember' a genetic configuration other bacteria once had and collectively decide to recreate it when colonies attain a certain size. Which is a nice story, but : 1. The empirical evidence is that the recurrence of the mutation is stochastic, as opposed to responsive to colony size. 2. You have no evidence for the existence of a parallel 'memory' from which the genetic changes in question could be deliberately recalled. 3. The occurrence of mutation varies linearly with total radiation dosage but not with intensity, favouring a statistical per-particle induction model. I'm not denying bacteria do remarkable things. But whatever they do they remain subject to random mutation, and when (as here) the characteristics of that 'mechanism' perfectly fit our observations there is no reason to imagine anything else to be at work, particularly something that doesn't fit those observations.

"02-14-2009","12214",9,"jakers","343920","[Addressing Peeling:] I've made a perfectly good argument, which you simply handwave away.... There is a small but finite chance of any given single-step mutation occurring to any given bacterium during, for instance, cell division - a chance which can be increased via environmental mutagens, be they chemicals or UV light. In even modest colonies those tiny odds are overwhelmed by the number of opportunities for those mutations to occur, and from that arises the 'dependability' of there being at least one mutant of type 'X' already in the population when the environment changes in its favour. If the colony is very small, the outcome is far less dependable. There's nothing irrational about this, it's not a 'just so' story, you can't hand-wave it away. Oh, but yes I can.","Matthew","344013","Why is that a problem?

"02-14-2009","12214",9,"jakers","342969","[Me:] But one very important thing you are missing is that organisms and their numbers change because their genes (and their numbers) change! If an organisms genes and genone changes, then it is necessary to so that that organism has changed. So, they change because they change because they change because they change? You think not? Anything whose root cause is random, is random. Environmental events caused by climate change, earthquake, or whatever, are random. Ergo, any change in the populations of organisms affected by such random events are rabndom statistical fluctuations. AKA, ""NS"", ""Fitness"", etc. I have never ""left this part out"". ...the words Plato chose did not radically diiffer from Greek usage of his time, and were therefore non-equivocal. My objection is to a band of self-righteous true-believing materialists who have taken upon themselves the exclusive right to re-interpret standard English words and images in such a way that their equivocations make their philosophy easier for the general public to swallow when it comes to anything connected to biology... ...most importantly, to the differences between living and non-living things. ...short of returning to university and picking up a Ph.D. in molecular chemistry, I have spent many years thinking about it and reading about it, and after believing in it for most of my life, I was and am finally convinced, entirely convinced, that it is absurd. I think that you are semantically nit-picking, since I was clearly talking Aristotle's four kinds of causation, and not debating the existence of God. Big difference between smoke having a tendency to rise and smoke wanting, needing, and forcing itself to rise. Or at least, that's how I see it. In this case, a discussion of regularity, repetition, i.e., mechanics, is under discussion. That is, what is the nature of mechanical things, and how do they differ from random, accidental, spontaneous, coincidental things. No. He does not. He finds that they have final outcomes,[an action for an end], not final causes [a motivation to act in order to achieve an end]. Once you step beyond the limits of empirical science and into the abstract world of metaphysics, it is only rational to assume that any created thing was created for a purpose, rather than by accident. The trick is to not do what the materialists/positivists do, namely, assume that everything, including physical laws, were created by accident, and then assume that, ipso facto, everything else that follows is purely accidental.","Matthew","344025","You know, in light of this remark, I seriously thought about addressing all of my future comments on your posts to your genes rather than to you, ""organisms"" and ""orgasnisms' genes"" apparently being logically equivalent and thus usable interchangeably. But as this discussion is already more than polemical enough, I will simply limit myself to a brief comment, namely: Wholes and their parts are not , in fact, logically equivalent to one another, and sometimes wholes do , in fact, change in non-tautological and non-trivial ways because their parts change. If you would like to address the matter of how organisms and their genes are related to one another in substantive terms, fantastic. But if you're just going to equivocate as it suits you, all the while accusing everybody else of disingenuous equivocations, then don't bother. Not so. Take a checkerboard, two eight-sided dice, and some marbles of a few different colors. Randomly arrange some of the marbles on the checkerboard, one to a square. Designate one die for columns and the other for rows. Roll them to identify a given square. Remove its marble. Then roll the dice again to identify another square. Replace the marble you removed with a marble of the same color as that in the second square you identified. And repeat the process for a while. What you will note as you repeat this random process is that the distribution of marble colors gradually comes to be non-random. But of the course, the analogy with natural selection is hardly perfect, since natural selection is not a random process. To wit: Nonsense. Who lives and who dies in the wake of ""random"" environmental changes is not itself a matter of chance. Seriously, read The Beak of the Finch if you have any interest in how this works. When the Grants examined which finches on one island survived a drought that caused a more than 80% reduction of their population, all had larger than average beak dimensions and larger than average bodies. No small-beaked, small-bodied birds made it. And male survivors outnumbered female survivors about five to one. Once the rains returned, the birds set about mating again. And only one fifth of the surviving males were able to mate. Which ones got to do so was again not random: those with the largest beaks and bodies. The finches' subsequent offspring had, you might guess, larger beaks and bodies. But only on average: some of the young had small beaks and small bodies. This isn't random. It's how genes get passed on from one generation to the next. It doesn't show signs of direction, either, insofar as the drought survivors did not produce offspring that were optimally suited to the now-wet environment. They produced offspring exactly as one would expect given a non-directed process. Furthermore, the smaller birds became more numerous over the course of generations in the wet period. This, too, is hardly random. Big beaks and bodies take significantly more energy to build, and smaller birds were able to devote more of their efforts toward reproduction than their larger relatives, who had to spend more time feeding. These smaller birds produced smaller offspring. Again, on average: they still left larger offspring, too, albeit larger offspring who didn't fare as well as their smaller kin. Just as the non-random but non-directed view expected. And then, drought happens again, and we're back to square one. What is my point in all of this? I will accept that variation is ""random"" in the senses (1) that we cannot make effective predictions about what mutations might happen to what birds when, or what the phenotypic effects of those mutations will be; and (2) that we cannot predict which alleles (whether mutant or established) will make it into which sex cells of any one bird, or which of its sex cells will unite with which of its mate's; and (3) that what actually comes to pass as far as these ""variation events"" are concerned does not give the appearance of being controlled by the conscious intentions of any being: not the finches, not God, not ""the psyche."" But none of the variation in the finch population is random in the sense of being uncaused, either in terms of molecular activity in their DNA or in terms of the environmental factors that affect their survival and reproductive success. Nor is it even unpredictable at the level of how the whole population will be affected. (And the Grants ended up being able to make some stunningly accurate predictions, incidentally.) Now, you can say that this is just oscillation in a population if you like, that this certainly isn't ""evolution."" But that's simply not so. All it would take is a long-term shift in environmental conditions to push them in one direction or the other (large-beaked and -bodied or small-). In the meantime, evolution doesn't stop just because conditions oscillate. It's an ongoing process that happens even when conditions are stable. And I fail to see what teleology adds to this picture, scientifically speaking. (Or even, perhaps, metaphysically.) Every time you treat evolution by natural selection as a fundamentally random process, you are leaving out natural selection itself. Because the process of natural selection is simply not random. The two words that Plato most commonly used to name the non-empirical, immutable, abstract entities at the heart of his metaphysics were eidos and morphe . Eidos meant ""image."" Morphe meant ""shape."" Now, I certainly don't deny that there are connections between these words in their ordinary Greek usage and Plato's own use of them, pertaining to image and shape as ""structure,"" say. But we shouldn't mislead ourselves into the linguistic innovation going on here, either: Plato was using empirical terms to name non -empirical entities. Similarly, there is a point of similarity between ""selection"" as used in evolutionary biology and in ordinary language. The fact that, in ordinary language, the term implies a conscious selecting agent, while in biological technical terminology it does not, should not be any more troubling than Plato's use of eidos and morphe in reference to his non-empirical Forms. (Or would you say that the very language Plato used reveals that the Forms must truly be empirical after all?...) This is thoroughly ad hominem, and false to boot. There are plenty of biologists who are not metaphysical materialists, but nonetheless accept the theory of evolution as it stands. Moreover, even if the charge were not false, it would still be completely irrelevant, as are all ad hominem invocations of motive. Supposing that this were the true motive of characterizing evolution non-teleologically, it would not render that characterization false. It may well be false. All you have to do is show that genetic variation is directed. This is called Lamarckism, which is neither conceptually incoherent nor logically impossible. But nobody has ever found any evidence for it. So the odds seem long. This charge is nothing more than a straw man. There are plenty of differences between living and non-living things, and I've never seen any biologist -- never, any -- claim or imply otherwise. But the differences appear to be differences in the way the matter that makes up living rather than non-living entities is arranged. It's not that there's some animating ""life force"" out there that organisms have and non-living matter doesn't. So instead of saying that you'd prefer to ignore the dominant theory, why don't you try to convince us that it's wrong? And I did not say you were. But since you invoked ""an Aristotelian tradition of causation,"" every component of which elaborates Aristotle's four kinds of causation, I fail to see why my reference to that tradition is a problem. If you didn't mean ""tradition,"" why'd you say it? I mean, haven't you been calling people on the carpet for linguistic imprecision left and right? And how Aristotle saw it. But you managed to omit my comment that as Aristotle saw it, things don't need to have volition to have final causes. He thought it reasonable to ascribe final causes to hammers and teeth, but he would never have ascribe volition to them. Why did you omit that part? You're doing it again! Again! Genetic variation is random, in the sense mentioned above. But the process of natural selection is not random! Why do you keep ignoring that? (Brackets yours.) ""For an end"" means final cause. Why you are conflating ""final cause"" with ""motivation,"" I don't know. But it's a big mistake. First of all, is this discussion of evolution scientific or metaphysical? I thought we were talking about biology, not ontology. Second of all... ...you cannot simply ""assume,"" as you've done in each of your last two sentences, that the things in question are ""created."" Of course created things are created for purposes. But are living things created? Seems like metaphysics, to me. And I'm basically a Kantian on metaphysical matters. As far as I see it, once we leave empiricism behind, metaphysical disagreements are fundamentally irresolvable. What we need is empirical science that cuts across these unending metaphysical differences. Unfortunately, you and other IDists seem to build a contentious metaphysical point about teleology right into the empirical science of biology. Now, I'm not so naive that I think Dawkins, for example, doesn't do the same thing from the opposite direction. But Dawkins' views of metaphysics and its connection to natural science is hardly shared by all scientists or biologists, or even by most of them. So you shouldn't treat a metaphysical dispute with materialists as a scientific dispute with biologists.","intelligent-designs-black-box","01:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","128"

Long answer, the 'standard evolutionary model' is non-empirical. It is founded upon a presumption that mutation/adaptation/evolution events are 'accidental' simply because they look that way according to statistical math. Appearances can be, and very often are, deceiving. Especially arithmetical appearances. Statistics often delude and confuse more than they elucidate and inform. They aren't science, IMHO. Science requires empirical observation and predictive testing of empirical evidence via the scientific method. There is none of that in Luria-Delbruck and its 'clones'. They are a priori premises that ""appear"" to be validated by statistical resemblances. I cannot imagine how such stuff ever won a Nobel Prize in anything but statistics. vIn fact, that prize was not awarded them until 1969, after 26 years of extreme politicking from the Random Mutation evolutionary camp, and even then it was awarded, not for evolutionary biology, but physiology and medicine.

"02-14-2009","12214",9,"Matthew","344025","You know, in light of this remark, I seriously thought about addressing all of my future comments on your posts to your genes rather than to you, ""organisms"" and ""orgasnisms' genes"" apparently being logically equivalent and thus usable interchangeably. But as this discussion is already more than polemical enough, I will simply limit myself to a brief comment, namely: Wholes and their parts are not , in fact, logically equivalent to one another, and sometimes wholes do , in fact, change in non-tautological and non-trivial ways because their parts change. If you would like to address the matter of how organisms and their genes are related to one another in substantive terms, fantastic. But if you're just going to equivocate as it suits you, all the while accusing everybody else of disingenuous equivocations, then don't bother.","jakers","344037","I'm sorry that you are offended. I intended no such thing, and I am not, and have not 'equivocated' anything. The equivocation involved is totally intrinsic to the standard model I am debating against. It is not I who equivocate an organism's genes with the whole organism that possesses them. It is your spontaneous genetic mutation model of evolution that does that. It is that irrational approach that I am fighting against, not for. According to the thinking in that model, we live in a purely material universe which is therefore mechanically determined. That is, physical event A is the sole and only cause for physical effect B, and wherever there is A, there must follow B. In biology, that means genetic determinism, that is, that gene A determines trait B. This determinism has taken a severe beating by scientific research over the past 60, but still it clings like a barnacle. You still, even after all the evidence of the various 'genome projects', hear evolutionary biologists of the mechanist persuasion speaking of 'the gene for this' and 'the gene for that'. Well, science has shown that that just ain't so. That something else can and sometimes does supercede and overrule 'genes', and that most traits depend upon many 'genes' working co-operatively, rather than a single 'point' gene [as supposed in Luria-Delbruck] determining, by chemical mechanics, an organismic trait of any but the most simple molecular kind. For eukaryotic organisms, you can just plain forget about it. Which Is why I pointed out that appeals to bacteria, yeasts, etc., are, in evolutionary theory, simple cases of 'special pleading'. Now, I'lol accept some typographical responsibility for the misunderstanding, but it alarms me that you were so quick to take offense where none was offered. I thought that with Peeling, Ian, and yourself, we could all relax and have a 'fun' exchange of views. But now it looks like this may be a tinder box like every other evolution thread, and quite frankly, I refuse to fight. So, please let me know where you stand, and if all's well, perhaps we can continue, or if the subject is just too 'touchy', perhaps not.","intelligent-designs-black-box","02:37 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","131"
"02-14-2009","12214",9,"jakers","344035","Long answer, the 'standard evolutionary model' is non-empirical. It is founded upon a presumption that mutation/adaptation/evolution events are 'accidental' simply because they look that way according to statistical math. Statistics often delude and confuse more than they elucidate and inform. They aren't science, IMHO. Science requires empirical observation and predictive testing of empirical evidence via the scientific method. There is none of that in Luria-Delbruck and its 'clones'. They are a priori premises that ""appear"" to be validated by statistical resemblances. I cannot imagine how such stuff ever won a Nobel Prize in anything but statistics. In fact, that prize was not awarded them until 1969, after 26 years of extreme politicking from the Random Mutation evolutionary camp, and even then it was awarded, not for evolutionary biology, but physiology and medicine. Which is too bad, since, thanks to them, the world is being overwhelmed by resistant forms of bacteria, plants, insects, and on and on. Why should he not 'dismiss' the last 60 years worth of developmental biology, bacteriology, immunology, epigenetic inheritance, eusocial defense mechanisms and on and on? Because that's just being as much a 'blind believer' as any semi-educated religious zealot. IAW, empiricism trumps probability theory.","Matthew","344065","I get the impression that you sincerely believe that. Nonetheless, the claim that ""variation is undirected"" is based on empirical evidence. There is a difference between using and abusing statistics. When properly applied to scientific evidence, statistical methods can be very valuable. Which, like it or not, is exactly what the ""variation is undirected"" hypothesis has received for a very long time. As I said, you're welcome to do the same for the Lamarckian ""variation is directed"" hypothesis, too. So far, the evidence indicates lack of direction rather than direction. This doesn't mean directed variation is impossible. But in the more than two centuries since Lamarck published his ideas, the evidence still has yet to turn up. Ever hear of Lysenko? So what? Many other people can imagine it quite well. This is mere argument from incredulity. More ad hominem irrelevancy. Even if politics played a role in the award, that has nothing to do with whether or not the research was good or bad. Many people would disagree with your assessment on the merits. ""Thanks to them?"" What are you saying, exactly? There is no need to dismiss any of that. But there's also no need to invoke final causes in order to explain such phenomena, either. What about when statistics are used to describe empirical phenomena accurately? It is possible, you know.","intelligent-designs-black-box","09:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","132"

Which is why I refrained from polemicizing. Nonetheless, I didn't regard your answer as substantive either. On the contrary, it was only by changing meanings that you could pretend that my original claim -- ""Organisms change because their genes change"" -- amounts to ""They change because they change."" Intentional or not, it's a semantic confusion of parts and wholes. Whose ""spontaneous genetic mutation model"" are you talking about? Did you get to the part of my post where I said that I don't think mutations (or any other type of genetic variation) are uncaused? I just don't think they have final causes. -- Or at the very least, I think there's no reason to invoke such causes as a matter of empirical science. Then your fight is with materialist metaphysics. Not with biology. Because the idea that the universe is ""purely material"" and ""mechanically determined"" is not entailed by the non-directedness of genetic variation. Materialism and determinism can of course be consistent with the non-directedness of genetic variation. But so can any metaphysical view of what lies (or doesn't lie) beyond the empirical realm. My single biggest complaint about Intelligent Design is that it confuses speculative metaphysics with empirical science. Not that some scientists don't make similar conflations, usually in the opposite direction. But the two remain distinct, despite the mistakes of either side. A commitment to the claim that variation is undirected, as a matter of scientific understanding of the natural world, simply does not entail a commitment to either materialism or determinism, as matters of metaphysics. Except that, as you point out, science itself ""has shown that that just ain't so"" -- and yet, it has still found no evidence that variation is directed! You keep acting as if all these developments were prima facie evidence that teleology must play a role in the empirical science of evolutionary biology. But ""that just ain't so,"" either. Look, I'm actually content to let bygones be bygones. Online debates get pointlessly heated all too quickly, and I don't want this not to be fun. But when you start imputing metaphysical agendas to people based on their scientific views -- metaphysical agendas that many who accept what you call the ""standard model"" of evolution simply do not hold, and that are not entailed by that model -- I'd say there's more at work here than typos! It seems to me that your argument is with metaphysical materialism and determinism. But these are not entailed by the undirectedness of variation. Perhaps this would be a fruitful opening into further discussion?","intelligent-designs-black-box","09:52 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","133"

Appearances can be, and very often are, deceiving.","Peeling","344184","In our discussion, the closest you've come to an argument against the effects of random mutation is to say that the outcome is too predictable for the cause to be random. That's all you've ever said, and it's in defiance of basic statistics. Pointing out that fundamental error in your logic is hardly 'handwaving'. I'm more than willing to put my money where my mouth is. I'll bet a thousand pounds to your ten that if we play a thousand hands of poker I'll be dealt an Ace at some point. Come on; there are forty-eight cards in the pack that aren't aces - how can you lose? Or I'll bet you a thousand pounds to your one that someone somewhere will win the lottery this year. How can you possibly refuse when the odds are so manifestly in your favour? As it turns out, you knew perfectly well that argument was unfounded, as you revealed here: After spending umpteen posts denying it to my face, you implicitly acknowledge to someone else that empirical observations do match predictions based on a model of random mutation! So why did you drag the two of us all around the houses, rather than simply stating right from the outset: ""I know it looks like these mutations occur at random, but that's wrong because..."" ? We could have talked about all kinds of interesting things. Perhaps you thought I would behave boorishly if you made the slightest concession; I'm not offended by that presumption but I am a little disappointed.","intelligent-designs-black-box","11:13 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","135"
