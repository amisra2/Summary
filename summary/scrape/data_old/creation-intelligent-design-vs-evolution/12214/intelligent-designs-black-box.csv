"01-13-2009","12214",1,"None","None","None","Peeling","340052","I had what I consider an interesting idea the other day - although of course your mileage may vary. I've posted it on a couple of pro-ID forums, attracting views but no replies. Obviously no significance can be attached to that, but it does rather leave me with nobody to talk to. So I'll post it here. By way of a preface, here is Intelligent Design Theory's premise in a nutshell: 1. We know there is such a thing as intelligent design: we do it ourselves. 2. Scientists should always exhaust the known before resorting to the unknown when seeking an explanation. 3. When considering any given biological feature (for our purposes typically the DNA from which a protein or group of proteins are derived), there are two possible contributing factors: design and evolution. In the latter case, the scale of the task facing evolution in creating the feature depends upon the existence - the plentiful existence - of proximate intermediate features. That is to say, DNA sufficiently similar and sufficiently widespread for the attainment of our target sequence to be statistically feasible via known mechanisms (mutation etc). 4. If we don't know what, if any, useful intermediate features could have prefaced the evolution of our target structure, 2) compels us to refrain from assuming their existence. We must instead go with what we know, and attempt to estimate the odds of the feature forming from an unrelated strand of DNA without the intermediate steps being useful. This is treated as statistically equivalent to a random search (create a DNA strand at random and see if it's the right one). 5. The amount of Complex Specified Information (CSI) in a feature is a measurement of those odds. And we know intelligence is capable of producing CSI because it can be measured in - well, this forum post for instance: what are the odds of a random sequence of characters duplicating it? Even if you allow for all the different possible sequences of characters conveying the same general meaning, they are still prodigiously outnumbered by permutations that are utterly meaningless. Before I present my argument, there are a couple of common criticisms of the above premise I'd like to cover: The Chicken and Egg problem Intelligent design may be a 'known', but it's also true that the only known intelligence in the universe is the product of the very process under investigation. This gives rise to a chicken and egg scenario. However, while this objection correctly highlights the ultimate futility of invoking intelligence as an explanation for the existence of itself, it could nevertheless be the case that we were designed by something that itself evolved. After all, the things we design remain designed, regardless of whether we ourselves evolved with or without external intelligent intervention. Thus the objection fails. CSI is a negative test This is a considerably more robust complaint: the amount of CSI measured in a biological structure depends to a large extent upon our ignorance. For instance, there are many, many variant genes in nature producing different proteins all serving as perfectly good insulin - that's why until recently diabetic patients were successfully treated with porcine or bovine insulin. The measured CSI of the DNA responsible is therefore reduced by our knowledge that there are multiple equivalent sequences (many targets for a random search to hit means lower CSI). If we didn't know they existed, our measurement would be higher. Also, we've observed insertion mutations occurring in the lab. An insertion mutation makes a DNA strand longer, and longer strands mean more permutations and thus yield a higher CSI measurement. So our measurement of CSI in the strand would be different depending upon whether we happened to observe that mutation. The ID counterargument is that it's always possible to suppose we've missed something that would influence our results, but we cannot rely upon such a supposition unless we can attach some meaningful probability to the event. And while we can make statements concerning the rate at which mutations occur, it's computationally impractical to 'rewind' evolution to any great extent to find functional intermediates from which mutations could plausibly have generated the DNA we see today - and even less practical to estimate how widespread such an intermediate would have been in an earlier population (or in many cases even the size of that population). By the letter of the law it's arguable that ID wins this argument by a nose, but an impartial observer would also concede that it is the impracticality of identifying a statistically quantifiable evolutionary history, rather than any theoretical weakness, which undermines the evolutionary position. To put it another way, the difficulty faced by an evolutionist in constructing a quantifiable evolutionary history is nothing to do with whether he's right or wrong about there being one. To put it yet another way, ID advocates only win because they don't have to do any work to support their position. Or do they? Intelligent Design's Black Box The idea I had last week starts with a simple question: I'm thinking of a number between 0 and 340 billion billion billion billion. What is it? The answer to that question represents a paltry 128 binary bits of CSI - equivalent to a 64 base-pair DNA strand and astronomically less than ID theory would measure in this sentence alone. So why can't you, an intelligent human being allegedly capable of creating far greater quantities of CSI merely by posting a legible response, answer me? It's claimed that intelligence understands meaning and purpose, and that's why it can find solutions evolution cannot. Very well: if I tell you the number in question is the WEP key for my wireless router, does your understanding of its purpose help in any way? Would you care to make a second guess? What the superficially trivial question above demonstrates is that intelligence cannot effortlessly hose out CSI on demand. Any problem analogous to my router's WEP key - such as finding a comparatively short, functionally isolated sequence of DNA - would be for all practical purposes just as intractable to an intelligent agent as to an evolutionary process. Returning to the original question, imagine instead of merely answering 'yes' or 'no' to your guesses, I tell you how many digits you got right, or whether the answer is higher or lower. Either would enable you to track down the target in short order - but in doing so you are utterly reliant upon patterns in the problem-space itself: the existence of a detectable route leading from an initial wrong guess to the right one. We find the same to be true in language. Imagine you see a cat, sitting on a mat, and decide you want to email your friends Alan and Zorg about it. To Alan you write 'I saw a cat sat on the mat' which according to ID theory (allowing for punctuation characters) represents about 128 bits of CSI. Next you try to email Zorg, your alien friend from the planet Zap. But there's a problem: Zorg doesn't speak English and in Zappian there's no consistent word for 'cat' or 'the' or 'sat' or 'mat'. There is a sequence of characters meaning 'I saw a cat sat on the mat' - but you have no idea what it is, and your intelligence is of no practical help to you in finding out. What we're seeing, then, is that in measuring CSI, ID theory is making two assumptions, not one. First, it's assuming that evolutionary intermediates we don't know about don't exist - which as we've discussed is just about justifiable according to the letter of the law. But it's also assuming patterns exist in the problem space that would enable an intelligent agent to find the solution. And as we've just seen, it's perfectly possible for no such patterns to exist - it's perfectly possible for intelligence to be no practical use at all. Thus by the same reasoning that excluded presumption of evolutionary intermediates, we must also exclude the presumption of intelligently traceable patterns - and in doing so we eliminate design as the default hypothesis. ID theorists do have a task before them, one comparable to that faced by evolutionists: they must quantify how much intelligence could contribute to the design of any given biological structure, by finding the patterns that would allow an intelligence to cull vast swathes of potential solutions at a stroke rather than having to consider or test them individually.

The ID argument we're dealing with here isn't in fact information-based. I agree that, in the same way the shape of a lock defines the shape of the key that will open it, an organism's environment defines - and thus encapsulates the information regarding - the ways in which that organism can survive and reproduce. And in my opinion evolution is sufficient explanation for how that information is transferred to the genome. However, it's also possible to transfer such information via design. The example of dropping freshwater fish into salt water or vice versa is an apt one in that respect: evolution would be unable to transfer the information in time to preserve the species. The 'official' ID argument for design (as opposed to the various poorly thought-out 'information can't arise ex nihilo' claims in circulation) is not that the environment doesn't represent the source of the information, but that evolution is an insufficiently powerful information pump. Many do, it's true - but that's not issue here. The issue is whether that genetic diversity could plausibly arise in the first place via evolutionary mechanisms, or whether there are genetic 'solutions' in nature that are too remote and isolated in permutation-space for an evolutionary search to have found them. My contention here is that the assumptions made in ID theory, which lead to the conclusion that some biological features are too functionally isolated to be found by evolution also - if fairly applied - eliminate intelligent design as a plausible origin. In other words, ID and evolution face the same problem: they must both show that biological features do not exhibit CSI in order to make their case.","intelligent-designs-black-box","07:08 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","4"

Bat wings for example are one of the easier problems for evolution to solve (we can even see potential transitional stages in other animals like the flying squirrel). The co-option of existing structures is the bread and butter of evolution. Now, if bats and birds had four legs and wings, that would be more of a head-scratcher. Civil and courteous, remember? Anyway, the topic primarily concerns structures at the protein level, about which there is at least some hope of measuring the level of CSI involved, so the evolution of wings isn't exactly relevant.","intelligent-designs-black-box","08:15 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","5"

I think that you are correct in this assumption, but since you do not define either 'intelligent' or 'design', I cannot be certain that we are not already at cross-purposes. True. I believe Mr. Sherlock Holmes said something to this effect wrt detective work. Well, that may be your personal approach to 'Evolution by Intelligent Design', but I believe that most people [and the majority of human beings are not geneticists and/or molecular chemists] would say that 'biological evolution', [to their way of thinking and mine], is about whole organisms, not molecules.

Evolution is an effect, not a cause, and trying to anthropomorphize that 'effect' into a 'cause' facing a 'task' smacks of animism. Evolution, as an effect, is an empirically observable fact. That is, there can be no doubt that over time and generations the forms that organisms take usually change. That is a non-issue, AFAIAC. The issue is determining the cause[s] that drive those changes. What you are saying here is that evolution drives evolution, which, among other things, is vacuous. Well, that's a bald assertion, and although it may even be true, I cannot accept it at face value. You'll have to take little time and explain to a non-scientist, amateur ontologist, just what it is that you intend that we should understand from these words, and why we should accept that understanding as true.

I have no interest in constructing a strawman, and if anyone can demonstrate that I have I will revise my understanding accordingly. I summarized the premise of ID not to cast it in any particular light but as a convenient reference for the argument that followed. As it happens, I haven't been able to find a consistent ID definition of the terms, either! On the ARN forums, for instance, the contributors were directly challenged to provide those definitions, and the various responses included: I think in this case Intelligence means something capable of producing design. Perhaps even the ability to make choices. Intelligence as it relates to ID is just to differentiate between optimal design on one side and apparent design on the other. (Wm DEmbski) In this context intelligence means what which nature, operating freely, could not or would not produce. (Del Ratzsch) I'll present and justify my definition of the terms in a moment, so bear with me. I agree: most people would say that, because for macro-scale multicellular creatures, the obvious selectable traits are visible morphological change (the size and shape of a limb or tooth, the configuration of a skull and so on). However, these macro changes are traceable to genetic or epigenetic traits at the molecular level. When you think about it, as a limb changes shape over generations it is not the limb that is evolving. After all, the physical limb itself is not handed down (sorry) from father to son. Rather it is the developmental process that produces the limb (in the foetus and growth into adulthood) which evolves, in turn resulting in a different end product in each successive generation. A moment's consideration reveals the inarguable truth of that. And the developmental process is regulated at the molecular level. Oh, don't be so hasty Bear in mind that at the scale upon which bacteria operate, molecules are significant physical structures. The bacterial flagellum, for instance, is an outboard motor constructed directly out of proteins, which are in turn directly, physically translated via RNA from DNA sequences. The physical shape of the folded molecular structure of those proteins is what makes the motor work. So there's nothing abstract about the relationship between DNA and the organism's physical form or abilities. Yes, I do define them as different things - and I'll explain why in a moment. Yes, our usage of those terms does differ markedly. You employ what I would call a narrative interpretation: design as a means to an end, contrasted with evolution having no ultimate goal. We're going to get into even more trouble over the term 'undirected', because evolution very much is directed, channeled and constrained by the environment. Of course, in narrative terms 'directed' once again implies a goal and an agent cognizant of that goal, so me using the word in conjunction with evolution is going to get us in a tangle. I'll therefore do my best to avoid using it. No, I mean evolution, in which statistically random variation is but one factor. It's a terrible mistake to equate evolution with pure chance. Evolution strikes me as being neither effect nor cause, but a process, akin to 'walking'. I wouldn't think it improper to describe, for instance, the reaching of the moon as a task to which the process of 'walking' is ill-suited I appreciate your concerns but they are groundless. I do not reify evolution in any sense; I used the phrase for evocative effect only. Evolution is a process, and the 'task' it faces in our mental exercise is the attainment of real-world sequences of DNA. The scale of that task - how well suited evolution is to completing it - equates to how plausible an explanation evolution is for what we see. And in terms of DNA sequences, evolution can reach a given sequence easily if there are abundant similar sequences already in existence - a scenario which can arise in a number of ways, the most readily understandable being that the previous, 'similar' sequence was of particular benefit to the organism's reproductive chances and became widespread in the population as a result. I apologise for leading you to that conclusion; it was not my intent. Evolution is a process, driven by events that induce variation (mutation, recombination, dietary change etc etc) and other influences which cull and select from that variation. It's fairly straightforward, probably more so than my wording suggested. The point is simply this: if we speculate that a particular 'target' (again, no teleology implied - 'target' here simply means a DNA sequence we know to exist) was reached by a process which involves producing random variations of existing DNA sequences, that process's chances of 'success', and of therefore being a plausible explanation, are intimately tied to the prior abundance or otherwise of substantially similar sequences. For example, if our target is the word 'Bellow' appearing in a population of words, the chances of it being reached by a process of random variation are substantially increased if there are already a million copies of the word 'Yellow' kicking about. That really is a shame. In case you change your mind, here is my working definition of 'design': Design: The culling of potential solutions in the abstract. You may well balk at that initially, but bear with me. Start by thinking about a problem in terms of the 'space' of all potential solutions, both good and bad. In principle at least you could find the optimal solution by trying everything and picking the solution that worked best. Interestingly enough, that method requires absolutely no understanding of the problem. Literally, brute force and ignorance. And it will suffice perfectly well if the problem-space is relatively small, like the combination lock on a briefcase. In most situations, however, the problem space is far too large for brute force and ignorance to triumph. One alternative is evolutionary: take a number of random starting solutions, pick the best, create a bunch of random variations from it, pick the best, rinse and repeat. Another alternative is design . This involves abstracting the problem to a simpler form with a smaller problem space. This drastically culls the range of alternatives that need to be considered or tested, enabling a solution to be found more quickly. The success of the process depends upon how well the abstraction - the model - of reality matches reality itself. The essence of my argument here in this thread is that CSI is a measurement of how badly any kind of abstract simplified model of the problem would fit the reality. You cannot simplify the problem of my router's WEP key, or the email to Zorg. They are, to borrow a phrase, irreducibly complex. And in the face of such problems design is helpless.","intelligent-designs-black-box","12:55 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","7"

But I have no intention of making myself look like an ##### by arguing blindly against someone else's particular area of expertise. Which is all that can happen in any debate we have that is framed in terms of genetics and molecular chemistry. Why not simply accept the dictionary definitions of 'intelligent' and 'design'? I don't see why the issue has to be muddied by looking for peculiar definitions for commonly understood words. A quick peek at my on-line dictionary gives me this information-- Definitions from The Online Plain Text English Dictionary: Intelligent # (a.) Endowed with the faculty of understanding or reason; as, man is an intelligent being. # (a.) Cognizant; aware; communicate. # (a.) Possessed of intelligence, education, or judgment; knowing; sensible; skilled; marked by intelligence; as, an intelligent young man; an intelligent architect; an intelligent answer. Definitions from The Online Plain Text English Dictionary: Design # (n.) A plan or scheme formed in the mind of something to be done; preliminary conception; idea intended to be expressed in a visible form or carried into action; intention; purpose; -- often used in a bad sense for evil intention or purpose; scheme; plot. # (n.) A preliminary sketch; an outline or pattern of the main features of something to be executed, as of a picture, a building, or a decoration; a delineation; a plan. # (n.)[b] Specifically, intention or purpose as revealed or inferred from the adaptation of means to an end; as, the argument from design.[b] # (n.) The invention and conduct of the subject; the disposition of every part, and the general order of the whole. # (n.) The realization of an inventive or decorative plan; esp., a work of decorative art considered as a new creation; conception or plan shown in completed work; as, this carved panel is a fine design, or of a fine design. # (n.) To create or produce, as a work of art; to form a plan or scheme of; to form in idea; to invent; to project; to lay out in the mind; as, a man designs an essay, a poem, a statue, or a cathedral. # (n.) To draw preliminary outline or main features of; to sketch for a pattern or model; to delineate; to trace out; to draw. # (n.) To intend or purpose; -- usually with for before the remote object, but sometimes with to. # (n.) To mark out and exhibit; to designate; to indicate; to show; to point out; to appoint. # (v. i.) To form a design or designs; to plan. [bold added] Just for starters, I would say that wrt biology, organisms, and biological organismic evolution, I best like the word senses that I have set out in 'bold'. ""Traceable"" in what sense? If you are implying some kind of mechanistic determinism between 'matter', as in molecules, and 'form', as in the actual organism as an operating system, then I simply have to refuse to accept your assumption. Which brings the debate back to another screeching halt. I do not believe that 'building materials' determine what actually gets built. As in 'bricks determine the shape and dimensions of a wall [or anything else] that is made of them'. I will go so far as to say that 'building materials' do limit what can or cannot be made of them. For instance, bricks are simply useless for kite construction. My main point, though, is that substances, building materials, can do nothing at all on their own. Even piles of rubble require gravity. Therefore I think it very unlikely that acid molecules decide or determine or even direct or guide other molecules so that, once you've accumulated enough molecules all strung together, you end up with an elephant or an albatross or whatever it is that these self-directed molecules turn themselves into. Which brings it all down to this--do molecules decide what to do with themselves, or does something that is not a molecule do that for them? Same point. I'll accept that genes can 'regulate' developmental biological processes. But only in the same sense of the word 'regulate' that I would apply to the thermostat on my wall wrt to room temperature, or to the 'cruise control' governor that monitors and 'regulates' my car's speed. This is what I was afraid of. You can claim that in one particular instance the 'laws' of mechanics [or chance] independently determine a certain form, and that that form determines a particular function. I have no way of knowing whether or not that claim is true. Therefore that path is closed to us. Yes, I use ""design"" in a teleological sense. I have not contrasted 'design' with 'evolution', however. Only you have done that. And you are still using the word evolution as if it were some kind of causal force. If you keep using the word that way, then it becomes interchangeable with ""Mother Nature"", or even ""God"". That just doesn't work for me. My point, above. I can accept that. Let us then agree that we will use the word 'evolution' in the sense of a developmental process in the course of which life forms become differentiated and variegated within the passage of at least two generations. Let us further agree to never commit the mortal sin of referring to 'evolution' as anything else. Do you see?!? You call it a process, which is correct, but since when does a process 'face'[implying awareness] a 'task'? Your language is still animistic, [meaning that it imputes awareness and cognition to an inanimate something--in this case an abstraction, a process. And that is reification. Let us say rather that it ""performs"" a task. The what, where, why, and how of that 'task' we can come to later, but you should be aware that even the word 'task' implies certain psychological qualities. Let us use the word 'operation' instead, shall we? You are still doing it. First, if you use words like 'target', 'goal', 'solution', 'answer' ,'objective', etc., then you are speaking teleologically. Denying it makes no difference. Trying to discuss biological evolution without speaking in teleological terms is, I suspect, impossible. So either evolution is a teleological biological process, as I suspect, or you are going to have a brutal semantic task on your hands. That sounds like 'selection' or 'choice', both of which imply a system of values, a criterion of judgment and discrimination, and of course, awareness, particularly of alternatives. All of which are mental phenomena. So I guess you'd best not use ""Natural Selection"", unless you wish to impute these qualities to Darwin's proposed 'culling'. True. But for trial and error to work without any teleology, ( i.e., randomly, relying solely upon hitting upon the 'right' answer accidentally), will, by simple mathematical probability, take more time than the universe has got! Except in single digit, [and very, very low single digit] possibilities. You are almost reduced to 'either/or' simplicity. That might work [I wouldn't know] for things as simple as atoms and molecules, but when it comes to any degree of systemic complexity, it would never work. And even bacteria, being cells, are way past being that simple. So I think we can cross that one off our list. ""Pick the best"" is pure teleology. AKA, intelligent design. Well, all this abstract and analytical thinking strikes me as anything but mechanical and/or accidental. ??

The only way to be sure is to ask the IDCreationist what he means when he uses the word. Specialized fields tend to take common words and assign a different definition. This is true of pseudo science like IDCreationism and Creation Science, as well as real science. For example, take the word ""evolution"": (from The Online Plain Text English Dictionary) Which definition you choose depends on who you are talking too and in what context. For example, if you could talk to Charles Darwin you would find that he understood the meaning of the word to be definition #1, which is why he objected so strongly to the use of the word in reference to his theories. Darwin included no sense of becoming better or more complex, and not necessarily all that different. The modern definition of evolution, the one used by evolutionary biologists, is #3a, as far as the first comma. Evolution is not necessarily always the result of natural selection as there are 5 or six other recognized mechanisms of evolution, at least three of which create the genetic variation mentioned in the dictionary definition. Moreover, development of new species is not a requirement for evolution to occur. New species may or may result in evolution - sometimes yes, sometimes no. At any rate, speciation is an observation of the actions of the mechanisms of evolution. The definition of evolution that I learned on the first day of my first class on evolution was: a change in the allele frequency in a population of organisms over generations. That's it. Of course, a paleontologist would be more likely to use definition #3b. Creationists tend to use other definitions that usually include speciation, increase in complexity, and improvement, but they always run away from defining those terms. Of course, it is typical for non-biologists to confuse the definition of evolution with events that fit the definition, and theories that explain the events. Those are all legitimate uses of the word. However, if there is no change in the genome, it isn't evolution. Moreover, even though I am several inches taller than my father was (as are my brothers), it isn't evolution. So, yes, in order to have a discussion with IDCreationists they need to define their terms. Otherwise we are free to assign our own definitions.

You could easily get around this impasse simply by replacing the word ""evolution"" in those kinds of statements with words such as ""life"", or ""biochemistry"", or rganic energy"", or something. It simply bothers the heck out of me to hear you say that evolution' is what is doing evolution. We agreed that evolution is a process. A process is not a thing that accounts for itself. Just like your example, 'walking', walking does not account for any part of walking. Walking is what it is. It cannot explain itself. So, for the last time, please stop saying that volution' does this or explains that, and choose some other word. If you do not like my suggestions, offer me one of your own and maybe I can accept it. Otherwise, this conversation cannot continue. As for teleology, it is either a part of biology or it is not. You cannot have your cake and eat it. You either abandon teleological terminology, and switch to mechanical terminology, or you admit that evolution is a teleological process. Now, there are several interpretations of the word 'teleology', some more sweeping than others. I try to keep it simple. For me, in everyday conversation, teleology is a way of explaining phenomena by their ends or purposes. Now, explaining phenomena is what science [and philosophy] is all about. I only know of three ways of explaining phenomena--a/ the teleological, b/the mechanical, and c/the supernatural. We both are content to leave c/ aside, I believe? Now that means that if we are to debate , we must take different positions. No point if we're both of the teleological persuasion, or both of the mechanical persuasion. I choose the teleological position. Therefore I shall speak in teleological terms wherever I see evidence that an end has had something to do with the achieving of that end. To show that no end, at least, no end wrt the evolutionary process, was ever accomplished by intrinsic efforts to achieve it, then you must speak in terms that never suggest that they do. But since even ""survival of the fittest"" and ""natural selection"" are both teleological, you are going to have a hard time of it. But, with all due respect, that is your problem, not mine. Language exists for the exchange of ideas, etc. It does not exist, although it is very often used to do so, in order to distort, or veil, or compromise ideas.

I'm not. What I have said is that the process of evolution involves 'this and that' and results in the biological forms we observe in nature. And if I contrived a new language for us to have this discussion, in which it was impossible to express teleological concepts, would you then be forced to admit that evolution is not a teleological process? Certainly you would not be able to say otherwise, but would your capitulation be merited? It is all but impossible to avoid suggesting teleology to someone sufficiently sensitive to its inference. Must I really tiptoe around the words 'direct' and 'guide' and choose 'channel' instead, to avoid conceding the whole debate? Is even 'channel' sufficiently ateleological a verb? The plain fact is that almost every verb, being a 'doing' word, has connotations of agency. Heck, in English there isn't even a version of 'whose' meaning 'belonging to it ' rather than to a person!

Consequently I must plod through tortuous, mind-numbing alternatives like 'environmentally-induced differential replication rates', worrying all the time whether 'induced' is going to set off alarm bells and result in an hour's carefully crafted reasoning getting brushed aside unanswered. I'll do my best, but the language we're obliged to employ is skewed in your favour. If you're determined to take ungentlemanly advantage of that, I propose we continue the debate in 68000 machine code instead In the former case, the nature of intelligence is so poorly understood that it remains to be accurately defined in anything other than circular terms, as your bolded definition exemplifies. In the latter: That is one meaning of the word, and I can hardly argue with your personal preference, but if you insist that it can be the only meaning of 'design' we employ in this discussion, we're going to have to find another word for: because that's the subject of this thread: what designing a solution to a problem actually entails. This objection can be dealt with on two levels. First - and your beliefs notwithstanding - it is the case that simulations of proteins at the molecular level, in which only the known natural forces are represented, accurately mimic their behaviour in real organisms. Second, regardless of whence we suppose the 'motive force' behind these molecules originates, it is also demonstrably the case that if the protein sequences are altered, their shape and consequently function can be altered or disrupted - and if those proteins are introduced to similar organisms lacking them, function is induced. So even if they are merely tools in the hands of a teleological force, the question of how they came to be the right tools, how 'right' they need to be, and whether variations of them could have been used for something else in the past, remains pertinent. Luckily for us they possess it, along with a number of other intermolecular forces Unlikely or not, it is proving obstinately difficult to find a definite crack into which to insert novel forces. I make no claims one way or another as to the significance of that question in absolute terms, but it is not relevant to the subject in hand. The physical structure of biological molecules is undeniably vital to their operation - for whatever reason. So the question remains: how did those molecules arise? Is the idea that they were designed plausible? To answer that question it's necessary to examine what it really means to design a solution to a problem, not just in philosophical terms but in terms of the problem-space involved and how solutions within it may be discovered. The example of the 128-bit WEP-key demonstrates that not all problems are equally tractable to intelligence. Consider again the contrast between the ease with which we two can communicate, and the impossibility of communicating with an alien whose language consists of character sequences - of the same length as English and thus representing the same amount of CSI according to ID theory - that are isolated in permutation space. You skipped the part about developmental processes evolving rather than the organism - should I take it that the point has been made? As I pointed out earlier, simulations in which only the mechanical forces are represented mimic the real-world behaviour of proteins accurately, so it's not unreasonable to proceed on that basis. Perhaps 'contrast' is the wrong word. Certainly a teleological agent could conduct an evolutionary search for a solution if it wanted to, but the point is that an evolutionary search can proceed without the need for such an agent in the specific case of self-replicating, mutating (in the general sense of 'changing') structures in an environment of limited resources. I have to ask - why? You clearly understand what I meant. I'm perfectly capable of writing ""the statistical chance of the process hypothesised to have produced the observed result actually producing it"" if absolutely necessary, but it's an awful mouthful and it doesn't clarify the point so much as obscure it with verbiage. I think the majority of readers would more readily identify with ""the scale of the task facing evolution"", and more intuitively grasp its import, without feeling the need to read too much into the teleological undertones. As I've already noted, the prevalence of terms with teleological connotations in the language we're using, and the consequent difficulty of speaking upon any topic without bumping into them, has no implications for the presence or absence of teleology in the actual subject under discussion. Semantics do not define what can be true, merely how easily and accurately truth may be described. In these matters the word ""target"" is routinely employed to mean a particular subset of a space, the reaching of which by any given process being what interests us. I plan to continue to use it in that fashion. You say 'first', but omit a second; presumably it would have contained your response to the substance of what I said, namely how the prior existence of abundant similar sequences influences the likelihood of stochastic variation hitting upon the one we're interested in. I'm not going to disagree, mainly because it doesn't matter. The fact remains that when you design something, you cull alternative solutions in the abstract. You may then produce and compare several prototypes, to see which of the solutions you thought would be good actually are good - effectively a test of how accurately your simplified abstraction of the problem modelled the reality of it. My contention here is that if the CSI possessed by a given solution is genuinely high, simplifications of the problem would be far more likely to wrongly exclude it than to find it, rendering 'design' an implausible explanation. The simple mathematical probability calculations to which you refer are apt for problems like that of the WEP key - but as we've already seen, teleology is of next to no use in such situations either. Unless, of course, you'd like to venture a guess and prove me wrong...? Trial and error does not require teleology to work within reasonable timescales. It requires three things: 1. A degree of continuity. By this I mean that successive trials must be - at least most of the time - limited variations upon previous trials. 2. A feedback mechanism resulting in trials that were more successful forming the basis for future trials more often than those that were less so. 3. A problem space in which 'success' is not binary, and which is not entirely chaotic and discontinuous. The 128-bit WEP key problem is not reducible by evolutionary means. Even if the first two criteria are satisfied by the process generating the trials, the binary nature of success prevents that process from converging upon a solution. It will indeed take longer than the universe has existed. But if the feedback mechanism reports the number of correct digits as the degree of success, and the more successful trials more often form the basis of subsequent variant trials than the less successful ones (say, changing a single digit each time), the 'perfect' solution can be found in a fraction of a second. In the case of variable self-replicating structures in an environment of limited resources, all three requirements are inherently satisfied. There is continuity: subsequent 'trial' structures are variations upon what came before. There is an inherent feedback mechanism ensuring that variations upon the more successful structures are represented more abundantly in subsequent trials - because success is reproduction. And success is not binary: there are many possible self-replicating structures; some are merely better/faster/more efficient than others. If an intelligent agent is 'picking the best', perhaps - although I'd dispute the idea that he's 'designing' anything. Recognising that something is a solution is not the same as designing one. But in the special - indeed unique - case of 'best' equating to 'best at self-replication', you don't need an external intelligence to do the picking. I refuse to fall into the trap of saying the replicators 'pick' themselves, by the way Rather, the best self-replicators will inevitably predominate in future trials. It cannot be otherwise. ID theory operates on the presumption that, until demonstrated otherwise, 3) is not satisfied, and that the evolutionary process must therefore fail to converge upon solutions. However, for a process of design to converge upon a solution, criteria comparable to 3) must be satisfied! If they are not, then no abstraction or simplification of the problem can be expected to lead to a viable solution; no guiding rule or principle exists to be intelligently noted and employed. The designer is reduced to taking pot-shots in the dark.","intelligent-designs-black-box","09:28 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","13"

That is exactly what you do have to do. Yes. It describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result, outcome, whatever but strictly to a cause/s force/s in action. That is why 'selection' is always teleological. In order to select or choose anything, an end must always be in view. There must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end. The only time ""channel"" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological. In the same way, 'sorting' can be considered non-teleological, hence mechanical, and thus suited to your glossary, because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone. But 'selection' always requires volition and awareness. So 'selection' is always teleological. ""Agency"" is not the issue. Agency is simply causality. An agency can be teleological, mechanical, or purely accidental. And of course every ""doing verb"" connotes agency, aka, causation, because we human beings have a tendency to suppose that every time something happens, that something caused it to happen. That should pose no problem for you. The only time that agency or causation should trouble you is when that agency is not accidental or strictly mechanical, but shows evidence of the end determining the means, that is the end or effect acting , at least in part, in determining itself. What, as I'm sure you know, Aristotle called a ""final"" cause. Aristotle distinguished four causesefficient, final, material, and formalthat may be illustrated by the following example: a statue is created by a sculptor (the efficient) who makes changes in marble (the material) in order to have a beautiful object (the final) with the characteristics of a statue (the formal). The only one you have to avoid is ""final"", connoted or denoted, stated or implied. That is not my understanding of the word. It is simply the possessive case of either 'who' [which is always a person] or 'which', [which does not have to be a person, but can be anything to which a property is attached. As in, ""The river, _whose_ waters originated in the hills, ..."" Their is nothing teleological in the word. Even when applied to a person, there is no connection to causation. Not only can I do so, I must do so, and so must everybody else including yourself. As I have already explained.

What a joke.","pandion","340459","Well, I incorrectly assumed that anyone attempting to enter the discussion would at least have a grasp of the most fundamental principles. It is quite strange to encounter someone in this day and age who lacks any knowledge whatsoever of the mechanism of adaptation since it was explained 150 years ago. It is one of Darwin's original hypotheses, independently arrived at by Alfred Russel Wallace. Darwin called this mechanism of adaptive change natural selection. It is based on a few simple observations and inferences. Here is how Ernst Mayr, formulator of the biological species concept and one of the evolutionary biologists responsible for the modern synthesis, put it: Darwin and Wallace realized that this process operating within species would result in organisms that appeared designed for their environment. Those organisms that possessed advantageous characteristics had a survival, and thus reproductive, advantage. If the advantageous characteristics were heritable, individuals in the next generation would also possess a reproductive advantage. That is why biologists sometimes talk about natural selection as being differential reproductive success. Natural selection was seriously debated for about 50 years before Mendel's work in genetics was rediscovered. That event supplied the missing mechanism of heredity. Darwin's theories + Mendelian genetics = modern synthesis. For 150 years, Darwin's theories have passed every test that has been devised. I know this may seem obvious to most people, but it seems to have escaped the notice of creationists. Birds are tetrapods, as are amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Birds didn't just grow wings. Wings are adaptions of the front limbs that were covered with feathers. Perhaps you are unaware of the evidence that indicates that maniraptors had feathers, probably for thermoregulation. Saying that there is no mechanism for birds to grow wings when they previously had none is like saying that there is no mechanism for mankind to grow arms when he previously had none. You see, mankind's closest relatives are the two species of chimpanzee - they are quadrupeds. And you have been so kind as to prove my point. Obviously you fail to understand. I can recommend some books for you to read to educate yourself a little. Let me know. At any rate, after extensive reading of the opinions of creationists such as Mr. Kent Hovind and Ken Ham, we truthfully characterize the creationist knowledge of science when we say:","intelligent-designs-black-box","11:39 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","17"
"01-16-2009","12214",2,"jakers","340486","Hi; I'm back, as promised. First let me say thank-you to Marc for his gracious welcome. Others have not been so kind. I can't imagine what put ""Winston Smith"" into such a snit, since Orwell's character was much concerned with semantics, and how language is twisted and bent out of shape for ideological purposes. Since I am in complete accord with, and a great admirer of, George Orwell and his work, it's quite odd to hear to hear someone using the name of one of his heroes to champion 'truthspeak'. And to quite crudely insult me personally. Is this an unmoderated board, or are the rules of good manners held in the same low esteem here as people like mr. smith hold the rules of good English? IAC, boors are never worth further notice, once they've revealed themselves. You, however, even though irritated by my insistence upon semantic honesty, have remained a gentleman. At least thus far. I'll try to finish your post, read your response to mine, and decide whether or not it will be fun to discuss this topic further, despite the hoots and catcalls . Let me give you my own definition. Intelligence is the faculty or capacity or ability to take in data from the environment, process it into meaning and significance, i.e., information wrt to a sensed 'self', an identity, and to use that information to determine, choose, and select a course of action from among alternatives, and then to record, store, [memorize]and if called upon in future, recollect [remember, re-acquire] that for previously acquired information for present application, use. I see nothing circular in it, but a great deal that is teleological. Which means you probably will not accept it. But I am a person who likes to believe that intelligence and other mental attributes are indeed actual phenomena, and not some kind of illusory epiphenomenon caused by the way in which molecules react to one another, either mechanically or accidentally. Now, if you do choose to adopt this latter position, [one much favoured in the world of 'science', apparently], and so simply and arbitrarily deny the existence of intelligence etc. because it does not fit into your philosophy, that is fair enough. But if you also wish to continue this debate with me, then you can nether denote nor connote, state or imply, that any molecular, chemical, or organismic behaviour falls under the definition that I have just given for 'intelligence', and its cognates. If you cannot do that, then I cannot continue. Well, I have no trouble with that, because it is pure, unvarnished teleology. The ""final cause"" in Aristotle's terms. As far as I am concerned, that's ""Intelligent Design"" in a nutshell. But how you can attribute planning and invention to a combination of simple mechanics and accidents is quite beyond me. Accept your own cited definition of 'design' and you argue my side for me. First, ""mimic"" is a poor choice of words [as per my continuing objections], since it denotes conscious and deliberate imitation. Now, to me anything that is intentional is teleological. I cannot attribute conscious and deliberate imitation to inanimate objects [proteins and molecules] and/or abstract concepts--only to intelligent entities. Now if you wish to say ""it is the case that simulations of proteins at the molecular level, in which only the known natural forces are represented, accurately [mirror, reflect, or resemble] their behaviour in real organisms."" Then go ahead. Those words do not imply intention, and so are not teleological. Moreover they neither surprise nor impress me. I mean what would expect mechanical things to do? Change their behaviour according to the time of day. Mechanical things never change. They always act the same, given the same set of conditions. That's why we call them 'mechanical'. Second, why in the world would it matter to me that an intelligently designed computer simulation with the laws of chemistry and atomic physics programmed into it should accurately mirror those same principles in the 'real' world?!? What's your point? Absolutely. Indeed, it is the very issue that we are debating, so it couldn't be more pertinent. The ""how"", that is the causation of biological evolution, the mechanism/force/agency that drives it and accounts for its existence in the realworld, is exactly what we are debating. I am saying that it is 'something' that is 'intelligent' and 'designing', i.e., something intentional and willful and aware. You are supposed to be arguing the opposite--that the 'how' of evolution is simple physical mechanics combined with its opposite, pure chance. I do not remember 'that part'. But I know that I would and do disagree with it. First of, for me, as I stated at the outset, evolution is all about the development of divergent lifeforms, i.e., organisms, over at least two or more generations. Developmental processes are are part and parcel of being a lifeform, i.e., organism. There is no, 'either/or'. I don't communicate all that well with codfish and clams, either, but what has that got to do with anything at all?!?!? That doesn't make me unintelligent. More importantly, it doesn't make codfish or clams unintelligent, either. I simply don't see what you are trying to get at. There used to be a 'caveman' comic in the papers wherein one character had invented the wheel, Except that his 'wheel' was a perfectly square rock. The humour being that he didn't seem to realize that only round, circular things can function as wheels. That is all I meant by form limits function. I don't remember saying that it 'determines' function, but only that it 'regulates' it, or constrains the 'function' possibilities open to it. What Aristotle would, I think, call a 'formal cause'. Such as trying to construct a fire using sand and water. The materials do not determine a fire but they do limit the possibilities thereof. Thank heaven, or we'd all go up in smoke. It may not be unreasonable, but for me its boring. I am not interested in discussing the mechanics of molecular chemistry. I only want to discuss the evolution of life forms. Now, if you believe that organisms are nothing more than a collection of chemically interacting molecules, that's fine. But I don't. Nor do I have to simply take your word for it. Your job in this debate is to prove to me that this, your premise, is true. I am not going to allow you to 'beg the question' by accepting your premise/conclusion as a given. True. But don't put those words in my mouth. It's up to you to find an honest way to express your ideas coherently and intelligibly. Ever since Darwin biologists have anthropomorphized the process of evolution. After over 150 years of misuse the general public, particularly those who attended the right schools, may 'intuitively' accept it, but they are wrong [no fault of theirs] to do so. Evolution is a process, not the agent or agency driving that process. So appeals to popularity are unacceptable. So you say. I disagree. Semantically-speaking, that's quite the circular statement you just made, since, in semantic terms, 'defining' and 'describing accurately' mean the same thing. Semantics is the science of determining the truth relation between a word and its meaning. That is, the 'true meaning' of a given word, symbol, whatever. IOW, you intend to use teleological words illegitimately, to express non-teleological mechanics. That's too bad. I was enjoying this. True. It is called, ""intelligent design"". It is exactly what I am arguing in favour of, re evolution. So how can it not matter?!? The contrary is true. If I understand [and I'm not sure that I do] your concept, 'complex specified information', than any search process must eventually come to a ' best' solution, if any such solution exists. The trouble is, that purely randomly generated 'possible solutions' will never achieve anything unless there is some very good luck involved, or the number of possible solutions allowed for trial boil down to 'either/or', or close to it. My contention is that organisms are not presented with 'either/or solutions to the real world problem of adaptation and survival in an environment composed of much CSI. That in fact, random 'try and try and try again' just won't cut it there. Simplification of a problem does not exclude its solution unless the 'problem solver' does not recognize it before it excludes it. Anything without awareness, values, and powers of discrimination will limit the complexity by comparing the solution with the problem, and chucking the failures out, until the problem/solution ratio gets very close to either/or. But with these qualities we are talking a 'goal-directed' i.e., teleological, process of elimination, in which 'good' solutions are kept, and 'poor' solutions are discarded, as the 'search space' is simplified by this intelligence-dependent culling process. How do you propose that "" limited variations upon previous trials"" take place, other than teleologically, as above? Random chance does not limit variations, and pure mechanics does not permit variation. If you can answer this question, could you please furnish an example for clarification? All ""feedback mechanisms"" are teleological, as above. This I agree with. Sorry. I've tried to figure out what you are trying to say, ""the binary nature of success prevents that process from converging upon a solution"" but I cannot. True. And that is what teleological processes are all about. Mechanical generation/chance elimination processes have no feed-back mechanisms, because they have no awareness of what they are doing, or why. True, but teleology dependent. 'Recognizing' is integral to 'designing'. There is no designing without awareness and intent. You can recognise something you did not design, but you cannot design anything that you cannot recognise. True. But the statement is vacuous, tautological, a truism, a mere statement of fact, explaining nothing. It speaks only to outcome, not to cause, and not to process. To become meaningful you must establish a verifiable connection between the fact/result that 'Tom won the race.', and the reason/s for why and how he did so. Well if that's so, then it is not my ""ID"" theory you're talking about, since your third condition was in fact the only one I accepted. My point exactly. Couldn't have put it better myself. that's teleological problem solving, versus mechanics plus random accident [pot shots in the dark] problem solving, right there. Well, it has been a long pull, much longer than I like, but I've finished my reply. As I said, unless you stop using teleology as if it were mechanics plus chance, by using teleological language and example as if they demonstrated chemical mechanics plus random chance, then I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree. Which won't be all bad, given that some very disagreeable types have attached themselves to this thread. Been good talking to you, though. Thanks.","Winston Smith","340514","Obviously you know absolutely nothing about the theory of evolution, luck and chance are not the engines of evolution. we have mutations and those random mutation which give an organism a reproductive advantage over the rest get passed on.

"01-16-2009","12214",2,"The Barbarian","340495","I think you're right. So how about this... Let Darwinism loose in an electronics lab and just watch what it creates. A lean, mean machine that nobody understands. Clive Davidson reports ""GO!"" barks the researcher into the microphone. The oscilloscope in front of him displays a steady green line across the top of its screen. ""Stop!"" he says and the line immediately drops to the bottom. Between the microphone and the oscilloscope is an electronic circuit that discriminates between the two words. It puts out 5 volts when it hears ""go"" and cuts off the signal when it hears ""stop"". It is unremarkable that a microprocessor can perform such a task--except in this case. Even though the circuit consists of only a small number of basic components, the researcher, Adrian Thompson, does not know how it works. He can't ask the designer because there wasn't one. Instead, the circuit evolved from a ""primordial soup"" of silicon components guided by the principles of genetic variation and survival of the fittest. Apparently, the device works by some so-far-unrecognized effect that can't be nailed down to anything happening in an individual component. The researcher who set up the environment in which this solution evolved has no idea how it actually works. He doesn't recognize the solution. So who did design this rather complex gadget?","jakers","340521","Hi; It doesn't sound all that 'complex', and it is not a 'gadget', it is simply a phenomenon. Phenomena do not need to be designed; they can merely happen,-- provided no physical laws are broken. Now, if and when this phenomenon is shown to serve a purpose, to have a function, then you can start pre-supposing a 'designer' of some kind. Until then it's just an unexplained physical event, nothing more. I wonder if it can be repeated under modified arrangements?","intelligent-designs-black-box","09:52 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","21"
"01-17-2009","12214",2,"iangb","340559","Three immediate responses to this: 1. What prevents an organism from being viewed as a 'phenomenon'? A human (or any other organism, really) is only born into life with a 'purpose' if you accept religion, or if a purpose is bestowed upon them. 2. A circuit which can recognise verbal commands sounds highly useful for all sorts of purposes. With regards to the OP: it's an excellent post and made for very interesting reading. Would it be be a fair paraphrase of the final argument to say that ""The designer implied by ID advocates is an entity which must be able to predict the outcome of an emergent system, when given the initial conditions""? If this is the case, then practically the only entity matching the description would be, not a designer, but a D esigner. Yet this would be a Designer strangely limited - by the constraints of the initial possibilities, and by the constraints of the emergent process (see also, the Incompetent Design arguments). Good food for thought.","jakers","340569","True. You can choose any 'a priori' position on existence, life, humanity, you name it. If, as Materialists/Positivists do, you elect to believe that everything is ultimately purposeless, meaningless, and absurd, you have every right to do so. Yes, it does. It might even render 'the Clapper' obsolete . But until some intelligent human designer finds a useful app for it, and builds it, it remains nothing more than a curiosity. If it's me that your asking, I will speak only for myself, and no other ""ID advocate"". My answer is no. The designer need only be aware of present conditions, including its own abilities and the attributes of any encountered problem. For example, suppose that I am an angler, and one day I notice that trout are 'taking' a certain insect, but ignoring every artificial fly I cast to them. Now, is I pick up a specimen of what it is they are eating, then I can 'design' a fly to match, provided that a/I know how to tie a fishing fly, and b/ I have the materials necessary to the design and construction of this particular fly. If I did, and do, there is still no guarantee that I'll catcha fish. I may have to fiddle with my model if they are being really, really picky, and even then they may simply stop biting altogether. There's no need for me to ""know"" that one or more fish must bite my fly. I don't know what ""Incompetent Design"" arguments are.","intelligent-designs-black-box","12:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","23"
"01-17-2009","12214",2,"iangb","340591","In that case, your position falls apart. You've essentially said here that the only things which need a 'designer' are those things that are used for a purpose. To come at that conclusion from a different direction: Man has no purpose, therefore man can be viewed as a phenomenon, therefore Man does not need to be designed. I would argue that the 'purpose' of the circuit has already been fulfilled - it's purpose was to show that irreducibly complex entities can be created without the interference of an intelligent agency. Does something has to be 'useful' in order to have a purpose? Furthermore, it's not too big a mental leap to imagine the scientist going on to 'breed in' other components. Many 'useful apps' could be created in this way - for example, the 'evolved watch' that I linked to above is an example. For this analogy to be correct, you must already know the appearance of what you are trying to create - in this case, the specimen that you have just picked up. This doesn't work for ID, unless you are proposing that the designers copied life already existent. That begs the question of how the original life came about.","jakers","340619","""My"" philosophical position does not 'fall apart' simply because somebody else subscribes to a different view. That is a Materialist/Positivist argument. I am not at all a Materialist/Positivist; the very opposite, in fact. They are allowed to believe that nothing needs to be designed, including human beings, but I am not compelled to concede that their supposition is correct. Like Materialist ontology, you are allowed to assume anything you please. Such as, this phenomenon fulfills its purpose simply by existing. But, as above, I have every right to deny your assumption, and I do. First of all, whose 'purpose' are you referring to? After all , among its meanings, the word 'purpose' has two that apply in this case-a/an anticipated outcome that is intended or that guides your [or somebody's or something's] planned actions and b/ what something is used for. At present the 'circuit is used for nothing, it simply is, so that's b/ eliminated. Therefore a/ applies, or would if the 'circuit' -[that is, the strange phenomenon it displays]- hadn't been a totally unanticipated accident. But it was, so the word 'purpose' has no application wrt it. No. There are other legitimate senses/applications for the word, 'purpose', including a/, as given above. An anticipated or intended outcome need not be 'useful' in the usual sense of the word, 'useful'. For instance, you can pick a wild flower and then discard it. The acts are intentional and deliberate, but there is no way that anything 'useful' has been accomplished; not unless you stretch the meaning of the word 'useful' to include just about anything and everything that anybody ever does. And I've already told you that once an app has been found for it, the app will be intelligently designed. Yes, to some extent it is necessary to have at least a notion of what qualities the solution will need. The problem itself will provide the 'clues' as to what its solution will require. And it is not necessary to know exactly and precisely what the solution must be in every detail. As with the insect, you do not have to create a real insect--a fair facsimile will usually fill the bill. Nor do you have to examine a specimen under a microscope in order to know enough to create an artificial that 'works'. But to the extent that in order to design something, or to solve a problem, or whatever, you must have at least some idea of what the end result will be, according to the requirements built into the situation or problem itself. The better and truer the preconception, the quicker and easier to get the job done. But that does not mean that you cannot solve a problem starting with only the germ of an idea. Of course, if the problem gives you no clue to any conceivable solution, you're pretty much out of luck. You can try 'potshots in the dark' , but unless you are miraculously lucky, that approach will get you nowhere. Well, I do believe that all designers work from prior experience, their own or something they've learned from somebody else. Going to 'the original' from a base of 'the established'. I do not believe that novelty pops out of nowhere and nothing. And yes, in terms of biology, it does call up the question of how life arose on earth, with the implication that life on earth is based on something else, somewhere else. But let us leave the issue of genesis aside while we deal with the mechanism/s of evolution. Most proponents of chemical, mechanical mechanisms for evolution tend to object to connecting genesis and evolution, preferring to view them as two separate issues. I do not, but that's just me, and in a debate on evolution I have no need to bring up genesis unless forced to do so by my opponents.

"01-18-2009","12214",2,"iangb","340685","It would not fall apart if this were a philosophical discussion. However, given that the argument is concerning the scientific merits of ID - and given that one needs to ascribe a metaphysical property such as 'purpose' to something in order to call it Intelligently Designed, your argument falls apart from a scientific points of view - if purely by Ockham's Razor. Surely b/ does apply - the circuit has been used for something? For the simplest of examples, it has been used as a talking point in this discussion. So if nothing changed about the app, but a purpose had been found for it, then it's status would change from 'intelligently evolved' (to coin a phrase) to 'intelligently designed'? Does this mean that if I use a rock to break open a coconut, that rock was intelligently designed? You seem to be under the impression that creation of an organism works something like the 'creature creator' in Spore , where the designer chooses the appropriate limbs and macroscopic features, and the microscopic features (how the creature actually 'works') sort themselves out. However, this isn't the case. Features of an organism are the result of an emergent process where the microscopic controls the macroscopic, not the other way around - and this is the argument of the OP - that reverse-engineering an emergent system such as this is incredibly difficult. An analogy presents itself. Imagine you have a running pinball machine, but you are not allowed to interact with it beyond choosing the initial speed of the pinball as it is shot into the mechanisms - the paddles/flippers work automatically on a timer. Your challenge - what you are assuming an intelligent designer could do - is to work out how fast to throw out the ball in order to get a specific score. While it is technically possible, actually doing it is near-impossible. All you are left with is to take 'potshots in the dark' of varying speeds and hope that you will strike it lucky. Apologies, I think you misunderstood me. By the 'original life', I do not mean the 'original human' or 'original organism-of-your-choice'. Instead, I mean the origins of the organism that humanity (or other organism) was based upon . Another analogy; you can buy plastic snowflake replicas as a form of confetti, or for decorative purposes. The plastic snowflakes are made by intelligent design based on the appearance of an actual snowflake. But someone looking at the origins of snowflakes would then ask how the actual snowflake came about - the fact that the plastic copy is a replica does not discuss the origins of the original. It's the 'did the intelligent designers evolve' argument, reformatted to be 'did the lifeforms that earthly organisms are based on evolve'.","jakers","340707","Well, so? This _is_ a philosophical discussion. No, it does not, since your self-titled ""scientific point of view"" is in fact based upon the metaphysical, 'a priori', philosophical pre-suppositions and basic ontological assumptions intrinsic to Materialism/Positivism. What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, my friend. You want the world to believe, as you do, that only world view that falls somewhere under the general heading of ""MATERIALISM"" can be called ""science"". You want the world to presuppose that only the mechanics/chance explanations of reality accepted by Materialism are 'scientific'. Well, you are entitled tothat opinion as far as your private life is concerned, but when you try to evangelize or impose that opinion on others, you best be prepared for the fact that, unlike you, that do not simply take it for granted. Simply labeling mental/psychological properties 'metaphysical' does not make them any less scientific than gravity, electro-magnetism, or any other phenomenon that can onlt be observed obliquely, via its effects upon things material, corporeal, and substantial. So unless you wish to confess that 'gravity' is a metaphysical concept [it is not] then you can stop trying to pretend that intelligence, volitition, motivation, etc., are ""merely"" metaphysical, mere ""objects of philosophy"" and ""unscientific"", I suggest that you drop this line of argumentation, because it's a loser. I have as much respect for ""Ockham's Razor"" as anyone, but per mit me to point out to you that, as was memorably put in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", ""It's not really a 'law', anyway. More like a 'guideline'."" But more to the point, what does ""Ochkams Razor"" have to do with disproving a non-materialist philosophy or disqualifying the presence of intelligence and volition in live organisms from the realm of scientific inquiry? That is not and was not the point. Simply because somebody can find a 'use' for something, thus endowing it with a telic purpose, does not mean that something had to be, perforce, intelligently designed and teleologically purposeful in its own creation. A boulder can drive in a tent peg, thus serving a telic purpose, but that bould was neither created nor generated so that, one happy day, it might get to act as a hammer. Are you following me so far? What ""app""? All you have so far is a curiosity, and unexplained phenomenon. Finding a purpose/use for it is an act of intelligent design, which has not, so far as you or I know, yet been done. I've already been over all of this in my earlier post to you, and I really do not enjoy repeating myself. I would say that where biology is concerned, you can put it either way and still be correct. See above. I had not seen your example before offering mine, [I compose my responses as I read posts, in order to save time, line by line] so it's quite amusing that they are so similar, don't you think? Well, you have me at a disadvantage because I have never seen ""Spore"", and probably never will. I have no idea what a 'creature creator' is supposed to be, except that it sounds as anthropomorphic as Dawkins' ""Blind Watchmaker"", or ""Mother Nature"", or ""The Great Flying Spaghetti Monster"" or whatever, and anthropomorphism plays no part in my view of the universe, including my explanation for the reality of the evolutionary process.evolution. If you want to anthropomorphise, then just say ""God"", or, ""the gods"", and be done with it. Yes, I'm quite sure that it isn't! Nice word, ""emergent"", but subject to much misuse. What do you think it means, when you use it? I know that that is, or was the original premise for the OP. I disagree with that premise, which is why I am here. I would say next to impossible if you start from a flawed philosophical premise. Begin with wrong basic idea in your head, and only much good luck will lead you to the right answer. First you have to know which part is the cart and which part is the horse. Here's my opinion--molecules, including genes, are the cart, not the horse. Well, it may be a wonderful analogy,-- but not to anything I envision or propose. In fact, it seems to be perfectly analogous to your model of evolution's mechanism more than anything else. That is-- A random mutagen whacks a gene, creating a molecular 'mutation', after which pre-programmed developmental 'flippers' may or may not, depending upon happy coincidence, rack up a good score [positive fitness] for you. No, I didn't misunderstand you. That is what I referred to, as well. Actually, I thought that I had made that quite clear. Obviously, but what's your point? I've never claimed otherwise. The 'plastic copy' or 'replica' is the process of biological inheritance. I never confuse 'inheritance', i.e., self-replication, conservation of form over time and generation, for creation; that is, the generation of the original forms, contrary to the mechanisms of inheritance/replication/manufacture of copies. If all we had we inheritance, we could have no evolution. So evolution, the process of creating novelty, originality, and diversity, is the direct opposite of conservative genetic inheritance. You can't have 'genes' doing both things at once, when these processes are in direct opposition to each other. Push/pull.

Your job in this debate is to prove to me that this, your premise, is true. I am not going to allow you to 'beg the question' by accepting your premise/conclusion as a given. (the prevalence of terms with teleological connotations in the language we're using, and the consequent difficulty of speaking upon any topic without bumping into them, has no implications for the presence or absence of teleology in the actual subject under discussion.) So you say. I disagree. Semantically-speaking, that's quite the circular statement you just made, since, in semantic terms, 'defining' and 'describing accurately' mean the same thing. Semantics is the science of determining the truth relation between a word and its meaning. That is, the 'true meaning' of a given word, symbol, whatever. IOW, you intend to use teleological words illegitimately, to express non-teleological mechanics. That's too bad. I was enjoying this. (when you design something, you cull alternative solutions in the abstract. ) True. It is called, ""intelligent design"". It is exactly what I am arguing in favour of, re evolution. So how can it not matter?!? (if the CSI possessed by a given solution is genuinely high, simplifications of the problem would be far more likely to wrongly exclude it than to find it, rendering 'design' an implausible explanation.) The contrary is true. If I understand [and I'm not sure that I do] your concept, 'complex specified information', than any search process must eventually come to a ' best' solution, if any such solution exists. My contention is that organisms are not presented with 'either/or solutions to the real world problem of adaptation and survival in an environment composed of much CSI. Simplification of a problem does not exclude its solution unless the 'problem solver' does not recognize it before it excludes it. How do you propose that "" limited variations upon previous trials"" take place, other than teleologically, as above? Random chance does not limit variations, and pure mechanics does not permit variation. If you can answer this question, could you please furnish an example for clarification? All ""feedback mechanisms"" are teleological, as above. Sorry. I've tried to figure out what you are trying to say, ""the binary nature of success prevents that process from converging upon a solution"" but I cannot. True. And that is what teleological processes are all about. Mechanical generation/chance elimination processes have no feed-back mechanisms, because they have no awareness of what they are doing, or why. 'Recognizing' is integral to 'designing'. (The best self-replicators inevitably predominate in future generations) True. But the statement is vacuous, tautological, a truism, a mere statement of fact, explaining nothing. It speaks only to outcome, not to cause, and not to process. To become meaningful you must establish a verifiable connection between the fact/result that 'Tom won the race.', and the reason/s for why and how he did so. Well if that's so, then it is not my ""ID"" theory you're talking about, since your third condition was in fact the only one I accepted. My point exactly. Couldn't have put it better myself. that's teleological problem solving, versus mechanics plus random accident [pot shots in the dark] problem solving, right there.","Peeling","340800","RE: jakers Once again, before I address the issues there are a couple of points to clarify: First, as regards my use of terms with teleological implications, as I've said I will do my best to accommodate your request for disambiguation. I am also happy to be corrected on the occasions when I slip up. All I ask in return is that such corrections are not employed in lieu of addressing the point I'm making. If you can correct my choice of words, you have clearly understood what I was trying to say - which means you can answer it. This isn't a formal debate; it's not about winning. It's about exchanging ideas and talking them through. Secondly, my use of teleological terms is deliberate when I reference intelligent design, so there is no need to correct me, or to imply that I am unwittingly strengthening your case. So... you don't employ the dictionary definition either? In any case, the definition of intelligence - incorporating teleology or otherwise - isn't relevant here. What concerns us is design - specifically, the fact that the degree to which a design process can reduce a problem depends upon the problem . This is what I was talking about in my preface: I'm not trying to argue that design isn't teleological. For the purposes of this discussion, I don't care one way or the other. It's irrelevant. Good! Gosh, I didn't expect that to be resolved so speedily. We've established that your earlier refusal to talk about the real-world behaviour of complex proteins in ateleological terms is unwarranted. Their sequence determines their physical form and thus their chemical interactions. So we return to the original question: if a given sequence is as complex and specific and isolated as ID theory would have us believe, is it reasonable to assume a design process produced it? Actually, no I'm not. What I'm talking about, here in this thread, are the demonstrable limitations of design processes. I'm discussing a flaw in ID theory. Now who's playing fast and loose with semantics? The process by which an organism grows is not itself 'an organism'. True - because you have not yet grasped what this discussion is about. I'm not trying to prove you're unintelligent. Indeed, the fact that you are intelligent is central to my argument. You are intelligent, yet some problems are demonstrably no more tractable to you than they are to evolutionary processes. You've actually quoted and responded to yourself there As I said, you haven't understood what's being discussed. I don't have to prove organisms are nothing more than chemically interacting molecules. Whatever the motive force , it is demonstrably the case that the sequence and consequent form of biological molecules such as proteins are vital to their operation. A key must fit a lock in order to turn, regardless of whether the torsional force is applied by a teleological agent or otherwise. Now, ID's reasoning is that the more CSI can be measured - the more complex the key and the more precisely-milled it must be before it will turn one iota - the less likely an evolutionary process is to have produced it. And that's true. However, their simultaneous assumption that a design process is always a plausible explanation for CSI is demonstrably false, as the WEP-key problem demonstrates. I'm sure you do, but the question is: why? Earlier, I posed a hypothetical: if I were to contrive a language absent all teleological terms and insist we employ it in our discussion, would you consider your inevitable capitulation fair and justified? Would you consider yourself proven wrong? You dodged the question without supplying an answer, but I can't imagine it would be 'yes'. Yet here you are, unrepentantly enjoying the semantic high ground and entirely prepared to declare a logical victory thence. Forgive me if I don't entirely buy your story that it stems from an altruistic concern for the English language Oh deary me, no. Historically Pi has been defined as '3', '25/8' and umpteen other values. Are any of those 'accurate descriptions' of the real value? Semantics define truth within the context of the language, but there is no necessary correspondence with truth in the real world. I can hardly believe you would acknowledge Orwell and claim otherwise in the same thread! Oh, sure - but what a word means doesn't itself have to represent real-world truth to any degree of accuracy. At one point Pi 'meant' three. That doesn't make three the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. It isn't an illegitimate use of a teleological word. I'm employing a scientific term in a teleologically agnostic context. I explained that from the outset in order to avoid confusion. This isn't confusion: this is just you being awkward Because all you care about is whether or not the process is teleological. Which is irrelevant here. What's relevant is to what degree the process can reduce a given problem. CSI is not my concept, but that of ID theorists. It supposedly measures how long 'eventually' is likely to be in the case of evolutionary processes, by assuming that at least one of the criteria necessary for convergence is lacking. Quite true - in fact, this is vital to the success of evolutionary processes. But that's the point: if the 'problem solver' were able to individually consider every solution his simplification culls, he wouldn't need the simplification, would he? He can't recognise a solution if he doesn't consider it, and he's employing the simplification because considering all solutions is impractical. According to ID theory high quantities of CSI mean that a given structure we see in nature is isolated in a vast sea of similar but useless alternatives - precisely the kind of solution most likely to be wrongly excluded by a simplification or abstraction of the problem. A 'for instance': suppose that in terms of streamlined shapes, a quirk of nature meant that a large, straight-sided box with a tiny dimple in one precise location on one side is the ultimate aerodynamically perfect shape. If the dimple is anywhere else, or if there's more than one, the effect disappears. Now, no designer could ever find that solution. He would observe various patterns and construct abstract models of the problem, all of which would quickly eliminate anything like a big square box. So if we were to actually observe that shape in nature, we would have no grounds for claiming that it could have been designed, right? Now, according to ID theory, organisms are packed full of molecular structures analogous to that dimpled box. So how can we possibly infer a design process? Genetic mutation. Genes are inherited unchanged for the most part, and the number of random changes that do occur is limited by the local levels of mutagens (eg radiation, chemicals or retroviruses). Thus each subsequent generation (or 'trial') inherently consists of variations on previous trials rather than entirely new random genomes. Incorrect. As noted further down, self-replication constitutes a feedback mechanism: the mere existence, extinction or abundance of a 'next generation' generated by a particular variant constitutes feedback from the environment. Teleology need not apply. Nothing needs to want to self-replicate; nothing needs to want to achieve some particular evolutionary goal, or be intelligently choosing a direction for the process. There is only variation, and the consequent replication (of varying levels of abundance), or failure to replicate. I'll try to explain: Given an arbitrary 128 digit binary number, another, purely random 128 digit binary number (which I'll call the 'seed' number) will, statistically speaking, have about 64 digits that match. Purely random variation of the seed (changing one random digit at a time) will cause that total to wander up and down. The higher it gets, the more likely random variation is to change a matching digit to a non-matching one. The lower it gets, the more likely the reverse is to occur. The expected number of generations for a purely random 'walk', as this is known, to reach 128 matching digits is therefore enormous. With me so far? Now imagine instead of one seed random number from which the random walk proceeds, there are two, and further imagine that the most 'successful' trial in one generation forms the basis for both trials in the next. Or, if both trials are equally successful, both are represented. If success is binary, as it is in the WEP-key problem (either yes, all digits match, or no, not all digits match) then both trials in each generation are almost certain to fail equally. So they each form the basis of one trial in the next generation, and so the two random walks continue side by side, neither of them likely to generate a fully matching sequence. They'll just meander around an equilibrium point of 64 matching digits until the heat-death of the universe. But what if success is not binary? What if 'success' is the number of matching digits? Now the process operates as a kind of ratchet. The 'best' random seed forms the basis of both the second generation trials. Now, either both random variants thereof will have one more matching digit (approx 25% chance at this stage), one will have one more and one will have one less (approx 50% chance), or both will have one less (25% chance). In all but the last case, the third generation will have more matching digits than the second. Our random walk now has a statistical bias towards more and more matching digits. But the effect of that bias is limited. When the number of matching digits reaches about 90, the odds of both subsequent trials having fewer matching digits reaches 50%, and the process reaches a new equilibrium. If the process includes three seeds, the equilibrium point becomes 101 matching digits. A fourth, and it's 107. A hundred seeds, and the equilibrium point of the process is 127 matching digits, at which point randomly hitting 128 is all but inevitable. That's why non-binary success is necessary for an evolutionary process to converge: it provides the statistical bias needed for the process to 'ratchet'. Again, you are simply incorrect in this belief. The relative rates at which variants self-replicate constitutes feedback all on its own. Awareness of a goal is redundant. But it is not design. Once again, you play fast and loose with semantics. You incorrectly described a process as 'intelligent design' in which the trials were random and only the recognition of success occurred. Again, I ask you: if 'success' is self-replication, what need is there for an intelligence to 'recognise' that success? What's the intelligence going to do, exactly? ""Ah, that mechanism self-replicated better than the others; I will therefore make it more abundant in the next generation so as to... oh. It already is more abundant. I'll just let it get on with it, then."" Well, I'm not about to get into a semantic wrangle about tautologies being vacuous. You agree that what I describe is inevitable, and that's enough. What differential reproductive rates explain is how random variations that happen to improve rather than impede self-replication in the local environment can accumulate - stack with one another - in individuals of successive generations, even though each such change may itself be a million-to-one shot. What differential reproductive rates explain is why you are wrong in your belief that the odds are too great for species to evolve undirected. My dear chap, it can hardly be my fault that you decided to enter a discussion about an ID theory that isn't yours. I really don't think that can be your point, since you still seem to believe that teleology is a magic bullet when it comes to problem-solving. I've provided two examples of comparatively simple problems where intelligence yields next to no advantage - upon what grounds do you claim that the biochemistry of living organisms is any different?","intelligent-designs-black-box","11:03 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","28"

I can only understand what you truly mean, and respond to what you truly mean, when you use language that agrees with what you truly mean. That has been my point all along. And it is not that difficult to express scientific concepts in terms that are mechanical, not telic. I have shown you this more than once already. All you have to do is avoid words that necessarily imply or denote awareness and intention on the part of the subject, whenever/wherever that subject is not a living or sentient entity. Like the man says, ""It's not rocket science!"" No, it's not about 'winning', but we cannot exchange ideas unless and until those ideas are expressed in language appropriate to them.

Not if you refuse to accept the dictionary definition, but the word in question needs to be defined or all discussion comes to a grinding halt! I'm sorry, and I regret it if I offend you, but is pure nonsense. Without a mutually acceptable definition for intelligence we have absolutely no way of discussing 'intelligent',-- nor 'design', come right down to it. As above, 'design', as an active verb, always entails intelligence of some kind. That much is undeniable. Then let us proceed on the basis that 'design' is always and everywhere, teleological, i.e., 'intelligent'. Since that fact doesn't matter to you. Now all you have to do is show that complex processes that produce or serve someone's or something's purposes, that accomplish the ends of that which is external to themselves, can arise by mechanics plus chance in cases where that something is inanimate and insentient. Such as in the case of a 'gene', a 'molecule' or 'evolution', per se. I'm sorry, my faculties are not what they used to be. I often express myself poorly or simply commit mistakes. Added to which, my memory is more like a sieve than anything else. So maybe that is why I have no recollection of ever refused to allow any discussion of insentient articles, particles, or processes in _ateleological_, i.e., in mechanical terms. I do not believe that I have ever done so, but if I did, I did not mean to do so, and simply made a slip of the tongue. Can you quote the statement wherein I am supposed to have made this error, back to me? I will thank you for it. I have no real understanding of what these words mean, but so long as you do not imply that their 'sequence' is in any way 'self-aware' or 'self- intentional' or 'self-directed', but is simply and strictly an event determined by something external to themselves [such as an inflexible physical 'law'], we'll have no problem. We can discuss where and how the laws of physics arose, some other time. [quote] This is what I was afraid of. What, exactly, are you referring to when you use the word, ""sequence""?!? Are you trying to slip it into the discussion as if it were synonymous with the word 'system', or even 'process'? Because it it is not, and I will not accept it as such. This is what the noun, 'sequence' means-- noun: film consisting of a succession of related shots that develop a given subject in a movie noun: a following of one thing after another in time (""The doctor saw a sequence of patients"") noun: several repetitions of a melodic phrase in different keys noun: serial arrangement in which things follow in logical order or a recurrent pattern (""The sequence of names was alphabetical"") noun: the action of following in order (""He played the trumps in sequence"") [ I have put that which I think pertinent to your use in bold, and these are the only senses in which I will accept the usage of this noun.] And in answer to your question, anything, even random chance, can create a 'sequence' of events, when you mean nothing more than one event following after another. For and orderly, iterated, repeatable, predictable series of events, you need, at minimum, the 'laws' of physics,[even though that explanation is tautological, since that is what the laws of physics are, themselves]. Well, I guess that is why we are at cross-purposes, since it is obvious to me that whatever ""Intelligent Design Theory"" you are referring to, it is not my own understanding of intelligence and design at work in the evolutionary process. In addition, no matter to whom this theory of which you speak properly belongs, [I believe it is that of William Dembski [sp.?], whose opinions I have seldom read, and do not usually accept;-at least not as he frames them.], unless we can forget about that and concentrate on my own opinions, we will continue to fail to understand each other.

It's just unecessarily time-consuming, given that this discussion isn't about teleology. You seem think the only question that matters is whether the process of evolution is teleological or not, but that isn't the exact subject in hand. Well, since I'm not, and you know full well I'm not, what's the problem? If I may say so, you seem awfully eager for that to happen On the contrary. We have no need to thrash out a priori definitions because my basic argument is a posteriori : there exist problems that intelligence is of little or no help in solving. Equivalently, there are problems no design process can reduce. I really don't. In a completely different discussion, sure, but not this one. I'm only touching upon that issue to correct some fairly major misconceptions you have about evolutionary processes. Here you go: and: In response to these objections, I pointed out that simulations of the interacting molecules in question, employing only known physical forces, mirrored their behaviour in real organisms. Dont fret so much! The 'sequence' in question is the sequence of base pairs in a DNA strand, which determines the sequence of amino acids in the protein derived from that strand, the chemical interactions between which determine how it folds and therefore its stable three-dimensional shape. A shape which - even if we suppose it doesn't determine the nature of its interactions with other molecules in the organism - is demonstrably vital for those interactions to proceed as they do. True enough. I'm not completely sure what your understanding is at this stage, but one thing seems clear: you do treat teleology as a magic bullet. It's never occurred to you to wonder what its limitations might be, in terms of the problems it can reduce (ie help solve). Well, yes and no. The OP highlights a specific problem with the concept of CSI, how it's measured, and why CSI cannot be assumed to be a marker for intelligent design. And it does so quite straightforwardly by demonstrating that there are problems requiring a solution of modest CSI that intelligence is of no practical help in solving. But a corollary of this is the more general observation that intelligence is not always useful, and I think that does speak to your opinions on the subject.

"01-22-2009","12214",3,"jakers","341015","I know that an organism's development is not a separate and distinct organism, per se. I know that that it is a part of every organism, that it is an essential property of all organisms. To suggest otherwise, that a 'developmental process' can be examined as if it were more than simply one part of being an organism, is playing with semantics. Excuse me for my ignorance, but I have no idea what ""WEP-key problem"" is. I don't even know what the the WEP-Key is, let alomne what is problematical about it, let alone how in any way it makes the plausibility of the necessity of intelligent design in the creation of a sophisticated 'key/lock system' somehow dubious or suspect. (Would you consider yourself legitimately proven wrong if we employed a language devoid of teleological terms in our discussion, forcing you to lose) Of course, if what we were discussing was part of any reality in which teleology was absent. But since that is not our reality, nor even a part of our reality, your hypothetical is impertinent to our discussion. Yes, if you are asking me if Pi has been 'described accurately', or not. No one said anything about describing anything perfectly, completely, and absolutely. Until they do, 'defining' something and 'describing it accurately' are effectively synonymous. I pointed out that ... there is _no necessary connection_ between semantic expressions and true meanings Trying to discuss biological evolution without speaking in teleological terms is, I suspect, impossible. So either evolution is a teleological biological process, as I suspect, or you are going to have a brutal semantic task on your hands. ( Using the term 'target' in a teleologically agnostic context) ""Teleologically agnostic""?!? In a debate over teleology is or is not present in biological evolution!?! I have no idea how you can claim that intelligent design is irrelevant to any understanding of complexity in systematics, language, biology, or any other context in which complex specified information is generated. As I've said, the farther you get from a simple 'either/or', yes or no', 'heads or tails' problem, the greater the degree of teleology necessary to effect any satisfactory solution to a problem. Well, I do not know what their ""criteria"" are nor do I know what they mean by ""convergence"" wrt to evolution or the generation of complex specified information. So until someone explains that to me, and I evaluate that information, I can make no comment upon it. The whole point of simplification is to eliminate the time and energy necessary to the consideration of impertinent possibilities. The 'solver' must first limit his 'search space' to solutions that are recognisably pertinent to the problem at hand. On the contrary, no non-designer could ever find that 'solution', because a/, no non-designer would know that there was any 'problem' in the first place, or any 'good/better/best solution to that unrecognised problem. Therefore the problem, and its solution, would both arise and disappear again, unremarked and unpreserved. An effective 'dimple', would, over the long term, have no more effect than an ineffective dimple, as, over time, 'dimples arise and vanish, randomly, as any 'non-designer'. The problem with your 'genetics' scenario is that it depends upon the belief that any accidental change in any gene necessarily, mechanically, determines a change in organic outcome. The change can be significant or insignificant, positive or negative, in terms of well-being of the organism, or rather, it's off-spring. IOW, the mutation is totally irrelevent to the well-being of the organism. It matters not whether that organism is doing well or is faced with a problem, since any random change forced upon it mechanically by an accidental change in the shape of a genetic molecule is impertinent to any state of affairs, whatsoever. Therefore, where there is no problem, but a great big 'solution to the non-problem' is created, then a great big problem is created. Or, if there is a great big complex problem, and the accident forces an impertinent change upon the organism, that problem doesn't get solved. The only time a random, non-teleological change in a molecule is going to effect a complex change in an organism that is positive for that organism, is a matter of pure chance. And unless it is wondrous lucky, wherever there is a serious problem in effect, there is little hope that random chance genetic mutation will suddenly, for no reason at all, produce an effective solution to that immediate problem. And that is a very serious problem for any organism that wants to go living and produce offspring that can thrive in a world where random chance is forever bringing up new complex problems. Heck, it would be just as much a problem in a world where the environment never randomly generates new complex problems, because it means that mechanically, an organism is forced to change randomly in a world that never does. This is not problem-solving. This is problem-creating. To coin a phrase, if you are not part of the solution [teleology], then you are a part of the problem. The problem with your 'genetics' scenario is that it depends upon the belief that any accidental change in any gene necessarily, mechanically, determines a change in organic outcome. The change can be significant or insignificant, positive or negative, in terms of well-being of the organism, or rather, it's off-spring. IOW, the mutation is totally irrelevent to the well-being of the organism. It matters not whether that organism is doing well or is faced with a problem, since any random change forced upon it mechanically by an accidental change in the shape of a genetic molecule is impertinent to any state of affairs, whatsoever. Therefore, where there is no problem, but a great big 'solution to the non-problem' is created, then a great big problem is created. Or, if there is a great big complex problem, and the accident forces an impertinent change upon the organism, that problem doesn't get solved. Wrong. This is not a 'feed-back' mechanism. This is a mechanical sorting mechanism, and it would apply no matter what, in every situation of every kind. In and of itself it contributes nothing to the solution of problems, it simply 'marks the exam papers'; something that can be done mechanically, as in sorting large eggs from small. I don't see why if they they did not 'need' to do it, why they would ever do it all. Like it or not, all of the lifeforms I've observed, unlike say, falling rocks, seem to have a built-in 'need to do it', i.e., to survive, to prosper, to carry on their identity further along in time. (Adding a second random walk, with the 'most successful' trial propagating into both slots in the next generation) I cannot believe that, in fact you will have any 'success', since both 'random walks' suffer from the same liability as the single 'seed' random walk, above. At best, you will only require half of eternity to achieve 'success'. (Suppose success was not binary, but the number of matching digits) Matching digits are not binary, by definition?!? Any kind of 'ratchet', or constraining mechanism based upon a 'value' criterion is teleological. As I pointed out earlier, 'best' is a value judgment, hence a teleological term. Their personal awareness of any goal, as in the case of abstract digits, is irrelevant. What is pertinent is the personal awareness, and goal, of the digit shuffler who intelligently designed a tool, a digital 'ratchet', in order to input teleology into the process. This is ridiculous. If recognising is essential to design, and it is, then you cannot speak of 'design' without 'recognition'. I could never recognise success if I had no idea of what i was looking for, and I certainly would not try everything and anything that popped out of the box if the box had had not been pre-loaded with pertinent possibilities only. How can there be 'self-replication' without a sense of 'self'? And how can their be simple 'replication' with an ability to recognise and distinguish 'same' from 'different'? As above, the teleology is only necessary and present in the generation of positive solutions to immediate problems. Sorry? What was it that you described that I agreed was inevitable? My memory isn't what it once was. But, as I've tried to make plain, differential reproduction rates ['fitness'] is not what I'm talking about when I speak of intelligent design. I disagree. I can't see where they have anything to do with evolution per se. For instance, the differential reproductive rates of both rabbits and cane toads has soared in Australia, without either organ evolving even a little bit.","Peeling","341238","I disagree. It's highly imprecise and misleading to talk about 'organisms evolving'. Your irises do not evolve open and closed in response to light. Your muscles do not evolve in response to the demands of exercise. And when my parents got together and produced my unique genetic makeup, there is no meaningful sense in which I as an organism could be said to have evolved, since my genetic makeup has never been anything other than it is now. To take the latter misconception first: there is nothing implausible about an intelligent designer constructing a sophisticated key-and-lock system. However, what happens when an intelligent designer finds himself faced with a problem equivalent to finding the right key for a sophisticated lock? Especially if he doesn't know at the start whether there even is one. This problem was explained in my original post: I'm thinking of a number between 0 and 340 billion billion billion billion. What is it? Obviously you can't answer with any meaningful chance of being right. ID theorists - including yourself - invoke teleology as a magic bullet to make all problems solvable. Intelligence understands purpose, it has goals, etc etc. In which case, if I tell you that the number in question is the WEP-key (the encryption key) for the wireless router in my house, and that I will give you that house if you can tell me what the key is - does that help? Whyever not? You know the purpose of the number; you have a goal and the motivation to accomplish it - why isn't your teleology helping? So you claim it wouldn't be fair to discuss the presence or absence of teleology in evolution using a language devoid of teleological terms because evolution is teleological. That's circular reasoning. A perfectly and completely and absolutely appropriate response to which is 'pull the other one, it's got bells on'. Fine; I'll go along with that. If '3' can be an 'accurate description' of Pi, then words with telic undertones can 'accurately describe' the behaviour of ateleological phenomena - we'll just call the discrepancy rounding error. So your ability to employ telic terms in connection with evolution has no implications for it truly being teleological. Phew! I'm glad that's sorted out. For a while there I thought you were saying something quite different: which suggested to me you did believe semantic expression had a necessary connection with true meaning. Clearly my bad. But as I keep saying, this isn't any such debate. Nor was the word 'target' even used in the specific context of biological evolution. As I said right from the outset, it's a term referring to a subset of a space. The space could be 'stones' and the target set could be 'stones smaller than a centimeter across', and we could be investigating whether a given mechanical filter could discriminate between members and non-members of that target set, and could therefore have produced the pile of small stones we just found. Or, it could be that the target set comprises solutions to a problem we're desperately trying to solve, and we're trying to find an algorithm that will locate those solutions so we can save the world. Like I said: teleologically agnostic. I made no such claim. What I said was is that all you want to talk about is whether a given process is teleological or not, whereas the discussion is about the degree to which a process can reduce a given problem. And with the greatest of respect you are as wrong now as when you first made that claim The trouble is, you're hung up on the complexity of the observed solution (or phenomenon) and you're ignoring the topology of the problem space that surrounds it. That's what your argument needs to address. The complexity of the solution is all but irrelevant. Counter-intuitive, perhaps, but true nonetheless. I provided criteria necessary and sufficient for an evolutionary process to converge in my earlier post. Convergence here means to approach and/or enter a subset of a space. I'm aware of that What I'm trying to make you see is that you're assuming such a simplification would not exclude solutions (or indeed the only solution). It's all very well waving your hands and saying that a teleological agent would avoid doing that, but how? What can he do? If the solution is as isolated and all-or-nothing as large values of CSI supposedly indicate, what guarantee do you have that an abstraction of the problem exists to significantly reduce the problem space without wrongly excluding the solution? Does such an abstraction exist to help you find my 128-bit number? No. So straight away you assume that the problem can be simplified. What if it can't? CSI, if correctly measured, is indicative of irreducibly complex problems with isolated solutions. Not if the problem is 'how to self-replicate'. Or indeed 'how to self-replicate more effectively than other things consuming the same resources'. You've already admitted that differential reproductive rates - colloquially known as survival of the fittest - are a fact; a tautology; inevitable. Yet here you are, denying a tautology. What is abundant representation in the gene pool if not preservation ? Again, not if the dimple contributes to improved self-replication. The effective dimple will, inarguably, prevail and remain while others fail and disappear. Of course, I'm not trying to argue that evolution could produce such a thing (it couldn't), merely that a designer couldn't either. Thus measuring high-CSI solutions in nature is no way to find evidence of design. You said right at the start that genetics aren't really your bag, so I hope you won't be offended if I tell you that what you've said here is wrong in every important respect. Let's take it step by step. Yes and no. If the same genetic change occurs in very similar organisms, the consequences (in terms of changes to the organism) are demonstrably similar. If the same gene changes in the same way in very different organisms, the consequences may be different (but often aren't, hence genetic engineering). So context is important. This much is true in that the 'fitness' of an organism is relative to its environment rather than any absolute scale, but it's such a catastrophic oversimplification as to be utterly misleading. In a given organism, some mutations (such as one that disrupts RNA-protein translation) are negative in pretty much every imaginable environment, while many others prove neutral or mildly negative in some environments while being hugely beneficial in others. Failing to recognise that leads to your first categorically false statement: You've taken something that's true (the effect of a given mutation on organismic fitness is not determined purely by the mutation or the organism to which it occurs), and twisted that into a falsehood (the effect of a given mutation on organismic fitness is random ). The effect of a given mutation on organismic fitness is context dependent. That's not the same as random. This is both false and irrelevant. First, mutations can be neutral or nearly-neutral in one environment and strongly beneficial or detrimental in another. Second (and we're talking about bacteria here for the most part), even if a given mutation does induce a reproductive disadvantage in the current environment, if it crops up often enough it will be present somewhere in the population if and when the environment changes. The proof of this was the fluctuation test developed in the middle of the last century (you might want to acquaint yourself with the details), which demonstrated the stochastic occurrence of antibiotic resistance in a flask of bacteria prior to antibiotic exposure. If you have a hundred billion bacteria, a one-in-ten-million mutation that happens to confer antibiotic resistance will appear in the population thousands of times over in a single generation, all the time, 24/7 - along with mutations making the organism more thermophillic or phobic, acid-loving or hating, even capable of digesting nylon waste products. If an antibiotic or a hotter or colder or more or less acidic environment is never encountered, or nylon isn't going to be invented for another million years - well, tough. Sucks to be a mutant. True. But your belief that evolution is teleological and therefore organismic has made you fixated on the fortunes of the organism rather than the species. Plus, you're stuck in the mindset that evolution has to respond to change; you're imagining a problem occurring and then a lucky mutation striking to make everything better. That can and does happen, so long as the organisms are able to continue living and breeding, albeit less well, after the change, but it is just as possible that a pertinent variation already exists somewhere within the gene pool. This is not merely conjecture; it is a repeatable observation of fact. Well, for one thing any feedback mechanism operating without a teleological agent would have to take the form of a tautology. It must be something inevitable - because otherwise it would need somebody to set it up and make it happen. You are pointing out a strength in my argument, not a weakness. For another, you're playing with semantics again without addressing what's actually happening. If I ran a simulation, scored self-replicators on how abundantly they reproduced in a single generation, and then seeded the next run of the simulation with corresponding quantities of those self-replicators, you'd happily call that a feedback process because a teleological agent (me) was involved. Even though I'm not contributing anything! The self-replicators are already doing 'my job' for me. Incorrect. If the 'problem' in question had only a yes/no solution, get it perfectly right and survive, otherwise perish, you would be right to say that differential reproductive rates could contribute nothing to the solution. But in that case, nor could teleology. Disagree? Then what's my router's WEP-key? Imagine your life depended upon knowing it, if that helps Differential reproductive rates (DRR) bias the otherwise stochastic search. Only if success is all-or-nothing, or resources were unlimited (population can expand freely forever) would DRR have no effect. Let me answer your question with a question: if you have a bunch of self-replicators, and some of them operate in a way that could be interpreted as a desire to survive and thrive, and some of them don't, whose descendants do you think you're going to encounter if you come back in a million years or so? Next up, the WEP-key problem. We're in agreement right from the start that a single 'random walk' of a 128-digit number is going to take effectively forever to reach a particular unrelated 128-digit number. Absolutely correct - if 'success' is purely yes/no. In that case, the two random walks operate strictly in parallel - halving the expected time to 'half of eternity'. Sorry; too much 'binary' going on What I mean to say is, what if the feedback was not just 'yes, all 128 digits correct' or 'no', but a scalar value of the number of matching digits in the trial. So instead of the two trials just generating (no, no) ad nauseam, they generate, for instance, (64, 65). Now the next generation consists of two variations on the second guess, the one that scored 65. The next score might then be (66,64), and so on. Statistically, the equilibrium point of this mechanism is 96 matching digits, which is the point at which it becomes equally likely that both next-gen trials will be worse as for one of them to be better. More seeds push the equilibrium point up, such that with a hundred seeds the optimal solution comes within the scope of the stochastic variation. Oh, absolutely. This is very much a teleological illustration. In almost every circumstance, you are right. Certainly in this illustration of evolutionary processes at work, 'best' is a contrivance. However... The 'best' self-replicator is an objective, quantitative measurement of fact. No telic agent is required to offer an opinion: the best self-replicator is the one that reproduced most abundantly. A ratchet in which the bias arises inevitably via differential rates of self-replication does not require a telic middle-man. Not in the case of self-replicators. As we noted before, a telic agent actively seeking the best self-replicator by scoring variants on how abundantly they replicate and seeding the next generation accordingly, is contributing absolutely nothing to the process. He may as well not be there. The process will produce better and better self-replicators all on its own, without anyone having to want it to happen. True - but you can speak of recognition without design. You referred to a process involving pure recognition as 'intelligent design'. It wasn't design. The intelligence is not in control of what solution emerges, and (as other contributors have pointed out) it may not even understand how the solution works. In what sense has the intelligence designed a solution he doesn't understand? The point of this thread in a nutshell Oh dear, more semantics. You want me to stop using the word 'self' now? Ok, you tell me what legitimate term I should use for a mechanism whose activity results in the existence of duplicate mechanisms. I don't know where you're getting this from. Whoever said anything about recognising or distinguishing same from different? But evolution doesn't necessitate the generation of positive solutions to immediate problems. Evolution can progress perfectly well via the accretion of variety prior to the emergence of problems (or opportunities). The feedback effect of self-replication. I understand that. But differential reproductive rates are pertinent to the uninformed comments you made about the impossibility of ateleological processes yielding complex solutions - so I undertook a slight detour to correct you. Um. No. Their numbers have soared. DRR generally refers to relative reproductive rates between variants of the same species sharing a pool of resources.

I think Nietzsche was right: teleological explanations (of natural phenomena, at least) confuse causes and effects. Take birds, for example. They did not evolve wings because an ideal capacity for flight caused their forelimbs to develop in certain ways. Rather, it was the development of birds' forelimbs that caused them to gain a real capacity for flight. Or go back to that example in the article Trebor cited about scientists making indefinitely replicating RNA. Some of the mutated strains of RNA became numerically dominant over others in the mixture. But this isn't because dominance was a telos that caused the ultimately dominant strains to mutate as they did. It's because the particular ways they mutated caused them to dominate. Both outcomes can be explained perfectly well in mechanistic terms. There is no need to invoke teleology in order to explain how they came about. I hasten to add, this doesn't mean that teleology is impossible, just that it is unnecessary. As theologian John Haught points out, the question ""Why is the water on the stove boiling?"" could be answered in terms of molecular motion or in terms of my desire to have a cup of tea, and neither answer excludes the other. But as he also points out, only one of those answers is scientific. And so I hasten to add further, I'm not sure what adding teleology into the sciences would clarify. If we construe, say, birds' wings as purposefully designed, this just seems to imply all sorts of unanswerable questions about their designer's purposes. E.g. why give birds wings, but not amphibians? why give some birds wings, but not the capacity for flight? etc. Perhaps I'm just overly pessimistic about the possibility for finding answers to such questions, but I don't think so.

Readers can decide that much for themselves, but for what it's worth I apologise for everything I've done to aggravate matters. So I propose a relatively clean slate, and that we proceed more slowly and carefully, covering less ground with each post so as to keep it more manageable. Before it can be worth us discussing the original post in any detail, I think we need to achieve a meeting of minds on a couple of issues: 1. The 'feedback effect' of self-replication-with-variation in an environment of limited resources 2. Undirected random mutation and its implications for organismic fitness. The first issue is one that has proved especially problematic because apparently the word 'feedback' implies teleology. I think this is a case of semantics and objective truth being at odds, and I will endeavour to explain why. Suppose a telic agent were to decide to improve a set of self-replicators. Suppose he were to decide to do so by randomly varying the properties of existing self-replicators, measuring how copiously each variant replicated, clearing the slate and then seeding a new generation with variants in relative quantities derived from his measurements. He does this so that the rare changes that improve self-replication have a greater chance of stacking and accumulating with previous improvements. I'm sure you would happily acknowledge this clever teleological process as employing 'feedback'. Now suppose that the environment is such that the random variations to the properties of the replicators were inevitable. One contribution of the telic agent is thus rendered redundant. Next suppose that the telic agent, instead of clearing the slate and reseeding it with a new generation based on his measurements, simply allows the results of the previous generation to stand. In terms of the replicators themselves, and the numbers of each variant present in each successive generation, nothing has changed. That's the point: nothing has changed. The telic agent is now not doing anything, and the process still has the same effect. So if it has suddenly ceased to be a feedback process, it's for semantic reasons only (no telic agent involved). The 'best' self-replicators are no longer being 'selected' or 'preserved' and the worst no longer being 'rejected', but in terms of their changing numbers from generation to generation, the departure of the telic agent has had no effect . Now, I'm personally quite happy calling this a feedback process, both because of the effect it has and how that effect comes about. If you feel obliged to balk at the prospect, then we need to find an innocuous term we're both happy with, because the process and its effects are logically sound. NB: I'm aware the effect of this process depends upon the possibility of the 'random changes', be they induced by the telic agent or by the environment, increasing the relative quantity of a given self-replicator present in the next generation. Hence the second vital issue, 2) above, which I'll get to when we're done with 1). For now, the important point for us to agree upon is that the presence or absence of a telic agent in the process does not alter its effect on replication efficiency. Also, in case you're concerned that I might be trying to sneak some other prerequisite for evolution in under the radar: no, you've read the above correctly. Differential reproductive rates influence the chances of beneficial changes accumulating within individual organisms - that's all. So if you can agree with that, we can move on in joyous lockstep Edit: I just noticed something from your previous post that needs to be addressed here: This is wrong.

I couldn't agree more. So when, for instance, a mutation in bacterial DNA is demonstrably both necessary and sufficient for a replication-improving trait to manifest, when the chemical activity of the novel enzyme (for instance) deterministically generated from that DNA can be traced to its effect upon organismic fitness, and the mutation demonstrably arises stochastically prior to the bacterium encountering the environment in which the mutation improves replication, it would violate Ockham's Razor to suppose the existence of some unknown teleological mechanism at work, based solely on an a priori philosophical assumption that only teleological processes can increase the replication chances of complex systems. Simpler by far to acknowledge the sufficiency of what we see before us to explain the phenomenon, and discard the erroneous philosophical assumption. Then you doubt wrongly. Both Behe and Dembski, to name only two, have accepted the validity of known evolutionary mechanisms - they just believe them to be insufficient to explain all biological features. Hence their statistical approach to inferring design. As for me having failed to demonstrate the effect of evolutionary mechanisms - in fairness we've only just reached the point of me starting to try As I said, the OP assumed a certain level of understanding, from which point we've been working steadily backwards in an attempt to find some common ground. Well, yes, that's what I just said. Which is why it would be a waste of time to discuss the OP right now. Its merits are only worth discussing if you don't believe the issue has already been settled by some other argument. Population fluctuations in absolute terms can, as you say, occur for many reasons. But fluctuations in the relative proportions of variants comprising that population are influenced by what you would call the relative 'fitness' of those variants in their environment. And those fluctuations in turn inevitably influence the relative chances of future changes stacking with the different variants already in existence. If there are a lot of variant A and only a few of variant B, the chances of a later change stacking with A is much greater than that of it stacking with B. Why is this relevant to the evolution of distinct and separate life forms? Because what separates two species that share an ancestor species are the differences in their accumulated changes. The longer two populations of a single species are reproductively isolated from one another, the more different the 'stacks' of changes in each population become - and this is true regardless of whether you believe the changes themselves are random or telic in origin. Part of that can result from genuinely different changes arising within each population, but even if the exact same changes were to arise in both populations, in the same order, the two populations can still diverge because DRR in their respective environments would influence which changes accumulated with which others. If a million men called Steve and one man called Andy enter the lottery, is it more likely a Steve or an Andy will win? Do we need to conduct that experiment for real to find out? So if a change - random or telic - empirically improves the relative statistical chance of self-replication, that mutant will inevitably come to numerically dominate the population. Agreed? So when another change occurs to an organism - again, be it random or telic - to which variant is it more likely to occur? The numerically dominant mutants, or the minority non-mutants? If you take the position that 'adaptive' implies teleology by definition, then obviously an ateleological but adaptive process is a semantic contradiction. It doesn't stop a process of ateleological self-replication improvement occurring, it just means we can't call it adaptive. Now personally , I'm comfortable with saying 'ateleological adaptation', because to me that describes something that has the same effect as adaptation, but isn't telic. Since semantics do not define objective truth, I don't see why putting those two words together should make me automatically wrong. 'Ateleological' is just a qualifier. The same goes for 'natural selection', a phrase chosen at the time for the express purpose of leading the reader from a concept they're comfortable and familiar with (livestock breeding) and showing them how the rigours of the environment result in an analogous effect , even if the actual process lacks the telic qualities implied by 'selection'. There was never any intent or desire to sneak animism in through the back door, as you seem determined to believe. As I've said all along, self-replication with variation is an utterly unique special case, the only situation in which statistically rare improvements can accumulate, and statistically common neutral or deleterious changes abate, without the interference of a telic entity. It's hardly surprising that it's difficult to find appropriate words, when the words we have were defined in ignorance of that one special case. Well, I don't know what 'many supporters' think. I know there is much, much more to evolution than mutation and differential reproductive rates. There are two reasons I focus on those elements here and now. First, their combined effectiveness is relatively straightforward to demonstrate, using asexually reproducing bacteria. Second, before I could even hope to interest you in the more complex processes entailed by sexual reproduction, I have to break down the mental block you have against the principle of ateleological processes yielding improved self-replication. I neither deny teleology per se, nor do I claim adaptation has no role in evolutionary biology. What I'm saying is that whatever effect they have it is inevitably layered atop known ateleological effects. Do you appreciate the distinction? Ateleological processes that improve an organism's fitness will continue to blindly operate regardless of whether or not the organism itself is telic. There is no all or nothing dichotomy.","intelligent-designs-black-box","07:38 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","59"

For while Darwin did indeed believe that evolution is an adaptive process, his entire point was to account for adaptations without invoking final causes. And the need for such an account arises from the fact that adaptations do not appear in response to the needs of the species in which they might appear. Consider the case of Guam. A venomous bird-eating tree snake was introduced there sometime around the end of World War II or shortly thereafter. The island's birds had never seen such a predator: prior to its arrival, there were no snakes on Guam. The effect was quite predictable. The snakes found easy pickings, and within a few decades there were no birds left on the island. Some had gone extinct; the others survived only because people removed them from the island altogether for conservation purposes. Now, I do not doubt for one second that these birds wanted to survive and reproduce. I have no doubt that doing so was some sort of ""purpose"" or ""goal"" of theirs, perhaps even an ""intention"" or a ""drive."" But none of that caused them to adapt to the new predator in their midst. On the other hand, it is quite easy to envision a process whereby that could have happened. If any of the birds possessed some feature that enabled them to defend themselves against the snake -- whether that feature pre-existed the snake's arrival or emerged soon after it arrived -- these birds simply would tend to survive and reproduce more effectively than their neighbors. And if that feature were heritable, they would pass it on to at least some of their offspring, who would follow in their parents' footsteps to survive and reproduce more effectively than their neighbors (perhaps even some of their siblings). And so on and so on, until you would wind up with the birds left on Guam adapted to the snake. But of course, that story is counterfactual. It's premised on one big ""if."" And as it turns out, the requisite conditions never got met. The important point to note is twofold. First, there was no final cause that compelled the birds to adapt. Second, their actual decline can be explained, and their hypothetical success could be explained, without resorting to any final causes. (And it's worth keeping in mind that real cases of successful adaptation get explained this way all the time, from the coloration of guppies in the presence or absence of predators to the pesticide resistance of insects.) What purpose is served by being hung up on the name of ""natural selection ?"" The process by which adaptations develop -- or fail to develop , incidentally -- can still be still be described ateleologically, and is in fact best described ateleologically. We could call it ""natural separation"" or even ""flurbation."" A rose by any other name. And I think that sometimes what ""appears to be"" and ""reality"" are not necessarily the same. Which is why I used the examples of sunrise and sunset. The sun appears to move across the sky, and it's hardly dishonest to say so. But that's not what's really going on. I'm sorry you feel that way. I think it's a marvelously simplified example of how mechanistic processes can lead to the numerical dominance of some entitities over others under particular conditions. Where? What is it that we can't understand here without invoking final causes? Why? I presume that you don't disagree about the sunrise/sunset issue (though I could be wrong). Why does using evolution as the subject of a sentence reify it? Truth matters to me, too, you know. And I think the truth of the matter is, adaptations can be explained without invoking final causes!

And that is evolution. But evolution doesn't ""do"" anything. The word ""evolution"" is applied to the definition of events that constitute evolution (a change in the allele frequency of populations of organisms over generations), observations of events that fit the definition, and theories that explain the events. Then you haven't looked. You haven't read Darwin, since that is one of the basic points he pointed out 150 years ago based on the evidence he observed.

Individual organisms do not evolve. Populations do. As to ""changes in the actual forms that express life,"" it sounds like what you're talking about is changes to organisms' phenotypes , and even perhaps just to their observable anatomy. But changes to genotypes underlie changes to phenotypes. Not true! Phenotypes change precisely because genotypes change. True, on all accounts. But science is not limited to explanations in terms of ""what we can observe with the naked eye!"" Indeed. But guess what? Modern genetics has corroborated the idea, in ways that aren't always visible, and that Darwin could never have dreamed of. I'm sorry, but you totally lost me here. How does the hypothesis depend on all possible trait variations pre-existing their expression? I don't think I've ever seen that said or even implied. It sounds far too Platonist for an empirical science. Could you clarify? If two individuals differ in a given allele, then at that point in their DNA, the molecules are precisely not the same! The coding sequences are different, and they thus get expressed differently, and they therefore produce different phenotypic effects. On the other hand, even the same allele doesn't work similarly under all conditions. Your own DNA is the same in every cell in your body, but fortunately, not every portion of it is active in every cell. Those genes encoding, say, muscle proteins aren't active in your brain cells -- which is fortunate, or we wouldn't be having this discussion!

And those fluctuations in turn inevitably influence the relative chances of future changes stacking with the different variants already in existence. If there are a lot of variant A and only a few of variant B, the chances of a later change stacking with A is much greater than that of it stacking with B. So if a change - random or telic - empirically improves the relative statistical chance of self-replication, that mutant will inevitably come to numerically dominate the population. Agreed? If you take the position that 'adaptive' implies teleology by definition, then obviously an ateleological but adaptive process is a semantic contradiction. It doesn't stop a process of ateleological self-replication improvement occurring, it just means we can't call it adaptive. Now personally , I'm comfortable with saying 'ateleological adaptation', because to me that describes something that has the same effect as adaptation, but isn't telic. Since semantics do not define objective truth, I don't see why putting those two words together should make me automatically wrong. 'Ateleological' is just a qualifier. The same goes for 'natural selection', a phrase chosen at the time for the express purpose of leading the reader from a concept they're comfortable and familiar with (livestock breeding) and showing them how the rigours of the environment result in an analogous effect , even if the actual process lacks the telic qualities implied by 'selection'. As I've said all along, self-replication with variation is an utterly unique special case, the only situation in which statistically rare improvements can accumulate, and statistically common neutral or deleterious changes abate, without the interference of a telic entity. It's hardly surprising that it's difficult to find appropriate words, when the words we have were defined in ignorance of that one special case. I know there is much, much more to evolution than mutation and differential reproductive rates. There are two reasons I focus on those elements here and now. First, their combined effectiveness is relatively straightforward to demonstrate, using asexually reproducing bacteria. I neither deny teleology per se, nor do I claim adaptation has no role in evolutionary biology. What I'm saying is that whatever effect they have it is inevitably layered atop known ateleological effects. Do you appreciate the distinction? Ateleological processes that improve an organism's fitness will continue to blindly operate regardless of whether or not the organism itself is telic. There is no all or nothing dichotomy.","jakers","342058","And there's your problem. Even according to your own theory it should be fallacious to suppose that just because any individual or any particular population has never encountered such an environment, that they have not inherited a mechanism from their ancestors who had already, and perhaps millions of times, encountered and devised a mechanism to deal with that very problem. A mechanism that could hold a certain enzyme action in abeyance until such time as it was necessary to release it again, even if that mechanism was a genetic 'allele' or whatever. If the problem environment can be shown, or even supposed, to be one that has come and gone repeatedly over million, billions, trillions, of bacteria generations, there is no reason to suppose that any given population of same has to rely on random chance, a lucky genetic mutation, to stochastically 're-invent the wheel' for the gazillioneth time. That is, no reason to suppose such a thing unless you really, really want such a phenomenon to be purely accidental. It seems top me that I am not the one who is making erroneous a priori philosophical assumptions that 'violate' Ockham's razor. I think that is the one who assumes a regular, repeatable, predictable, but totally random, utterly stochastic, brand new, disassociated set of two [on/off] genetic mutations. I wouild say that such an appeal to such dependably iterated good luck not only would offend Ockham, but common sense as well. It smacks of superstition, to me. This word, 'stacking', although quite familiar to me, seems to used by you in a sense that to me is entirely unfamiliar. Could you outline your novel use of this word, and explain just exactly what it means in terms of DNA molecules and expressed organic traits? Is this just another way of re-stating the old Darwinian thesis tiny differences accumulate steadily over generations until one day you look around and discover that a great big difference/change occurred without Natural Selection having noticed? Or any real prompting from the environment. Just incessant 'change for change sake' owing to long periods of isolated self-replication? It is tautologous to say that a positive change in life form will lead to a positive gain in self-replication. Since all tautologies are truisms, I can hardly argue the point. However, I can argue that relative frequency, speed, efficiency, and specificity by which a change in life forms arise in relation to a novel environmental difference which makes that change 'positive', as opposed to neutral [ineffective] or negative [detrimental] can give reasonable grounds to awarding the accomplishment to some intentional agency rather than a great streak of amazing luck. Fine. I'll continue to assert that evolution is a process of organismic adaptation to random environmental change, and you can stop using the word 'adaptive', or any of its cognates, or synonyms, wrt evolution. Darwin must be rolling over in his grave, but he's dead, so that's his problem. And my problem with you, all along, is your incredibly cavalier attitude towards words and their true meanings. Reminds me very much, if you'll forgive my saying so, of just what Humpty Dumpty said to Alice in Lewis Carroll's satirical 'children's' book. Semantics refer to truth in word meanings, where two or more communicaters use the same terminology, what is 'true' for one must be 'true' for the other, or the word usage simply is not true at all. And, what Mr. Dumpty said notwithstanding, there is no legitimate way that one person, or select group of persons, can unilaterally and arbitrarily impose a new meaning on a word without the express consent of all others with whom they use that word in any act of communication, because when they do this, they speak falsely, deceptively, mendaciously, and do no more than corrupt meaning to serve their own purposes. Sounds like 'politics as usual' to me. This is a flagrant example of 'special pleading'. I can't remember the exact names of the logical fallacies it falls under. What special case?!? LIFE? Life was around long before language was invented. Which might be convincing if you could demonstrate it just as easily using other life forms. Another 'special case' for 'special pleading', it sounds like to me. Exceptions are not the foundations for the rule. Well, up to this moment, it has seemed to me that that is exactly what you were doing, in both cases. I appreciate the fact that if I wish to drink a glass of beer I need the beer, a hand an elbow, a throat and stomach, among other physical things. I also require thirst, taste, satisfaction, and a lot of other stuff that I would not have were I not also alive, and acting teleologically.

For while Darwin did indeed believe that evolution is an adaptive process, his entire point was to account for adaptations without invoking final causes. And the need for such an account arises from the fact that adaptations do not appear in response to the needs of the species in which they might appear. Now, I do not doubt for one second that these birds wanted to survive and reproduce. I have no doubt that doing so was some sort of ""purpose"" or ""goal"" of theirs, perhaps even an ""intention"" or a ""drive."" But none of that caused them to adapt to the new predator in their midst. First, there was no final cause that compelled the birds to adapt. (And it's worth keeping in mind that real cases of successful adaptation get explained this way all the time, from the coloration of guppies in the presence or absence of predators to the pesticide resistance of insects.) What purpose is served by being hung up on the name of ""natural selection ?"" The process by which adaptations develop -- or fail to develop , incidentally -- can still be still be described ateleologically, and is in fact best described ateleologically. We could call it ""natural separation"" or even ""flurbation."" A rose by any other name. Why does using evolution as the subject of a sentence reify it?

But he did nothing to prove the non-existence of proximate and temporal final causes, and if you believe, as I do, that evolution is a process by which solutions are found to proximate, temporal, problems relative to time and space, and not some ultimate, fundamental, elemental problem, then you cannot call anything adaptive that _is not_ looking for, teleologically seeking, that proximate solution to that immediate problem. Nor can you call anything that _is_ doing that, non-adaptive. And the problem with that is, that they do. Ask any infectious bacterium about antibiotic resistance. Nowhere is it claimed that any organism can adapt to any situation in which it finds its. Heck, the dodo and the dinosaur have already told us that much. But failure to solve to solve one problem or another is not proof that an intrinsic ability to solve some problems does not exist. It is certainly not proof that adaptation and evolution are matters of chance accident, lucky happenstance, a coincidental conjunction of genetic mutation and organismic need. It merely points up the reality that teleology is not magic. Some things it can fix, some things it can't. Lucky chance, however, seldom fixes anything, so if I'm putting money on a race, teleology versus luck, my money is always on teleology. Yes, there was--survival.

Evolution is responsible for evolution. Evolution is what evolution does. And so on and so forth. That eliminates the need to find any real cause for evolution.

What is not obvious is what has caused that fact. And that's what I thought was at issue here: not whether organisms are adapted to their environments, but why. What's also not obvious (to me, at any rate) is what exactly you have in mind by speaking of ""teleology."" Perhaps an example will help. Must we invoke final causes to explain why, say, a polar bear is adapted to cold environments? (Or see the bacterium example below. But I'd like to see what you have to say about the polar bears, too.) But in the case of evolution, what exactly is doing this ""looking for?"" Or maybe not what, but who ? Sorry, but no. The mere fact that a given feature would be adaptive under given conditions does not cause that feature to appear. Sometimes, the bacteria all die. Which is quite fortunate for us when we take antibiotics! If, however, a genetic feature that allows a bacterium to resist antibiotics already exists or comes into existence, while its neighbors lack this feature, then that bacterium will leave more offspring in the next generation than its neighbors (other things being equal, of course). As will its offspring, relative to their neighbors. And so on and so on. I would say that, to construe antibiotic resistance as a telos that bacteria are trying to reach, somehow then ""causing"" the bacteria to evolve said antibiotic resistance, is to get things precisely backwards . Antibiotic resistance is a real effect , not an ideal cause. But conversely, successfully adapting does not show that teleology obtains, either. The above account can explain why bacteria develop antibiotic resistance when they do, and why they don't when they don't. It even explains why, in those cases where bacteria develop antibiotic resistance, there is usually a much higher kill rate at the beginning, after which the resistant strains build up their numbers. (The situation is essentially the same for pesticide resistance in insects.) What exactly does this account miss that only teleology can explain? And how does teleology explain it? You realize, though, that natural selection is not ""chance."" Right? ""Not teleological"" is not equivalent to ""chance."" But even granting your point for the sake of argument: Is there a principled distinction to be made between what teleology can fix and what it can't? If not, then what distinguishes teleological causation from lucky chance after all? In practice, how could we tell the difference? Okay, firstly-- now who's hypostasizing an abstraction! ""Survival"" is not a ""thing."" It doesn't do anything. I find it rather bizarre that, after all this criticism about evolutionists reifying ""evolution,"" you would do the same with ""survival."" But frankly, turning abstractions into things strikes me as a necessary component of teleology. Secondly, ""survival"" is entirely too general to explain anything specific . In the case of the vanished birds of Guam, what particular effects did ""survival"" have on them? If all that a teleological explanation can say is something like ""The organism's goal of survival led it to try to survive,"" I just don't find that terribly informative. Thirdly and finally, insofar as the birds did not survive, how did survival "" cause "" anything?!? Your medical student example doesn't help here. Having the goal isn't the cause of your would-be doctor's failure! And even if he were to succeed, having the goal wouldn't be the cause of his success. To sum up: I just don't see how final causes are causes. Indeed! And personally, I find ""final causes"" to be the most seductive of all such rationalizations; their seductiveness probably explains their vast historical success. Not so! In using the term ""selection,"" Darwin was making a useful analogy. As with all analogies, there is no claim of perfect resemblance. The obvious disanalogy is that when human breeders select, they do so consciously and intelligently, whereas the effects of natural ""selection"" are not conscious or intelligent. But a profound similarity is found in both cases: based on some feature or features of their own, some entities are systematically removed from the larger set of entitities to which they belong. So why not call it ""selection?""","intelligent-designs-black-box","08:33 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","68"
"01-28-2009","12214",5,"jakers","342040","Thank-you, Pandion, for supporting me on this point. But, I'm not sure that I'd define 'evolution' as ""changes in the genetic makeup of populations over time"". That's just too gene-centric for my tastes. Again, the gene-centric definition of evolution that just does not work for me. For me, evolution is about changes in the actual forms that express life, not a head count of which DNA molecules reside where. The only empirical observations that comply with that definition are genome mappings. Actually, Darwin knew nothing about genes, and had no understanding of the genetic theory of inheritance. All that Darwin obderverd [sic] , and all that we can observe with the naked eye, is that within any group of like organisms, even one as limited as a human family, very minor trait variations always, and very serious trait variations occasionally, occur. He, like ourselves, seem,s to have noted that whenever serious, robust trait variations do occur, that they are always debilitating, often fatal. To get around this fact, his theory supposed that tiny variations could accrue to one another over time, the environment permitting, until finally one population had accrued such a large accumulation of trait differences that it could be distinguished from another population of organisms that had not accrued and expressed those changes. I've never understood the notion of 'alleles', wherebye, I'm told, the exact same DNA molecule can somehow express itself in a variety of different fashions. No doubt I'm misunderstanding something about that, since it does not seem very mechanical to me. Almost as if molecules were being understood to have minds of their own.","pandion","342130","Sure, but my statement was actually a bit sloppy - inaccurate. I stated that organisms have been observed to ""...change in response to their environment."" Actually, the organisms change as a consequence of changes in the genome of the population. The genome changes in response to the environment as well as other mechanisms of evolution. It doesn't matter how you'd define evolution. That's how biologists define it. If you don't like it, then you aren't talking about evolution. Maybe you should select another word for whatever you are talking about. People will get the impression that you are talking about evolution and that you know what you are talking about otherwise. But that's the definition used by biologists - a change in the allele frequency in a population over generations. You can talk about whatever you want but please stop calling it evolution. Evolutionary biologists are the ones who get to assign meanings to the terms that they use. What does that mean? Please define ""actual forms that express life."" What exactly is a ""head count"" of DNA molecules? I think a good name for whatever you are talking about would be ""nebulous fantasy."" That may be for someone who doesn't know what evolution is in the first place. Either you missed the point or you are being intentionally disingenuous. The point was (as Peeling said and with which I agreed) that diversity can accumulate in a population that is not a response to problems or opportunities in the environment. I mentioned that Darwin had made that observation. I said nothing about whether or not Darwin understood genetics. Try reading Darwin again. Or even any good book on evolution. I can recommend some if you would like to learn. [quote]And that is basically all that Darwin had to say about that, based upon his empirical observations. The trouble was, that hypothesis depended upon the belief that all possible trait variations of every kind pre-existed their expression, and that what an organism was, was what what was left over after all the unused and unwanted trait variations had been eliminated. Sort of like saying that a statue is what's left after all the unwanted marble has been cut away [""selected""], or that a house is what's left after you had finished picking out what you liked from a pile of building materials,-- planks, bricks, nails, glass panes, and whatnot. For some notion of just where and how those building materials originated he turned to other people's early ideas, and called them his theory of 'pangenesis'.[quote]That's pure nonsense. For sure you don't understand the notion of alleles. That could be why you don't understand the notion of evolution, reproduction and genetics. No wonder you want to look for nebulous and undefined forms. Like I agreed, you don't understand. Maybe that could have something to do with the fact that you are attempting to discuss a topic without bothering to learn the basics.","intelligent-designs-black-box","08:19 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","69"

Now it has come to a question of whether organisms evolve by design or by genetic accident. Is teleology involved or is it a case of, "" things change, willy-nilly, and what you see today is just what was lucky enough to change in a way that suited the fickle finger of blind, random, environmental fluctuations"". To me there is no way that you can claim that anything 'adapted' to anything without speaking teleologically, or poetically. Poetically, as in, the water adapted to the drop in temperature by freezing, or the branch adapted to the rise in temperature by catching fire. The online dictionaries all say something like-- Adapt # (a.) Fitted; suited. # (v. t.) To make suitable; to fit, or suit; to adjust; to alter so as to fit for a new use; -- sometimes followed by to or for. Therefore the original [and only true and legitimate] meaning for 'fitness for' something, is also teleological. To be 'fit for' is always to 'be suitable for'. I do not see how the words 'adapted' and 'fitted' can be separated from each other wrt the words 'environment' and 'evolution'. Thus both ""Survival of the Fittest"" and ""Natural Selection"" imply a value judgement made by something or other, real or imaginary, and that makes such expressions intrinsically teleological and clearly opposite any inference of chance or mechanics. Well, to me teleology is a part of the concept of 'causation' in philosophy. That is, it sometimes plays a part in explaining what caused a certain effect, or outcome. Thus, to me, teleology is part of an Aristotelian tradition of causation, that is his 'final cause'. Anything that suggests that a 'change action' was started with a view, be it vague or clearly defined, to a desired end, is teleological. Anything that makes a value judgement on the lines of 'good, better, best', etc., wrt to itself and the world around it, is teleological. Thus anything capable of recognising itself as a 'self', an individual being distinguishable from the rest of the universe, is teleological. The concepts of 'mind', 'intelligence'. awareness'. 'volition', 'free will', 'choice', 'judgement', 'selection', 'fitness', 'suitability', 'purpose', 'use', 'intention', 'goal', 'objective', 'motive' and a thousand others are plainly teleological. To put in its simplest terms, teleology is present where a mental activity assesses a present state of affairs, makes a conscious or unconscious judgement wrt its impact on the being experiencing the mental activity, and this judgement has an effect on what that 'judge' does, and what the result of that action will be. Many people, especially of late, have ridiculed teleology as being a philosophy which insists that everything that exists, got to be where it is and how it is through the conscious efforts of some wilful external agent or agency, usually referred to as a god. [but sometimes 'evolution', That is not my belief. I am not here to deny the presence of random chance as an intrinsic part of reality. I believe that accidents do happen. Nor I am I here to deny mechanics. Observation shows us that there is law and order in this universe, because certain causes can be depended upon to lead to certain ends, time after time. I am here simply to say that where living organisms are concerned, what they do in their own lives, and over the 'lifespans' of their 'lifeforms', is not a simple matter of chemical iterations nor inexplicable failures of molecular iterations, but that there is 'something else' in 'life' itself which exercises power over the mechanics/operations/behaviours of sentient, self-aware, mentally-endowed beings, a power exercised right down to the molecular level. An intrinsic teleological power. The power to _act_ upon the world, and just to be a passive 'thing' that it acts upon. I say that you have to invoke a final cause anytime you claim that something is 'adapted' to anything. To 'adapt' yourself, or anything else, to something else, is always a teleological act. A senseless thing can 'conform' to the laws of physics and chemistry, but it can never 'adapt' to them. 'Adaptation' always connotes awareness and intention. Conformance and compliance do not. I believe that insentient matter complies and conforms entirely, passively, in reaction to whatever external forces act upon it. I believe that sentient lifeforms, i.e., living organisms, internally affect and direct what happens to the insentient matter within themselves, just as they act upon the insentient matter external to them, though by no means in the same way or to the same extent. Polar bears are white [sort of], and their ice flow environment is whitish as well. Therefore we may suppose that polar bear fur colour is another instance of natural camouflage, a phenomenon widespread throughout the natural world. Camouflage, in and of itself, [along with 'mimicry'] is an extremely interesting and mysterious phenomenon. Great topic. But for our purposes, the polar bear, once a grizzly bear kind of bear, somehow sensed that it caught more seals on ice flows when the seal couldn't see them, and, unconsciously picking up on the fact that the ice and snow around it were white, succeeded, teleologically, in making its offspring successively less brown and more white. How subconscious awareness of surroundings cause organisms to change themselves to suit, either intantly or over a generation or so, is quite a mystery. But claiming that all the brown bears died, and only mutant white bears survived, is, to me, a children's story. I do not know. For lack of a better word, I could say 'the psyche'. Whatever ""it"" is, it is intrinsic to ""life"". Now, I have heard some people say that there is no such thing as 'life'. That is only 'matter', acting mechanically. I do not like to argue with people who deny the obvious--that is, a live thing does things that a dead thing cannot, even though all of the 'matter' is still there.

I'm sorry to hear that. All of the above, I believe. I suspect that you are being, shall we say, disingenuous, since I cannot believe that you cannot put ""genetic accident"" together with ""random genetic mutation"". Surely you are familiar with that? Well, no, not really. I'm talking about random events [mutagenic random events] which change _the genes_ in an organism [i.e., 'mutate' one or more of them] to the extent that the organism's offspring [and their 'genes'][i.e., 'mutants'] are at least somewhat different from those carried, up to that moment, by it's ancestors' offspring. Lots of things can change the genetic makeup of any given population. The Nazis tried to change the genetic makeup of the European population by killing all the Jews and Gypsies. Thankfully, they failed, but they did kill enough, I would wager, to have changed ""the genetic makeup"" of Europe. Statistically, at least. Or, put another way, just adding one more hen to a coop can change that flock's ""genetic makeup"". Well, if you choose to make an enemy of everybody who disagrees with you, you've picked the proper way to go about it. Poisoning the well by accusing others of deliberate ignorance will not bring anyone over to your point of view. If any of the above are intentional or mechanical, then they do not deserve to be called 'accidental', 'random', 'coincidental', 'fortuitous', 'chance' or 'just plain lucky'. If, OTH, the presence of mechanics and/or or intent is denied, then how else are they to be described other than in those terms? Well, that is basically what I was referring to, but since you bring up these other things, perhaps I should include them under the same heading. Unless, of course, you can show that ""gene flow, recombination, and genetic drift"" are mechanical and/or intentional, then they won't deserve to be called 'random', 'accidental', etc. What ""Taint so?"" That ""the word design implies some intelligent cause""? It does. That's just the way it is. So what are you saying? In that case, since there are only the three alternatives, then those 'mechanisms' must be true 'mechanisms', i.e., chains of events that are mechanically determined and predictable, that cannot be altered or avoided. None of that verbiage relates to the plain English word 'to select', or to any of its cognates. All you are doing is offering the tautology that, 'things that do better, do better'. 'Selection' just ain't in this stuff. Neither is anything else. Instead of natural selection, just say ""Natural Success"". ""Success breeds success!"", and so on. ""Prosperity of the Successful"", to coin a phrase. Well, it would be nice if they didn't just suggest what it does, but actually said what, in scientific as opposed to literary terms, it _is_. I suggest to you that anything that is not mechanical is not a mechanism, as such. At least in material terms. However, I do admit of psychological 'mechanisms' as well as material ones. I do not admit of 'accidental mechanisms', since that is an oxymoron, but that does seem to be what you are trying to put forward. Sexual selection, in the rare cases where it is actually present, is true 'selection' because it is something done by a sentient being, a live organism. An awful lot of 'mate acquisition' has little to do with any real choice. But forget about that for now. This appears to be a genuine instance of choice, selection, based upon a certain 'value judgement', and is thus intentional, and not accidental. It also makes it teleological, unless you can show a determined, inflexible, unavoidable chemical progression from the eye of the peahen to the act of copulation. In which case it is not selection/choice, since it is compelled. The ladies will not, I think, thank you for that one. Well, I only meant to assert my opinion that there is a teleological element in biological evolution. I had no intention of taking a course in genetics. I still don't, not really. I know that that is what you believe, but you'll have to prove it to me. And, BTW, ""random mechanisms"" is still an oxymoron.

Nor was it intended to be, since I make no pretense of being what is commonly called a scientist. True. But I think that the belief in a truly determinist reality has already been proved false by quantum theory. So absolute determinism is already in the wastebasket, 'mind-stuff' or no 'mind-stuff'. Which is another reason to assert the true existence of 'mind-stuff' in reality, including the reality of this universe. Not necessarily. The organism's 'mind-stuff' must necessarily be aware, even if unconsciously aware. But all it needs to be aware of is it's current state of well-being. It helps to be aware of what is contributing to a state of well or ill being, but at the very basic level, all that is needed is an attraction to this or a repulsion to that, based upon unconscious awareness and 'knowledge' of how 'this' or 'that' have, in the past or currently, have done or are positively or negatively affecting the 'self's' state of being, existence. In other words, not all organisms contain, or perhaps, have access to, the same amount, or perhaps quality, of 'mind-stuff'. The development of of organisms that are very passive and reactive to organisms that are very dynamic and proactive seems to be a large part of biological evolution. If by ""biological methods"", you mean is aware of its 'self' and its own 'biology', and how to 'own and operate' that biological 'self', i.e., to adjust, alter, and adapt that biology [knowledge of physical system, make-up and operation]then , yes, it must be at least unconsciously [or subconsciously, I'm not sure which is the better word] aware of how and to what extent it can act. Yes. How 'often' and/or how 'serious' ""mistakes"" are made are contingent upon a/the quantity of problems to be solved, the number of proximate and immediate needs and wants to be satisfied, b/, the quality, i.e., seriousness [life or death], degree of change/adaptation required, the degree of complexity inherent in the situation, and c/ the amount and/or quality of 'mind-stuff' which the organism has, or has access to. No. If the 'parent' did not have its own 'mind-stuff' operating on it, it could do nothing to enable its offspring's 'mind-stuff' to work on, to develop, to adapt, itself. No 'new-born' so to speak, has to start from its parents', 'square one'. The changes wrought in a parent in its life struggles with its own world affect its potential offspring before it even has anything started. Well, lots of things change the features of an individual during that individual's lifetime, intentionally or unintentionally. Just plain old development and aging will do that, among a million others. The issue is whether or not some changes undergone by a parent in its lifetime can in any way carry on to, be inherited by, its offspring. Obviously accidental changes that have nothing to do with adaptedness do not. Scarred faces, lost arms or tails or foreskins, are not inheritable. That does not mean that internally induced organismic changes brought on by the organism's 'mind-stuff' assessing and acting upon its state of well-being cannot and do not get passed on to its offspring, not ever, ever. As a matter of fact, modern developmental biology is, I believe, far more in line with Lamarck's ideas on evolution's mechanism/s than with the reigning 'genetic mechanics/determinism'+random mutation' paradigm. Then why hasn't the assumption of a ""Natural Selector"", aka ""Flying Spaghetti Monster"", not eliminated Darwin's allegorical hypothesis from science classrooms? Why hasn't the foolishness of the oxymoron of ""random mechanisms"" or ""mechanical randomness"" not been eliminated from science classes? Is it because 'scientists' like to be allowed to cherry-pick what is to be called 'science', and what is not, strictly on the basis of their personal philosophical preferences? Anything random is not, by definition, a mechanism, because all mechanisms are founded upon regularity, dependability, and predictability, i.e., mechanical determinism. That is why 'random mechanism' is an absurd contradiction in terms. Nothing can be both 'random' and 'mechanically determined' at the same time. Obviously, because I no longer find the old paradigm satisfactory. The instances in which I found it less than convincing are too numerous to go over. Suffice it to say, in view of what we have learned about organisms, how they operate, how they develop, etc., over the past 50 years, has simply rendered the current paradigm obsolete. IMHO. Granted, it is difficult, at least at times, to discern whether or not an event/outcome arose by accident or by intent. But it is certain that dice do not come into existence 'by accident', nor do they get thrown 'by accident' nor do the results get analysed, 'by accident'. So even tales of coin and die tossing and other wonders of statistical arithmetic and 'probability theory' are not, in and of themselves, random or accidental. I know that that is the story that has dominated evolutionary biology for the past 80 years. I just don't accept it any longer. What makes you say that? The assumption seems unwarranted, to me. Well, if I find time to look for and at it, I will. But as I've said often enough already, I'm not here to take a course of study; especially not one designed in accordance with someone else's opinions. I just want a light, pleasant discussion of the what, how, and why of life form evolution.","intelligent-designs-black-box","01:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","85"

Therefore, Darwin's theory of natural selection acting on random mutations applies to bacteria as well as to more complex organisms.

"02-01-2009","12214",6,"jakers","342058","(Re: observed evidence for Darwinian evolution) And there's your problem. Even according to your own theory it should be fallacious to suppose that just because any individual or any particular population has never encountered such an environment, that they have not inherited a mechanism from their ancestors who had already, and perhaps millions of times, encountered and devised a mechanism to deal with that very problem. If the problem environment can be shown, or even supposed, to be one that has come and gone repeatedly over million, billions, trillions, of bacteria generations, there is no reason to suppose that any given population of same has to rely on random chance, a lucky genetic mutation, to stochastically 're-invent the wheel' for the gazillioneth time. It seems top me that I am not the one who is making erroneous a priori philosophical assumptions that 'violate' Ockham's razor. I think that is the one who assumes a regular, repeatable, predictable, but totally random, utterly stochastic, brand new, disassociated set of two [on/off] genetic mutations. I wouild say that such an appeal to such dependably iterated good luck not only would offend Ockham, but common sense as well. It smacks of superstition, to me. This word, 'stacking', although quite familiar to me, seems to used by you in a sense that to me is entirely unfamiliar. Could you outline your novel use of this word, and explain just exactly what it means in terms of DNA molecules and expressed organic traits? However, I can argue that relative frequency, speed, efficiency, and specificity by which a change in life forms arise in relation to a novel environmental difference which makes that change 'positive', as opposed to neutral [ineffective] or negative [detrimental] can give reasonable grounds to awarding the accomplishment to some intentional agency rather than a great streak of amazing luck. Fine. I'll continue to assert that evolution is a process of organismic adaptation to random environmental change, and you can stop using the word 'adaptive', or any of its cognates, or synonyms, wrt evolution. Darwin must be rolling over in his grave, but he's dead, so that's his problem. And my problem with you, all along, is your incredibly cavalier attitude towards words and their true meanings. there is no legitimate way that one person, or select group of persons, can unilaterally and arbitrarily impose a new meaning on a word without the express consent of all others with whom they use that word in any act of communication, This is a flagrant example of 'special pleading'. I can't remember the exact names of the logical fallacies it falls under. What special case?!? LIFE? Life was around long before language was invented. Which might be convincing if you could demonstrate it just as easily using other life forms. Another 'special case' for 'special pleading', it sounds like to me. Exceptions are not the foundations for the rule. I appreciate the fact that if I wish to drink a glass of beer I need the beer, a hand an elbow, a throat and stomach, among other physical things. I also require thirst, taste, satisfaction, and a lot of other stuff that I would not have were I not also alive, and acting teleologically.","Peeling","342614","Sorry it's taken me so long to reply - I've been very busy with other commitments. Certainly organisms do possess mechanisms for dealing with common (but irregularly-encountered) environmental changes. You can recognise them because they kick in after the environment changes, not before. There are three main flaws with that argument. First of all, it wrongly presumes that the random, lucky genetic mutation stochastically 're-inventing the wheel' is somehow a defective or unreliable mechanism for generating the 'enzyme' in question on all those occasions. It's not. In a quite modestly-sized bacterial colony every multi-billion-to-one mutation will be amply represented purely through replication error. So supposing the existence of a responsive mechanism ready to generate each and every one is entirely unnecessary, on top of being implausible. Where are all these mechanisms? There isn't nearly enough genome to describe them all, even theoretically. Secondly, if a bacterial species had developed a responsive mechanism for dealing with an environmental change after being exposed to it millions of times over, we would expect it to work on an individual level a bit better than the one-in-ten-billion times or so it empirically does in the examples we're talking about - a rate that is on the other hand remarkably congruent with typical rates of genetic mutation. And of course, there's the awkward fact that mutants arise, stochastically, prior to and in the absence of the environmental changes to which they could be considered adaptive. I hardly think it appropriate to describe straightforward statistics as 'superstition' Pick a number from one to six and then roll a die. Did you guess right? Now ask twenty people to pick a number, and then roll a die. Did one of them guess right? Now enter the lottery. Did you win? Now get fifty million people to enter the lottery. Did one of them win? The math doesn't become invalid just because the numbers get bigger. I hardly think it's a novel use of the word. Plates stack, effects stack... mutations stack. And because they're stochastic, any given mutation is most likely to occur to the offspring of the most numerically prevalent variant of an organism - thus adding to their particular 'stack' of accumulated variations rather than to a different organism's 'stack'. You can certainly try . In bacteria, the argument fails because the demonstrable pre-existence of mutants represents effectively instant 'adaptation'. Is 'instant' fast enough for you? In sexually-reproducing organisms, the argument fails for somewhat more complex reasons. I really don't think it's a good idea to get into that right now. As I've said all along, I'll do my best to accomodate your needs. If that means avoiding using the word 'adaptive' in conjuncton with evolution, fine. Well, I can only apologise for causing your problems. Now, why is it I'm not seeing Humpty Dumpty, but an image of a monkey with his hands over his ears, sitting next to one with his hands over his mouth? You're correct that I cannot force you to accept a phrase such as 'ateleological adaption' as valid. But I can use it to converse with other people who share my understanding of it, and I can explain to those who don't what is meant by it, so that they might understand me in future. You are entirely free to abstain - which makes it much more difficult to talk to you but has no implications whatsoever for which of us is ultimately right. Hardly. Is it 'special pleading' to say that the result of division is uniquely undefined when the operand is zero? Or merely stating a logical truth? Evolutionary processes can be used, to find solutions that are 'better' according to pretty much any criteria. As you say, that both logically and semantically entails teleology: choosing a goal and then selection criteria to cause the system to converge upon that goal. No argument there. But in the unique instance of the 'goal' being better self-replication, any hypothetical teleological agent need only stand back and watch. In the absence of any externally-imposed criteria, a pool of stochastically variable self-replicators will inevitably converge upon better self-replicating variants, if they exist in potentia. It's not special pleading, it's just true. But the theory of evolution wasn't. Prior to that, we had no need to get our brains around the idea of an 'ateleologically adaptive' process, so we didn't need or have words for it. And if you have your way, we never will I'm not using bacteria as an exception. I'm using them because focusing on single-celled, asexually-reproducing organisms allows us to work comfortably with the large populations and rapid reproduction rates necessary to see genetic mutation, the slowest of evolutionary mechanisms, in operation. It's the simplest and clearest way to disprove the supposed universal principle that random changes cannot increase reproductive rates. That doesn't mean you developed a hand, elbow, throat and stomach in order to satisfy your desire to drink beer; it just means you've come up with something entertaining to do with the organs you already had. Have you ever played poker? That's a classic example of what we're talking about here. There's a telic layer to the game, and a random layer. The best players win statistically more often than the worst players, despite them both being dealt the same average quality of hands, in the long run. That's the telic layer. But it's also true that the best hands win statistically more often than the worst hands, despite them being dealt equally to both good and bad players. In life we may believe there's a telic layer, and that success and failure is influenced by that layer. Even if that's true, there's also a random layer to the game, and it too influences the outcome. The difference between life and poker is that in poker the crappy hands keep getting dealt out with the same frequency, forever - whereas in life the crappy genetic hands tend to lose 'market share', as it were. Unless the telic layer is deliberately acting perversely to prevent that happening, it's simply inevitable. Anyway, it's really late (again) and I need to tidy the kitchen before bed.

Pick a number from one to six and then roll a die. Did you guess right? Now ask twenty people to pick a number, and then roll a die. Did one of them guess right? Now enter the lottery. Did you win? Now get fifty million people to enter the lottery. Did one of them win? The math doesn't become invalid just because the numbers get bigger.","jakers","342624","Or, in this case, after they have been changed to be out of sync with the normal state of affairs, which has not changed. I believe that with bacteria it's called 'reverse' or 'revertant' mutation? It is not accidental, but an actual mechanism. Anything that happens with a dependable, predictable regularity, is not random. Actually, it is a plain statement of fact that any event, including a genetic mutation, that can be depended upon to generate a particular enzyme at a regular, predictable, rate, cannot be called defective or unreliable. It cannot be called 'random'. The mere fact that the Luria-Delbruck experiment, and others like it, have been repeated thousands of times, always with the same predictable outcome, is proof enough that the event and the outcome are not matters of chance, stochastic, accident. Further to that, the fact that no matter how many antibiotics, pesticides, herbicides, or other 'cides' we invent in our labs, so far every one has been overcome by the organisms it was meant to destroy shows that that is no accident. If a Vegas casino noticed that a gambler started out losing at every game of chance he or she tried, but always left the table the big winner, they would never put that fact down to random chance or luck. They'd know that that winner had a winning 'system' of some kind, even if they had no idea what it might be. The the thing is, I have not postulated ""the existence of a responsive mechanism ready to generate each and every one"" , by which I suppose you to mean that I had proposed that every genome contained sufficient inherited random mutations that they had something that would act as as a dependable mechanism to deal with every and any challenge that the organism might encounter. That is the farthest thing from my own opinion, but it does seem to be exactly what many adherents of the current genetic approach to evolution believe. It's their problem that they either have to believe that, which, as you put it politely, is implausible [I would have said, ""silly""], or they have to believe that random genetic mutations can and do happen almost immediately upon the instance of organismic need, and specific to that particular need, as well. Which is equally, uhm, implausible. I don't know what you are talking about, but I have never heard of a repitition of the Luria-Delbruck experiment, or any of its offshoots, that did not produce the exact same result. When something happens every time, that event is remarkably congruent with what I would call a mechanism. Accidents do not come even remotely close to that kind of regularity. And ponder this--if it were not a mechanical regularity developed as a defense mechanism over millions of generations, why does that experiment and others like it fail miserably when some truly original antibiotic is first used on batches of unexposed microbes for the first time? Let's see, in terms of being resisistant , bacteria score, --Luria-Delbruck, 100% success every time; brand new antibiotic, 100% failure, every time. Nothing random here. If by mutants you are referring to 'genes', i.e., DNA molecules, I imagine the rate of 'mutation' is fairly regular unless disturbed by some cause external to the genome which might cause that rate to accelerate, perhaps instantaneously, perhaps very rapidly. Whether or not in some cases, [such as irradiation], the mutant genes were in no way adaptive to any environment currently encountered by the organism, is of no matter. It is beside the point we are discussing. If by mutants you mean altered organisms which arise thanks to genetic or developmental malfunction [accident], these are generally considered to be illnesses, that is, system failures of some kind, and are hardly relevant to this discussion of adaptation, either. This is a red herring. I fail to see any genuine relation to the question of adaptation. It seems to be a faith statement that given a sufficiently large number of instances, anything, even miracles, can happen. Worse, that anything that could happen that way, must happen, eventually. This thinking is utterly irrational. Sorry, but all this statistical math is just that--math, not biology. I am not interested.

"02-02-2009","12214",7,"jakers","342535","A 'clue'? To what mystery, exactly? How so? I'm sorry to hear that. All of the above, I believe. I suspect that you are being, shall we say, disingenuous, since I cannot believe that you cannot put ""genetic accident"" together with ""random genetic mutation"". Surely you are familiar with that? Well, no, not really. I'm talking about random events [mutagenic random events] which change _the genes_ in an organism [i.e., 'mutate' one or more of them] to the extent that the organism's offspring [and their 'genes'][i.e., 'mutants'] are at least somewhat different from those carried, up to that moment, by it's ancestors' offspring. Lots of things can change the genetic makeup of any given population. Well, if you choose to make an enemy of everybody who disagrees with you, you've picked the proper way to go about it. Poisoning the well by accusing others of deliberate ignorance will not bring anyone over to your point of view. If any of the above are intentional or mechanical, then they do not deserve to be called 'accidental', 'random', 'coincidental', 'fortuitous', 'chance' or 'just plain lucky'. If, OTH, the presence of mechanics and/or or intent is denied, then how else are they to be described other than in those terms? Well, that is basically what I was referring to, but since you bring up these other things, perhaps I should include them under the same heading. Unless, of course, you can show that ""gene flow, recombination, and genetic drift"" are mechanical and/or intentional, then they won't deserve to be called 'random', 'accidental', etc. What ""Taint so?"" That ""the word design implies some intelligent cause""? It does. That's just the way it is. So what are you saying? In that case, since there are only the three alternatives, then those 'mechanisms' must be true 'mechanisms', i.e., chains of events that are mechanically determined and predictable, that cannot be altered or avoided. None of that verbiage relates to the plain English word 'to select', or to any of its cognates. All you are doing is offering the tautology that, 'things that do better, do better'. Well, it would be nice if they didn't just suggest what it does, but actually said what, in scientific as opposed to literary terms, it _is_. I suggest to you that anything that is not mechanical is not a mechanism, as such. At least in material terms. However, I do admit of psychological 'mechanisms' as well as material ones. I do not admit of 'accidental mechanisms', since that is an oxymoron, but that does seem to be what you are trying to put forward. Sexual selection, in the rare cases where it is actually present, is true 'selection' because it is something done by a sentient being, a live organism. An awful lot of 'mate acquisition' has little to do with any real choice. But forget about that for now. This appears to be a genuine instance of choice, selection, based upon a certain 'value judgement', and is thus intentional, and not accidental. It also makes it teleological, unless you can show a determined, inflexible, unavoidable chemical progression from the eye of the peahen to the act of copulation. In which case it is not selection/choice, since it is compelled. The ladies will not, I think, thank you for that one. Well, I only meant to assert my opinion that there is a teleological element in biological evolution. I had no intention of taking a course in genetics. I still don't, not really. I know that that is what you believe, but you'll have to prove it to me. And, BTW, ""random mechanisms"" is still an oxymoron. Well, since I'm not taking your course, I don't have to do your quizzes, do I?","pandion","342628","It was a clue that you might investigate to learn why your argument was erroneous. False dichotomy. A false dichotomy is a logical fallacy where only two alternatives are presented in answer to a question where there are more. I would have thought that you would have understood that. Anyway, ""either design or accident"" is such a logical fallacy. There are more possibilities in reality than those that you presented, and in fact, neither of your choices is correct. It would be nice if you would make an effort to use clear language in the future, in addition to making an effort to learn the basics of the topic that you are trying to discuss. Do you have so little understanding of English that you think that your simple, and incorrect, phrase conforms to all of those definitions? Yes, I am. What I am saying is that your terminology isn't correct. If you wish to discuss the topic with at least 3 degreed biologists, you should at least try not to use nonsense terms. I know what random genetic mutations are but I can't be sure what you meant by ""genetic accident."" This is especially true now that you have explained that you think that three different and exclusive definitions all apply. It's strange. How strange. I asked if you were talking about ""random events that change the genetic makeup of a population"", and you say no. You then use less precise language to explain that you were talking about random events that change the genetic makeup of a population. That is true. And I made an effort to explain many of them to you. Instead, you come up with Nazis and Jews. That makes me your enemy? The mechanisms that I mentioned are not accidents. They are random events. However, those who don't understand evolutionary theory prefer to call them accidents. It is a matter of knowledge. That can be cured by education. But they aren't intentional or mechanical. They are processes that are agents of change. They are random in nature with none of the baggage the you seem to want to assign with other terms. Do you have a problem understanding what evolutionary biology means by ""random?"" What are you talking about? The mechanisms that I mentioned do not imply mechanics or intent. Above you wanted to extent a simple statement to include all definitions of a term and now you want to limit a definition to a single, narrow definition. The wrong one. By mechanism I mean, "" the fundamental processes involved in or responsible for an action, reaction, or other natural phenomenon."" It's not mechanics or intent. Since I have already done so, the question is moot. It seems that you don't understand the use of the term ""mechanism"" in a biological context. It isn't mechanical and it isn't intentional. Perhaps it would be a good idea to actually make an effort to learn the basics of evolutionary biology before you speak. We are not talking about engineering. In that context the word ""mechanism"" has a different meaning. Your understanding to the language of science seems to be a problem here. Actually, that is what you accept on faith without evidence. In the real world design does not imply intelligence since organisms appear to have been designed for their environment. That appearance of design was explained 150 years ago by the theory of natural selection. There isn't any need to postulate a magical being. Again with a single engineering definition. And yet, you weren't able to actually settle on a definition of ""accident"" in this context. Let me repeat, a mechanism is ""the fundamental processes involved in or responsible for an action, reaction, or other natural phenomenon."" What happened to the other two alternatives? But it isn't plain English. Why is that so hard for you to grasp? It is the language of evolutionary biology. By the way, I said, ""selection."" How sad that you didn't bother to read what I said. It is even more sad that you attempt to debate evolutionary biology with even the slightest understanding of what it is or how it works. But, that's what I did. Let me say it again. Biologists simply say that natural selection lends a differential reproductive advantage. If you have a problem understanding, maybe you should follow with your finger as you read. Feel free to move your lips. Again with the limited understanding of definitions and science. You were imprecise when it came to the definition of accident, and now you want to use a narrow engineering definition of a word. That means? And, of course, you don't admit to biological mechanisms, which have nothing to do with mechanics. Please educate yourself before you speak. BWAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAH. The rare case. That's good. But of course, natural selection doesn't imply a sentient being since the environment is the ""selector."" Is that a problem for you? But I didn't say that all mating was driven by sexual selection. Pick an organism and learn about it. Peacocks with big tails produce more offspring. Lions with large manes produce more offspring. But I didn't say that it was accidental. It is most certainly the preference of peahens. I suspect that they don't have the mental ability to make value judgements, at least in the sense that you imply. Actually, I think that it is you that must show that peahens actually want to produce offspring with large, beautiful tails. So, is it teleological that many American men are attracted to women with large breasts? I can understand that women undergo breast enhancement for teleological motives, but the attraction of men? What does that have to do with ""ladies""? Are you actually aware of what we are talking about? Sexual selection isn't compelled. It is a statistical tendency. God forbid that you should actually make an attempt to learn what you are talking about. It is much more preferable to postulate that you have knowledge without the slightest thought or effort. Do you know what an oxymoron is? It seems not. It seems that you neither understand the meaning of the terms ""random"" nor ""mechanisms"" in a biological context. That would take some actual study of biology. Thank you for your admission of ignorance. It's actually pretty apparent - one might even say intuitively apparent - to anyone who understands the basics.

"02-02-2009","12214",7,"jakers","342510","... it has come to a question of whether organisms evolve by design or by genetic accident. Is teleology involved or is it a case of, "" things change, willy-nilly, and what you see today is just what was lucky enough to change in a way that suited the fickle finger of blind, random, environmental fluctuations"". To me there is no way that you can claim that anything 'adapted' to anything without speaking teleologically, or poetically. Poetically, as in, the water adapted to the drop in temperature by freezing, or the branch adapted to the rise in temperature by catching fire. The online dictionaries all say something like-- Adapt # (a.) Fitted; suited. # (v. t.) To make suitable; to fit, or suit; to adjust; to alter so as to fit for a new use; -- sometimes followed by to or for. Therefore the original [and only true and legitimate] meaning for 'fitness for' something, is also teleological. To be 'fit for' is always to 'be suitable for'. I do not see how the words 'adapted' and 'fitted' can be separated from each other wrt the words 'environment' and 'evolution'. Thus both ""Survival of the Fittest"" and ""Natural Selection"" imply a value judgement made by something or other, real or imaginary, and that makes such expressions intrinsically teleological and clearly opposite any inference of chance or mechanics. Well, to me teleology is a part of the concept of 'causation' in philosophy. That is, it sometimes plays a part in explaining what caused a certain effect, or outcome. Thus, to me, teleology is part of an Aristotelian tradition of causation, that is his 'final cause'. Anything that suggests that a 'change action' was started with a view, be it vague or clearly defined, to a desired end, is teleological. Anything that makes a value judgement on the lines of 'good, better, best', etc., wrt to itself and the world around it, is teleological. Thus anything capable of recognising itself as a 'self', an individual being distinguishable from the rest of the universe, is teleological. The concepts of 'mind', 'intelligence'. awareness'. 'volition', 'free will', 'choice', 'judgement', 'selection', 'fitness', 'suitability', 'purpose', 'use', 'intention', 'goal', 'objective', 'motive' and a thousand others are plainly teleological. To put in its simplest terms, teleology is present where a mental activity assesses a present state of affairs, makes a conscious or unconscious judgement wrt its impact on the being experiencing the mental activity, and this judgement has an effect on what that 'judge' does, and what the result of that action will be. Many people, especially of late, have ridiculed teleology as being a philosophy which insists that everything that exists, got to be where it is and how it is through the conscious efforts of some wilful external agent or agency, usually referred to as a god. [but sometimes 'evolution', That is not my belief. I am not here to deny the presence of random chance as an intrinsic part of reality. I believe that accidents do happen. Nor I am I here to deny mechanics. Observation shows us that there is law and order in this universe, because certain causes can be depended upon to lead to certain ends, time after time. I am here simply to say that where living organisms are concerned, what they do in their own lives, and over the 'lifespans' of their 'lifeforms', is not a simple matter of chemical iterations nor inexplicable failures of molecular iterations, but that there is 'something else' in 'life' itself which exercises power over the mechanics/operations/behaviours of sentient, self-aware, mentally-endowed beings, a power exercised right down to the molecular level. An intrinsic teleological power. The power to _act_ upon the world, and just to be a passive 'thing' that it acts upon. I say that you have to invoke a final cause anytime you claim that something is 'adapted' to anything. To 'adapt' yourself, or anything else, to something else, is always a teleological act. A senseless thing can 'conform' to the laws of physics and chemistry, but it can never 'adapt' to them. 'Adaptation' always connotes awareness and intention. Conformance and compliance do not. I believe that insentient matter complies and conforms entirely, passively, in reaction to whatever external forces act upon it. I believe that sentient lifeforms, i.e., living organisms, internally affect and direct what happens to the insentient matter within themselves, just as they act upon the insentient matter external to them, though by no means in the same way or to the same extent. Polar bears are white [sort of], and their ice flow environment is whitish as well. Therefore we may suppose that polar bear fur colour is another instance of natural camouflage, a phenomenon widespread throughout the natural world. Camouflage, in and of itself, [along with 'mimicry'] is an extremely interesting and mysterious phenomenon. Great topic. But for our purposes, the polar bear, once a grizzly bear kind of bear, somehow sensed that it caught more seals on ice flows when the seal couldn't see them, and, unconsciously picking up on the fact that the ice and snow around it were white, succeeded, teleologically, in making its offspring successively less brown and more white . How subconscious awareness of surroundings cause organisms to change themselves to suit, either intantly or over a generation or so, is quite a mystery. But claiming that all the brown bears died, and only mutant white bears survived, is, to me, a children's story. [boldface added] For lack of a better word, I could say 'the psyche'. Whatever ""it"" is, it is intrinsic to ""life"". Now, I have heard some people say that there is no such thing as 'life'. That is only 'matter', acting mechanically. I do not like to argue with people who deny the obvious--that is, a live thing does things that a dead thing cannot, even though all of the 'matter' is still there. So that therefore there is a true and real difference between an organism that possesses something called 'life', and another one that does not. Well. enough for now. I'll get back to this in a while. Later.","Matthew","342668","There are three problems with putting things this way. First, the alternative to teleology that you provide should not be ""genetic accident."" It should be ""genetic variation , and natural selection."" I realize that you don't like the term ""natural selection."" But however we name it, the process by which some organisms survive and reproduce more effectively than others works just the same. If you leave it out, you're leaving out the greater part of how the evolutionary process is conceived to work without teleology. Second, that greater part is not remotely as ""chancey"" a process as you make it out to be. Genetic variation is, in some sense, random: we cannot always predict when or how it will occur. But under at least some circumstances, even mutations can be predicted (e.g. irradiation), and in sexually reproducing organisms, recombination leads predictably to variation. In any event, variation need not be a matter of chance for evolution to occur. What's even more important is that the process by which these variations lead to differential survival and reproduction (natural selection) is anything but random. More on this in a bit. Thirdly and finally, this may well be a false dichotomy. It is quite possible that, what looks undirected and contingent from the perspective of natural science may be teleological or even necessary from a philosophical or theological perspective. Possible, but not necessary -- meaning that if one's philosophical or theological metaphysic leads one to presume direction for the process, the natural process is compatible with that, but there is no necessity to that presumption: if one's philosophical or theological metaphysic leads one in the opposite direction, the natural process is compatible with that, too. In either case, the natural process is the same, and it does not indicate whether there is anything teleological going on or not. And with all due respect, water freezing and wood burning are not examples of ""adaptation,"" in the biological sense of the term . See below. Do any of those online dictionaries provide multiple definitions for the term? Are any of those definitions introduced with something along the lines of "" Biol. ""? Because that's the case with my hardcover volume. It gives a biological definition, which mirrors that found in the biology textbook I bought a few months ago (when I decided I needed to know more about this stuff (Raven's 8th ed., if you're interested in the specifics)). Biologists have had to be more precise than just saying that an organism is ""suitable"" for its environment, or that it ""fits"" there somehow. The definition in my textbook glossary is that an ""adaptation"" is a feature that enables an organism to survive and reproduce in its environment. An organism is ""adapted"" to its environment to the extent that it has such features. There is nothing teleological or evaluative here. Whether or not organisms survive and reproduce is empirically observable. Whether or not any particular feature is an adaptation can certainly be disputed, and biologists engage in such investigation all the time. The role that the feature plays in enabling survival and reproduction needs to be examined. But again, it can be examined empirically. I grant you, the process by which organisms become ""adapted,"" by which they gain ""adaptations,"" may well be teleological. Or it may not be. And my view is that the non-teleological explanation of genetic variation plus natural selection is sufficient to explain this process. Perhaps why will become clearer as we go. In any event, I think you are far too hung up on definitions. Which brings me to the following: The brackets are there in your original. And if I may offer an aside on the philosophy of language, I think that it indicates some root level problems. You see, I don't think there's any such thing as a "" true meaning."" Meanings are matters of convention. Moreover, I certainly don't think that there's any link between ""legitimacy"" of meaning and ""original"" meaning. Terms take on new meanings all the time -- because the conventions that govern their usage change. This isn't a ""Humpty Dumpty"" problem, whereby any term mean can be used however one wants it to be used. No individual has control over linguistic meanings. But neither is language use as constrained as this ""original [and only true and legitimate] meaning"" idea indicates. That's simply a bad model of language, because it pays insufficient attention to how language actually works. I think you need to pay more attention to how biologists are using their terms, and stop saying that they're using their terms ""incorrectly."" If you don't want to use terms the way they do, that's certainly an option. But then you shouldn't pretend that you're talking about what they're talking about. And you shouldn't pretend that what you are criticizing is the biological theory of evolution. End of aside, back to substance: And I do, as do biologists. The term can be defined -- the notion of ""fit"" can be re fined -- in terms of survival and reproduction. Polar bears are adapted to the Arctic. What does that mean? That they can survive and reproduce there. Again, not so. What value judgment is implied by the fact that, under a given set of conditions, organisms with some features survive and reproduce in greater numbers than those with other features? What is teleological about that? Yes, I'm quite familiar with Aristotle. The problem is, his tradition of causation did things like impute purposes to stones in order to explain why they fall, or to flames to explain why they rise. I have no doubt that purposes can be used to explain the significance of the behaviors of certain organisms, whether a leopard crouching in tall grass or a quarterback throwing a pass. I also have no doubt that various phenomena can be understood in terms of the purposeful behavior to which they will be put, whether a leopard's sharp teeth or a quarterback's shoulder-pads. Whether such explanations reveal causes of behavior is an open question. But whether ""explanation"" or ""cause,"" just because purposes may explain or cause some phenomena, it does not follow that they must explain jor cause all phenomena. Behaviors? Well, okay, up to a point (alhtough there is certainly a great deal of mechanism involved in behavior). But evolution? No. Because evolution is not a behavior. But genetic variations don't happen this way! They happen whether any end would be served or not. And natural selection isn't teleological either. Those whose variations, whatever their source, enable them to survive and reproduce in greater numbers than their neighbors simply will have more descendents in the long run than will their neighbors (if conditions remain stable, of course). The individual organism are, I grant you, trying to survive and reproduce. They are not, however, trying to evolve. This is an effect of their behavior, not a goal. But genetic variation gives no indication whatsoever of involving ""mental activity!"" Nor does natural selection. It's all quite mechanical. If you think otherwise, then you need to demonstrate that organisms -- or something... -- are engaged in the mental activity in question. Til then, why should we admit it? Maybe it's not. But go back and look at the list of characteristics you just gave. You summed them up under the heading of ""mental activity,"" making ""conscious or unconscious judgments."" And before long, you'll be speaking of ""the psyche."" The only difference I see here is, rather than making this mental agent external, you're making it immanent. But whether external or immanent, it's a metaphysical thesis that has absolutely no bearing on the empirical biology. (And ironically, as a theist myself, I have no problem invoking God! I just don't think God should be invoked when we are trying to understand a process scientifically . Science is neutral on the metaphysical issue of theism.) Fair enough. But who is denying that organisms can act in the world, rather than just being acted upon? All that I'm saying is that organisms don't control their own evolution. What I mean will become clearer when we get to the bears. And I say you don't. As used by biologists, it merely implies the capacity for survival and reproduction. But see, here's the thing. Individual organisms don't ""adapt themselves."" They are adapted, or they're not, meaning that they survive and reproduce, or they don't. Over time, a species can become adapted, via a process that no member of that species controls. Who would deny that? It's just ""homeostasis."" And I'm sorry, but this is not how reproduction and inheritance work. A bear has no control over which of its genes make it into which of its individual sex cells, or which of its sex cells will unite with that of its mate, and still less which of its mates' sex cells will be the one that its own sex cell unites with. Nor does any other organism. When you're dealing with inheritance, the patterns are exactly what one would expect if the process were not directed by the organisms doing the reproducing. If you think otherwise, then the burden of proof is yours to show that there is any such causal link between the organism's ""subconscious awareness of surroundings"" and its changes over time. Personally, I think that's a recipe for getting precisely nowhere, because figuring out what a non-human organism's conscious awareness of anything is like, is a hard enough problems; when you start invoking sub-conscious awareness, it seems even tougher. The whole thing remains at the level of mystery. But if you think you can establish this sort of causal link -- or that someone else could -- then go ahead. Make me a believer. Meanwhile, the ""children's story"" quip is just empty bluster. Initially, brown bears probably weren't at much disadvantage at all. As seals became more used to the predator in their midst, however, lighter fur could've become advanatageous. This need not imply that all the brown bears never survived, just that they survived less often, and left fewer descendents. If you want to see an even better example of how the process works, check out The Beak of the Finch , by Jonathan Weiner, on the work of Peter and Rosemary Grant. Hardly a children's story. Whatever ""it"" is, you need to find many better words before I'm even convinced that it exists, let alone that it plays a role in evolution. Yes, but is the difference the possession of some thing or property called ""life?"" Or is it a difference in the organization of the matter in question? Ditto. Please no response on this one til I respond to the second.","intelligent-designs-black-box","12:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","95"

[Me:] But even granting your point for the sake of argument: Is there a principled distinction to be made between what teleology can fix and what it can't? If not, then what distinguishes teleological causation from lucky chance after all? In practice, how could we tell the difference? I didn't turn 'survival' into a 'thing', I simply said it could be a goal, an objective. Goals and objectives are not things either, and yes, they are all part of teleology. And the whole point of teleology is that goals and objectives, such as survival, DO do something. They affect what the doer does and how what the doer does is done. I object to using ""evolution' as the active subject performing an action mostly because the action it is proposed to be doing is itself, and that is absurd. Outcomes do not generate themselves. Teleologically a certain outcome may prompt a sentient being to bring it to fruition... ... but it is always and only the sentient being that a/recognises the situation, b. envisages solutions and outcomes, c/selects courses of action and follows through and d/ achieves goals. The problems, solutions, goals and achievements are not the actor, but only what the actor has, finds, or does. [Me:] In the case of the vanished birds of Guam, what particular effects did ""survival"" have on them? [You:] None, since they didn't. [Me:] In the case of the vanished birds of Guam, what particular effects did ""survival"" have on them? [Me:] If all that a teleological explanation can say is something like ""The organism's goal of survival led it to try to survive,"" I just don't find that terribly informative. [You:] Well, I do. For one thing, it tells me to look for very different behaviours from a dead fish in a shark tank compared to that of a live fish in a shark tank, if you'll accept this hypothetical image. [Me:] If all that a teleological explanation can say is something like ""The organism's goal of survival led it to try to survive,"" I just don't find that terribly informative. [Me:] Your medical student example doesn't help here. Having the goal isn't the cause of your would-be doctor's failure! And even if he were to succeed, having the goal wouldn't be the cause of his success. [You:] I want a million dollars. Teleologically, I buy a lottery ticket. Maybe I buy a lot of them. I still don't win a million dollars. I still did what I did because I wanted to. [Me:] Your medical student example doesn't help here. Having the goal isn't the cause of your would-be doctor's failure! And even if he were to succeed, having the goal wouldn't be the cause of his success. Analogies can be literary and pretty, without being rational or real. The difference between human [artificial] selection and 'natural selection' is that selection is always a teleological act. It takes a mind and a will to select. Nature as such has no embodied mind and will. Natural selection sounds great, but it's an oxymoron. It has no more to do with science than Dumbo the flying elephant. ... Because they were not mindfully, intentionally separated by a sentient being. You can mechanically sort things like potatoes and beans, but only a human being can choose/select one or another.","Matthew","342775","Here's part two. But here's the thing. In many cases where a given feature would be adaptive, the variation that would bring that feature about is not present, and fails to become so. Moreover, variations that could bring about adaptive features in one context are often present, or do become so, even in contexts where they have no adaptive consequences at all. What you need to do is, in those ""sometimes"" where you claim that adaptive utility ""causes"" the variations to appear, back that up with some evidence . Right now, there isn't any. You can't just assume that because variations sometimes produce adaptively useful features, those features' adaptive utility is what caused the underlying variation to occur. Except that your ""childrens' fable"" talk is, again, empty bluster. Bacteria are prone to high rates of mutation. Moreover, there is plenty of variation already found in any population of organisms, mutations aside. When you couple this with extremely rapid generation times, it is not at all difficult to understand why bacteria so regularly develop resistance. What you are also ignoring, still, is the fact that, prior to the evolution of resistance, the far more regular and predictable occurrence in populations exposed to antibiotics is extinction of that population. With beneficial consequences for those of us who have found such a population resident within ourselves at one time or another. This is the only reason why it ever makes sense to prescribe antibiotics in the first place: they've succeeded much more often than they've failed. So antibiotic resistance which does not yet exist somehow causes antiobiotic resistance to exist. Like I said: backwards . At least when Plato and Aristotle did this sort of thing, they made no bones about hypostasizing the causes! And if you would be more precise about just what constitutes "" too often"" and "" too fast"" and "" too cause-specific,"" I'd buy this. But right now, it looks like your subjective impression, nothing more. I mean, as to ""too often,"" we are talking about something that fails to happen more often than it does happen (with, as I said, positive consequences for those who have taken antibiotics). As to ""too fast,"" you need to think in terms of generation time. The speed at which bacteria reproduce allows vast numbers of generations in what we would count a relatively short measurement time. And as to ""too cause-specific,"" it's no big mystery. To the extent that they evolve resistance in any way that is useful to them, the bacteria will have to evolve resistance to those antibiotics they really have been and are confronted with. More problematically for your claim, they sometimes evolve resistance not only to specific antibiotics, but to whole related sets of antibiotics. I'm sorry, but now I think you're just being shrill. ""Natural selection"" is a name for a process, like ""Second Law of Thermodynamics."" The entities engaged in that process are real organisms, who really survive and reproduce in real environments, or who really don't do these things. You don't like the name? Fine. Pick another. The rest of us will keep calling it natural selection. As to ""random genetic mutation,"" well, I'm sorry, but it's hardly an invention. ""Random"" is exactly how to describe mutations. Not in the sense that they're uncaused, but in the sense that we cannot precisely when they will happen, or what precisely those effects will be, and in the sense that when they do happen, they don't appear to be directed to any particular end. My point is, when your alleged final causes fail to produce any effects at all -- when the birds of Guam go extinct, for example -- can you explain why? And once you do, will the rate of success prove to be at all different from what the non-teleological theory predicts? Because if it's not, then why should we assume that your teleological version is anything other than a redescription of the phenomena? Not without being ""things,"" they don't. ""Affect"" it? or explain it? The latter doesn't seem to involve hypostasis, but the former certainly does. And I don't object, so long as it's recognized that to speak this way is merely useful shorthand for a process the real agents of which are organisms themselves. Which fact, frankly, I've never found any biologist who used this shorthand to be ignorant of. Except that this ""outcome"" doesn't yet exist in order to ""prompt"" anything! Do you see why I'm saying that final causes necessarily involve hypostases? Plato and Aristotle happily acknowledge this. Except that, when it comes to evolution, individual organisms (with the exception of humans engaged in genetic engineering) cannot select the course of action needed to solve the problem. See my comments on the polar bears. Exactly my point! It produced no effects on them -- so it wasn't a cause . You lost me. I thought we were talking about teleological explanations of evolution , not of the behavior of living organisms as opposed to dead. So I fail to see the point of this comment. Which fails to explain why you didn't win. In the example of the birds of Guam, their failure to adapt is precisely what needs to be explained. And finally, we arrive at your definitional hang-ups again. Selection, as used in biology, does not have the requirement that you set up. You can claim -- according to what seems to be ""linguistic essentialism"" -- that the ""only true and legitimate"" meanings of ""selection"" must involve mental activity and must imply teleology. But with all due respect, you don't get to make that call . No one does. Not even Darwin: if most people had felt the way you feel about the term, it would've fallen into disuse very quickly. Heck, for an example of how little control Darwin himself had, just look at the word ""evolution."" It doesn't appear in the Origin . Yet apparently, that's what Darwin was talking about. I'm sorry, Jakers. But I really don't think your ""teleology!"" criticisms of evolution by natural selection amount to much more than semantics.","intelligent-designs-black-box","11:39 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","98"
"02-03-2009","12214",7,"Matthew","342668","There are three problems with putting things this way. First, the alternative to teleology that you provide should not be ""genetic accident."" It should be ""genetic variation , and natural selection."" I realize that you don't like the term ""natural selection."" But however we name it, the process by which some organisms survive and reproduce more effectively than others works just the same. If you leave it out, you're leaving out the greater part of how the evolutionary process is conceived to work without teleology. Second, that greater part is not remotely as ""chancey"" a process as you make it out to be. Genetic variation is, in some sense, random: we cannot always predict when or how it will occur. But under at least some circumstances, even mutations can be predicted (e.g. irradiation), and in sexually reproducing organisms, recombination leads predictably to variation. In any event, variation need not be a matter of chance for evolution to occur. What's even more important is that the process by which these variations lead to differential survival and reproduction (natural selection) is anything but random. More on this in a bit. Thirdly and finally, this may well be a false dichotomy. It is quite possible that, what looks undirected and contingent from the perspective of natural science may be teleological or even necessary from a philosophical or theological perspective. Possible, but not necessary -- meaning that if one's philosophical or theological metaphysic leads one to presume direction for the process, the natural process is compatible with that, but there is no necessity to that presumption: if one's philosophical or theological metaphysic leads one in the opposite direction, the natural process is compatible with that, too. In either case, the natural process is the same, and it does not indicate whether there is anything teleological going on or not. Do any of those online dictionaries provide multiple definitions for the term? Are any of those definitions introduced with something along the lines of "" Biol. ""? Because that's the case with my hardcover volume. It gives a biological definition, which mirrors that found in the biology textbook I bought a few months ago (when I decided I needed to know more about this stuff (Raven's 8th ed., if you're interested in the specifics)). Biologists have had to be more precise than just saying that an organism is ""suitable"" for its environment, or that it ""fits"" there somehow. The definition in my textbook glossary is that an ""adaptation"" is a feature that enables an organism to survive and reproduce in its environment. An organism is ""adapted"" to its environment to the extent that it has such features. There is nothing teleological or evaluative here. Whether or not organisms survive and reproduce is empirically observable. Whether or not any particular feature is an adaptation can certainly be disputed, and biologists engage in such investigation all the time. The role that the feature plays in enabling survival and reproduction needs to be examined. But again, it can be examined empirically. I grant you, the process by which organisms become ""adapted,"" by which they gain ""adaptations,"" may well be teleological. Or it may not be. And my view is that the non-teleological explanation of genetic variation plus natural selection is sufficient to explain this process. Perhaps why will become clearer as we go. You see, I don't think there's any such thing as a "" true meaning."" Meanings are matters of convention. Moreover, I certainly don't think that there's any link between ""legitimacy"" of meaning and ""original"" meaning. Terms take on new meanings all the time -- because the conventions that govern their usage change. This isn't a ""Humpty Dumpty"" problem, whereby any term mean can be used however one wants it to be used. No individual has control over linguistic meanings. But neither is language use as constrained as this ""original [and only true and legitimate] meaning"" idea indicates. That's simply a bad model of language, because it pays insufficient attention to how language actually works. I think you need to pay more attention to how biologists are using their terms, and stop saying that they're using their terms ""incorrectly.""","jakers","342776","NS is covered by the second part. Besides, what you call ""NS"" is just what happens after actual evolutionary alteration has taken place. All ""NS"" does is change the numbers. Any evolutionary force can create a change in an organism that will change the numbers of that organism and its genes. The issue is--is the force that changes the organism and its genes so that evolution continues strictly a matter of genetic chance, or is some organismic teleology involved. The population fluctuations that follow are merely an after-thought, mostly of interest to those who study ecology and the evolution of ecosystems, not the internal evolution of specific lifeforms. Irradiation is usually telic, not accidental, but where it is accidental, it is random, and predicting that an accident will cause damage to that which is involved is no great scientific feat. We are supposed to be discussing 'accidents' that not only do not damage anything, but actually make things much better. I've seen natural mechanisms produce serendipitously beneficial results, but I've never seen a random accidental one-off event that ever did that. Variation in and of itself is not evolution. Only an increase in variation is evolution. Well, I may not have followed your reasoning, but in case of 'science', I do not start , a priori, from a metaphysical premise and then look for 'facts' that I can mould to suit my expectations. Where I see evolution taking place today, and I do see it, there is always first a shift in environment, and then a fairly rapid change in physiology and behaviour to suit the novel environment. This observed rapidity and specificity screams, ""Non-random!!"". I clicked answers.com. This is what I got and it seems right to me. ""v., adapted, adapting, adapts. v.tr. To make suitable to or fit for a specific use or situation. v.intr. To become adapted: a species that has adapted well to winter climes. [Middle English adapten, from Latin adaptre : ad-, ad- + aptre, to fit (from aptus, fitting; see apt).] adaptedness adapt'edness n. SYNONYMS adapt, accommodate, adjust, conform, fit, reconcile. These verbs mean to make suitable to or consistent with a particular situation or use: adapted themselves to city life; can't accommodate myself to the new requirements; adjusting their behavior to the rules; conforming her life to accord with her moral principles; fitting the punishment to the crime; couldn't reconcile his reassuring words with his hostile actions. ANTONYM unfit"" I have no problem with that. I should hope that it would be examined empirically, or it wouldn't be science. It would a mythic tail made up to 'explain' stuff, like, why polar bears are white, or why penguins can't fly, but bats can.Without empirical argument you get the children's tales made famo9us by Rudyard Kipling's ""Just So"" stories, wherein, for instance, a crodile once seized the short trunk of an elephant and in the ensuing struggle, stretched it to its present length. I consider the ""random genetic mutation"" causal force driving evolution to be one of the more recent ""Just So"" stories. Well, you're not alone in your belief. over the past 80+ years almost the entire educated population on the planet has been converted to the faith. Alas, I lost my faith in the ""random genetic mutation"" fable several years ago. That is exactly what a ""true"" meaning is--one that conforms to convention, so that when two or people use it, they all give it the same agreed-upon meaning. If someone comes along and says to me, ""Well, unlike you ordinary folks, when me and my friends use this word, it no longer means what you think it means, it means what we say it means."", that's dishonest, and it ticks me off. Re-read what I just said. I did not say what you are saying I said. Sure. By common consent. Not by self-serving diktat. Unfortunately in the 150 years since ""Origins"", so many words have been distorted and misused for so long by people in a position to push their own agenda, that ordinary people have unconsciously accepted the junk that they were so carefully taught. That's why you'll often find corrupt usages of words from the glossary of evolution now accepted, in many dictionaries/glossaries, especially those written for the subject, as if they were legitimate. It's sort of a variation on the theme of, ""Tell an outrageous lie often enough, it becomes some, even most, people's truth."" Goebbels[sp?] did that in Nazi Germany. I don't believe that I put it the way you think I put it, but if I did, I meant the way I put it earlier, above. I think the word I used was ""illegitimately"". Illegitimate because they want evolution to back-up their a priori metaphysical assumption that the universe is materialist, mechanical, and ateleological. It is illegitimate to use teleological words and expressions in an attempt to prove that evolution is not teleological. If you are arguing for a mechanical reality, with no teleology, then leave out the teleological language and stick to words that do not imply awareness and intent, intelligence and willpower. If you cannot do that, then itv is simply because that is not what reality is. The fault lies with your philosophy, not the English language.

I think that the current paradigm is vacuous, but I would prefer to ignore it than than to debate it, but that apparently, is all that anyone here wants to discuss. [You:]Thus, to me, teleology is part of an Aristotelian tradition of causation, that is his 'final cause'. [Me:]Yes, I'm quite familiar with Aristotle.

And another important thing you're missing is... ...that these changes in gene frequencies across whole populations do not change by ""chance!"" That's the entire point of natural selection. You keep leaving this part out, which is the only reason you can characterize this is a contrast between chance or teleology. See? There you go again. You ignore half the story, by leaving out any mention of how natural selection works. More than half actually, since ""genetic mutation"" is merely a subset of genetic variation, and since genetic variation need not be ""random"" in order for natural selection to occur. But why quibble? If you're going to leave out any consideration of how natural selection works anyway, the game is lost before it starts. Give me a break. If that's so, then all use of technical language -- a phenomenon in which we philosophers have been known to indulge from time to time -- would be ""dishonest."" Plato, for example, would never have been to use ""eidos"" or ""morphe"" as terms in his own metaphysics. And the conventions of use don't necessarily pre-exist the terms, which is how neologism happens. (How much of our philosophical vocabulary can be traced to the terminological inventiveness of Aristotle? Among others, of course.) Somebody proposes a novel term, or a novel use of a term. Other people see the point and use it that way too, or they don't and they don't. There's nothing insidious about the process. It's just a part of how languages change over time. But you yourself simply refuse to discuss the matter if its not in terms of teleological ordinary language. As soon as someone wants to deal with the problem in terms of molecular biology and population genetics, you (erroneously) declare that has nothing to do with organismic evolution and won't discuss it. Insofar as you refuse to talk about how genes work, either at the molecular level or in populations, then you are not talking about biological evolution. I realize that you think you are, but you're not. Again you leave out the important part. Again! ""Ignoring it"" hardly indicates that you're correct to think that paradigm ""vacuous."" All it proves is that you have no interest in even trying to understand it. First, I did not say that Aristotle, or anyone else, imputed ""volition"" to stones and flames. Just ""purposes."" Presumably you think hammers and teeth have purposes without volition, so this does not strike me as controversial. Second, you did not initially say ""Aristotle."" You said ""an Aristotelian tradition ."" I therefore assumed that you were including various Aristotelian thinkers other than Aristotle himself -- including, rather pertinently, medieval theologians who explained all natural phenomena with reference to God's purposes. (Not, of course, to those purposes alone, but they were conceived to be a necessary portion of the explanations of natural phenomena.) But third, as to Aristotle himself anyway, I guess I had in mind the opening of Physics IV.8 (214b14): ""If each of the simple bodies has a natural locomotion, e.g. fire upward and earth downward and towards the middle of the universe...."" Now, while it might be thought that I am construing the ""naturalness"" of said locomotion in too teleological and purposive terms, there are more than ample reasons for thinking not. See for example Physics II.8 (198b10): ""We must explain then first why nature belongs to the class of causes which act for the sake of something...."" Or see the discussion of weather that follows, the point of which is made by 199a1-8 or so: ""We do not ascribe to chance or mere coincicence the frequency of rain in winter, but frequent rain in summer we do; nor heat in summer but only if we have it in winter. If then, it is agreed that things are either the result of coincidence or for the sake of something, and these cannot be the result of coincidence or spontaneity, it follows that they must be for the sake of something; and that such things are all due to nature even the champions of the theory which is before us [viz., a rejection of teleology] would agree. Therefore action for an end is present in things which come to be and are by nature."" As to the specifics, I doubt very strongly that Aristotle imputes volition or any other mental activity to the weather. Nonetheless, he finds meteorological (or perhaps climatological) phenomena to have final causes. For as to the general point, he finds everything in nature to have final causes. All the monotheists (Judaic, Christian, and Islamic) in his ""tradition of causation"" had to do was attribute the purposes of inanimate natural objects to the mind of God. (Or was that ""the psyche?""... ) So I hardly think my comment was much of a stretch. Further discussion of the point would be off-topic here, though we could take it to the philosophy section if you like. But somehow I doubt we're going to find too much to disagree about concerning whether Aristotle thought there was purpose in nature.","intelligent-designs-black-box","07:34 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","104"
"02-05-2009","12214",7,"jakers","342624","Or, in this case, after they have been changed to be out of sync with the normal state of affairs, which has not changed. I believe that with bacteria it's called 'reverse' or 'revertant' mutation? It is not accidental, but an actual mechanism. Anything that happens with a dependable, predictable regularity, is not random. Actually, it is a plain statement of fact that any event, including a genetic mutation, that can be depended upon to generate a particular enzyme at a regular, predictable, rate, cannot be called defective or unreliable. It cannot be called 'random'. The mere fact that the Luria-Delbruck experiment, and others like it, have been repeated thousands of times, always with the same predictable outcome, is proof enough that the event and the outcome are not matters of chance, stochastic, accident. And ponder this--if it were not a mechanical regularity developed as a defense mechanism over millions of generations, why does that experiment and others like it fail miserably when some truly original antibiotic is first used on batches of unexposed microbes for the first time? Let's see, in terms of being resisistant , bacteria score, --Luria-Delbruck, 100% success every time; brand new antibiotic, 100% failure, every time. Nothing random here.","Peeling","342955","Some experiments are indeed conducted to examine reversion rates, mainly because of the degree of control it affords the experimenter. Others are not, and the results are the same either way. As for your latter claim, that such mutations cannot be random because of their 'dependable, predictable regularity' - we're really going to have to sort that out before we can go any further. I propose we hold the parts of your response not directly related to this in abeyance until we reach agreement, at which point I'll come back and deal with them point-by-point. So, what is the real nature of this 'dependable, predictable regularity' of which you speak? It is the dependability of a die showing a six if it rolls a thousand times. It is the predictability of being dealt an ace if you play a thousand hands. It is the statistical inevitability of a low-probability event occurring, given a number of opportunities that dwarfs its improbability. Well, that's very interesting, because harmful mutations occur with exactly the same kind and degree of regularity and predictability - so they must be deliberate teleological acts too! What you call a plain statement of fact is nothing of the sort. There is a small but finite chance of any given single-step mutation occurring to any given bacterium during, for instance, cell division - a chance which can be increased via environmental mutagens, be they chemicals or UV light. In even modest colonies those tiny odds are overwhelmed by the number of opportunities for those mutations to occur, and from that arises the 'dependability' of there being at least one mutant of type 'X' already in the population when the environment changes in its favour. If the colony is very small, the outcome is far less dependable. There's nothing irrational about this, it's not a 'just so' story, you can't hand-wave it away. It's proof of nothing of the sort. The events are stochastic, while the outcome is statistically predictable because of the number of opportunities for the event to occur. This is just basic maths. The L&D experiment takes it a step further, settling the question of whether the events occur before or after the environmental change. Once again you are badly mistaken. First of all, individual bacteria aren't 'resistant' or 'not' to antibiotic chemicals. Rather they have a tolerance level: a maximum concentration in their environment with which they can coexist - and this applies to even the most novel antibiotics. Within any given population of bacteria, some will have higher tolerance levels and some will have lower, thanks to genetic variance. Antibiotics are developed by discovering chemicals to which the pre-existing range of tolerance levels is low, possibly because higher tolerance levels incur some sort of performance penalty - natural selection at work as usual. That's why it's so important for antibiotics to be administered carefully, at the right dosage and at the right time. A high enough dose will wipe out all the bacteria because none of them can tolerate that concentration of the drug. Resistant strains arise, not because the bacteria have been given time to 'figure it out', but when drugs are administered either improperly or too routinely. In the former scenario the concentration of the drug is low enough for the most naturally tolerant bacteria to survive and reproduce - and without competition from their more efficient low-tolerance bretheren, they can flourish, representing the new median level of tolerance, with further genetic variation around that point. If a high enough second dose can be applied without killing the patient, the situation can be remedied, but if care is not taken a strain can arise that is tolerant to all non-patient-lethal doses of that drug. In the latter scenario, routine administration of antibiotics, in livestock particularly, purely and simply increases the odds of the antibiotic being encountered by a very low-probability high-tolerance variant - which will then, instead of being out-competed and vanishing as it would do in the absence of the antibiotic, thrive in the wake of the devastation wrought by the drug. The reason the L&D experiment works 'every time' for the bacteria (with chemical antibiotics anyway) is that the experimenters aren't actually trying to kill all the bacteria, which they easily could do with a massive dose. Instead they run the fluctuation test at carefully chosen concentrations of antibiotic to determine the rate at which mutants emerged - stochastically and prior to exposure - capable of tolerating those levels. The original L&D experiment employed a bacteriophage as an antibiotic, to which resistance can be, IIRC, an all-or-nothing affair, in some cases mediated by the shape of a particular surface protein the phage connects to, triggering the injection of its payload. The result however was exactly the same: mutants appearing stochastically prior to exposure during colony growth. I hope that clears a few things up, so we can get back on track.","intelligent-designs-black-box","08:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","105"

You keep leaving this part out, which is the only reason you can characterize this is a contrast between chance or teleology. More than half actually, since ""genetic mutation"" is merely a subset of genetic variation, and since genetic variation need not be ""random"" in order for natural selection to occur. Give me a break. If that's so, then all use of technical language -- a phenomenon in which we philosophers have been known to indulge from time to time -- would be ""dishonest."" Plato, for example, would never have been to use ""eidos"" or ""morphe"" as terms in his own metaphysics. And the conventions of use don't necessarily pre-exist the terms, which is how neologism happens. ""Ignoring it"" hardly indicates that you're correct to think that paradigm ""vacuous."" All it proves is that you have no interest in even trying to understand it. Second, you did not initially say ""Aristotle."" You said ""an Aristotelian tradition ."" I therefore assumed that you were including various Aristotelian thinkers other than Aristotle himself -- including, rather pertinently, medieval theologians who explained all natural phenomena with reference to God's purposes. (Not, of course, to those purposes alone, but they were conceived to be a necessary portion of the explanations of natural phenomena.) But third, as to Aristotle himself anyway, I guess I had in mind the opening of Physics IV.8 (214b14): ""If each of the simple bodies has a natural locomotion, e.g. fire upward and earth downward and towards the middle of the universe...."" Now, while it might be thought that I am construing the ""naturalness"" of said locomotion in too teleological and purposive terms, there are more than ample reasons for thinking not. See for example Physics II.8 (198b10): ""We must explain then first why nature belongs to the class of causes which act for the sake of something...."" Or see the discussion of weather that follows, the point of which is made by 199a1-8 or so: ""We do not ascribe to chance or mere coincicence the frequency of rain in winter, but frequent rain in summer we do; nor heat in summer but only if we have it in winter. If then, it is agreed that things are either the result of coincidence or for the sake of something, and these cannot be the result of coincidence or spontaneity, it follows that they must be for the sake of something; and that such things are all due to nature even the champions of the theory which is before us [viz., a rejection of teleology] would agree. Therefore action for an end is present in things which come to be and are by nature."" As to the specifics, I doubt very strongly that Aristotle imputes volition or any other mental activity to the weather. Nonetheless, he finds meteorological (or perhaps climatological) phenomena to have final causes. For as to the general point, he finds everything in nature to have final causes. All the monotheists (Judaic, Christian, and Islamic) in his ""tradition of causation"" had to do was attribute the purposes of inanimate natural objects to the mind of God. (Or was that ""the psyche?""... ) Further discussion of the point would be off-topic here, though we could take it to the philosophy section if you like. But somehow I doubt we're going to find too much to disagree about concerning whether Aristotle thought there was purpose in nature.","jakers","342969","If an organisms genes and genone changes, then it is necessary to so that that organism has changed. So, they change because they change because they change because they change? You think not? Anything whose root cause is random, is random. Environmental events caused by climate change, earthquake, or whatever, are random. Ergo, any change in the populations of organisms affected by such random events are rabndom statistical fluctuations. AKA, ""NS"", ""Fitness"", etc. I have never ""left this part out"". This is interesting. How and when and why, in your book, is genetic variation not random, but mechanically determined? Not True. Aside from the fact that ontological metaphysics is categorically different, in its examination of abstractions, from science/biology [in its examination of corporeal entities], the words Plato chose did not radically diiffer from Greek usage of his time, and were therefore non-equivocal. I have never said otherwise. It is not the expansion and growth of language and vocabulary that I have objected to all along, even though you choose to think so. My objection is to a band of self-righteous true-believing materialists who have taken upon themselves the exclusive right to re-interpret standard English words and images in such a way that their equivocations make their philosophy easier for the general public to swallow when it comes to anything connected to biology,-- most importantly, to the differences between living and non-living things. No. What it means is, that short of returning to university and picking up a Ph.D. in molecular chemistry, I have spent many years thinking about it and reading about it, and after believing in it for most of my life, I was and am finally convinced, entirely convinced, that it is absurd. I think that you are semantically nit-picking, since I was clearly talking Aristotle's four kinds of causation, and not debating the existence of God. As an aside, if a creator god exists, then all things created necessarily exist to his/her/its purposes. If not, then not, but that another topic altogether. Big difference between smoke having a tendency to rise and smoke wanting, needing, and forcing itself to rise. Or at least, that's how I see it. In this case, a discussion of regularity, repetition, i.e., mechanics, is under discussion. That is, what is the nature of mechanical things, and how do they differ from random, accidental, spontaneous, coincidental things. No. He does not. He finds that they have final outcomes,[an action for an end], not final causes [a motivation to act in order to achieve an end]. It doesn't matter. Once you step beyond the limits of empirical science and into the abstract world of metaphysics, it is only rational to assume that any created thing was created for a purpose, rather than by accident. The trick is to not do what the materialists/positivists do, namely, assume that everything, including physical laws, were created by accident, and then assume that, ipso facto, everything else that follows is purely accidental. AKA, absurd. Moving away from this forum might be a good idea. Aside from you, Peeling, and Ian, I seem to have drawn a great deal of bile, bitterness, and insulting tone and language from far too many other participants. Id not need #### from strangers, so I no longer read their garbage. But it is getting so common that I have very seriously considered leaving this forum to its own devices. This is no fun.

It is the dependability of a die showing a six if it rolls a thousand times. It is the predictability of being dealt an ace if you play a thousand hands. It is the statistical inevitability of a low-probability event occurring, given a number of opportunities that dwarfs its improbability. What you call a plain statement of fact is nothing of the sort. There is a small but finite chance of any given single-step mutation occurring to any given bacterium during, for instance, cell division - a chance which can be increased via environmental mutagens, be they chemicals or UV light. In even modest colonies those tiny odds are overwhelmed by the number of opportunities for those mutations to occur, and from that arises the 'dependability' of there being at least one mutant of type 'X' already in the population when the environment changes in its favour. If the colony is very small, the outcome is far less dependable. There's nothing irrational about this, it's not a 'just so' story, you can't hand-wave it away. It's proof of nothing of the sort. The events are stochastic, while the outcome is statistically predictable because of the number of opportunities for the event to occur. This is just basic maths. The L&D experiment takes it a step further, settling the question of whether the events occur before or after the environmental change.","jakers","343027","That's not the probability and dependability I'm talking about.

There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever to suggest that when any given population of cells is completly and totally and simultaneously exposed to a novel bactericide that neither they nor their ancestors have ever had any chance to deal with, if that novel bactericide is effective, and if all cells are simultaneously exposed to it, then each and every and all cells die.

Do you have a link? You must consider two situations. We'll start with the Luria-Delbruck situation. I'll call it the developmentally inherited mechanism. Here you have a kind of bacterium, e. coli., that over millenia has evolved a mechanism for resisting attacks by the phage [?]. That mechanism is that as the colony grows and its cell numbers increase, it reaches a point where a certain percentage of new members are always formed with the 'resistance' enzyme, so that any large colony always contains a few 'pre-attack' resistant cells, while the vast majority of cells, for the sake, of collective productivity and efficiency, do not show the defensive form. That way, when the attack does come again, as it has done millions of times in their mutual history, the bacteria always has enough resistant cells to recover afterwards. This is why Luria-Delbruck is weak. It first assumes that by whittling a colony down to the point where one division is completely wiped out, that a matching but unexposed division would be wiped out if it were exposed, and so the assumption is that this batch has no resistant cells in it, simply because the other portions of the batch it came from did not. Perhaps so, perhaps not, but it is still only an assumption, not an empirical observation. After taking this supposedly resistance free batch, allowing it grow large enough to be subdivided into several separate batches, the experimenbt assumes that during the cloning process that the bacteria had no hereditary developmental mechanism of self-protection whereby as it grew, it did not restore the old and time-honored device of creating a few 'resistant' cells, de novo. Therefore it is assumed that each and every sub-batch taken from this supposedly resistance-free batch contains the same number of resistant cells, i.e., none, or very very few that might have met with a gamma ray over nite. These divided batches are left to sit some more in order to give the su[pposed rdiation time to work its magic. Then all the batches are are plated and, guess what, they all show resistant cells that vary in number per batch as if they had formed at random. The conclusion is then worked out backwards--a/These resistant cells resemble a random distribution. B/ We know that a/ the batctch we started the test from had no resistant cells, and b/ we know that bacteria, when they clone have no developmental processes that could intelligently, albeit haphazardly re-generate resistant cells. Ergo we know that these cells acquired resistant cells prior to plating, but following the 'purification' process, and since they are incapable of helping themselves, the new resistance can only have been bestowed upon them from on high by passing gamma rays acting as fairy godmothers. This thesis is so riddled with illogical assumptions and leaps of faith and lack of empirical retesting that it is a blot on science, and a Nobel prizewinner to boot! It could be easily verified, but if it was, nobody told anyone. All you have to do is repeat the experiment exactly, only do it in a lead-lined room or deep in an old minr where the radiation is reduced to nil. If the same results are forthcoming, then random genetic mutation caused by radiation, [the long held assumption], is clearly false. If no resistance appears in the absence of radiation, then the original assumption holds. Easy for any scientist to do. Why has it never been done [so far as I know]? Next the second situation, which I call the e.coli intelligently design and evolve a novel method of combating phage. This act of evolution took place millions of years, and trillions of generations in the past, so details are blurry. This much is known. Bacteria have, unlike plants and animals, two sets of DNA. Their 'personal' kit, and 'plasmid' kit of genese they like to pass around and experiment with among themselves. Also, although each cell is or can be self-sustaining, bacteria are really homogeneous entity made up of millions of cells that co-operate and communicate [intelligently] with each other just as an army might do. It has been noted that when a toxin is applied to the outer perimeter of a large bacteria colony, the dying outer edge communicates its predicament to the back rows, triggering a thing called 'hyper-mutation', in which vast number of self-induced mutations are systematically generated in a trial and error fashion that is narrowed down by feedback as some mutated cells do better than others, until, given enough time and resources, immunity to the toxin appears and developmentally improves. This true act of evolution takes place every time a big drug company spends tens of millions to invent an antibiotic to which the chosen microbe has no resistance. But because bacteria do not wait for the gamma ray fairies to strike their genes with a magic wand [random genetic mutation] strains of bacteria always rapidly develop a specific immunity to that toxin. That's evolution, and it's an intelligent, volitional process. What, nobody has ever challenged your favourite assumptions before?!? Bacteria colonies tolerate low doses, individual cells do not, unless the dose is next to non-existent. And the reason why colonies, the larger the better, resist better, the lower the quantity of toxin the better, has just now been explained to you. If so much toxin hit the entire colony at once, there would be no chance for communication, induced hyper-mutation, and trial and error feedback information in the intelligent design of newly self-mutated resistant strains. As explained above. I do note that you have now dropped your original assertion of individual testing of single cells, and now agree that all such testing is always done on large co-operative groups of cells. Some groups may be much smaller than others, but they never get tested one cell at a time, as you seemed to be claiming earlier on. That is why it is bad science to think of single bacteria cells as 'the organism'. The 'organism' is a highly organised, highly communicative, co-operative society gather together and talking to each other chemically, while they play around, scientifically, with their varying kits of plasmid DNA. Explained above, developmentally,[systemically], as opposed to accidentally. It is incredibly difficult to 'overthrow' an article of faith. That's why religions can tell the same children's stories for thousands of years. In science I believe that such an overthrow is called , ""a paradigm shift"". But it you believe that microbiologists have learned nothing that overthrows the _assumptions_ drawn from Luria-Delbruck 65 years ago, and that developmental biology, even in bacteriology, has not torn huge holes in those antique assumptions, then perhaps you need to read as much as this non-scientist has already done. Take a look at some of the stuff provided by Teleological. He/she is probably a scientist and is much better able to converse with you on these matters at your own level. In logic it is impossible to prove a negative proposition, especially one as vaporous as just what is 'possible' and and what is 'not possible'. In science, on the other hand, the onus of proof is always upon the one who states his/her hypothesis in a positive manner, and does so affirmatively, not just as a possibility, but as a reality, an empirically testable phenomenon. Your premise is therefore stated thusly-- Evolutionary changes in the morphology and behaviour [and possibly trait function] of organisms has its start point where a mutagen effects a particular portion of an organism's genome, and that deformation leads mechanically to a novel trait in it's offspring, and its offspring's offspring. Now that is an hypothesis that needs to be be tested by the scientific method, not a bunch of assumptions derived from ignorance and a similarity to statistical outcomes. As above, it is not my responsibility to do any such thing. It is your scientific responsibility to demonstrate empirically, via the scientific method, that not only 'could', but actually _do_ what you claim that they do so often ans so consistently that they are to be considered the engine that drives biological evolution.","intelligent-designs-black-box","11:22 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","120"

Let me just stop you there. There's no reason to accept your version of events, because there doesn't need to be a mechanism. The 'few' and 'small percentage' you're talking about occur anyway through replication error. Except that the same attack hasn't come millions of times in their history, any more than the same 'flu strikes every year. The 'batch' is four or five cells from a colony. That's why none of them are resistant to start with (very little chance of picking a rare resistant one). Since your 'mechanism' is indistinguishable in its effect from stochastic mutation due to replication error, I can't see how such an assumption is relevant. The hypothesis is that if this first-stage growth is timed correctly, only one or two resistant mutants would occur at most - which is borne out by later results. The expected number in each sub-batch at this stage is zero, or just possibly one IIRC. The significant observation is of 'jackpot' sub-batches, indicating the rare occasions when the mutant arose early in the sub-batch's growth (the mutant had a lot of time to replicate before plating) as opposed to late in its growth (few or no opportunities to replicate before plating). So there is in fact no indication of a dependable mechanism. The bacteria do not wait until the colony reaches a certain size before generating a resistant sprinkling of mutants. It occurs at random during growth. Tagging 'intelligence' onto that is a just-so story. And since those 'fairy godmothers' are a perfectly adequate explanation for the observation, why should we invent another? Well... it has. Routinely. Only in reverse, by the application of UV light during growth to elevate mutation rates, which in turn elevates the number of mutants - of all kinds, resistant or otherwise. You can't actually reduce the mutation rate to nil because at those atomic scales the uncertainty principle prevents perfect replication ever being 100% certain.

And since those 'fairy godmothers' are a perfectly adequate explanation for the observation, why should we invent another? Well... it has. Routinely. Only in reverse, by the application of UV light during growth to elevate mutation rates, which in turn elevates the number of mutants - of all kinds, resistant or otherwise. You can't actually reduce the mutation rate to nil because at those atomic scales the uncertainty principle prevents perfect replication ever being 100% certain.","jakers","343867","In science, all things predictable require a mechanism.

There is a small but finite chance of any given single-step mutation occurring to any given bacterium during, for instance, cell division - a chance which can be increased via environmental mutagens, be they chemicals or UV light. In even modest colonies those tiny odds are overwhelmed by the number of opportunities for those mutations to occur, and from that arises the 'dependability' of there being at least one mutant of type 'X' already in the population when the environment changes in its favour.

"02-14-2009","12214",9,"jakers","342969","[Me:] But one very important thing you are missing is that organisms and their numbers change because their genes (and their numbers) change! If an organisms genes and genone changes, then it is necessary to so that that organism has changed. So, they change because they change because they change because they change? You think not? Anything whose root cause is random, is random. Environmental events caused by climate change, earthquake, or whatever, are random. Ergo, any change in the populations of organisms affected by such random events are rabndom statistical fluctuations. AKA, ""NS"", ""Fitness"", etc. I have never ""left this part out"". ...the words Plato chose did not radically diiffer from Greek usage of his time, and were therefore non-equivocal. My objection is to a band of self-righteous true-believing materialists who have taken upon themselves the exclusive right to re-interpret standard English words and images in such a way that their equivocations make their philosophy easier for the general public to swallow when it comes to anything connected to biology... ...most importantly, to the differences between living and non-living things. ...short of returning to university and picking up a Ph.D. in molecular chemistry, I have spent many years thinking about it and reading about it, and after believing in it for most of my life, I was and am finally convinced, entirely convinced, that it is absurd. I think that you are semantically nit-picking, since I was clearly talking Aristotle's four kinds of causation, and not debating the existence of God. Big difference between smoke having a tendency to rise and smoke wanting, needing, and forcing itself to rise. Or at least, that's how I see it. In this case, a discussion of regularity, repetition, i.e., mechanics, is under discussion. That is, what is the nature of mechanical things, and how do they differ from random, accidental, spontaneous, coincidental things. No. He does not. He finds that they have final outcomes,[an action for an end], not final causes [a motivation to act in order to achieve an end]. Once you step beyond the limits of empirical science and into the abstract world of metaphysics, it is only rational to assume that any created thing was created for a purpose, rather than by accident. The trick is to not do what the materialists/positivists do, namely, assume that everything, including physical laws, were created by accident, and then assume that, ipso facto, everything else that follows is purely accidental.","Matthew","344025","You know, in light of this remark, I seriously thought about addressing all of my future comments on your posts to your genes rather than to you, ""organisms"" and ""orgasnisms' genes"" apparently being logically equivalent and thus usable interchangeably. But as this discussion is already more than polemical enough, I will simply limit myself to a brief comment, namely: Wholes and their parts are not , in fact, logically equivalent to one another, and sometimes wholes do , in fact, change in non-tautological and non-trivial ways because their parts change. If you would like to address the matter of how organisms and their genes are related to one another in substantive terms, fantastic. But if you're just going to equivocate as it suits you, all the while accusing everybody else of disingenuous equivocations, then don't bother. Not so. Take a checkerboard, two eight-sided dice, and some marbles of a few different colors. Randomly arrange some of the marbles on the checkerboard, one to a square. Designate one die for columns and the other for rows. Roll them to identify a given square. Remove its marble. Then roll the dice again to identify another square. Replace the marble you removed with a marble of the same color as that in the second square you identified. And repeat the process for a while. What you will note as you repeat this random process is that the distribution of marble colors gradually comes to be non-random. But of the course, the analogy with natural selection is hardly perfect, since natural selection is not a random process. To wit: Nonsense. Who lives and who dies in the wake of ""random"" environmental changes is not itself a matter of chance. Seriously, read The Beak of the Finch if you have any interest in how this works. When the Grants examined which finches on one island survived a drought that caused a more than 80% reduction of their population, all had larger than average beak dimensions and larger than average bodies. No small-beaked, small-bodied birds made it. And male survivors outnumbered female survivors about five to one. Once the rains returned, the birds set about mating again. And only one fifth of the surviving males were able to mate. Which ones got to do so was again not random: those with the largest beaks and bodies. The finches' subsequent offspring had, you might guess, larger beaks and bodies. But only on average: some of the young had small beaks and small bodies. This isn't random. It's how genes get passed on from one generation to the next. It doesn't show signs of direction, either, insofar as the drought survivors did not produce offspring that were optimally suited to the now-wet environment. They produced offspring exactly as one would expect given a non-directed process. Furthermore, the smaller birds became more numerous over the course of generations in the wet period. This, too, is hardly random. Big beaks and bodies take significantly more energy to build, and smaller birds were able to devote more of their efforts toward reproduction than their larger relatives, who had to spend more time feeding. These smaller birds produced smaller offspring. Again, on average: they still left larger offspring, too, albeit larger offspring who didn't fare as well as their smaller kin. Just as the non-random but non-directed view expected. And then, drought happens again, and we're back to square one. What is my point in all of this? I will accept that variation is ""random"" in the senses (1) that we cannot make effective predictions about what mutations might happen to what birds when, or what the phenotypic effects of those mutations will be; and (2) that we cannot predict which alleles (whether mutant or established) will make it into which sex cells of any one bird, or which of its sex cells will unite with which of its mate's; and (3) that what actually comes to pass as far as these ""variation events"" are concerned does not give the appearance of being controlled by the conscious intentions of any being: not the finches, not God, not ""the psyche."" But none of the variation in the finch population is random in the sense of being uncaused, either in terms of molecular activity in their DNA or in terms of the environmental factors that affect their survival and reproductive success. Nor is it even unpredictable at the level of how the whole population will be affected. (And the Grants ended up being able to make some stunningly accurate predictions, incidentally.) Now, you can say that this is just oscillation in a population if you like, that this certainly isn't ""evolution."" But that's simply not so. All it would take is a long-term shift in environmental conditions to push them in one direction or the other (large-beaked and -bodied or small-). In the meantime, evolution doesn't stop just because conditions oscillate. It's an ongoing process that happens even when conditions are stable. And I fail to see what teleology adds to this picture, scientifically speaking. (Or even, perhaps, metaphysically.) Every time you treat evolution by natural selection as a fundamentally random process, you are leaving out natural selection itself. Because the process of natural selection is simply not random. The two words that Plato most commonly used to name the non-empirical, immutable, abstract entities at the heart of his metaphysics were eidos and morphe . Eidos meant ""image."" Morphe meant ""shape."" Now, I certainly don't deny that there are connections between these words in their ordinary Greek usage and Plato's own use of them, pertaining to image and shape as ""structure,"" say. But we shouldn't mislead ourselves into the linguistic innovation going on here, either: Plato was using empirical terms to name non -empirical entities. Similarly, there is a point of similarity between ""selection"" as used in evolutionary biology and in ordinary language. The fact that, in ordinary language, the term implies a conscious selecting agent, while in biological technical terminology it does not, should not be any more troubling than Plato's use of eidos and morphe in reference to his non-empirical Forms. (Or would you say that the very language Plato used reveals that the Forms must truly be empirical after all?...) This is thoroughly ad hominem, and false to boot. There are plenty of biologists who are not metaphysical materialists, but nonetheless accept the theory of evolution as it stands. Moreover, even if the charge were not false, it would still be completely irrelevant, as are all ad hominem invocations of motive. Supposing that this were the true motive of characterizing evolution non-teleologically, it would not render that characterization false. It may well be false. All you have to do is show that genetic variation is directed. This is called Lamarckism, which is neither conceptually incoherent nor logically impossible. But nobody has ever found any evidence for it. So the odds seem long. This charge is nothing more than a straw man. There are plenty of differences between living and non-living things, and I've never seen any biologist -- never, any -- claim or imply otherwise. But the differences appear to be differences in the way the matter that makes up living rather than non-living entities is arranged. It's not that there's some animating ""life force"" out there that organisms have and non-living matter doesn't. So instead of saying that you'd prefer to ignore the dominant theory, why don't you try to convince us that it's wrong? And I did not say you were. But since you invoked ""an Aristotelian tradition of causation,"" every component of which elaborates Aristotle's four kinds of causation, I fail to see why my reference to that tradition is a problem. If you didn't mean ""tradition,"" why'd you say it? I mean, haven't you been calling people on the carpet for linguistic imprecision left and right? And how Aristotle saw it. But you managed to omit my comment that as Aristotle saw it, things don't need to have volition to have final causes. He thought it reasonable to ascribe final causes to hammers and teeth, but he would never have ascribe volition to them. Why did you omit that part? You're doing it again! Again! Genetic variation is random, in the sense mentioned above. But the process of natural selection is not random! Why do you keep ignoring that? (Brackets yours.) ""For an end"" means final cause. Why you are conflating ""final cause"" with ""motivation,"" I don't know. But it's a big mistake. First of all, is this discussion of evolution scientific or metaphysical? I thought we were talking about biology, not ontology. Second of all... ...you cannot simply ""assume,"" as you've done in each of your last two sentences, that the things in question are ""created."" Of course created things are created for purposes. But are living things created? Seems like metaphysics, to me. And I'm basically a Kantian on metaphysical matters. As far as I see it, once we leave empiricism behind, metaphysical disagreements are fundamentally irresolvable. What we need is empirical science that cuts across these unending metaphysical differences. Unfortunately, you and other IDists seem to build a contentious metaphysical point about teleology right into the empirical science of biology. Now, I'm not so naive that I think Dawkins, for example, doesn't do the same thing from the opposite direction. But Dawkins' views of metaphysics and its connection to natural science is hardly shared by all scientists or biologists, or even by most of them. So you shouldn't treat a metaphysical dispute with materialists as a scientific dispute with biologists.","intelligent-designs-black-box","01:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","128"

I intended no such thing, and I am not, and have not 'equivocated' anything. The equivocation involved is totally intrinsic to the standard model I am debating against. It is not I who equivocate an organism's genes with the whole organism that possesses them. It is your spontaneous genetic mutation model of evolution that does that. It is that irrational approach that I am fighting against, not for. According to the thinking in that model, we live in a purely material universe which is therefore mechanically determined. That is, physical event A is the sole and only cause for physical effect B, and wherever there is A, there must follow B. In biology, that means genetic determinism, that is, that gene A determines trait B. This determinism has taken a severe beating by scientific research over the past 60, but still it clings like a barnacle. You still, even after all the evidence of the various 'genome projects', hear evolutionary biologists of the mechanist persuasion speaking of 'the gene for this' and 'the gene for that'. Well, science has shown that that just ain't so. That something else can and sometimes does supercede and overrule 'genes', and that most traits depend upon many 'genes' working co-operatively, rather than a single 'point' gene [as supposed in Luria-Delbruck] determining, by chemical mechanics, an organismic trait of any but the most simple molecular kind. For eukaryotic organisms, you can just plain forget about it. Which Is why I pointed out that appeals to bacteria, yeasts, etc., are, in evolutionary theory, simple cases of 'special pleading'.

The equivocation involved is totally intrinsic to the standard model I am debating against. It is not I who equivocate an organism's genes with the whole organism that possesses them. It is your spontaneous genetic mutation model of evolution that does that. It is that irrational approach that I am fighting against, not for. According to the thinking in that model, we live in a purely material universe which is therefore mechanically determined. That is, physical event A is the sole and only cause for physical effect B, and wherever there is A, there must follow B. In biology, that means genetic determinism, that is, that gene A determines trait B. This determinism has taken a severe beating by scientific research over the past 60, but still it clings like a barnacle. You still, even after all the evidence of the various 'genome projects', hear evolutionary biologists of the mechanist persuasion speaking of 'the gene for this' and 'the gene for that'. Well, science has shown that that just ain't so. That something else can and sometimes does supercede and overrule 'genes', and that most traits depend upon many 'genes' working co-operatively, rather than a single 'point' gene [as supposed in Luria-Delbruck] determining, by chemical mechanics, an organismic trait of any but the most simple molecular kind. For eukaryotic organisms, you can just plain forget about it. Which Is why I pointed out that appeals to bacteria, yeasts, etc., are, in evolutionary theory, simple cases of 'special pleading'. Now, I'lol accept some typographical responsibility for the misunderstanding, but it alarms me that you were so quick to take offense where none was offered. I thought that with Peeling, Ian, and yourself, we could all relax and have a 'fun' exchange of views. But now it looks like this may be a tinder box like every other evolution thread, and quite frankly, I refuse to fight.

Intentional or not, it's a semantic confusion of parts and wholes. Whose ""spontaneous genetic mutation model"" are you talking about? Did you get to the part of my post where I said that I don't think mutations (or any other type of genetic variation) are uncaused? I just don't think they have final causes. -- Or at the very least, I think there's no reason to invoke such causes as a matter of empirical science. Then your fight is with materialist metaphysics. Not with biology. Because the idea that the universe is ""purely material"" and ""mechanically determined"" is not entailed by the non-directedness of genetic variation. Materialism and determinism can of course be consistent with the non-directedness of genetic variation. But so can any metaphysical view of what lies (or doesn't lie) beyond the empirical realm. My single biggest complaint about Intelligent Design is that it confuses speculative metaphysics with empirical science. Not that some scientists don't make similar conflations, usually in the opposite direction. But the two remain distinct, despite the mistakes of either side. A commitment to the claim that variation is undirected, as a matter of scientific understanding of the natural world, simply does not entail a commitment to either materialism or determinism, as matters of metaphysics. Except that, as you point out, science itself ""has shown that that just ain't so"" -- and yet, it has still found no evidence that variation is directed!

As for my, ""they change because they change because..."", if, as you did, one adopts the determinist mechanical gene-driven hypothesis re organisms and their traits, and if, as you did, you attribute gene change to 'random mutation', i.e., spontaneous, accidental, non-mechanical, non-intentional, undirected random causes, then , in point of fact, then that is exactly what you are saying.. I am talking about that great mass of geneticists, molecular biologists, statisticians, et al, who have, ever since the late 20's and early 30's, have insisted upon coupling Darwin's ""Natural Selection"" imagery to the geneticist/statistician [see Wright, et al] supposition of genetically determined, rando, [spontaneous] and undirected evolution, which is most commonly referred to as ""Random Mutation plus Natural Selection"", often simply as ""RM+NS"". No, but, FYI, ""spontaneous does _not_ mean ""uncaused"" or ""without cause"". In fact, if you'll re-read Luria-Delbruck, you'll find [if memory serves?] that they referred to their 'mutations' as 'spontaneous'. In that sense 'spontaneous' simply means 'undirected', 'unintententional', 'random', etc. You are probably right. But we are stuck with the fact that it is biology, most specifically, evolution, that those of the Materialist/Mechanist/Positivist metaphysical persuasion have latched onto, via ""Random Genetic Mutation"", in order to convince the world at large that the universe is unintentional, a wierd accident, an act of spontaneous generation unintended, undirected, accidental, and ateleological, which not only 'could have', but in fact did, arise out of nothingness and nowhere thanks to nothing else at all giving it the least aid and support. They do this because they [rightly] fear primitive religious passions and the violence and horrors that they generate. But their motives, albeit honourable, are not scientific, but ideological, and all that they have done is deflect scientific attention away from the way evolution, and universes, operate. I did not say it was ""entailed"" by genetic determinism. Isaid that genetic determinism is part and parcel of an over-view that that the entire universe, and every event in it, are mechanically pre-determined. And the fact is, that unless you insist upon genetic determinism in evolution, not only does your ""evolution via RM+NS' hypothesis fall apart [because that would admit of something non-genetic, non-molecular, non-corporeal intervening between gene and expressed trait], the entire notion of a spontaneously self-generated universe would also crumble. And that way, materialists believe, [with unfortunately, some reason] back to horrible days of religious fundamentalism, and people dying [a la Palestine] for the sake of a children's story. The brand of ""Intelligent Design"" associated with fundamentalist right-wing politics in the USA and Canada does that, it is true. Mine does not. However, the ""RM+NS"" hypothesis is equally guilty of confusing speculative metaphysics with empirical science. Of course there is a lot more in play here than typoes and misunderstandings. But never pretend to yourself that what goes on in evolution debates is all about 'science', on either side. Only scientists bother to debate pure science. Whether you like it or not, all public debates wrt to life and evolution are philosophical debates, with 'science' merely appended to attach more or less credibility to some ideological POV, and it is that POV, not the science, that is AL:WAYS the core issue in these debates, for ALL participants, even those who pretend to be mere objective empirical 'scientists'. In the end, that is what it all comes round to, when a supposedly scientific ""theory"" depends for its very life upon an assumption of strictly genetic molecular mechanical materialist determinism. You see, we have 3 choices only,unless you can find me another. Choice 1--RM+NS, a gene is changed, ergo, mechanically, a trait is changed [genetic determinism]. Choice 2--A trait's change begins with the accidental, random, spontaneous mutation of a molecule called a gene, but it is not determined by that mutation, because along the way from 'gene' to 'trait', all sorts of other accidental, spontaneous, random, undirected aberrations take place, too, so that in fact all traits are spontaneous and random, both to their genes and the expressed traits, which are only coincidentally adaptive to specified environmental demands and opportunities. Choice 3 The organism attempts, when necessary or highly advantageous, to adapt itself to environmental circumstances, and to that end operates upon itself entire, including its own genome, and records adaptive changes in its 'self' in the code of its genome. Sometimes it wins, ofttimes it loses, and in some cases, the inability to operates successfully upon itself, its physiology, behaviours, and trait functions, it dies, along with all its kind, and we have another extinction event.

That would be a manifest contradiction, so it's hardly surprising that the evidence for it is non-existent. But I do thank you for using those brackets and differentiating what I actually said from the straw man you're keen to knock around. What I said was, ""variation is undirected."" This is because variation sometimes makes organisms more adapted to their environments, but it often makes them less so, and many times has no effect at all. Variation happens, and it doesn't have an intrinsic tendency toward adaptation. That is Lamarck's hypothesis -- and there is no evidence for it. And if that's the teleology POV, it's wrong. Organisms don't try to direct their physiology and behavior toward adaptation. They try to survive, and they try to reproduce. The indirect effect of which, under a given set of genetic and environmental circumstances, can be adaptation. Or not. I've discussed the brown bear ancestors of polar bears and the Galapagos finches with reference to this issue. The stuff about the bears was speculative, but the stuff about the finches referred to the work of the Grants. And my point has been that organisms don't produce offspring that would be adaptive any more frequently than the Mendelian-molecular model of inheritance predicts they will. Nor is there any evidence that they are ""trying"" to do so. Why do you keep ignoring this? Twice now, at least. And once again, you characterize the whole process as more ""random"" than it should be, precisely because you ignore the fact that natural selection is not a random process. It's not that some random mutation comes along and overrides a previous random mutation. It's that under a given set of environmental conditions and a given sequence of environmental events, the variations that already exist in a population -- and these variations do not have to be ""mutations,"" incidentally (but I digress) -- will cause their bearers to survive and reproduce with variable degrees of success. This process -- e.g. in the Galapagos finches -- is non -random! I mean, look. If it were random, then there should have been drought survivors of all different sizes. There should have been successfully mated male survivors of all different sizes. But that's not what happened. Why do you keep ignoring this, too? It looks to me like you're fighting a straw man. And not an assumption made by evolutionary biology. Mutations do, of course, happen. They are indeed often harmful, and they are, on some level, an ""ultimate"" source of variations. But they are hardly the only source of variation, and biologists don't say so. And all that I find ""astonishing"" here is that you actually seem to believe this. A difference in "" what it takes,"" sure. Under a given set of circumstances, some features would be adaptive for an organism, while others would be maladaptive. But that does not imply an essential difference in the process that yields both adaptations and maladaptations. You seem to be saying that there must be such a difference. 'Sure we could chalk maladaptation up to material and efficient causes -- but only final causes could explain adaptation.' One sort of explanation for failure, another sort for success. And that's what I don't buy. Perhaps so, but do non-human organisms comprehend this need and try to meet it? Do they do so by planning ahead and trying to adapt themselves? Show me the evidence. Explain to me what is going on in their conscious or subconscious minds (as you mentioned in the discussion of the polar bears' ancestors). Or in ""the psyche."" (Or in Gaia, perhaps? Is that where you're coming from? Gaia theory?) I think you have bitten off much more than any human being can chew. ""It is quite simply silly to suppose that"" this is how biologist propose that evolution by natural selection works. Yet again: straw man. But what are you astonished at? Not biology. Your straw man. [QUOTE]Even were I to grant, [which I do not, but will not argue against], that by some billion to one chance fluke of nature a spontaneous/random genetic mutation did, once or twice, by incredible good luck, result in coincidentally granting an adaptive advantage to this organism or that... See? Again with the straw man. Regularities? You mean, the sort of things that STATISTICS can be used to describe? Come on. And I'm still not sure why you think the ""standard model"" of evolution is special pleading. Living things work differently from non-living things. You yourself have said as much. Sounds like all of intelligent design to me! What about using them to describe -- how did you put it? -- ""observable regularities?"" Only if you mistake the map for the terrain, which biologists don't, so far as I can see. But not to prompt one correctly . As you yourself have said, appearances can deceive. And this is a case in point. ""Researched?"" I wouldn't put it that way, no. But it doesn't take much ""research"" to realize that his theories about environmentally induced variation failed, miserably. It is always ad hominem to invoke features of the messenger -- including not only his character but also, as is unfortunately less frequently acknowledged, his motives -- in order to discredit the message. Every time you critique evolutionary biology by talking about metaphysical agendas or politicking in their name, you're guilty of ad hominem attack. ""Look it up."" Perhaps so! But if so, a fact that is completely irrelevant to whether the science in question was good science. It's not based upon ideological differences. It's based on scientists' estimate of what is or is not quality science. If that offends anybody's politics, so what. Who was appealing to popularity? I was merely saying that a whole lot of people disagree with your assessment of the merits of the research in question.

But we are stuck with the fact that it is biology, most specifically, evolution, that those of the Materialist/Mechanist/Positivist metaphysical persuasion have latched onto, via ""Random Genetic Mutation"", in order to convince the world at large that the universe is unintentional, a wierd accident, an act of spontaneous generation unintended, undirected, accidental, and ateleological, which not only 'could have', but in fact did, arise out of nothingness and nowhere thanks to nothing else at all giving it the least aid and support. They do this because they [rightly] fear primitive religious passions and the violence and horrors that they generate. But their motives, albeit honourable, are not scientific, but ideological, and all that they have done is deflect scientific attention away from the way evolution, and universes, operate. ...unless you insist upon genetic determinism in evolution, not only does your ""evolution via RM+NS' hypothesis fall apart [because that would admit of something non-genetic, non-molecular, non-corporeal intervening between gene and expressed trait], the entire notion of a spontaneously self-generated universe would also crumble. The brand of ""Intelligent Design"" associated with fundamentalist right-wing politics in the USA and Canada does that, it is true. Mine does not. However, the ""RM+NS"" hypothesis is equally guilty of confusing speculative metaphysics with empirical science. In the end, that is what it all comes round to, when a supposedly scientific ""theory"" depends for its very life upon an assumption of strictly genetic molecular mechanical materialist determinism. The organism attempts, when necessary or highly advantageous, to adapt itself to environmental circumstances, and to that end operates upon itself entire, including its own genome, and records adaptive changes in its 'self' in the code of its genome.","Matthew","344219","Jakers, that was most certainly not my ""claim."" That is your straw man (mis)interpretation of my claim. I hate to break this to you, but there is a relationship between genetic change and phenotypic change. To say this does not commit one to the ""determinist mechanical gene-driven hypothesis"" you are so keen to attribute to me. I really don't get why you refuse to address genetics at all . Every time someone brings up ""molecular chemistry"" (?) you idignantly refuse to get a doctorate in the ""subject,"" as if that were required in order to grasp the ideas at hand, and you then proceed to dismiss them. Ditto for statistics and probability, despite that what is being discussed are the variable characteristics among the individuals that comprise populations, and the ways and likelihoods of those characteristics changing over time. It's as if nothing in molecular genetics or population genetics counts as ""science"" to you. And that's just plain sad. I think it absolutely cripples your ability to grasp how the process of natural selection, that you so vehemently criticize, even works. But of course, I did not make this attribution! Because I do not think that all gene change is random, when we're talking about gene changes in populations , subject to differential survival and reproduction -- i.e., to natural selection, a non -random process that you have, yet again, left out. Fair enough. Which is a metaphysical abuse of the theory, not anything implied by the theory itself. There are plenty of evolutionists who don't share that metaphysic at all, and even plenty of evolutionists who are materialists reject using evolution to further their metaphysical views. Nuclear physics makes weapons of mass destruction possible. If one objects to such weapons, that hardly renders the physics faulty. Ah, so you do have an IDist axe to grind! But that would be ad hominem of me. What is less ad hominem is to point out that ""RM +NS "" certainly does incorporate something other than genes into the model, namely the entire set of environmental circumstances in which organisms find themselves. Even as you mention ""NS,"" you ignore it. Meanwhile, if you think there really is something ""non-corporeal"" at work here, get set explaining it. I'm not sure that it would or even could have anything to do with ""science,"" but you're welcome to persuade me otherwise. Gaia theory, perhaps? Or what? No, some materialists (e.g. Dawkins) are. It doesn't. You have got to distinguish the metaphysical views of a few vocal materialists with the empirical science of evolutionary biology itself. Show me the evidence! Don't just claim it. Prove it! Give me the grounds that show organisms ""attempting"" to change their own genomes! Tell me how to get into the conscious or subconscious ""mind"" of a bacterium or a snail or a mosquito or a fish or a finch or a bear so I can understand what it's ""attempting."" Because ""RM+NS"" ( don't forget the ""+NS"" ) can explain how these changes happen. Why is your ""teleological"" explanation preferable?

What I have actually asserted [and here repeat] is that adaptation by organisms to random changes in their environment is simply too common to be a matter of sheer good fortune. That is, that the concept of spontaneous, random, accidental, undirected, unspecified alterations in this DNA molecule or that one, whatever,[ya spins the wheel and ya takes ya chance], leading inevitably and immutably through the determinism of an organism's molecular mechanics to a change in the function, size, shape, operation, capacity or whatever of some portion or trait or property possessed by an organism--[a change, that is, which is meaningful, i.e.,non-trivial, enough to be remarked upon empirically as something truly novel, original, and at the same time adaptive, positive, and productive, [in the organism's own terms] that it may be said that that lifeform has in fact evolved, is so speculative, flimsy, hypothetical and lacking in scientific [empirical]] observation and testing that it is no better than a superstition. Sorry for the run -on, but I think the thought process is plain enough to follow without too much difficulty. Quite frankly I said at the start that I was only interested in debating the merits of ""Intelligent Design"" in this thread, not in attacking the standard geneticist/molecular biologist/statistician model for evolution's supposed source of causation. I believe that I stated plainly at that time, that statistics, and any suppositions derived from statistics, were of no interest to me, because I saw and see no reason to suppose that that arithmetic offers or provides anything empirically testable. Empirical, scientific observation of organisms and their traits, not their census numbers, nor any book-keeping wrt to the comparative ledger balance, plus or minus, wrt to the relative totals of specified DNA molecules between different organisms of the same kind. In addition, let me add that statistics do not explain themselves. They are measurements, observations, of numerical, arithmetical, effects, outcomes. Observations of effects does not explain the causes of said effects, but that is precisely what you geneticist/statistician/molecular biologists are trying to do with your antique bacteria experiments. You are trying to make a statistical effect the proof of an empirical cause, [random, accidental DNA molecule mutation] for an organismic phenomenon--evolution. Well, that's simply not science,and I'm not buying any, I've exposed and explained this flaw as it pertains to Luria-Delbruck and company. I've done so by pointing out properties which we now know bacteria to possess that were unknown in 1943, and which pretty much squelch the entire notion of anything, even an organism as primitive as a bacteria colony, evolving by happy accident alone, is preposterous. You simply hand-wave the findings of modern microbiology off like smoke, and pretend that what I'm saying, what I believe to be the scientific case, is merely some kind of stubborn refusal to face 'the facts' of statistics. Well, since all that statistics are is meaningless facts requiring interpretation before they mean a darn thing, what you are really saying is that I'm just being stubborn when I reject your interpretation of those facts. But the truth is, there is nothing, either in logic, reasoning, or science, that should compel me or anyone else to accept your interpretation of your statistics. ['quote] That's all you've ever said, and it's in defiance of basic statistics.[/quote] See, there you go, talking as if statistics, [which are numbers, which are nothing more than meaningless factual observations], are really meaningful in and of themselves alone! I've never challenged a fact. That would be silly, since by definition a fact is something indisputable. So I've never ""defied basic statistics"". I've simply noted that statistics are meaningless without a causal explanation for them, and that they do not ever explain themselves, and that all given explanations for supposed causes of statistical effects/facts are strictly hypothetical until empirically demonstrated by the scientific method. But you guys just want to wave off the scientific method of establishing causation and go straight from, 'these effects _look_ random , statistically -speaking', therefore their cause _actually is_ random'. Very bad science. I find that you have a very exagerated awe of statistics, what they are, and what they can and do contribute to hum understanding. I do not defy them, but unlike many [no offence?] I do do not bow down and venerate them for their own sakes. Now you're just trying for a laugh by offering absurdities. OK Excuse me?!?! Where and when did I ever 'deny to your face' that statistical number comparisons, as empirical observations, can compare positively [in statistics terms] to census expectations founded upon earlier observations of fact? Or indeed, where and when did I ever say that numerical outcomes cannot look stochastic, or cannot look stochastic if anyone predicts that they will look that way? I've never said any such thing. If you can quote me, with post number, please do so. Otherwise do not put words in my mouth, please and thank-you. I dragged nobody anywhere. I have never ever denied that the Luria-Delbruck stats looked like a random result. Instead, I pointed out, as I have always pointed out, that just because something resembles a random effect, that in no way shape or form proves that it had a random cause. NOT, that is unless you first assume that there are only 2 kinds of causes-1/mechanically determined, and 2/ random, i.e., stochastic. Given this false dichotomy as an a priori materialist assumption, if effects look regular and predictable, formed, regulated and constrained, then they are 'mechanical'. If not, then they are, perforce, random. Problem is the false dichotomy, because, in my view and that of several billion other people, there is a third alternative to the determined/random dichotomy--teleology. Intention. And the fact is that facts, results, outcomes, both those that resemble products of ordered and predictable mechanical causation, but also those that look like disordered, accidental, and random products, can both be truly the result neither of determined, nor of random, causation; but rather, of teleological causation.

Post 79 Speed and specificity and regularity. That is , their resistance/immunity happens way too often, way too fast, and way too specific to cause, to simply be a matter of happy accident, of chance mutation. Post 88 The only reason you call such a regularity, 'random', is because that is what you'd like it to be--a 'random mechanism', a self-contradictory oxymoron, because that would help it fit into your a priori assumptions of what everything is all about.

I wouldn't dream of claiming random mutation is responsible for all organismic adaptation. I wouldn't dream of dismissing the last sixty years of research into the biology of bacteria and other organisms. But RM is unquestionably happening ; it's a part of the grand biological process whether we like it or not. I don't have a philosophical axe to grind here; I don't have a 'materialist agenda'. I just want to get the clearest possible picture of what's actually happening, warts and all. And to do that we can't just brush contributing factors like RM under the carpet and pretend they don't exist or don't matter. We need to fully understand their contribution so that our understanding of everything else isn't grossly distorted. Recall the poker analogy, which I think was the closest we came to a meeting of minds. You talked about 'aces up sleeves' and suchlike, and it's certainly the case that organisms possess developmental contingencies to a greater or lesser extent. Let's examine that analogy in more detail. Are you familiar with Texas Hold'em? Each player is dealt two cards, and must make the best hand he can with five further cards dealt to the table. This game is a particularly good analogy because the player's two 'hole' cards can be thought of as his genes, and those dealt to the table, the environment in which he and all his fellow players are living. So while, as you suggested, a player can possess developmental contingencies (cards up his sleeve) they are only effective within a limited range of environmental peturbation. Where biology and poker sharply diverge is in the way the 'cards' are dealt to the players and the table. In poker there is no continuity: the 'genes' and 'environment' are shuffled and re-dealt each hand. The effect of this is to render the influence of the cards neutral over the long term, so that winning or losing is in the end a matter of player skill and strategy. In biology on the other hand there is genetic and environmental continuity, and that changes everything. Imagine a game where the shared cards remain on the table, with maybe one or two changing occasionally. The same happens with the players' cards: kept from hand to hand with one changing occasionally. And the winner(s) of each hand get to give a copy of their cards to another player for the next round. The 'best' hands proliferate and the 'worst' abate - best and worst being strictly in the context of the environmental cards on the table, of course. And so the 'gene pool' will, after a fashion, blindly track the environmental changes. In this version of the game we've removed all skill and strategy, and reproduction of cards is asexual, so it's a very limited analogy for biology. You're absolutely right that in macroscopic, sexually reproducing species adaptation does not tally with the occurrence of random mutation, and bacteria possess many contingent mechanisms or behaviours. But that doesn't mean RM+NS can't 'work', or has no influence in the grand scheme of things. It just means that in order to detect unalloyed RM+NS it's necessary to filter out other evolutionary factors, something which is most readily achieved in the lab with bacteria. We agree that pertinent mutations have been shown to arise, during colony growth, in a statistically stochastic pattern prior to environmental change. There is no empirical evidence of it being a response to the colony achieving a 'critical mass', or indeed a response to anything at all. Up to this point the possibility remains that, as you would prefer, the genetic dice are being rolled on purpose by the bacteria as insurance against future environmental change. They can't know what's coming, or predict the effects of mutation, so a degree of randomised biodiversity is about the best strategy one could hope for under the circumstances. Does that sound fair enough? That hypothesis fails when we investigate causes of mutation. The empirical fact that the rate of mutations - both adaptive and maladaptive - increases linearly with radiation dosage indicates the genetic dice-rolls are inadvertent: externally induced, unintentional. This fact does not vindicate philosophical materialism or determinism in the slightest, it is merely a truth we must factor into our model of evolution: among random mutations there are those that do turn out to be pertinent to future environmental changes, and in bacterial colonies of billions those individually rare events are sufficient to explain our observations of evolutionary adaptation under controlled circumstances. I say again for the record: this is not the be-all and end-all of evolution. It is merely one ongoing, inevitable process which we must recognise and accept, or else be led into grave error. That's not what I claimed you denied. You denied that random mutation could be a sufficiently reliable process - reliability being a statistical measurement - to account for the regularity of results from tests like L&D. I've included several supporting links below. The comparison in question was not, as you now claim, between observations and census expectations based on previous observation, but between observation and prediction based on hypothesis. By saying that the occurrence of bacterial resistance is too regular to be explained by random mutation, you are denying the statistical math that leads us to expect precisely the observed degree of regularity given a tiny finite chance of mutation per cell division - ie, replication error. I know. Nevertheless, you attempted to deny that the results of the L&D test indicated stochastic mutation: I'm sorry, but you repeatedly denied, to myself and to others, that the L&D results matched the expectations of a hypothesis of random mutation: I could go on, but I think the point is proved. You said I must be 'superstitious', wearing 'ideological blinkers', prone to believing in 'children's fables' - hardly the words of someone who accepts that the predictions of the RM hypothesis match our observations. And time and time again you explicitly said the outcome, the effect , was too reliable, too regular, too predictable - more denial of the correlation between RM's predictions and our observations. You offered an alternative teleological cause, but the only argument you leveled against RM, other than scorn, was that RM could not explain the observed effects. An argument you've since admitted is incorrect. Correct. You distinguish between causes by bombarding organisms with radiation and observing the linear elevation in their mutation rates. L&D on its own directly proves that mutations occurred stochastically during cell growth prior to environmental change. It eliminates the possibility of the underlying mechanism being responsive. Bombardment with radiation, and the observation of linear change in mutation rates, eliminates the remaining uncertainty as to whether the mechanism is endogenous - a deliberate strategy - or exogenous (environmentally induced and unintentional). Once again, this is not the sum total of evolutionary processes. But it is one of them, it is part of the whole.

"02-18-2009","12214",10,"Matthew","344218","The thesis was not that ""'variation is undirected [toward adaptation] .'"" That would be a manifest contradiction, so it's hardly surprising that the evidence for it is non-existent. But I do thank you for using those brackets and differentiating what I actually said from the straw man you're keen to knock around. What I said was, ""variation is undirected."" This is because variation sometimes makes organisms more adapted to their environments, but it often makes them less so, and many times has no effect at all. Variation happens, and it doesn't have an intrinsic tendency toward adaptation. That is Lamarck's hypothesis -- and there is no evidence for it. Organisms don't try to direct their physiology and behavior toward adaptation. They try to survive, and they try to reproduce.","jakers","344301","Up to this point our discussion has been pleasant. But your tone is now turning towards that of others that I automatically ignore. You will not hear from me again should this persist. The confusion between us here is that you are speaking of 'variation' _after_ it has been created and inherited, whereas I have been speaking of the creation of novel variation, i.e., evolution. Please specify that you are talking about 'ex post facto' variation, inherited variation, when that is what you intend. Whenever you say something like ""Variation happens, and it doesn't have an intrinsic tendency toward adaptation."", you lead me to believe that you are talking, not of existing inherited and established variation, but of the creation of novel, original variety in addition to that which inheritance brings with it. And of that you offer that it just ""happens"", as in the vulgarity ""sh-t happens"", spontaneously, for no mechanical nor teleological reasons. That it simply does, out of nowhere and nothing, by pure random chance i.e., the intrinsic systemic entropy of a 'genetic copying error' , or a toxic deformation of a DNA molecule by some external mutagen. You don't speak of 'genes', here, but I don't think I am offering a ""strawman"" by interposing them into the thought, since I do not believe that you meant that organismic trait variations simply popped into existence altogether on their own, willy-nilly. OTH, I speak of the evolution of novel, original variation, something beyond the standard parameters of established trait variation for any given species. I do not believe that such creation is an uncaused event, nor do I believe that the causation of such events must be either chemically mechanical -[determinist], or stochastically spontaneous, i.e., random. I believe that there is also a third alternative, something based in what Ian has called ""mind-stuff"", which, as intelligently directed volition, aka, 'intelligent design'. is also capable of shaping ,changing, developing, i.e., informing, organismic traits, including brand-new, original, evolved traits. I am not at all concerned with the 'ex post facto' consequences involved ecologically between a certain species or a certain variety of a given species, ex post facto, after it has been expressed and exposed to its environment with whatever distinct individual trait combination it has. It goes without saying, as a truism, that if it expresses traits that match its needs to what the environment has on offer, it thrives. If it doesn't, it does poorly, and quite often perishes. It takes no scientist to say that the better suited [adapted] to a given situation one is, the better off one is. That's mere tautology, and basically, that is all that ""Natural Selection"" does say. I am strictly concerned with that which causes novelty, originality, diversity, and unprecedented variety in lifeforms over time. That is what I call evolution--the origination of novel biological traits, and the causes for that phenomenon are all that interest me. ""NS"" would happen no matter whether 'random mutation' did it, god did it, mother nature did it, the fairies did it, or nothing did it, it simply happened to happen all by itself, spontaneously self-generated. As it hap[pens, I choose ""none of the above"" did it. Unless you interpret the word 'god' very , very broadly, well beyond the bounds of any earthly religion of which I am aware. That's your opinion, you're entitled to it, it is in fact the ruling and most popular opinion, but I respectfully disagree with it. How can you admit this, and at the same time deny their efforts to adapt themselves to the living conditions in which they find themselves? Trying to survive and trying to reproduce are acts of trying to adapt. They are wilful, aka teleological, actions. If you admit, as here you do, to teleology in the everyday adaptive behaviour of organisms, where do you find the right to banish teleology from the long-term, generational adaptive behaviour [evolution] of lineages of organisms? You either must do what the last die-hard materialists, such as that fellow, Richard Dawkins, do, and claim that life-forms, organisms, are mere automatons, robots, zombies, whatever, that have no teleology in them. That, despite empirical appearances, they merely react mechanically in ways determined chemically by 'the laws of physics', without anything like true 'intelligence' or true 'volition' involved. Just mere passive subjection to the external compulsions of the material world batting them this way and that, like billiard balls. ""Variation just happens"", and so on.

To simplify, your hypothesis [called a 'theory', although never tested empirically], is that information moves from accidentally altered molecule that by merely existing contains coded information that then is mechanically, deterministically, moved along a chemical developmental conveyor belt until at length a novel [at least in part] organismic trait appears. In my hypothesis, more of the Lamarckian style, information comes to the whole organism from the environment. The organism deals with this information in such a way as to further its own 'best interests'. If during the course of doing so, its behaviour patterns and trait functions change, then this new information is passed on to its offspring during the developmental process, enabling the offspring to use the parent's experience to better work with the information that the environment is supplying. If the same conditions persist over successive generations, more information is collected and expanded, both in terms of behaviour and, if necessary, physiology. Eventually this info 'hardens' and becomes mechasnised and systematic as the organism encodes it on DNA molecules in its genome.

"02-26-2009","12214",11,"Peeling","344825","I think trying to respond line-by line would be somewhat impractical, especially when only one or two issues are at stake. I will instead try to summarise; let me know if I miss anything important. So we agree random mutation happens. I'm confident you would never argue that radiation or chemical mutagens can somehow 'avoid' causing mutations that later turn out to be pertinent, so it follows we agree radiation or chemical mutagens can and do induce such mutations. Yet according to you we can infer nothing from these facts because we are supposedly not allowed to explain a phenomenon via a mechanism which would only rarely and exceptionally generate it - even if that phenomenon is empirically rare and exceptional! Forgive me, but I cannot see merit in that reasoning. Whatever the explanation, it must necessarily only predict rare and exceptional 'success' within individual bacteria, or else it will not accord with our observations. So why is a rarely successful telic process a better explanation than a rarely pertinent natural process? Moreover, if random mutations can, as you say, in exceptional cases turn out to be pertinent, they necessarily account for at least some fraction of the observed occurrences of pertinent mutations.","jakers","345100","Hi; I think that that is a good idea, especially as something has come up that is really eating into the time I have available for fun chats and debates. You may be gettinmg veryshort, 'hit and run' messages for the next few weeks. I hope you won't find that irritating. Well, not exactly. Yes, random mutations and accidents do happen in this world. And yes, there is no question, as seen in many studies, that some random mutations can be ""pertinent"", if by that you mean 'non-trivial' where the 'life-style' of the expressed organism is concerned. In fact, often such mutations are downright lethal, and are very often, even usually, crippling. In that sense there is no denying that randomly arriving genetic mutations are ""pertinent"". But as to whether or not such stochastic accidents are in any way, ever positive [adaptively speaking] for the organism that expresses them;[ ie., experiences a trait change mechanically brought into existence by said genetic accident that coincidentally matches current and immediate needs and wants wrt survival, etc.], ""might do"" is as far as I am willing to go, since arguing what is opr is not possible in this world won't get us anywhere. However, that does not give you the right to change my ""might do"" to ""actually do"". There is a great difference between allowing possibility and affirming actuality. We can draw any inference we like from our observations, so long as they are plausible and ration. That's exactly how every hypothesis, including scientific hypotheses, begins. But in science, as in philosophy, an hypothesis is only a beginning. The hard part is proving that what you have inferred from observations to be the cause for a certain kind of event, is in fact the actual cause of that kind of observed effect, as a general rule and guiding principle. Which means, for L&D, etc., observations of survival patterns in large populations of related microbes in a given experiment is sufficiently plausible and rational to infer that that they were caused by some random agency, because, statistically speaking, the result patterns resemble what one would expect to see if one pre-supposed a non-mechanical, disordered, unguided and haphazardly acting causal factor of some kind, and you have already ruled out any kind of telic agency intrinsic to the organism itself having any influence in the causation of those random-looking result patterns. First of all, you are still thinking in the old, 'bacteria are single -celled organisms that end up clumping together in a certain spot as they increase their population totals'. As if each bacterium were a separate and distinct individual organism, and so to deal with such lifeforms, you must consider them, 'one at a time'. We now know that bacteria are in fact eusocial 'super-organisms', and that they must be dealt with 'one sizable colony/population at a time'. Thus, what is rare in single cells, is common, even the rule, in the eusocial 'superorganism'; a collectively self-serving intelligent entity. Whoa! I said 'might', meaning, 'possibly could';--- but in no way do I grant that they 'actually do', or ever 'have done', anything that is or was positively pertinent in terms of of expressed novel traits. I'm only saying that that is not impossible. I don't know if you are using 'pertinent' as a synonym for 'positive'; I know that I don't. It would seem to me that where where 'pertinent' applies to to a loss of 'adaptability/survivability', i.e., 'negative' outcomes, random genetic accidents have shown themselves to be a common cause. To say that because it has been observed that a fairly ubiquitous causal event [random genetic mutation] commonly results in very negative outcomes for the inheriting offspring, it follows that at least some times it must and actually does result in very positive outcomes as well. That's illogical. Perhaps it may, but there is no natural law compelling such positive outcomes out of randomly acting agents. 'Maybe, might, could do', is the very best that logic will allow. But darn, my spare time is used up again. Will get back to you as soon as I can.","intelligent-designs-black-box","05:52 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","162"

Right now I think the best candidate is the 'Might do' issue - but if you disagree, you can finish your previous response and we can work forward from there. Let's not forget, there's no requirement for a genetic change to match current and immediate needs or wants. It can be pertinent to a later environmental change. (NB: Since you ask, I'm using 'pertinent' for two reasons. Firstly, because you used it. Secondly, as we've established, I can't use 'adaptive' or any term that even whiffs of goal-oriented behaviour, so a mutation being 'pertinent' to self-replication is about the best I can come up with. If I could use 'positive', that would be a great help ) But let's consider this 'might do' you're limiting yourself to at the moment. The exact same kinds of mutation (insertion, deletion, frameshift, mis-sense etc) that negatively affect biological operation and replication - which you would I'm sure happily attribute to random external causes - also lie behind contextually (current environment) or eventually (later environment) positive changes to biological operation. A change to one base-pair that ultimately renders an organism non-viable is no different, in terms of the chemical changes involved, to the same change to an identical base-pair elsewhere in the genome that has a contextually or eventually positive effect. In other words, there's no reason whatsoever to treat contextually/eventually positive mutations as 'special'. Their effects may be wildly different, but in terms of what is changing and how at the molecular level they are indistinguishable. Since you've already accepted that random mutations do happen, and it is an empirical fact that there is no distinction between the 'kinds' of mutations that prove positive and those that prove negative, you have already effectively conceded that RM does encompass positive as well as negative change. But there is further confirmation: observations under elevated levels of environmental mutagens. What we see is a linear increase in the rate of all mutations, something that would not occur if contextually/eventually positive mutations were 'special'. It is not necessary to 'rule out' any kind of telic agency, because it is not and has never been an either/or scenario. Both RM and telic processes could in principle be in play. Based on our factual knowledge, RM's contribution to positive change is inevitable. The question therefore isn't 'Is RM or some telic process at work?', but 'Is something other than RM at work as well ?' All organisms are eusocial. All of them influence their neighbours in some fashion, and all form collectives (willingly, knowingly or otherwise) whose emergent behaviour is something beyond the sum of the parts. The swarming phase of locusts, for instance, emerges spontaneously through purely individualistic activity at a critical population density. The fact remains: mutations occur to individual organisms, in this case bacteria. Moreover, in experiments the 'broth' in which colonies are cultured prior to plating is continuously agitated, effectively eliminating any possibility of structured organisation. It would be like trying to hold a committee meeting in a tornado. Plus, recall the L&D results confirming that the occurrence of mutation within individuals is not related to population size. There is no evidence that mutation is a eusocial activity - and even if we did find some in the future, it wouldn't invalidate the contribution from RM. It would be layered on top. I completely agree, right up to the semicolon. After that we're into somewhat murky semantic waters. Even so, inevitable RM is perfectly adequate, all by itself, to explain how individually rare events become the rule in large populations. If some telic process is also at work in larger, 'more intelligent' colonies, we should see it added to the effects of RM. And so far we don't. I'm aware you've never said those words, but nevertheless you have cumulatively conceded points that add up to precisely that. You agree random mutation happens. You agree the observed effects of experiments are congruent with random external influences as a cause. You have provided no evidence to suggest that positively pertinent mutations are of a different nature, at the genetic level, to those you would readily admit are randomly, exogenously induced. It all adds up. I can't force you to do the math, but I have high hopes","intelligent-designs-black-box","07:24 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","163"

I've taken on some responsibilities that are chewing up every bit of my time, or so it seems. For a while my input may be sporadic, and I apologise for that. [ That's only true if every randomly generated genetic mutation means something from the moment of inception, but is not expressed, or, is expressed but is so trivial that it makes no impact on your ""Natural; Selection"", and yet remains within the genome, archived, ready and able to suddenly, and coincidentally, express itself in a robust and meaningful way just as environmental conditions suddenly and randomly become changed in such a way that its expression is both meaningful and positive in terms of your ""Natural Selection"". Are you saying that all 'accidental information' encoded into a genome by a random mutation remains with that genotype forever? And re-expresses itself repeatedly enough that it gets expressed when positive in terms of NS, when suddenly it creates a difference that makes a difference, but either is not expressed until needed, or is always expressed,but is always trivial [neutral] until the long arm of happy environmental coincidence turns it into a very robust ""good thing""? You can use positive wherever you can empirically demonstrate tha5 a/ a genetic mutation is spontaneously, randomly generated, AND that that particular mutation lead mechanically to the expression of an organic trait that proved positive to the receiving organism in terms of its survival and well-being. If all you are saying is that there is a noticeable relationship between a random mutation at the gene level and a corresponding trait change at the organic level, then unless you can demonstrate the conditions I've outlined, then perhaps, 'robust or trivial', or 'effective or neutral', might be easier to parse than 'pertinent'. What do you think? I know that this is your claim, dating back to Fisher, Haldane, and Wright in the 1930's and forward to date. And it is this claim that I am challenging, calling upon you for empirical evidence and testing via the famous ""Scientific Method"" in order to validate it and give it the merit of being a 'theory', instead of just remaining an hypothesis for almost 80 years [whiler undeservedly called a 'theory'] All you have to do is prove this contention using the scientific method. You'll have a problem doing that, as the past has proven time and again. First, you hae to demonstrate mechanical chemical determinism between DNA molecule and expressed trait, and second you have to show how a random accident can encode meaningful information in a genome. Then you have to show how the issues I raised earlier are resolved. I bet dollars to donuts that you won't be able to do that, since nobody else ever has. You are just taking an assumption based upon idological faith, and assuming it for a fact. Not a good thing. There is, on the contrary, every reason in the world, logically and empirically, to expect a difference between that which causes a beneficial outcome and that which causes a negative outcome, or even no outcome amenable to observation'. Different causes have different effects, and different effects signify a difference in causation. What is to be learned from this is that qalthough all random genetic mutations ""look-alike"", so to speak, they make no difference, positive or negative or neutral, unless they 'code' for an enzyme which, by your reasoning, must by mechanical determinism be expressed biochemically in a specific trait change. Sadly for that hypothesis, most genes don't 'code' for anything at all, and never express anything. So why do some genes express just the right thing at just the right time and place? Because biochemistry says they could do, might do, would do, do do, because ""at the molecular level they are all the same sort of thing--a DNA molecule. There is no logic to that, as the genome-mapping work has proven. There is ""something else"" between the cup and the lip, so top speak. Somethin non-genetic, i.e., not molecular or chemical, is there in the live organism, and it rules the DNA, the DNA does not rule it. Absolutely not, as above. Not so. As we know, hypermutation is a self-defence mechanism employed organismically, epigenetically. Of course if you bang on the roof of a car more often, you'll produce more dents [negative/neutral outcomes]. But the fact of epigenetic hypermutation makes any claim that hyper-mutating bacteria or whatever artificially is the root mechanically determined efficient causer of a demonstrably positive organic trait mutation, dubious in the extreme. Besides, how often, out there in the reaL worled, do huge doses of radiation or other mutagenic materials suddenly invade the organism's immediate environment, causing so much hypermutation that what appears to be a positive trait mutation [and I'd love to see some real examples!!] was actually spontaneously generated. From what I've read, the only 'positive' resultws arising from artificial hypermutation induced by hyper-radiation have been genetic genes arising that that express traits that counter and fight against the effects of hyper-radiation itself, so what does that tell you? I know what it tells me. Just what ""factual knowledge"" would that be.? With all due respect, I've seen nothing ""factual"" that proves anything coming out of your side in over 80 years!!

I think it likely you don't have clear examples of positive change in mind, which makes it difficult for you to imagine how a mutation could be neutral in one environment and positive in another. An example might be a mutation which causes the protein produced to be more structurally stable at higher temperatures, allowing biological function to continue should a warmer environment be encountered. Until altered by further mutation or eliminated by the failure of that lineage to breed, yes. Well, we'll get to the latter part presently, but as for the former, you've already agreed spontaneous random mutations do occur. You seem to be saying that they can occur to this base pair but not that one, yet you discriminate between this and that based - not upon the physics of the changes, but upon what the effect would be if they were changed. That's not logical. We cannot suppose mutagens tiptoe around the genome avoiding doing something you think they shouldn't. I really don't mind. I don't understand why you consider this a 'challenge'. Countless genes and genomes have been sequenced, to better understand all manner of positive or harmful mutations, and the changes involved are all of a relatively small variety of kinds. All the evidence is on my side here. You're claiming positive mutations are 'special', not just in terms of their effect but in terms of the actual chemical change to the genome. Where's your evidence? Easily enough done. The 'temperature stability' mutation example I spoke of earlier is a good one; I'll track it down for you if you like. Another is the nylon-bug mutation: the altered protein (nylonase) acts as a chemical catalyst for the breakdown of certain nylon waste products. Then there's gene-splicing: if a gene were, as you prefer, merely a 'note to self' for the organism that had 'invented' an organismic response, that note would invariably be meaningless to another organism. Such is not the case. Take the mutation that produced the nylonase enzyme, for instance - if that occurred (which it undoubtedly did billions of times) before the invention of nylon, would you say it required 'meaningful information' to be encoded in the genome at the time? Clearly not; it would pertain to nothing. Yet when someone invents nylon, that exact same mutation becomes 'meaningful' - so it's suddenly off-limits to arising via random mutation? I don't think so. Information, as I've said before, is a tricky and often counter-intuitive subject, mathematically speaking. Creating a new gene does not require the creation of any additional information; it is merely new data. A meteorite hits the Pope; a meteorite hits Hitler. Different effects, equivalent causation. Find yourself a see-saw, and get two friends to sit on one side of it near the pivot. Sit on the other side of the pivot and see what happens. Now move so you're sitting on the end instead of near the middle. Different effects, equivalent causation. I could go on, and on, and on, but you get the general idea. Yes, different effects have different causes. And the 'same' genetic change to two different base pairs counts as different causes: alike in nature but different in context. Enzyme coding is deterministic. The DNA isn't the 'name' of the enzyme. It's a direct mapping of triplets to amino acids. So what? Their effect can still be deterministic in a given context, as gene splicing demonstrates. Why would hypermutation be a sensible defensive response to elevated mutation rates? It tells me you stopped reading when you found something you liked Like I said, radiation is *routinely* used to increase genome-wide mutation rates to facilitate all manner of experiments. It's not news any more. Responses to UV bombardment are.","intelligent-designs-black-box","12:46 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","165"
