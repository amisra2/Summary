Therefore he/she must do one of two things-a/ admit that a certain process, eg., biological evolution, is teleological, hence, intelligent and designed, or- To cloak his/her inability to express his premise in in its own context, eg., language based upon mechanics and chance, i.e., physical, chemical, material, words and images, he/she is then forced to introduce teleology ""through the back door"", dishonestly, by insisting or inferring that the distinction between teleological meanings and mechanical or other meanings for certain words and/or verbal images,[tropes, analogies, whatever], is obscure and blurred to the point where he/she can use teleological words to express mechanical concepts [""natural selection"", where 'selection' is purely teleological word, like 'choice', 'distinguish', or 'discern']. Even Darwin had the honesty to feel guilty over that false analogy, and thought Spencer's tautology, ""Survival of the fittest."" at least more honest.

Now, as to the language issue: Here I am reminded of Nietzsche's famous quip that it might be impossible to get rid of God without also getting rid of grammar. Let me put it a little less obtusely (perhaps very little less). Is there something dishonest about speaking of sunrises and sunsets? Or do we have to admit the truth of geocentrism if we keep using these terms? I mean, we all know that the sun doesn't really rise or set.

""Evolution"" doesn't get reified just because it gets used as the GRAMMATICAL subject of a sentence!

For while Darwin did indeed believe that evolution is an adaptive process, his entire point was to account for adaptations without invoking final causes. And the need for such an account arises from the fact that adaptations do not appear in response to the needs of the species in which they might appear. Consider the case of Guam. A venomous bird-eating tree snake was introduced there sometime around the end of World War II or shortly thereafter. The island's birds had never seen such a predator: prior to its arrival, there were no snakes on Guam. The effect was quite predictable. The snakes found easy pickings, and within a few decades there were no birds left on the island. Some had gone extinct; the others survived only because people removed them from the island altogether for conservation purposes. Now, I do not doubt for one second that these birds wanted to survive and reproduce. I have no doubt that doing so was some sort of ""purpose"" or ""goal"" of theirs, perhaps even an ""intention"" or a ""drive."" But none of that caused them to adapt to the new predator in their midst. On the other hand, it is quite easy to envision a process whereby that could have happened. If any of the birds possessed some feature that enabled them to defend themselves against the snake -- whether that feature pre-existed the snake's arrival or emerged soon after it arrived -- these birds simply would tend to survive and reproduce more effectively than their neighbors. And if that feature were heritable, they would pass it on to at least some of their offspring, who would follow in their parents' footsteps to survive and reproduce more effectively than their neighbors (perhaps even some of their siblings). And so on and so on, until you would wind up with the birds left on Guam adapted to the snake. But of course, that story is counterfactual. It's premised on one big ""if."" And as it turns out, the requisite conditions never got met. The important point to note is twofold. First, there was no final cause that compelled the birds to adapt. Second, their actual decline can be explained, and their hypothetical success could be explained, without resorting to any final causes. (And it's worth keeping in mind that real cases of successful adaptation get explained this way all the time, from the coloration of guppies in the presence or absence of predators to the pesticide resistance of insects.) What purpose is served by being hung up on the name of ""natural selection ?"" The process by which adaptations develop -- or fail to develop , incidentally -- can still be still be described ateleologically, and is in fact best described ateleologically. We could call it ""natural separation"" or even ""flurbation."" A rose by any other name. And I think that sometimes what ""appears to be"" and ""reality"" are not necessarily the same. Which is why I used the examples of sunrise and sunset. The sun appears to move across the sky, and it's hardly dishonest to say so. But that's not what's really going on. I'm sorry you feel that way. I think it's a marvelously simplified example of how mechanistic processes can lead to the numerical dominance of some entitities over others under particular conditions. Where? What is it that we can't understand here without invoking final causes? Why? I presume that you don't disagree about the sunrise/sunset issue (though I could be wrong). Why does using evolution as the subject of a sentence reify it? Truth matters to me, too, you know. And I think the truth of the matter is, adaptations can be explained without invoking final causes!

He did, perhaps, show that there are no ultimate final causes, and if he did, then quite possibly he was right, and there are no ultimate final causes. But he did nothing to prove the non-existence of proximate and temporal final causes, and if you believe, as I do, that evolution is a process by which solutions are found to proximate, temporal, problems relative to time and space, and not some ultimate, fundamental, elemental problem, then you cannot call anything adaptive that _is not_ looking for, teleologically seeking, that proximate solution to that immediate problem. Nor can you call anything that _is_ doing that, non-adaptive. And the problem with that is, that they do. Ask any infectious bacterium about antibiotic resistance. Nowhere is it claimed that any organism can adapt to any situation in which it finds its. Heck, the dodo and the dinosaur have already told us that much. But failure to solve to solve one problem or another is not proof that an intrinsic ability to solve some problems does not exist. It is certainly not proof that adaptation and evolution are matters of chance accident, lucky happenstance, a coincidental conjunction of genetic mutation and organismic need. It merely points up the reality that teleology is not magic. Some things it can fix, some things it can't.

It's not so much the reification as the anthropomorphization that botheres me, because in this instance using 'evolution' as the subject makes it out to be its own cause. Evolution is responsible for evolution. Evolution is what evolution does. And so on and so forth. That eliminates the need to find any real cause for evolution. I'm sure that it matters to all of us, or we wouldn't bother talking about ideas and reality, instead of playing video games and eating snacks.

What is not obvious is what has caused that fact. And that's what I thought was at issue here: not whether organisms are adapted to their environments, but why. What's also not obvious (to me, at any rate) is what exactly you have in mind by speaking of ""teleology."" Perhaps an example will help. Must we invoke final causes to explain why, say, a polar bear is adapted to cold environments? (Or see the bacterium example below. But I'd like to see what you have to say about the polar bears, too.) But in the case of evolution, what exactly is doing this ""looking for?"" Or maybe not what, but who ? Sorry, but no. The mere fact that a given feature would be adaptive under given conditions does not cause that feature to appear. Sometimes, the bacteria all die. Which is quite fortunate for us when we take antibiotics! If, however, a genetic feature that allows a bacterium to resist antibiotics already exists or comes into existence, while its neighbors lack this feature, then that bacterium will leave more offspring in the next generation than its neighbors (other things being equal, of course). As will its offspring, relative to their neighbors. And so on and so on. I would say that, to construe antibiotic resistance as a telos that bacteria are trying to reach, somehow then ""causing"" the bacteria to evolve said antibiotic resistance, is to get things precisely backwards . Antibiotic resistance is a real effect , not an ideal cause. But conversely, successfully adapting does not show that teleology obtains, either. The above account can explain why bacteria develop antibiotic resistance when they do, and why they don't when they don't. It even explains why, in those cases where bacteria develop antibiotic resistance, there is usually a much higher kill rate at the beginning, after which the resistant strains build up their numbers. (The situation is essentially the same for pesticide resistance in insects.) What exactly does this account miss that only teleology can explain? And how does teleology explain it? You realize, though, that natural selection is not ""chance."" Right? ""Not teleological"" is not equivalent to ""chance."" But even granting your point for the sake of argument: Is there a principled distinction to be made between what teleology can fix and what it can't? If not, then what distinguishes teleological causation from lucky chance after all? In practice, how could we tell the difference? Okay, firstly-- now who's hypostasizing an abstraction! ""Survival"" is not a ""thing."" It doesn't do anything. I find it rather bizarre that, after all this criticism about evolutionists reifying ""evolution,"" you would do the same with ""survival."" But frankly, turning abstractions into things strikes me as a necessary component of teleology. Secondly, ""survival"" is entirely too general to explain anything specific . In the case of the vanished birds of Guam, what particular effects did ""survival"" have on them? If all that a teleological explanation can say is something like ""The organism's goal of survival led it to try to survive,"" I just don't find that terribly informative. Thirdly and finally, insofar as the birds did not survive, how did survival "" cause "" anything?!? Your medical student example doesn't help here. Having the goal isn't the cause of your would-be doctor's failure! And even if he were to succeed, having the goal wouldn't be the cause of his success. To sum up: I just don't see how final causes are causes. Indeed! And personally, I find ""final causes"" to be the most seductive of all such rationalizations; their seductiveness probably explains their vast historical success. Not so! In using the term ""selection,"" Darwin was making a useful analogy. As with all analogies, there is no claim of perfect resemblance. The obvious disanalogy is that when human breeders select, they do so consciously and intelligently, whereas the effects of natural ""selection"" are not conscious or intelligent. But a profound similarity is found in both cases: based on some feature or features of their own, some entities are systematically removed from the larger set of entitities to which they belong. So why not call it ""selection?""","intelligent-designs-black-box","08:33 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","845"

Now it has come to a question of whether organisms evolve by design or by genetic accident. Is teleology involved or is it a case of, "" things change, willy-nilly, and what you see today is just what was lucky enough to change in a way that suited the fickle finger of blind, random, environmental fluctuations"". To me there is no way that you can claim that anything 'adapted' to anything without speaking teleologically, or poetically. Poetically, as in, the water adapted to the drop in temperature by freezing, or the branch adapted to the rise in temperature by catching fire. The online dictionaries all say something like-- Adapt # (a.) Fitted; suited. # (v. t.) To make suitable; to fit, or suit; to adjust; to alter so as to fit for a new use; -- sometimes followed by to or for. Therefore the original [and only true and legitimate] meaning for 'fitness for' something, is also teleological. To be 'fit for' is always to 'be suitable for'. I do not see how the words 'adapted' and 'fitted' can be separated from each other wrt the words 'environment' and 'evolution'. Thus both ""Survival of the Fittest"" and ""Natural Selection"" imply a value judgement made by something or other, real or imaginary, and that makes such expressions intrinsically teleological and clearly opposite any inference of chance or mechanics. Well, to me teleology is a part of the concept of 'causation' in philosophy. That is, it sometimes plays a part in explaining what caused a certain effect, or outcome. Thus, to me, teleology is part of an Aristotelian tradition of causation, that is his 'final cause'. Anything that suggests that a 'change action' was started with a view, be it vague or clearly defined, to a desired end, is teleological. Anything that makes a value judgement on the lines of 'good, better, best', etc., wrt to itself and the world around it, is teleological. Thus anything capable of recognising itself as a 'self', an individual being distinguishable from the rest of the universe, is teleological. The concepts of 'mind', 'intelligence'. awareness'. 'volition', 'free will', 'choice', 'judgement', 'selection', 'fitness', 'suitability', 'purpose', 'use', 'intention', 'goal', 'objective', 'motive' and a thousand others are plainly teleological. To put in its simplest terms, teleology is present where a mental activity assesses a present state of affairs, makes a conscious or unconscious judgement wrt its impact on the being experiencing the mental activity, and this judgement has an effect on what that 'judge' does, and what the result of that action will be. Many people, especially of late, have ridiculed teleology as being a philosophy which insists that everything that exists, got to be where it is and how it is through the conscious efforts of some wilful external agent or agency, usually referred to as a god. [but sometimes 'evolution', That is not my belief. I am not here to deny the presence of random chance as an intrinsic part of reality. I believe that accidents do happen. Nor I am I here to deny mechanics. Observation shows us that there is law and order in this universe, because certain causes can be depended upon to lead to certain ends, time after time. I am here simply to say that where living organisms are concerned, what they do in their own lives, and over the 'lifespans' of their 'lifeforms', is not a simple matter of chemical iterations nor inexplicable failures of molecular iterations, but that there is 'something else' in 'life' itself which exercises power over the mechanics/operations/behaviours of sentient, self-aware, mentally-endowed beings, a power exercised right down to the molecular level. An intrinsic teleological power. The power to _act_ upon the world, and just to be a passive 'thing' that it acts upon. I say that you have to invoke a final cause anytime you claim that something is 'adapted' to anything. To 'adapt' yourself, or anything else, to something else, is always a teleological act. A senseless thing can 'conform' to the laws of physics and chemistry, but it can never 'adapt' to them. 'Adaptation' always connotes awareness and intention. Conformance and compliance do not. I believe that insentient matter complies and conforms entirely, passively, in reaction to whatever external forces act upon it. I believe that sentient lifeforms, i.e., living organisms, internally affect and direct what happens to the insentient matter within themselves, just as they act upon the insentient matter external to them, though by no means in the same way or to the same extent. Polar bears are white [sort of], and their ice flow environment is whitish as well. Therefore we may suppose that polar bear fur colour is another instance of natural camouflage, a phenomenon widespread throughout the natural world. Camouflage, in and of itself, [along with 'mimicry'] is an extremely interesting and mysterious phenomenon. Great topic. But for our purposes, the polar bear, once a grizzly bear kind of bear, somehow sensed that it caught more seals on ice flows when the seal couldn't see them, and, unconsciously picking up on the fact that the ice and snow around it were white, succeeded, teleologically, in making its offspring successively less brown and more white. How subconscious awareness of surroundings cause organisms to change themselves to suit, either intantly or over a generation or so, is quite a mystery. But claiming that all the brown bears died, and only mutant white bears survived, is, to me, a children's story. I do not know. For lack of a better word, I could say 'the psyche'. Whatever ""it"" is, it is intrinsic to ""life"". Now, I have heard some people say that there is no such thing as 'life'. That is only 'matter', acting mechanically. I do not like to argue with people who deny the obvious--that is, a live thing does things that a dead thing cannot, even though all of the 'matter' is still there. So that therefore there is a true and real difference between an organism that possesses something called 'life', and another one that does not. Well. enough for now. I'll get back to this in a while. Later.","intelligent-designs-black-box","07:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","1326"

To me there is no way that you can claim that anything 'adapted' to anything without speaking teleologically, or poetically. Poetically, as in, the water adapted to the drop in temperature by freezing, or the branch adapted to the rise in temperature by catching fire. The online dictionaries all say something like-- Adapt # (a.) Fitted; suited. # (v. t.) To make suitable; to fit, or suit; to adjust; to alter so as to fit for a new use; -- sometimes followed by to or for. Therefore the original [and only true and legitimate] meaning for 'fitness for' something, is also teleological. To be 'fit for' is always to 'be suitable for'. I do not see how the words 'adapted' and 'fitted' can be separated from each other wrt the words 'environment' and 'evolution'. Thus both ""Survival of the Fittest"" and ""Natural Selection"" imply a value judgement made by something or other, real or imaginary, and that makes such expressions intrinsically teleological and clearly opposite any inference of chance or mechanics. Well, to me teleology is a part of the concept of 'causation' in philosophy. That is, it sometimes plays a part in explaining what caused a certain effect, or outcome. Thus, to me, teleology is part of an Aristotelian tradition of causation, that is his 'final cause'. Anything that suggests that a 'change action' was started with a view, be it vague or clearly defined, to a desired end, is teleological. Anything that makes a value judgement on the lines of 'good, better, best', etc., wrt to itself and the world around it, is teleological. Thus anything capable of recognising itself as a 'self', an individual being distinguishable from the rest of the universe, is teleological. The concepts of 'mind', 'intelligence'. awareness'. 'volition', 'free will', 'choice', 'judgement', 'selection', 'fitness', 'suitability', 'purpose', 'use', 'intention', 'goal', 'objective', 'motive' and a thousand others are plainly teleological. To put in its simplest terms, teleology is present where a mental activity assesses a present state of affairs, makes a conscious or unconscious judgement wrt its impact on the being experiencing the mental activity, and this judgement has an effect on what that 'judge' does, and what the result of that action will be. Many people, especially of late, have ridiculed teleology as being a philosophy which insists that everything that exists, got to be where it is and how it is through the conscious efforts of some wilful external agent or agency, usually referred to as a god. [but sometimes 'evolution', That is not my belief. I am not here to deny the presence of random chance as an intrinsic part of reality. I believe that accidents do happen. Nor I am I here to deny mechanics. Observation shows us that there is law and order in this universe, because certain causes can be depended upon to lead to certain ends, time after time. I am here simply to say that where living organisms are concerned, what they do in their own lives, and over the 'lifespans' of their 'lifeforms', is not a simple matter of chemical iterations nor inexplicable failures of molecular iterations, but that there is 'something else' in 'life' itself which exercises power over the mechanics/operations/behaviours of sentient, self-aware, mentally-endowed beings, a power exercised right down to the molecular level. An intrinsic teleological power. The power to _act_ upon the world, and just to be a passive 'thing' that it acts upon. I say that you have to invoke a final cause anytime you claim that something is 'adapted' to anything. To 'adapt' yourself, or anything else, to something else, is always a teleological act. A senseless thing can 'conform' to the laws of physics and chemistry, but it can never 'adapt' to them. 'Adaptation' always connotes awareness and intention. Conformance and compliance do not. I believe that insentient matter complies and conforms entirely, passively, in reaction to whatever external forces act upon it. I believe that sentient lifeforms, i.e., living organisms, internally affect and direct what happens to the insentient matter within themselves, just as they act upon the insentient matter external to them, though by no means in the same way or to the same extent. Polar bears are white [sort of], and their ice flow environment is whitish as well. Therefore we may suppose that polar bear fur colour is another instance of natural camouflage, a phenomenon widespread throughout the natural world. Camouflage, in and of itself, [along with 'mimicry'] is an extremely interesting and mysterious phenomenon. Great topic. But for our purposes, the polar bear, once a grizzly bear kind of bear, somehow sensed that it caught more seals on ice flows when the seal couldn't see them, and, unconsciously picking up on the fact that the ice and snow around it were white, succeeded, teleologically, in making its offspring successively less brown and more white . How subconscious awareness of surroundings cause organisms to change themselves to suit, either intantly or over a generation or so, is quite a mystery. But claiming that all the brown bears died, and only mutant white bears survived, is, to me, a children's story. [boldface added] For lack of a better word, I could say 'the psyche'. Whatever ""it"" is, it is intrinsic to ""life"". Now, I have heard some people say that there is no such thing as 'life'. That is only 'matter', acting mechanically. I do not like to argue with people who deny the obvious--that is, a live thing does things that a dead thing cannot, even though all of the 'matter' is still there. So that therefore there is a true and real difference between an organism that possesses something called 'life', and another one that does not. Well. enough for now. I'll get back to this in a while. Later.","Matthew","342668","There are three problems with putting things this way. First, the alternative to teleology that you provide should not be ""genetic accident."" It should be ""genetic variation , and natural selection."" I realize that you don't like the term ""natural selection."" But however we name it, the process by which some organisms survive and reproduce more effectively than others works just the same. If you leave it out, you're leaving out the greater part of how the evolutionary process is conceived to work without teleology. Second, that greater part is not remotely as ""chancey"" a process as you make it out to be. Genetic variation is, in some sense, random: we cannot always predict when or how it will occur. But under at least some circumstances, even mutations can be predicted (e.g. irradiation), and in sexually reproducing organisms, recombination leads predictably to variation. In any event, variation need not be a matter of chance for evolution to occur. What's even more important is that the process by which these variations lead to differential survival and reproduction (natural selection) is anything but random. More on this in a bit. Thirdly and finally, this may well be a false dichotomy. It is quite possible that, what looks undirected and contingent from the perspective of natural science may be teleological or even necessary from a philosophical or theological perspective. Possible, but not necessary -- meaning that if one's philosophical or theological metaphysic leads one to presume direction for the process, the natural process is compatible with that, but there is no necessity to that presumption: if one's philosophical or theological metaphysic leads one in the opposite direction, the natural process is compatible with that, too. In either case, the natural process is the same, and it does not indicate whether there is anything teleological going on or not. And with all due respect, water freezing and wood burning are not examples of ""adaptation,"" in the biological sense of the term . See below. Do any of those online dictionaries provide multiple definitions for the term? Are any of those definitions introduced with something along the lines of "" Biol. ""? Because that's the case with my hardcover volume. It gives a biological definition, which mirrors that found in the biology textbook I bought a few months ago (when I decided I needed to know more about this stuff (Raven's 8th ed., if you're interested in the specifics)). Biologists have had to be more precise than just saying that an organism is ""suitable"" for its environment, or that it ""fits"" there somehow. The definition in my textbook glossary is that an ""adaptation"" is a feature that enables an organism to survive and reproduce in its environment. An organism is ""adapted"" to its environment to the extent that it has such features. There is nothing teleological or evaluative here. Whether or not organisms survive and reproduce is empirically observable. Whether or not any particular feature is an adaptation can certainly be disputed, and biologists engage in such investigation all the time. The role that the feature plays in enabling survival and reproduction needs to be examined. But again, it can be examined empirically. I grant you, the process by which organisms become ""adapted,"" by which they gain ""adaptations,"" may well be teleological. Or it may not be. And my view is that the non-teleological explanation of genetic variation plus natural selection is sufficient to explain this process. Perhaps why will become clearer as we go. In any event, I think you are far too hung up on definitions. Which brings me to the following: The brackets are there in your original. And if I may offer an aside on the philosophy of language, I think that it indicates some root level problems. You see, I don't think there's any such thing as a "" true meaning."" Meanings are matters of convention. Moreover, I certainly don't think that there's any link between ""legitimacy"" of meaning and ""original"" meaning. Terms take on new meanings all the time -- because the conventions that govern their usage change. This isn't a ""Humpty Dumpty"" problem, whereby any term mean can be used however one wants it to be used. No individual has control over linguistic meanings. But neither is language use as constrained as this ""original [and only true and legitimate] meaning"" idea indicates. That's simply a bad model of language, because it pays insufficient attention to how language actually works. I think you need to pay more attention to how biologists are using their terms, and stop saying that they're using their terms ""incorrectly."" If you don't want to use terms the way they do, that's certainly an option. But then you shouldn't pretend that you're talking about what they're talking about. And you shouldn't pretend that what you are criticizing is the biological theory of evolution. End of aside, back to substance: And I do, as do biologists. The term can be defined -- the notion of ""fit"" can be re fined -- in terms of survival and reproduction. Polar bears are adapted to the Arctic. What does that mean? That they can survive and reproduce there. Again, not so. What value judgment is implied by the fact that, under a given set of conditions, organisms with some features survive and reproduce in greater numbers than those with other features? What is teleological about that? Yes, I'm quite familiar with Aristotle. The problem is, his tradition of causation did things like impute purposes to stones in order to explain why they fall, or to flames to explain why they rise. I have no doubt that purposes can be used to explain the significance of the behaviors of certain organisms, whether a leopard crouching in tall grass or a quarterback throwing a pass. I also have no doubt that various phenomena can be understood in terms of the purposeful behavior to which they will be put, whether a leopard's sharp teeth or a quarterback's shoulder-pads. Whether such explanations reveal causes of behavior is an open question. But whether ""explanation"" or ""cause,"" just because purposes may explain or cause some phenomena, it does not follow that they must explain jor cause all phenomena. Behaviors? Well, okay, up to a point (alhtough there is certainly a great deal of mechanism involved in behavior). But evolution? No. Because evolution is not a behavior. But genetic variations don't happen this way! They happen whether any end would be served or not. And natural selection isn't teleological either. Those whose variations, whatever their source, enable them to survive and reproduce in greater numbers than their neighbors simply will have more descendents in the long run than will their neighbors (if conditions remain stable, of course). The individual organism are, I grant you, trying to survive and reproduce. They are not, however, trying to evolve. This is an effect of their behavior, not a goal. But genetic variation gives no indication whatsoever of involving ""mental activity!"" Nor does natural selection. It's all quite mechanical. If you think otherwise, then you need to demonstrate that organisms -- or something... -- are engaged in the mental activity in question. Til then, why should we admit it? Maybe it's not. But go back and look at the list of characteristics you just gave. You summed them up under the heading of ""mental activity,"" making ""conscious or unconscious judgments."" And before long, you'll be speaking of ""the psyche."" The only difference I see here is, rather than making this mental agent external, you're making it immanent. But whether external or immanent, it's a metaphysical thesis that has absolutely no bearing on the empirical biology. (And ironically, as a theist myself, I have no problem invoking God! I just don't think God should be invoked when we are trying to understand a process scientifically . Science is neutral on the metaphysical issue of theism.) Fair enough. But who is denying that organisms can act in the world, rather than just being acted upon? All that I'm saying is that organisms don't control their own evolution. What I mean will become clearer when we get to the bears. And I say you don't. As used by biologists, it merely implies the capacity for survival and reproduction. But see, here's the thing. Individual organisms don't ""adapt themselves."" They are adapted, or they're not, meaning that they survive and reproduce, or they don't. Over time, a species can become adapted, via a process that no member of that species controls. Who would deny that? It's just ""homeostasis."" And I'm sorry, but this is not how reproduction and inheritance work. A bear has no control over which of its genes make it into which of its individual sex cells, or which of its sex cells will unite with that of its mate, and still less which of its mates' sex cells will be the one that its own sex cell unites with. Nor does any other organism. When you're dealing with inheritance, the patterns are exactly what one would expect if the process were not directed by the organisms doing the reproducing. If you think otherwise, then the burden of proof is yours to show that there is any such causal link between the organism's ""subconscious awareness of surroundings"" and its changes over time. Personally, I think that's a recipe for getting precisely nowhere, because figuring out what a non-human organism's conscious awareness of anything is like, is a hard enough problems; when you start invoking sub-conscious awareness, it seems even tougher. The whole thing remains at the level of mystery. But if you think you can establish this sort of causal link -- or that someone else could -- then go ahead. Make me a believer. Meanwhile, the ""children's story"" quip is just empty bluster. Initially, brown bears probably weren't at much disadvantage at all. As seals became more used to the predator in their midst, however, lighter fur could've become advanatageous. This need not imply that all the brown bears never survived, just that they survived less often, and left fewer descendents. If you want to see an even better example of how the process works, check out The Beak of the Finch , by Jonathan Weiner, on the work of Peter and Rosemary Grant. Hardly a children's story. Whatever ""it"" is, you need to find many better words before I'm even convinced that it exists, let alone that it plays a role in evolution. Yes, but is the difference the possession of some thing or property called ""life?"" Or is it a difference in the organization of the matter in question? Ditto. Please no response on this one til I respond to the second.","intelligent-designs-black-box","12:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","2081"

Besides, what you call ""NS"" is just what happens after actual evolutionary alteration has taken place. All ""NS"" does is change the numbers. Any evolutionary force can create a change in an organism that will change the numbers of that organism and its genes. The issue is--is the force that changes the organism and its genes so that evolution continues strictly a matter of genetic chance, or is some organismic teleology involved. The population fluctuations that follow are merely an after-thought, mostly of interest to those who study ecology and the evolution of ecosystems, not the internal evolution of specific lifeforms. Irradiation is usually telic, not accidental, but where it is accidental, it is random, and predicting that an accident will cause damage to that which is involved is no great scientific feat. We are supposed to be discussing 'accidents' that not only do not damage anything, but actually make things much better. I've seen natural mechanisms produce serendipitously beneficial results, but I've never seen a random accidental one-off event that ever did that. Variation in and of itself is not evolution. Only an increase in variation is evolution. Well, I may not have followed your reasoning, but in case of 'science', I do not start , a priori, from a metaphysical premise and then look for 'facts' that I can mould to suit my expectations. Where I see evolution taking place today, and I do see it, there is always first a shift in environment, and then a fairly rapid change in physiology and behaviour to suit the novel environment.

I consider the ""random genetic mutation"" causal force driving evolution to be one of the more recent ""Just So"" stories. Well, you're not alone in your belief. over the past 80+ years almost the entire educated population on the planet has been converted to the faith. Alas, I lost my faith in the ""random genetic mutation"" fable several years ago. That is exactly what a ""true"" meaning is--one that conforms to convention, so that when two or people use it, they all give it the same agreed-upon meaning. If someone comes along and says to me, ""Well, unlike you ordinary folks, when me and my friends use this word, it no longer means what you think it means, it means what we say it means."", that's dishonest, and it ticks me off. Re-read what I just said. I did not say what you are saying I said. Sure. By common consent. Not by self-serving diktat. Unfortunately in the 150 years since ""Origins"", so many words have been distorted and misused for so long by people in a position to push their own agenda, that ordinary people have unconsciously accepted the junk that they were so carefully taught. That's why you'll often find corrupt usages of words from the glossary of evolution now accepted, in many dictionaries/glossaries, especially those written for the subject, as if they were legitimate. It's sort of a variation on the theme of, ""Tell an outrageous lie often enough, it becomes some, even most, people's truth."" Goebbels[sp?] did that in Nazi Germany. I don't believe that I put it the way you think I put it, but if I did, I meant the way I put it earlier, above. I think the word I used was ""illegitimately"". Illegitimate because they want evolution to back-up their a priori metaphysical assumption that the universe is materialist, mechanical, and ateleological. It is illegitimate to use teleological words and expressions in an attempt to prove that evolution is not teleological. If you are arguing for a mechanical reality, with no teleology, then leave out the teleological language and stick to words that do not imply awareness and intent, intelligence and willpower.

You keep leaving this part out, which is the only reason you can characterize this is a contrast between chance or teleology. See? There you go again. You ignore half the story, by leaving out any mention of how natural selection works. More than half actually, since ""genetic mutation"" is merely a subset of genetic variation, and since genetic variation need not be ""random"" in order for natural selection to occur. But why quibble? If you're going to leave out any consideration of how natural selection works anyway, the game is lost before it starts. Give me a break. If that's so, then all use of technical language -- a phenomenon in which we philosophers have been known to indulge from time to time -- would be ""dishonest."" Plato, for example, would never have been to use ""eidos"" or ""morphe"" as terms in his own metaphysics. And the conventions of use don't necessarily pre-exist the terms, which is how neologism happens. (How much of our philosophical vocabulary can be traced to the terminological inventiveness of Aristotle? Among others, of course.) Somebody proposes a novel term, or a novel use of a term. Other people see the point and use it that way too, or they don't and they don't. There's nothing insidious about the process. It's just a part of how languages change over time. But you yourself simply refuse to discuss the matter if its not in terms of teleological ordinary language. As soon as someone wants to deal with the problem in terms of molecular biology and population genetics, you (erroneously) declare that has nothing to do with organismic evolution and won't discuss it. Insofar as you refuse to talk about how genes work, either at the molecular level or in populations, then you are not talking about biological evolution. I realize that you think you are, but you're not. Again you leave out the important part. Again! ""Ignoring it"" hardly indicates that you're correct to think that paradigm ""vacuous."" All it proves is that you have no interest in even trying to understand it. First, I did not say that Aristotle, or anyone else, imputed ""volition"" to stones and flames. Just ""purposes."" Presumably you think hammers and teeth have purposes without volition, so this does not strike me as controversial. Second, you did not initially say ""Aristotle."" You said ""an Aristotelian tradition ."" I therefore assumed that you were including various Aristotelian thinkers other than Aristotle himself -- including, rather pertinently, medieval theologians who explained all natural phenomena with reference to God's purposes. (Not, of course, to those purposes alone, but they were conceived to be a necessary portion of the explanations of natural phenomena.) But third, as to Aristotle himself anyway, I guess I had in mind the opening of Physics IV.8 (214b14): ""If each of the simple bodies has a natural locomotion, e.g. fire upward and earth downward and towards the middle of the universe...."" Now, while it might be thought that I am construing the ""naturalness"" of said locomotion in too teleological and purposive terms, there are more than ample reasons for thinking not. See for example Physics II.8 (198b10): ""We must explain then first why nature belongs to the class of causes which act for the sake of something...."" Or see the discussion of weather that follows, the point of which is made by 199a1-8 or so: ""We do not ascribe to chance or mere coincicence the frequency of rain in winter, but frequent rain in summer we do; nor heat in summer but only if we have it in winter. If then, it is agreed that things are either the result of coincidence or for the sake of something, and these cannot be the result of coincidence or spontaneity, it follows that they must be for the sake of something; and that such things are all due to nature even the champions of the theory which is before us [viz., a rejection of teleology] would agree. Therefore action for an end is present in things which come to be and are by nature."" As to the specifics, I doubt very strongly that Aristotle imputes volition or any other mental activity to the weather. Nonetheless, he finds meteorological (or perhaps climatological) phenomena to have final causes. For as to the general point, he finds everything in nature to have final causes. All the monotheists (Judaic, Christian, and Islamic) in his ""tradition of causation"" had to do was attribute the purposes of inanimate natural objects to the mind of God. (Or was that ""the psyche?""... ) So I hardly think my comment was much of a stretch. Further discussion of the point would be off-topic here, though we could take it to the philosophy section if you like. But somehow I doubt we're going to find too much to disagree about concerning whether Aristotle thought there was purpose in nature.","intelligent-designs-black-box","07:34 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","1027"

All it proves is that you have no interest in even trying to understand it. Second, you did not initially say ""Aristotle."" You said ""an Aristotelian tradition ."" I therefore assumed that you were including various Aristotelian thinkers other than Aristotle himself -- including, rather pertinently, medieval theologians who explained all natural phenomena with reference to God's purposes. (Not, of course, to those purposes alone, but they were conceived to be a necessary portion of the explanations of natural phenomena.) But third, as to Aristotle himself anyway, I guess I had in mind the opening of Physics IV.8 (214b14): ""If each of the simple bodies has a natural locomotion, e.g. fire upward and earth downward and towards the middle of the universe...."" Now, while it might be thought that I am construing the ""naturalness"" of said locomotion in too teleological and purposive terms, there are more than ample reasons for thinking not. See for example Physics II.8 (198b10): ""We must explain then first why nature belongs to the class of causes which act for the sake of something...."" Or see the discussion of weather that follows, the point of which is made by 199a1-8 or so: ""We do not ascribe to chance or mere coincicence the frequency of rain in winter, but frequent rain in summer we do; nor heat in summer but only if we have it in winter. If then, it is agreed that things are either the result of coincidence or for the sake of something, and these cannot be the result of coincidence or spontaneity, it follows that they must be for the sake of something; and that such things are all due to nature even the champions of the theory which is before us [viz., a rejection of teleology] would agree. Therefore action for an end is present in things which come to be and are by nature."" As to the specifics, I doubt very strongly that Aristotle imputes volition or any other mental activity to the weather. Nonetheless, he finds meteorological (or perhaps climatological) phenomena to have final causes. For as to the general point, he finds everything in nature to have final causes. All the monotheists (Judaic, Christian, and Islamic) in his ""tradition of causation"" had to do was attribute the purposes of inanimate natural objects to the mind of God. (Or was that ""the psyche?""... ) Further discussion of the point would be off-topic here, though we could take it to the philosophy section if you like. But somehow I doubt we're going to find too much to disagree about concerning whether Aristotle thought there was purpose in nature.","jakers","342969","If an organisms genes and genone changes, then it is necessary to so that that organism has changed.

But as this discussion is already more than polemical enough, I will simply limit myself to a brief comment, namely: Wholes and their parts are not , in fact, logically equivalent to one another, and sometimes wholes do , in fact, change in non-tautological and non-trivial ways because their parts change. If you would like to address the matter of how organisms and their genes are related to one another in substantive terms, fantastic. But if you're just going to equivocate as it suits you, all the while accusing everybody else of disingenuous equivocations, then don't bother. Not so. Take a checkerboard, two eight-sided dice, and some marbles of a few different colors. Randomly arrange some of the marbles on the checkerboard, one to a square. Designate one die for columns and the other for rows. Roll them to identify a given square. Remove its marble. Then roll the dice again to identify another square. Replace the marble you removed with a marble of the same color as that in the second square you identified. And repeat the process for a while. What you will note as you repeat this random process is that the distribution of marble colors gradually comes to be non-random. But of the course, the analogy with natural selection is hardly perfect, since natural selection is not a random process. To wit: Nonsense. Who lives and who dies in the wake of ""random"" environmental changes is not itself a matter of chance. Seriously, read The Beak of the Finch if you have any interest in how this works. When the Grants examined which finches on one island survived a drought that caused a more than 80% reduction of their population, all had larger than average beak dimensions and larger than average bodies. No small-beaked, small-bodied birds made it. And male survivors outnumbered female survivors about five to one. Once the rains returned, the birds set about mating again. And only one fifth of the surviving males were able to mate. Which ones got to do so was again not random: those with the largest beaks and bodies. The finches' subsequent offspring had, you might guess, larger beaks and bodies. But only on average: some of the young had small beaks and small bodies. This isn't random. It's how genes get passed on from one generation to the next. It doesn't show signs of direction, either, insofar as the drought survivors did not produce offspring that were optimally suited to the now-wet environment. They produced offspring exactly as one would expect given a non-directed process. Furthermore, the smaller birds became more numerous over the course of generations in the wet period. This, too, is hardly random. Big beaks and bodies take significantly more energy to build, and smaller birds were able to devote more of their efforts toward reproduction than their larger relatives, who had to spend more time feeding. These smaller birds produced smaller offspring. Again, on average: they still left larger offspring, too, albeit larger offspring who didn't fare as well as their smaller kin. Just as the non-random but non-directed view expected. And then, drought happens again, and we're back to square one. What is my point in all of this? I will accept that variation is ""random"" in the senses (1) that we cannot make effective predictions about what mutations might happen to what birds when, or what the phenotypic effects of those mutations will be; and (2) that we cannot predict which alleles (whether mutant or established) will make it into which sex cells of any one bird, or which of its sex cells will unite with which of its mate's; and (3) that what actually comes to pass as far as these ""variation events"" are concerned does not give the appearance of being controlled by the conscious intentions of any being: not the finches, not God, not ""the psyche."" But none of the variation in the finch population is random in the sense of being uncaused, either in terms of molecular activity in their DNA or in terms of the environmental factors that affect their survival and reproductive success. Nor is it even unpredictable at the level of how the whole population will be affected. (And the Grants ended up being able to make some stunningly accurate predictions, incidentally.) Now, you can say that this is just oscillation in a population if you like, that this certainly isn't ""evolution."" But that's simply not so. All it would take is a long-term shift in environmental conditions to push them in one direction or the other (large-beaked and -bodied or small-). In the meantime, evolution doesn't stop just because conditions oscillate. It's an ongoing process that happens even when conditions are stable. And I fail to see what teleology adds to this picture, scientifically speaking. (Or even, perhaps, metaphysically.) Every time you treat evolution by natural selection as a fundamentally random process, you are leaving out natural selection itself. Because the process of natural selection is simply not random. The two words that Plato most commonly used to name the non-empirical, immutable, abstract entities at the heart of his metaphysics were eidos and morphe . Eidos meant ""image."" Morphe meant ""shape."" Now, I certainly don't deny that there are connections between these words in their ordinary Greek usage and Plato's own use of them, pertaining to image and shape as ""structure,"" say. But we shouldn't mislead ourselves into the linguistic innovation going on here, either: Plato was using empirical terms to name non -empirical entities. Similarly, there is a point of similarity between ""selection"" as used in evolutionary biology and in ordinary language. The fact that, in ordinary language, the term implies a conscious selecting agent, while in biological technical terminology it does not, should not be any more troubling than Plato's use of eidos and morphe in reference to his non-empirical Forms. (Or would you say that the very language Plato used reveals that the Forms must truly be empirical after all?...) This is thoroughly ad hominem, and false to boot. There are plenty of biologists who are not metaphysical materialists, but nonetheless accept the theory of evolution as it stands. Moreover, even if the charge were not false, it would still be completely irrelevant, as are all ad hominem invocations of motive. Supposing that this were the true motive of characterizing evolution non-teleologically, it would not render that characterization false. It may well be false. All you have to do is show that genetic variation is directed. This is called Lamarckism, which is neither conceptually incoherent nor logically impossible. But nobody has ever found any evidence for it. So the odds seem long. This charge is nothing more than a straw man. There are plenty of differences between living and non-living things, and I've never seen any biologist -- never, any -- claim or imply otherwise. But the differences appear to be differences in the way the matter that makes up living rather than non-living entities is arranged. It's not that there's some animating ""life force"" out there that organisms have and non-living matter doesn't. So instead of saying that you'd prefer to ignore the dominant theory, why don't you try to convince us that it's wrong? And I did not say you were. But since you invoked ""an Aristotelian tradition of causation,"" every component of which elaborates Aristotle's four kinds of causation, I fail to see why my reference to that tradition is a problem. If you didn't mean ""tradition,"" why'd you say it? I mean, haven't you been calling people on the carpet for linguistic imprecision left and right? And how Aristotle saw it. But you managed to omit my comment that as Aristotle saw it, things don't need to have volition to have final causes. He thought it reasonable to ascribe final causes to hammers and teeth, but he would never have ascribe volition to them. Why did you omit that part? You're doing it again! Again! Genetic variation is random, in the sense mentioned above. But the process of natural selection is not random! Why do you keep ignoring that? (Brackets yours.) ""For an end"" means final cause. Why you are conflating ""final cause"" with ""motivation,"" I don't know. But it's a big mistake. First of all, is this discussion of evolution scientific or metaphysical? I thought we were talking about biology, not ontology. Second of all... ...you cannot simply ""assume,"" as you've done in each of your last two sentences, that the things in question are ""created."" Of course created things are created for purposes. But are living things created? Seems like metaphysics, to me. And I'm basically a Kantian on metaphysical matters. As far as I see it, once we leave empiricism behind, metaphysical disagreements are fundamentally irresolvable. What we need is empirical science that cuts across these unending metaphysical differences. Unfortunately, you and other IDists seem to build a contentious metaphysical point about teleology right into the empirical science of biology. Now, I'm not so naive that I think Dawkins, for example, doesn't do the same thing from the opposite direction. But Dawkins' views of metaphysics and its connection to natural science is hardly shared by all scientists or biologists, or even by most of them. So you shouldn't treat a metaphysical dispute with materialists as a scientific dispute with biologists.","intelligent-designs-black-box","01:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","1859"

I am talking about that great mass of geneticists, molecular biologists, statisticians, et al, who have, ever since the late 20's and early 30's, have insisted upon coupling Darwin's ""Natural Selection"" imagery to the geneticist/statistician [see Wright, et al] supposition of genetically determined, rando, [spontaneous] and undirected evolution, which is most commonly referred to as ""Random Mutation plus Natural Selection"", often simply as ""RM+NS"". No, but, FYI, ""spontaneous does _not_ mean ""uncaused"" or ""without cause"". In fact, if you'll re-read Luria-Delbruck, you'll find [if memory serves?] that they referred to their 'mutations' as 'spontaneous'. In that sense 'spontaneous' simply means 'undirected', 'unintententional', 'random', etc. You are probably right. But we are stuck with the fact that it is biology, most specifically, evolution, that those of the Materialist/Mechanist/Positivist metaphysical persuasion have latched onto, via ""Random Genetic Mutation"", in order to convince the world at large that the universe is unintentional, a wierd accident, an act of spontaneous generation unintended, undirected, accidental, and ateleological, which not only 'could have', but in fact did, arise out of nothingness and nowhere thanks to nothing else at all giving it the least aid and support. They do this because they [rightly] fear primitive religious passions and the violence and horrors that they generate. But their motives, albeit honourable, are not scientific, but ideological, and all that they have done is deflect scientific attention away from the way evolution, and universes, operate. I did not say it was ""entailed"" by genetic determinism. Isaid that genetic determinism is part and parcel of an over-view that that the entire universe, and every event in it, are mechanically pre-determined. And the fact is, that unless you insist upon genetic determinism in evolution, not only does your ""evolution via RM+NS' hypothesis fall apart [because that would admit of something non-genetic, non-molecular, non-corporeal intervening between gene and expressed trait], the entire notion of a spontaneously self-generated universe would also crumble. And that way, materialists believe, [with unfortunately, some reason] back to horrible days of religious fundamentalism, and people dying [a la Palestine] for the sake of a children's story. The brand of ""Intelligent Design"" associated with fundamentalist right-wing politics in the USA and Canada does that, it is true. Mine does not. However, the ""RM+NS"" hypothesis is equally guilty of confusing speculative metaphysics with empirical science. Of course there is a lot more in play here than typoes and misunderstandings. But never pretend to yourself that what goes on in evolution debates is all about 'science', on either side. Only scientists bother to debate pure science. Whether you like it or not, all public debates wrt to life and evolution are philosophical debates, with 'science' merely appended to attach more or less credibility to some ideological POV, and it is that POV, not the science, that is AL:WAYS the core issue in these debates, for ALL participants, even those who pretend to be mere objective empirical 'scientists'. In the end, that is what it all comes round to, when a supposedly scientific ""theory"" depends for its very life upon an assumption of strictly genetic molecular mechanical materialist determinism. You see, we have 3 choices only,unless you can find me another. Choice 1--RM+NS, a gene is changed, ergo, mechanically, a trait is changed [genetic determinism]. Choice 2--A trait's change begins with the accidental, random, spontaneous mutation of a molecule called a gene, but it is not determined by that mutation, because along the way from 'gene' to 'trait', all sorts of other accidental, spontaneous, random, undirected aberrations take place, too, so that in fact all traits are spontaneous and random, both to their genes and the expressed traits, which are only coincidentally adaptive to specified environmental demands and opportunities. Choice 3 The organism attempts, when necessary or highly advantageous, to adapt itself to environmental circumstances, and to that end operates upon itself entire, including its own genome, and records adaptive changes in its 'self' in the code of its genome. Sometimes it wins, ofttimes it loses, and in some cases, the inability to operates successfully upon itself, its physiology, behaviours, and trait functions, it dies, along with all its kind, and we have another extinction event. But sometimes it works, and we get a novel organism, a butterfly, a bat, a bobolink, or a burbot, just to name a few.","intelligent-designs-black-box","02:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","1055"

But their motives, albeit honourable, are not scientific, but ideological, and all that they have done is deflect scientific attention away from the way evolution, and universes, operate. ...unless you insist upon genetic determinism in evolution, not only does your ""evolution via RM+NS' hypothesis fall apart [because that would admit of something non-genetic, non-molecular, non-corporeal intervening between gene and expressed trait], the entire notion of a spontaneously self-generated universe would also crumble. The brand of ""Intelligent Design"" associated with fundamentalist right-wing politics in the USA and Canada does that, it is true. Mine does not. However, the ""RM+NS"" hypothesis is equally guilty of confusing speculative metaphysics with empirical science. In the end, that is what it all comes round to, when a supposedly scientific ""theory"" depends for its very life upon an assumption of strictly genetic molecular mechanical materialist determinism. The organism attempts, when necessary or highly advantageous, to adapt itself to environmental circumstances, and to that end operates upon itself entire, including its own genome, and records adaptive changes in its 'self' in the code of its genome.","Matthew","344219","Jakers, that was most certainly not my ""claim."" That is your straw man (mis)interpretation of my claim. I hate to break this to you, but there is a relationship between genetic change and phenotypic change. To say this does not commit one to the ""determinist mechanical gene-driven hypothesis"" you are so keen to attribute to me. I really don't get why you refuse to address genetics at all . Every time someone brings up ""molecular chemistry"" (?) you idignantly refuse to get a doctorate in the ""subject,"" as if that were required in order to grasp the ideas at hand, and you then proceed to dismiss them. Ditto for statistics and probability, despite that what is being discussed are the variable characteristics among the individuals that comprise populations, and the ways and likelihoods of those characteristics changing over time. It's as if nothing in molecular genetics or population genetics counts as ""science"" to you. And that's just plain sad. I think it absolutely cripples your ability to grasp how the process of natural selection, that you so vehemently criticize, even works. But of course, I did not make this attribution! Because I do not think that all gene change is random, when we're talking about gene changes in populations , subject to differential survival and reproduction -- i.e., to natural selection, a non -random process that you have, yet again, left out. Fair enough. Which is a metaphysical abuse of the theory, not anything implied by the theory itself. There are plenty of evolutionists who don't share that metaphysic at all, and even plenty of evolutionists who are materialists reject using evolution to further their metaphysical views. Nuclear physics makes weapons of mass destruction possible. If one objects to such weapons, that hardly renders the physics faulty. Ah, so you do have an IDist axe to grind! But that would be ad hominem of me. What is less ad hominem is to point out that ""RM +NS "" certainly does incorporate something other than genes into the model, namely the entire set of environmental circumstances in which organisms find themselves. Even as you mention ""NS,"" you ignore it. Meanwhile, if you think there really is something ""non-corporeal"" at work here, get set explaining it. I'm not sure that it would or even could have anything to do with ""science,"" but you're welcome to persuade me otherwise. Gaia theory, perhaps? Or what? No, some materialists (e.g. Dawkins) are. It doesn't. You have got to distinguish the metaphysical views of a few vocal materialists with the empirical science of evolutionary biology itself. Show me the evidence! Don't just claim it. Prove it! Give me the grounds that show organisms ""attempting"" to change their own genomes! Tell me how to get into the conscious or subconscious ""mind"" of a bacterium or a snail or a mosquito or a fish or a finch or a bear so I can understand what it's ""attempting."" Because ""RM+NS"" ( don't forget the ""+NS"" ) can explain how these changes happen. Why is your ""teleological"" explanation preferable?

I couldn't agree more. So when, for instance, a mutation in bacterial DNA is demonstrably both necessary and sufficient for a replication-improving trait to manifest, when the chemical activity of the novel enzyme (for instance) deterministically generated from that DNA can be traced to its effect upon organismic fitness, and the mutation demonstrably arises stochastically prior to the bacterium encountering the environment in which the mutation improves replication, it would violate Ockham's Razor to suppose the existence of some unknown teleological mechanism at work, based solely on an a priori philosophical assumption that only teleological processes can increase the replication chances of complex systems. Simpler by far to acknowledge the sufficiency of what we see before us to explain the phenomenon, and discard the erroneous philosophical assumption. Then you doubt wrongly. Both Behe and Dembski, to name only two, have accepted the validity of known evolutionary mechanisms - they just believe them to be insufficient to explain all biological features. Hence their statistical approach to inferring design. As for me having failed to demonstrate the effect of evolutionary mechanisms - in fairness we've only just reached the point of me starting to try As I said, the OP assumed a certain level of understanding, from which point we've been working steadily backwards in an attempt to find some common ground. Well, yes, that's what I just said. Which is why it would be a waste of time to discuss the OP right now. Its merits are only worth discussing if you don't believe the issue has already been settled by some other argument. Population fluctuations in absolute terms can, as you say, occur for many reasons. But fluctuations in the relative proportions of variants comprising that population are influenced by what you would call the relative 'fitness' of those variants in their environment. And those fluctuations in turn inevitably influence the relative chances of future changes stacking with the different variants already in existence. If there are a lot of variant A and only a few of variant B, the chances of a later change stacking with A is much greater than that of it stacking with B. Why is this relevant to the evolution of distinct and separate life forms? Because what separates two species that share an ancestor species are the differences in their accumulated changes. The longer two populations of a single species are reproductively isolated from one another, the more different the 'stacks' of changes in each population become - and this is true regardless of whether you believe the changes themselves are random or telic in origin. Part of that can result from genuinely different changes arising within each population, but even if the exact same changes were to arise in both populations, in the same order, the two populations can still diverge because DRR in their respective environments would influence which changes accumulated with which others. If a million men called Steve and one man called Andy enter the lottery, is it more likely a Steve or an Andy will win? Do we need to conduct that experiment for real to find out? So if a change - random or telic - empirically improves the relative statistical chance of self-replication, that mutant will inevitably come to numerically dominate the population. Agreed? So when another change occurs to an organism - again, be it random or telic - to which variant is it more likely to occur? The numerically dominant mutants, or the minority non-mutants? If you take the position that 'adaptive' implies teleology by definition, then obviously an ateleological but adaptive process is a semantic contradiction. It doesn't stop a process of ateleological self-replication improvement occurring, it just means we can't call it adaptive. Now personally , I'm comfortable with saying 'ateleological adaptation', because to me that describes something that has the same effect as adaptation, but isn't telic. Since semantics do not define objective truth, I don't see why putting those two words together should make me automatically wrong. 'Ateleological' is just a qualifier. The same goes for 'natural selection', a phrase chosen at the time for the express purpose of leading the reader from a concept they're comfortable and familiar with (livestock breeding) and showing them how the rigours of the environment result in an analogous effect , even if the actual process lacks the telic qualities implied by 'selection'. There was never any intent or desire to sneak animism in through the back door, as you seem determined to believe. As I've said all along, self-replication with variation is an utterly unique special case, the only situation in which statistically rare improvements can accumulate, and statistically common neutral or deleterious changes abate, without the interference of a telic entity. It's hardly surprising that it's difficult to find appropriate words, when the words we have were defined in ignorance of that one special case. Well, I don't know what 'many supporters' think. I know there is much, much more to evolution than mutation and differential reproductive rates. There are two reasons I focus on those elements here and now. First, their combined effectiveness is relatively straightforward to demonstrate, using asexually reproducing bacteria. Second, before I could even hope to interest you in the more complex processes entailed by sexual reproduction, I have to break down the mental block you have against the principle of ateleological processes yielding improved self-replication. I neither deny teleology per se, nor do I claim adaptation has no role in evolutionary biology. What I'm saying is that whatever effect they have it is inevitably layered atop known ateleological effects. Do you appreciate the distinction?

Even according to your own theory it should be fallacious to suppose that just because any individual or any particular population has never encountered such an environment, that they have not inherited a mechanism from their ancestors who had already, and perhaps millions of times, encountered and devised a mechanism to deal with that very problem. A mechanism that could hold a certain enzyme action in abeyance until such time as it was necessary to release it again, even if that mechanism was a genetic 'allele' or whatever. If the problem environment can be shown, or even supposed, to be one that has come and gone repeatedly over million, billions, trillions, of bacteria generations, there is no reason to suppose that any given population of same has to rely on random chance, a lucky genetic mutation, to stochastically 're-invent the wheel' for the gazillioneth time. That is, no reason to suppose such a thing unless you really, really want such a phenomenon to be purely accidental. It seems top me that I am not the one who is making erroneous a priori philosophical assumptions that 'violate' Ockham's razor. I think that is the one who assumes a regular, repeatable, predictable, but totally random, utterly stochastic, brand new, disassociated set of two [on/off] genetic mutations. I wouild say that such an appeal to such dependably iterated good luck not only would offend Ockham, but common sense as well. It smacks of superstition, to me. This word, 'stacking', although quite familiar to me, seems to used by you in a sense that to me is entirely unfamiliar. Could you outline your novel use of this word, and explain just exactly what it means in terms of DNA molecules and expressed organic traits? Is this just another way of re-stating the old Darwinian thesis tiny differences accumulate steadily over generations until one day you look around and discover that a great big difference/change occurred without Natural Selection having noticed? Or any real prompting from the environment. Just incessant 'change for change sake' owing to long periods of isolated self-replication? It is tautologous to say that a positive change in life form will lead to a positive gain in self-replication. Since all tautologies are truisms, I can hardly argue the point. However, I can argue that relative frequency, speed, efficiency, and specificity by which a change in life forms arise in relation to a novel environmental difference which makes that change 'positive', as opposed to neutral [ineffective] or negative [detrimental] can give reasonable grounds to awarding the accomplishment to some intentional agency rather than a great streak of amazing luck.

Reminds me very much, if you'll forgive my saying so, of just what Humpty Dumpty said to Alice in Lewis Carroll's satirical 'children's' book. Semantics refer to truth in word meanings, where two or more communicaters use the same terminology, what is 'true' for one must be 'true' for the other, or the word usage simply is not true at all. And, what Mr. Dumpty said notwithstanding, there is no legitimate way that one person, or select group of persons, can unilaterally and arbitrarily impose a new meaning on a word without the express consent of all others with whom they use that word in any act of communication, because when they do this, they speak falsely, deceptively, mendaciously, and do no more than corrupt meaning to serve their own purposes. Sounds like 'politics as usual' to me. This is a flagrant example of 'special pleading'. I can't remember the exact names of the logical fallacies it falls under. What special case?!? LIFE? Life was around long before language was invented. Which might be convincing if you could demonstrate it just as easily using other life forms.

Certainly organisms do possess mechanisms for dealing with common (but irregularly-encountered) environmental changes. You can recognise them because they kick in after the environment changes, not before. There are three main flaws with that argument. First of all, it wrongly presumes that the random, lucky genetic mutation stochastically 're-inventing the wheel' is somehow a defective or unreliable mechanism for generating the 'enzyme' in question on all those occasions. It's not. In a quite modestly-sized bacterial colony every multi-billion-to-one mutation will be amply represented purely through replication error. So supposing the existence of a responsive mechanism ready to generate each and every one is entirely unnecessary, on top of being implausible. Where are all these mechanisms? There isn't nearly enough genome to describe them all, even theoretically. Secondly, if a bacterial species had developed a responsive mechanism for dealing with an environmental change after being exposed to it millions of times over, we would expect it to work on an individual level a bit better than the one-in-ten-billion times or so it empirically does in the examples we're talking about - a rate that is on the other hand remarkably congruent with typical rates of genetic mutation. And of course, there's the awkward fact that mutants arise, stochastically, prior to and in the absence of the environmental changes to which they could be considered adaptive. I hardly think it appropriate to describe straightforward statistics as 'superstition' Pick a number from one to six and then roll a die. Did you guess right? Now ask twenty people to pick a number, and then roll a die. Did one of them guess right? Now enter the lottery. Did you win? Now get fifty million people to enter the lottery. Did one of them win? The math doesn't become invalid just because the numbers get bigger. I hardly think it's a novel use of the word. Plates stack, effects stack... mutations stack. And because they're stochastic, any given mutation is most likely to occur to the offspring of the most numerically prevalent variant of an organism - thus adding to their particular 'stack' of accumulated variations rather than to a different organism's 'stack'. You can certainly try . In bacteria, the argument fails because the demonstrable pre-existence of mutants represents effectively instant 'adaptation'. Is 'instant' fast enough for you? In sexually-reproducing organisms, the argument fails for somewhat more complex reasons. I really don't think it's a good idea to get into that right now. As I've said all along, I'll do my best to accomodate your needs. If that means avoiding using the word 'adaptive' in conjuncton with evolution, fine. Well, I can only apologise for causing your problems. Now, why is it I'm not seeing Humpty Dumpty, but an image of a monkey with his hands over his ears, sitting next to one with his hands over his mouth? You're correct that I cannot force you to accept a phrase such as 'ateleological adaption' as valid. But I can use it to converse with other people who share my understanding of it, and I can explain to those who don't what is meant by it, so that they might understand me in future. You are entirely free to abstain - which makes it much more difficult to talk to you but has no implications whatsoever for which of us is ultimately right. Hardly. Is it 'special pleading' to say that the result of division is uniquely undefined when the operand is zero? Or merely stating a logical truth? Evolutionary processes can be used, to find solutions that are 'better' according to pretty much any criteria. As you say, that both logically and semantically entails teleology: choosing a goal and then selection criteria to cause the system to converge upon that goal. No argument there. But in the unique instance of the 'goal' being better self-replication, any hypothetical teleological agent need only stand back and watch. In the absence of any externally-imposed criteria, a pool of stochastically variable self-replicators will inevitably converge upon better self-replicating variants, if they exist in potentia. It's not special pleading, it's just true. But the theory of evolution wasn't. Prior to that, we had no need to get our brains around the idea of an 'ateleologically adaptive' process, so we didn't need or have words for it. And if you have your way, we never will I'm not using bacteria as an exception. I'm using them because focusing on single-celled, asexually-reproducing organisms allows us to work comfortably with the large populations and rapid reproduction rates necessary to see genetic mutation, the slowest of evolutionary mechanisms, in operation. It's the simplest and clearest way to disprove the supposed universal principle that random changes cannot increase reproductive rates. That doesn't mean you developed a hand, elbow, throat and stomach in order to satisfy your desire to drink beer; it just means you've come up with something entertaining to do with the organs you already had. Have you ever played poker? That's a classic example of what we're talking about here. There's a telic layer to the game, and a random layer. The best players win statistically more often than the worst players, despite them both being dealt the same average quality of hands, in the long run. That's the telic layer. But it's also true that the best hands win statistically more often than the worst hands, despite them being dealt equally to both good and bad players. In life we may believe there's a telic layer, and that success and failure is influenced by that layer. Even if that's true, there's also a random layer to the game, and it too influences the outcome. The difference between life and poker is that in poker the crappy hands keep getting dealt out with the same frequency, forever - whereas in life the crappy genetic hands tend to lose 'market share', as it were. Unless the telic layer is deliberately acting perversely to prevent that happening, it's simply inevitable. Anyway, it's really late (again) and I need to tidy the kitchen before bed.

Actually, it is a plain statement of fact that any event, including a genetic mutation, that can be depended upon to generate a particular enzyme at a regular, predictable, rate, cannot be called defective or unreliable.

Further to that, the fact that no matter how many antibiotics, pesticides, herbicides, or other 'cides' we invent in our labs, so far every one has been overcome by the organisms it was meant to destroy shows that that is no accident. If a Vegas casino noticed that a gambler started out losing at every game of chance he or she tried, but always left the table the big winner, they would never put that fact down to random chance or luck. They'd know that that winner had a winning 'system' of some kind, even if they had no idea what it might be. The the thing is, I have not postulated ""the existence of a responsive mechanism ready to generate each and every one"" , by which I suppose you to mean that I had proposed that every genome contained sufficient inherited random mutations that they had something that would act as as a dependable mechanism to deal with every and any challenge that the organism might encounter. That is the farthest thing from my own opinion, but it does seem to be exactly what many adherents of the current genetic approach to evolution believe. It's their problem that they either have to believe that, which, as you put it politely, is implausible [I would have said, ""silly""], or they have to believe that random genetic mutations can and do happen almost immediately upon the instance of organismic need, and specific to that particular need, as well. Which is equally, uhm, implausible. I don't know what you are talking about, but I have never heard of a repitition of the Luria-Delbruck experiment, or any of its offshoots, that did not produce the exact same result. When something happens every time, that event is remarkably congruent with what I would call a mechanism. Accidents do not come even remotely close to that kind of regularity. And ponder this--if it were not a mechanical regularity developed as a defense mechanism over millions of generations, why does that experiment and others like it fail miserably when some truly original antibiotic is first used on batches of unexposed microbes for the first time? Let's see, in terms of being resisistant , bacteria score, --Luria-Delbruck, 100% success every time; brand new antibiotic, 100% failure, every time. Nothing random here. If by mutants you are referring to 'genes', i.e., DNA molecules, I imagine the rate of 'mutation' is fairly regular unless disturbed by some cause external to the genome which might cause that rate to accelerate, perhaps instantaneously, perhaps very rapidly. Whether or not in some cases, [such as irradiation], the mutant genes were in no way adaptive to any environment currently encountered by the organism, is of no matter. It is beside the point we are discussing. If by mutants you mean altered organisms which arise thanks to genetic or developmental malfunction [accident], these are generally considered to be illnesses, that is, system failures of some kind, and are hardly relevant to this discussion of adaptation, either. This is a red herring. I fail to see any genuine relation to the question of adaptation. It seems to be a faith statement that given a sufficiently large number of instances, anything, even miracles, can happen. Worse, that anything that could happen that way, must happen, eventually. This thinking is utterly irrational. Sorry, but all this statistical math is just that--math, not biology. I am not interested.

I believe that with bacteria it's called 'reverse' or 'revertant' mutation? It is not accidental, but an actual mechanism. Anything that happens with a dependable, predictable regularity, is not random. Actually, it is a plain statement of fact that any event, including a genetic mutation, that can be depended upon to generate a particular enzyme at a regular, predictable, rate, cannot be called defective or unreliable. It cannot be called 'random'.

Others are not, and the results are the same either way. As for your latter claim, that such mutations cannot be random because of their 'dependable, predictable regularity' - we're really going to have to sort that out before we can go any further. I propose we hold the parts of your response not directly related to this in abeyance until we reach agreement, at which point I'll come back and deal with them point-by-point. So, what is the real nature of this 'dependable, predictable regularity' of which you speak? It is the dependability of a die showing a six if it rolls a thousand times. It is the predictability of being dealt an ace if you play a thousand hands. It is the statistical inevitability of a low-probability event occurring, given a number of opportunities that dwarfs its improbability. Well, that's very interesting, because harmful mutations occur with exactly the same kind and degree of regularity and predictability - so they must be deliberate teleological acts too! What you call a plain statement of fact is nothing of the sort. There is a small but finite chance of any given single-step mutation occurring to any given bacterium during, for instance, cell division - a chance which can be increased via environmental mutagens, be they chemicals or UV light. In even modest colonies those tiny odds are overwhelmed by the number of opportunities for those mutations to occur, and from that arises the 'dependability' of there being at least one mutant of type 'X' already in the population when the environment changes in its favour. If the colony is very small, the outcome is far less dependable. There's nothing irrational about this, it's not a 'just so' story, you can't hand-wave it away. It's proof of nothing of the sort. The events are stochastic, while the outcome is statistically predictable because of the number of opportunities for the event to occur. This is just basic maths. The L&D experiment takes it a step further, settling the question of whether the events occur before or after the environmental change. Once again you are badly mistaken. First of all, individual bacteria aren't 'resistant' or 'not' to antibiotic chemicals. Rather they have a tolerance level: a maximum concentration in their environment with which they can coexist - and this applies to even the most novel antibiotics. Within any given population of bacteria, some will have higher tolerance levels and some will have lower, thanks to genetic variance. Antibiotics are developed by discovering chemicals to which the pre-existing range of tolerance levels is low, possibly because higher tolerance levels incur some sort of performance penalty - natural selection at work as usual. That's why it's so important for antibiotics to be administered carefully, at the right dosage and at the right time. A high enough dose will wipe out all the bacteria because none of them can tolerate that concentration of the drug. Resistant strains arise, not because the bacteria have been given time to 'figure it out', but when drugs are administered either improperly or too routinely. In the former scenario the concentration of the drug is low enough for the most naturally tolerant bacteria to survive and reproduce - and without competition from their more efficient low-tolerance bretheren, they can flourish, representing the new median level of tolerance, with further genetic variation around that point. If a high enough second dose can be applied without killing the patient, the situation can be remedied, but if care is not taken a strain can arise that is tolerant to all non-patient-lethal doses of that drug. In the latter scenario, routine administration of antibiotics, in livestock particularly, purely and simply increases the odds of the antibiotic being encountered by a very low-probability high-tolerance variant - which will then, instead of being out-competed and vanishing as it would do in the absence of the antibiotic, thrive in the wake of the devastation wrought by the drug. The reason the L&D experiment works 'every time' for the bacteria (with chemical antibiotics anyway) is that the experimenters aren't actually trying to kill all the bacteria, which they easily could do with a massive dose. Instead they run the fluctuation test at carefully chosen concentrations of antibiotic to determine the rate at which mutants emerged - stochastically and prior to exposure - capable of tolerating those levels. The original L&D experiment employed a bacteriophage as an antibiotic, to which resistance can be, IIRC, an all-or-nothing affair, in some cases mediated by the shape of a particular surface protein the phage connects to, triggering the injection of its payload. The result however was exactly the same: mutants appearing stochastically prior to exposure during colony growth. I hope that clears a few things up, so we can get back on track.","intelligent-designs-black-box","08:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","925"

There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever to suggest that when any given population of cells is completly and totally and simultaneously exposed to a novel bactericide that neither they nor their ancestors have ever had any chance to deal with, if that novel bactericide is effective, and if all cells are simultaneously exposed to it, then each and every and all cells die.

Do you have a link? You must consider two situations. We'll start with the Luria-Delbruck situation. I'll call it the developmentally inherited mechanism. Here you have a kind of bacterium, e. coli., that over millenia has evolved a mechanism for resisting attacks by the phage [?]. That mechanism is that as the colony grows and its cell numbers increase, it reaches a point where a certain percentage of new members are always formed with the 'resistance' enzyme, so that any large colony always contains a few 'pre-attack' resistant cells, while the vast majority of cells, for the sake, of collective productivity and efficiency, do not show the defensive form. That way, when the attack does come again, as it has done millions of times in their mutual history, the bacteria always has enough resistant cells to recover afterwards. This is why Luria-Delbruck is weak. It first assumes that by whittling a colony down to the point where one division is completely wiped out, that a matching but unexposed division would be wiped out if it were exposed, and so the assumption is that this batch has no resistant cells in it, simply because the other portions of the batch it came from did not. Perhaps so, perhaps not, but it is still only an assumption, not an empirical observation. After taking this supposedly resistance free batch, allowing it grow large enough to be subdivided into several separate batches, the experimenbt assumes that during the cloning process that the bacteria had no hereditary developmental mechanism of self-protection whereby as it grew, it did not restore the old and time-honored device of creating a few 'resistant' cells, de novo. Therefore it is assumed that each and every sub-batch taken from this supposedly resistance-free batch contains the same number of resistant cells, i.e., none, or very very few that might have met with a gamma ray over nite. These divided batches are left to sit some more in order to give the su[pposed rdiation time to work its magic. Then all the batches are are plated and, guess what, they all show resistant cells that vary in number per batch as if they had formed at random. The conclusion is then worked out backwards--a/These resistant cells resemble a random distribution. B/ We know that a/ the batctch we started the test from had no resistant cells, and b/ we know that bacteria, when they clone have no developmental processes that could intelligently, albeit haphazardly re-generate resistant cells. Ergo we know that these cells acquired resistant cells prior to plating, but following the 'purification' process, and since they are incapable of helping themselves, the new resistance can only have been bestowed upon them from on high by passing gamma rays acting as fairy godmothers. This thesis is so riddled with illogical assumptions and leaps of faith and lack of empirical retesting that it is a blot on science, and a Nobel prizewinner to boot! It could be easily verified, but if it was, nobody told anyone. All you have to do is repeat the experiment exactly, only do it in a lead-lined room or deep in an old minr where the radiation is reduced to nil. If the same results are forthcoming, then random genetic mutation caused by radiation, [the long held assumption], is clearly false. If no resistance appears in the absence of radiation, then the original assumption holds. Easy for any scientist to do. Why has it never been done [so far as I know]? Next the second situation, which I call the e.coli intelligently design and evolve a novel method of combating phage. This act of evolution took place millions of years, and trillions of generations in the past, so details are blurry. This much is known. Bacteria have, unlike plants and animals, two sets of DNA. Their 'personal' kit, and 'plasmid' kit of genese they like to pass around and experiment with among themselves. Also, although each cell is or can be self-sustaining, bacteria are really homogeneous entity made up of millions of cells that co-operate and communicate [intelligently] with each other just as an army might do. It has been noted that when a toxin is applied to the outer perimeter of a large bacteria colony, the dying outer edge communicates its predicament to the back rows, triggering a thing called 'hyper-mutation', in which vast number of self-induced mutations are systematically generated in a trial and error fashion that is narrowed down by feedback as some mutated cells do better than others, until, given enough time and resources, immunity to the toxin appears and developmentally improves. This true act of evolution takes place every time a big drug company spends tens of millions to invent an antibiotic to which the chosen microbe has no resistance. But because bacteria do not wait for the gamma ray fairies to strike their genes with a magic wand [random genetic mutation] strains of bacteria always rapidly develop a specific immunity to that toxin. That's evolution, and it's an intelligent, volitional process. What, nobody has ever challenged your favourite assumptions before?!? Bacteria colonies tolerate low doses, individual cells do not, unless the dose is next to non-existent. And the reason why colonies, the larger the better, resist better, the lower the quantity of toxin the better, has just now been explained to you. If so much toxin hit the entire colony at once, there would be no chance for communication, induced hyper-mutation, and trial and error feedback information in the intelligent design of newly self-mutated resistant strains. As explained above. I do note that you have now dropped your original assertion of individual testing of single cells, and now agree that all such testing is always done on large co-operative groups of cells. Some groups may be much smaller than others, but they never get tested one cell at a time, as you seemed to be claiming earlier on. That is why it is bad science to think of single bacteria cells as 'the organism'. The 'organism' is a highly organised, highly communicative, co-operative society gather together and talking to each other chemically, while they play around, scientifically, with their varying kits of plasmid DNA. Explained above, developmentally,[systemically], as opposed to accidentally. It is incredibly difficult to 'overthrow' an article of faith. That's why religions can tell the same children's stories for thousands of years. In science I believe that such an overthrow is called , ""a paradigm shift"". But it you believe that microbiologists have learned nothing that overthrows the _assumptions_ drawn from Luria-Delbruck 65 years ago, and that developmental biology, even in bacteriology, has not torn huge holes in those antique assumptions, then perhaps you need to read as much as this non-scientist has already done. Take a look at some of the stuff provided by Teleological. He/she is probably a scientist and is much better able to converse with you on these matters at your own level. In logic it is impossible to prove a negative proposition, especially one as vaporous as just what is 'possible' and and what is 'not possible'. In science, on the other hand, the onus of proof is always upon the one who states his/her hypothesis in a positive manner, and does so affirmatively, not just as a possibility, but as a reality, an empirically testable phenomenon. Your premise is therefore stated thusly-- Evolutionary changes in the morphology and behaviour [and possibly trait function] of organisms has its start point where a mutagen effects a particular portion of an organism's genome, and that deformation leads mechanically to a novel trait in it's offspring, and its offspring's offspring. Now that is an hypothesis that needs to be be tested by the scientific method, not a bunch of assumptions derived from ignorance and a similarity to statistical outcomes. As above, it is not my responsibility to do any such thing. It is your scientific responsibility to demonstrate empirically, via the scientific method, that not only 'could', but actually _do_ what you claim that they do so often ans so consistently that they are to be considered the engine that drives biological evolution.","intelligent-designs-black-box","11:22 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","1588"

Let me just stop you there. There's no reason to accept your version of events, because there doesn't need to be a mechanism.

Except that the same attack hasn't come millions of times in their history, any more than the same 'flu strikes every year. The 'batch' is four or five cells from a colony. That's why none of them are resistant to start with (very little chance of picking a rare resistant one). Since your 'mechanism' is indistinguishable in its effect from stochastic mutation due to replication error, I can't see how such an assumption is relevant. The hypothesis is that if this first-stage growth is timed correctly, only one or two resistant mutants would occur at most - which is borne out by later results. The expected number in each sub-batch at this stage is zero, or just possibly one IIRC. The significant observation is of 'jackpot' sub-batches, indicating the rare occasions when the mutant arose early in the sub-batch's growth (the mutant had a lot of time to replicate before plating) as opposed to late in its growth (few or no opportunities to replicate before plating). So there is in fact no indication of a dependable mechanism. The bacteria do not wait until the colony reaches a certain size before generating a resistant sprinkling of mutants. It occurs at random during growth. Tagging 'intelligence' onto that is a just-so story.

What I have actually asserted [and here repeat] is that adaptation by organisms to random changes in their environment is simply too common to be a matter of sheer good fortune. That is, that the concept of spontaneous, random, accidental, undirected, unspecified alterations in this DNA molecule or that one, whatever,[ya spins the wheel and ya takes ya chance], leading inevitably and immutably through the determinism of an organism's molecular mechanics to a change in the function, size, shape, operation, capacity or whatever of some portion or trait or property possessed by an organism--[a change, that is, which is meaningful, i.e.,non-trivial, enough to be remarked upon empirically as something truly novel, original, and at the same time adaptive, positive, and productive, [in the organism's own terms] that it may be said that that lifeform has in fact evolved, is so speculative, flimsy, hypothetical and lacking in scientific [empirical]] observation and testing that it is no better than a superstition. Sorry for the run -on, but I think the thought process is plain enough to follow without too much difficulty. Quite frankly I said at the start that I was only interested in debating the merits of ""Intelligent Design"" in this thread, not in attacking the standard geneticist/molecular biologist/statistician model for evolution's supposed source of causation. I believe that I stated plainly at that time, that statistics, and any suppositions derived from statistics, were of no interest to me, because I saw and see no reason to suppose that that arithmetic offers or provides anything empirically testable. Empirical, scientific observation of organisms and their traits, not their census numbers, nor any book-keeping wrt to the comparative ledger balance, plus or minus, wrt to the relative totals of specified DNA molecules between different organisms of the same kind. In addition, let me add that statistics do not explain themselves. They are measurements, observations, of numerical, arithmetical, effects, outcomes. Observations of effects does not explain the causes of said effects, but that is precisely what you geneticist/statistician/molecular biologists are trying to do with your antique bacteria experiments. You are trying to make a statistical effect the proof of an empirical cause, [random, accidental DNA molecule mutation] for an organismic phenomenon--evolution. Well, that's simply not science,and I'm not buying any, I've exposed and explained this flaw as it pertains to Luria-Delbruck and company. I've done so by pointing out properties which we now know bacteria to possess that were unknown in 1943, and which pretty much squelch the entire notion of anything, even an organism as primitive as a bacteria colony, evolving by happy accident alone, is preposterous. You simply hand-wave the findings of modern microbiology off like smoke, and pretend that what I'm saying, what I believe to be the scientific case, is merely some kind of stubborn refusal to face 'the facts' of statistics. Well, since all that statistics are is meaningless facts requiring interpretation before they mean a darn thing, what you are really saying is that I'm just being stubborn when I reject your interpretation of those facts. But the truth is, there is nothing, either in logic, reasoning, or science, that should compel me or anyone else to accept your interpretation of your statistics. ['quote] That's all you've ever said, and it's in defiance of basic statistics.[/quote] See, there you go, talking as if statistics, [which are numbers, which are nothing more than meaningless factual observations], are really meaningful in and of themselves alone! I've never challenged a fact. That would be silly, since by definition a fact is something indisputable. So I've never ""defied basic statistics"". I've simply noted that statistics are meaningless without a causal explanation for them, and that they do not ever explain themselves, and that all given explanations for supposed causes of statistical effects/facts are strictly hypothetical until empirically demonstrated by the scientific method. But you guys just want to wave off the scientific method of establishing causation and go straight from, 'these effects _look_ random , statistically -speaking', therefore their cause _actually is_ random'. Very bad science. I find that you have a very exagerated awe of statistics, what they are, and what they can and do contribute to hum understanding. I do not defy them, but unlike many [no offence?] I do do not bow down and venerate them for their own sakes. Now you're just trying for a laugh by offering absurdities. OK Excuse me?!?! Where and when did I ever 'deny to your face' that statistical number comparisons, as empirical observations, can compare positively [in statistics terms] to census expectations founded upon earlier observations of fact? Or indeed, where and when did I ever say that numerical outcomes cannot look stochastic, or cannot look stochastic if anyone predicts that they will look that way? I've never said any such thing. If you can quote me, with post number, please do so. Otherwise do not put words in my mouth, please and thank-you. I dragged nobody anywhere. I have never ever denied that the Luria-Delbruck stats looked like a random result. Instead, I pointed out, as I have always pointed out, that just because something resembles a random effect, that in no way shape or form proves that it had a random cause. NOT, that is unless you first assume that there are only 2 kinds of causes-1/mechanically determined, and 2/ random, i.e., stochastic. Given this false dichotomy as an a priori materialist assumption, if effects look regular and predictable, formed, regulated and constrained, then they are 'mechanical'. If not, then they are, perforce, random. Problem is the false dichotomy, because, in my view and that of several billion other people, there is a third alternative to the determined/random dichotomy--teleology. Intention. And the fact is that facts, results, outcomes, both those that resemble products of ordered and predictable mechanical causation, but also those that look like disordered, accidental, and random products, can both be truly the result neither of determined, nor of random, causation; but rather, of teleological causation.

Post 79 Speed and specificity and regularity. That is , their resistance/immunity happens way too often, way too fast, and way too specific to cause, to simply be a matter of happy accident, of chance mutation. Post 88 The only reason you call such a regularity, 'random', is because that is what you'd like it to be--a 'random mechanism', a self-contradictory oxymoron, because that would help it fit into your a priori assumptions of what everything is all about.

I wouldn't dream of claiming random mutation is responsible for all organismic adaptation. I wouldn't dream of dismissing the last sixty years of research into the biology of bacteria and other organisms. But RM is unquestionably happening ; it's a part of the grand biological process whether we like it or not. I don't have a philosophical axe to grind here; I don't have a 'materialist agenda'. I just want to get the clearest possible picture of what's actually happening, warts and all. And to do that we can't just brush contributing factors like RM under the carpet and pretend they don't exist or don't matter. We need to fully understand their contribution so that our understanding of everything else isn't grossly distorted. Recall the poker analogy, which I think was the closest we came to a meeting of minds. You talked about 'aces up sleeves' and suchlike, and it's certainly the case that organisms possess developmental contingencies to a greater or lesser extent. Let's examine that analogy in more detail. Are you familiar with Texas Hold'em? Each player is dealt two cards, and must make the best hand he can with five further cards dealt to the table. This game is a particularly good analogy because the player's two 'hole' cards can be thought of as his genes, and those dealt to the table, the environment in which he and all his fellow players are living. So while, as you suggested, a player can possess developmental contingencies (cards up his sleeve) they are only effective within a limited range of environmental peturbation. Where biology and poker sharply diverge is in the way the 'cards' are dealt to the players and the table. In poker there is no continuity: the 'genes' and 'environment' are shuffled and re-dealt each hand. The effect of this is to render the influence of the cards neutral over the long term, so that winning or losing is in the end a matter of player skill and strategy. In biology on the other hand there is genetic and environmental continuity, and that changes everything. Imagine a game where the shared cards remain on the table, with maybe one or two changing occasionally. The same happens with the players' cards: kept from hand to hand with one changing occasionally. And the winner(s) of each hand get to give a copy of their cards to another player for the next round. The 'best' hands proliferate and the 'worst' abate - best and worst being strictly in the context of the environmental cards on the table, of course. And so the 'gene pool' will, after a fashion, blindly track the environmental changes. In this version of the game we've removed all skill and strategy, and reproduction of cards is asexual, so it's a very limited analogy for biology. You're absolutely right that in macroscopic, sexually reproducing species adaptation does not tally with the occurrence of random mutation, and bacteria possess many contingent mechanisms or behaviours. But that doesn't mean RM+NS can't 'work', or has no influence in the grand scheme of things. It just means that in order to detect unalloyed RM+NS it's necessary to filter out other evolutionary factors, something which is most readily achieved in the lab with bacteria. We agree that pertinent mutations have been shown to arise, during colony growth, in a statistically stochastic pattern prior to environmental change. There is no empirical evidence of it being a response to the colony achieving a 'critical mass', or indeed a response to anything at all. Up to this point the possibility remains that, as you would prefer, the genetic dice are being rolled on purpose by the bacteria as insurance against future environmental change. They can't know what's coming, or predict the effects of mutation, so a degree of randomised biodiversity is about the best strategy one could hope for under the circumstances. Does that sound fair enough? That hypothesis fails when we investigate causes of mutation. The empirical fact that the rate of mutations - both adaptive and maladaptive - increases linearly with radiation dosage indicates the genetic dice-rolls are inadvertent: externally induced, unintentional. This fact does not vindicate philosophical materialism or determinism in the slightest, it is merely a truth we must factor into our model of evolution: among random mutations there are those that do turn out to be pertinent to future environmental changes, and in bacterial colonies of billions those individually rare events are sufficient to explain our observations of evolutionary adaptation under controlled circumstances. I say again for the record: this is not the be-all and end-all of evolution. It is merely one ongoing, inevitable process which we must recognise and accept, or else be led into grave error. That's not what I claimed you denied. You denied that random mutation could be a sufficiently reliable process - reliability being a statistical measurement - to account for the regularity of results from tests like L&D. I've included several supporting links below. The comparison in question was not, as you now claim, between observations and census expectations based on previous observation, but between observation and prediction based on hypothesis. By saying that the occurrence of bacterial resistance is too regular to be explained by random mutation, you are denying the statistical math that leads us to expect precisely the observed degree of regularity given a tiny finite chance of mutation per cell division - ie, replication error. I know. Nevertheless, you attempted to deny that the results of the L&D test indicated stochastic mutation: I'm sorry, but you repeatedly denied, to myself and to others, that the L&D results matched the expectations of a hypothesis of random mutation: I could go on, but I think the point is proved. You said I must be 'superstitious', wearing 'ideological blinkers', prone to believing in 'children's fables' - hardly the words of someone who accepts that the predictions of the RM hypothesis match our observations. And time and time again you explicitly said the outcome, the effect , was too reliable, too regular, too predictable - more denial of the correlation between RM's predictions and our observations. You offered an alternative teleological cause, but the only argument you leveled against RM, other than scorn, was that RM could not explain the observed effects. An argument you've since admitted is incorrect. Correct. You distinguish between causes by bombarding organisms with radiation and observing the linear elevation in their mutation rates. L&D on its own directly proves that mutations occurred stochastically during cell growth prior to environmental change. It eliminates the possibility of the underlying mechanism being responsive. Bombardment with radiation, and the observation of linear change in mutation rates, eliminates the remaining uncertainty as to whether the mechanism is endogenous - a deliberate strategy - or exogenous (environmentally induced and unintentional). Once again, this is not the sum total of evolutionary processes. But it is one of them, it is part of the whole. I'm entirely willing to talk about telic evolutionary processes - are you willing to remove your ideological blinkers and accept that not all evolutionary processes are necessarily telic?","intelligent-designs-black-box","07:24 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","1368"

You don't build scientific principles on anomalies and exceptions. Therefore the basic principle wrt the the fundamental agency/cause of evolution is not random, spontaneous generation of organismic changes via entropic system failure or external toxins, it is a telic process wherebye the organism itself makes itself, [and more importantly, its offspring], more adapted, fitted, suited to a particular environment than its predecessors were. In my hypothesis, the organism is not the hapless pawn of stochastically altered DNA molecules--rather, DNA molecules are the 'paper' on which the organism pro-actively re-writes its message to posterity as it engages with its environment. To simplify, your hypothesis [called a 'theory', although never tested empirically], is that information moves from accidentally altered molecule that by merely existing contains coded information that then is mechanically, deterministically, moved along a chemical developmental conveyor belt until at length a novel [at least in part] organismic trait appears. In my hypothesis, more of the Lamarckian style, information comes to the whole organism from the environment. The organism deals with this information in such a way as to further its own 'best interests'. If during the course of doing so, its behaviour patterns and trait functions change, then this new information is passed on to its offspring during the developmental process, enabling the offspring to use the parent's experience to better work with the information that the environment is supplying. If the same conditions persist over successive generations, more information is collected and expanded, both in terms of behaviour and, if necessary, physiology. Eventually this info 'hardens' and becomes mechasnised and systematic as the organism encodes it on DNA molecules in its genome.
