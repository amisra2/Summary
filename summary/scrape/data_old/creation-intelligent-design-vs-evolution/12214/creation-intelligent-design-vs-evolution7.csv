"02-02-2009","12214",7,"Peeling","342614","Certainly organisms do possess mechanisms for dealing with common (but irregularly-encountered) environmental changes. You can recognise them because they kick in after the environment changes, not before. There are three main flaws with that argument. First of all, it wrongly presumes that the random, lucky genetic mutation stochastically 're-inventing the wheel' is somehow a defective or unreliable mechanism for generating the 'enzyme' in question on all those occasions. It's not. In a quite modestly-sized bacterial colony every multi-billion-to-one mutation will be amply represented purely through replication error. So supposing the existence of a responsive mechanism ready to generate each and every one is entirely unnecessary, on top of being implausible. Where are all these mechanisms? There isn't nearly enough genome to describe them all, even theoretically. Secondly, if a bacterial species had developed a responsive mechanism for dealing with an environmental change after being exposed to it millions of times over, we would expect it to work on an individual level a bit better than the one-in-ten-billion times or so it empirically does in the examples we're talking about - a rate that is on the other hand remarkably congruent with typical rates of genetic mutation. And of course, there's the awkward fact that mutants arise, stochastically, prior to and in the absence of the environmental changes to which they could be considered adaptive. Pick a number from one to six and then roll a die. Did you guess right? Now ask twenty people to pick a number, and then roll a die. Did one of them guess right? Now enter the lottery. Did you win? Now get fifty million people to enter the lottery. Did one of them win? The math doesn't become invalid just because the numbers get bigger.","jakers","342624","Or, in this case, after they have been changed to be out of sync with the normal state of affairs, which has not changed. I believe that with bacteria it's called 'reverse' or 'revertant' mutation? It is not accidental, but an actual mechanism. Anything that happens with a dependable, predictable regularity, is not random. Actually, it is a plain statement of fact that any event, including a genetic mutation, that can be depended upon to generate a particular enzyme at a regular, predictable, rate, cannot be called defective or unreliable. It cannot be called 'random'. The mere fact that the Luria-Delbruck experiment, and others like it, have been repeated thousands of times, always with the same predictable outcome, is proof enough that the event and the outcome are not matters of chance, stochastic, accident. Further to that, the fact that no matter how many antibiotics, pesticides, herbicides, or other 'cides' we invent in our labs, so far every one has been overcome by the organisms it was meant to destroy shows that that is no accident. If a Vegas casino noticed that a gambler started out losing at every game of chance he or she tried, but always left the table the big winner, they would never put that fact down to random chance or luck. They'd know that that winner had a winning 'system' of some kind, even if they had no idea what it might be. The the thing is, I have not postulated ""the existence of a responsive mechanism ready to generate each and every one"" , by which I suppose you to mean that I had proposed that every genome contained sufficient inherited random mutations that they had something that would act as as a dependable mechanism to deal with every and any challenge that the organism might encounter. That is the farthest thing from my own opinion, but it does seem to be exactly what many adherents of the current genetic approach to evolution believe. It's their problem that they either have to believe that, which, as you put it politely, is implausible [I would have said, ""silly""], or they have to believe that random genetic mutations can and do happen almost immediately upon the instance of organismic need, and specific to that particular need, as well. Which is equally, uhm, implausible. I don't know what you are talking about, but I have never heard of a repitition of the Luria-Delbruck experiment, or any of its offshoots, that did not produce the exact same result. When something happens every time, that event is remarkably congruent with what I would call a mechanism. Accidents do not come even remotely close to that kind of regularity. And ponder this--if it were not a mechanical regularity developed as a defense mechanism over millions of generations, why does that experiment and others like it fail miserably when some truly original antibiotic is first used on batches of unexposed microbes for the first time? Let's see, in terms of being resisistant , bacteria score, --Luria-Delbruck, 100% success every time; brand new antibiotic, 100% failure, every time. Nothing random here. If by mutants you are referring to 'genes', i.e., DNA molecules, I imagine the rate of 'mutation' is fairly regular unless disturbed by some cause external to the genome which might cause that rate to accelerate, perhaps instantaneously, perhaps very rapidly. Whether or not in some cases, [such as irradiation], the mutant genes were in no way adaptive to any environment currently encountered by the organism, is of no matter. It is beside the point we are discussing. If by mutants you mean altered organisms which arise thanks to genetic or developmental malfunction [accident], these are generally considered to be illnesses, that is, system failures of some kind, and are hardly relevant to this discussion of adaptation, either. This is a red herring. I fail to see any genuine relation to the question of adaptation. It seems to be a faith statement that given a sufficiently large number of instances, anything, even miracles, can happen. Worse, that anything that could happen that way, must happen, eventually. This thinking is utterly irrational. Sorry, but all this statistical math is just that--math, not biology. I am not interested.

"02-02-2009","12214",7,"jakers","342535","A 'clue'? To what mystery, exactly? How so? I'm sorry to hear that. All of the above, I believe. I suspect that you are being, shall we say, disingenuous, since I cannot believe that you cannot put ""genetic accident"" together with ""random genetic mutation"". Surely you are familiar with that? Well, no, not really. I'm talking about random events [mutagenic random events] which change _the genes_ in an organism [i.e., 'mutate' one or more of them] to the extent that the organism's offspring [and their 'genes'][i.e., 'mutants'] are at least somewhat different from those carried, up to that moment, by it's ancestors' offspring. Lots of things can change the genetic makeup of any given population. Well, if you choose to make an enemy of everybody who disagrees with you, you've picked the proper way to go about it. Poisoning the well by accusing others of deliberate ignorance will not bring anyone over to your point of view. If any of the above are intentional or mechanical, then they do not deserve to be called 'accidental', 'random', 'coincidental', 'fortuitous', 'chance' or 'just plain lucky'. If, OTH, the presence of mechanics and/or or intent is denied, then how else are they to be described other than in those terms? Well, that is basically what I was referring to, but since you bring up these other things, perhaps I should include them under the same heading. Unless, of course, you can show that ""gene flow, recombination, and genetic drift"" are mechanical and/or intentional, then they won't deserve to be called 'random', 'accidental', etc. What ""Taint so?"" That ""the word design implies some intelligent cause""? It does. That's just the way it is. So what are you saying? In that case, since there are only the three alternatives, then those 'mechanisms' must be true 'mechanisms', i.e., chains of events that are mechanically determined and predictable, that cannot be altered or avoided. None of that verbiage relates to the plain English word 'to select', or to any of its cognates. All you are doing is offering the tautology that, 'things that do better, do better'. Well, it would be nice if they didn't just suggest what it does, but actually said what, in scientific as opposed to literary terms, it _is_. I suggest to you that anything that is not mechanical is not a mechanism, as such. At least in material terms. However, I do admit of psychological 'mechanisms' as well as material ones. I do not admit of 'accidental mechanisms', since that is an oxymoron, but that does seem to be what you are trying to put forward. Sexual selection, in the rare cases where it is actually present, is true 'selection' because it is something done by a sentient being, a live organism. An awful lot of 'mate acquisition' has little to do with any real choice. But forget about that for now. This appears to be a genuine instance of choice, selection, based upon a certain 'value judgement', and is thus intentional, and not accidental. It also makes it teleological, unless you can show a determined, inflexible, unavoidable chemical progression from the eye of the peahen to the act of copulation. In which case it is not selection/choice, since it is compelled. The ladies will not, I think, thank you for that one. Well, I only meant to assert my opinion that there is a teleological element in biological evolution. I had no intention of taking a course in genetics. I still don't, not really. I know that that is what you believe, but you'll have to prove it to me. And, BTW, ""random mechanisms"" is still an oxymoron. Well, since I'm not taking your course, I don't have to do your quizzes, do I?","pandion","342628","It was a clue that you might investigate to learn why your argument was erroneous. False dichotomy. A false dichotomy is a logical fallacy where only two alternatives are presented in answer to a question where there are more. I would have thought that you would have understood that. Anyway, ""either design or accident"" is such a logical fallacy. There are more possibilities in reality than those that you presented, and in fact, neither of your choices is correct. It would be nice if you would make an effort to use clear language in the future, in addition to making an effort to learn the basics of the topic that you are trying to discuss. Do you have so little understanding of English that you think that your simple, and incorrect, phrase conforms to all of those definitions? Yes, I am. What I am saying is that your terminology isn't correct. If you wish to discuss the topic with at least 3 degreed biologists, you should at least try not to use nonsense terms. I know what random genetic mutations are but I can't be sure what you meant by ""genetic accident."" This is especially true now that you have explained that you think that three different and exclusive definitions all apply. It's strange. How strange. I asked if you were talking about ""random events that change the genetic makeup of a population"", and you say no. You then use less precise language to explain that you were talking about random events that change the genetic makeup of a population. That is true. And I made an effort to explain many of them to you. Instead, you come up with Nazis and Jews. That makes me your enemy? The mechanisms that I mentioned are not accidents. They are random events. However, those who don't understand evolutionary theory prefer to call them accidents. It is a matter of knowledge. That can be cured by education. But they aren't intentional or mechanical. They are processes that are agents of change. They are random in nature with none of the baggage the you seem to want to assign with other terms. Do you have a problem understanding what evolutionary biology means by ""random?"" What are you talking about? The mechanisms that I mentioned do not imply mechanics or intent. Above you wanted to extent a simple statement to include all definitions of a term and now you want to limit a definition to a single, narrow definition. The wrong one. By mechanism I mean, "" the fundamental processes involved in or responsible for an action, reaction, or other natural phenomenon."" It's not mechanics or intent. Since I have already done so, the question is moot. It seems that you don't understand the use of the term ""mechanism"" in a biological context. It isn't mechanical and it isn't intentional. Perhaps it would be a good idea to actually make an effort to learn the basics of evolutionary biology before you speak. We are not talking about engineering. In that context the word ""mechanism"" has a different meaning. Your understanding to the language of science seems to be a problem here. Actually, that is what you accept on faith without evidence. In the real world design does not imply intelligence since organisms appear to have been designed for their environment. That appearance of design was explained 150 years ago by the theory of natural selection. There isn't any need to postulate a magical being. Again with a single engineering definition. And yet, you weren't able to actually settle on a definition of ""accident"" in this context. Let me repeat, a mechanism is ""the fundamental processes involved in or responsible for an action, reaction, or other natural phenomenon."" What happened to the other two alternatives? But it isn't plain English. Why is that so hard for you to grasp? It is the language of evolutionary biology. By the way, I said, ""selection."" How sad that you didn't bother to read what I said. It is even more sad that you attempt to debate evolutionary biology with even the slightest understanding of what it is or how it works. But, that's what I did. Let me say it again. Biologists simply say that natural selection lends a differential reproductive advantage. If you have a problem understanding, maybe you should follow with your finger as you read. Feel free to move your lips. Again with the limited understanding of definitions and science. You were imprecise when it came to the definition of accident, and now you want to use a narrow engineering definition of a word. That means? And, of course, you don't admit to biological mechanisms, which have nothing to do with mechanics. Please educate yourself before you speak. BWAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAH. The rare case. That's good. But of course, natural selection doesn't imply a sentient being since the environment is the ""selector."" Is that a problem for you? But I didn't say that all mating was driven by sexual selection. Pick an organism and learn about it. Peacocks with big tails produce more offspring. Lions with large manes produce more offspring. But I didn't say that it was accidental. It is most certainly the preference of peahens. I suspect that they don't have the mental ability to make value judgements, at least in the sense that you imply. Actually, I think that it is you that must show that peahens actually want to produce offspring with large, beautiful tails. So, is it teleological that many American men are attracted to women with large breasts? I can understand that women undergo breast enhancement for teleological motives, but the attraction of men? What does that have to do with ""ladies""? Are you actually aware of what we are talking about? Sexual selection isn't compelled. It is a statistical tendency. God forbid that you should actually make an attempt to learn what you are talking about. It is much more preferable to postulate that you have knowledge without the slightest thought or effort. Do you know what an oxymoron is? It seems not. It seems that you neither understand the meaning of the terms ""random"" nor ""mechanisms"" in a biological context. That would take some actual study of biology. Thank you for your admission of ignorance. It's actually pretty apparent - one might even say intuitively apparent - to anyone who understands the basics. I'm sorry that you are so opposed to learning.","intelligent-designs-black-box","01:19 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","93"

"02-02-2009","12214",7,"jakers","342510","... it has come to a question of whether organisms evolve by design or by genetic accident. Is teleology involved or is it a case of, "" things change, willy-nilly, and what you see today is just what was lucky enough to change in a way that suited the fickle finger of blind, random, environmental fluctuations"". To me there is no way that you can claim that anything 'adapted' to anything without speaking teleologically, or poetically. Poetically, as in, the water adapted to the drop in temperature by freezing, or the branch adapted to the rise in temperature by catching fire. The online dictionaries all say something like-- Adapt # (a.) Fitted; suited. # (v. t.) To make suitable; to fit, or suit; to adjust; to alter so as to fit for a new use; -- sometimes followed by to or for. Therefore the original [and only true and legitimate] meaning for 'fitness for' something, is also teleological. To be 'fit for' is always to 'be suitable for'. I do not see how the words 'adapted' and 'fitted' can be separated from each other wrt the words 'environment' and 'evolution'. Thus both ""Survival of the Fittest"" and ""Natural Selection"" imply a value judgement made by something or other, real or imaginary, and that makes such expressions intrinsically teleological and clearly opposite any inference of chance or mechanics. Well, to me teleology is a part of the concept of 'causation' in philosophy. That is, it sometimes plays a part in explaining what caused a certain effect, or outcome. Thus, to me, teleology is part of an Aristotelian tradition of causation, that is his 'final cause'. Anything that suggests that a 'change action' was started with a view, be it vague or clearly defined, to a desired end, is teleological. Anything that makes a value judgement on the lines of 'good, better, best', etc., wrt to itself and the world around it, is teleological. Thus anything capable of recognising itself as a 'self', an individual being distinguishable from the rest of the universe, is teleological. The concepts of 'mind', 'intelligence'. awareness'. 'volition', 'free will', 'choice', 'judgement', 'selection', 'fitness', 'suitability', 'purpose', 'use', 'intention', 'goal', 'objective', 'motive' and a thousand others are plainly teleological. To put in its simplest terms, teleology is present where a mental activity assesses a present state of affairs, makes a conscious or unconscious judgement wrt its impact on the being experiencing the mental activity, and this judgement has an effect on what that 'judge' does, and what the result of that action will be. Many people, especially of late, have ridiculed teleology as being a philosophy which insists that everything that exists, got to be where it is and how it is through the conscious efforts of some wilful external agent or agency, usually referred to as a god. [but sometimes 'evolution', That is not my belief. I am not here to deny the presence of random chance as an intrinsic part of reality. I believe that accidents do happen. Nor I am I here to deny mechanics. Observation shows us that there is law and order in this universe, because certain causes can be depended upon to lead to certain ends, time after time. I am here simply to say that where living organisms are concerned, what they do in their own lives, and over the 'lifespans' of their 'lifeforms', is not a simple matter of chemical iterations nor inexplicable failures of molecular iterations, but that there is 'something else' in 'life' itself which exercises power over the mechanics/operations/behaviours of sentient, self-aware, mentally-endowed beings, a power exercised right down to the molecular level. An intrinsic teleological power. The power to _act_ upon the world, and just to be a passive 'thing' that it acts upon. I say that you have to invoke a final cause anytime you claim that something is 'adapted' to anything. To 'adapt' yourself, or anything else, to something else, is always a teleological act. A senseless thing can 'conform' to the laws of physics and chemistry, but it can never 'adapt' to them. 'Adaptation' always connotes awareness and intention. Conformance and compliance do not. I believe that insentient matter complies and conforms entirely, passively, in reaction to whatever external forces act upon it. I believe that sentient lifeforms, i.e., living organisms, internally affect and direct what happens to the insentient matter within themselves, just as they act upon the insentient matter external to them, though by no means in the same way or to the same extent. Polar bears are white [sort of], and their ice flow environment is whitish as well. Therefore we may suppose that polar bear fur colour is another instance of natural camouflage, a phenomenon widespread throughout the natural world. Camouflage, in and of itself, [along with 'mimicry'] is an extremely interesting and mysterious phenomenon. Great topic. But for our purposes, the polar bear, once a grizzly bear kind of bear, somehow sensed that it caught more seals on ice flows when the seal couldn't see them, and, unconsciously picking up on the fact that the ice and snow around it were white, succeeded, teleologically, in making its offspring successively less brown and more white . How subconscious awareness of surroundings cause organisms to change themselves to suit, either intantly or over a generation or so, is quite a mystery. But claiming that all the brown bears died, and only mutant white bears survived, is, to me, a children's story. [boldface added] For lack of a better word, I could say 'the psyche'. Whatever ""it"" is, it is intrinsic to ""life"". Now, I have heard some people say that there is no such thing as 'life'. That is only 'matter', acting mechanically. I do not like to argue with people who deny the obvious--that is, a live thing does things that a dead thing cannot, even though all of the 'matter' is still there. So that therefore there is a true and real difference between an organism that possesses something called 'life', and another one that does not. Well. enough for now. I'll get back to this in a while. Later.","Matthew","342668","There are three problems with putting things this way. First, the alternative to teleology that you provide should not be ""genetic accident."" It should be ""genetic variation , and natural selection."" I realize that you don't like the term ""natural selection."" But however we name it, the process by which some organisms survive and reproduce more effectively than others works just the same. If you leave it out, you're leaving out the greater part of how the evolutionary process is conceived to work without teleology. Second, that greater part is not remotely as ""chancey"" a process as you make it out to be. Genetic variation is, in some sense, random: we cannot always predict when or how it will occur. But under at least some circumstances, even mutations can be predicted (e.g. irradiation), and in sexually reproducing organisms, recombination leads predictably to variation. In any event, variation need not be a matter of chance for evolution to occur. What's even more important is that the process by which these variations lead to differential survival and reproduction (natural selection) is anything but random. More on this in a bit. Thirdly and finally, this may well be a false dichotomy. It is quite possible that, what looks undirected and contingent from the perspective of natural science may be teleological or even necessary from a philosophical or theological perspective. Possible, but not necessary -- meaning that if one's philosophical or theological metaphysic leads one to presume direction for the process, the natural process is compatible with that, but there is no necessity to that presumption: if one's philosophical or theological metaphysic leads one in the opposite direction, the natural process is compatible with that, too. In either case, the natural process is the same, and it does not indicate whether there is anything teleological going on or not. And with all due respect, water freezing and wood burning are not examples of ""adaptation,"" in the biological sense of the term . See below. Do any of those online dictionaries provide multiple definitions for the term? Are any of those definitions introduced with something along the lines of "" Biol. ""? Because that's the case with my hardcover volume. It gives a biological definition, which mirrors that found in the biology textbook I bought a few months ago (when I decided I needed to know more about this stuff (Raven's 8th ed., if you're interested in the specifics)). Biologists have had to be more precise than just saying that an organism is ""suitable"" for its environment, or that it ""fits"" there somehow. The definition in my textbook glossary is that an ""adaptation"" is a feature that enables an organism to survive and reproduce in its environment. An organism is ""adapted"" to its environment to the extent that it has such features. There is nothing teleological or evaluative here. Whether or not organisms survive and reproduce is empirically observable. Whether or not any particular feature is an adaptation can certainly be disputed, and biologists engage in such investigation all the time. The role that the feature plays in enabling survival and reproduction needs to be examined. But again, it can be examined empirically. I grant you, the process by which organisms become ""adapted,"" by which they gain ""adaptations,"" may well be teleological. Or it may not be. And my view is that the non-teleological explanation of genetic variation plus natural selection is sufficient to explain this process. Perhaps why will become clearer as we go. In any event, I think you are far too hung up on definitions. Which brings me to the following: The brackets are there in your original. And if I may offer an aside on the philosophy of language, I think that it indicates some root level problems. You see, I don't think there's any such thing as a "" true meaning."" Meanings are matters of convention. Moreover, I certainly don't think that there's any link between ""legitimacy"" of meaning and ""original"" meaning. Terms take on new meanings all the time -- because the conventions that govern their usage change. This isn't a ""Humpty Dumpty"" problem, whereby any term mean can be used however one wants it to be used. No individual has control over linguistic meanings. But neither is language use as constrained as this ""original [and only true and legitimate] meaning"" idea indicates. That's simply a bad model of language, because it pays insufficient attention to how language actually works. I think you need to pay more attention to how biologists are using their terms, and stop saying that they're using their terms ""incorrectly."" If you don't want to use terms the way they do, that's certainly an option. But then you shouldn't pretend that you're talking about what they're talking about. And you shouldn't pretend that what you are criticizing is the biological theory of evolution. End of aside, back to substance: And I do, as do biologists. The term can be defined -- the notion of ""fit"" can be re fined -- in terms of survival and reproduction. Polar bears are adapted to the Arctic. What does that mean? That they can survive and reproduce there. Again, not so. What value judgment is implied by the fact that, under a given set of conditions, organisms with some features survive and reproduce in greater numbers than those with other features? What is teleological about that? Yes, I'm quite familiar with Aristotle. The problem is, his tradition of causation did things like impute purposes to stones in order to explain why they fall, or to flames to explain why they rise. I have no doubt that purposes can be used to explain the significance of the behaviors of certain organisms, whether a leopard crouching in tall grass or a quarterback throwing a pass. I also have no doubt that various phenomena can be understood in terms of the purposeful behavior to which they will be put, whether a leopard's sharp teeth or a quarterback's shoulder-pads. Whether such explanations reveal causes of behavior is an open question. But whether ""explanation"" or ""cause,"" just because purposes may explain or cause some phenomena, it does not follow that they must explain jor cause all phenomena. Behaviors? Well, okay, up to a point (alhtough there is certainly a great deal of mechanism involved in behavior). But evolution? No. Because evolution is not a behavior. But genetic variations don't happen this way! They happen whether any end would be served or not. And natural selection isn't teleological either. Those whose variations, whatever their source, enable them to survive and reproduce in greater numbers than their neighbors simply will have more descendents in the long run than will their neighbors (if conditions remain stable, of course). The individual organism are, I grant you, trying to survive and reproduce. They are not, however, trying to evolve. This is an effect of their behavior, not a goal. But genetic variation gives no indication whatsoever of involving ""mental activity!"" Nor does natural selection. It's all quite mechanical. If you think otherwise, then you need to demonstrate that organisms -- or something... -- are engaged in the mental activity in question. Til then, why should we admit it? Maybe it's not. But go back and look at the list of characteristics you just gave. You summed them up under the heading of ""mental activity,"" making ""conscious or unconscious judgments."" And before long, you'll be speaking of ""the psyche."" The only difference I see here is, rather than making this mental agent external, you're making it immanent. But whether external or immanent, it's a metaphysical thesis that has absolutely no bearing on the empirical biology. (And ironically, as a theist myself, I have no problem invoking God! I just don't think God should be invoked when we are trying to understand a process scientifically . Science is neutral on the metaphysical issue of theism.) Fair enough. But who is denying that organisms can act in the world, rather than just being acted upon? All that I'm saying is that organisms don't control their own evolution. What I mean will become clearer when we get to the bears. And I say you don't. As used by biologists, it merely implies the capacity for survival and reproduction. But see, here's the thing. Individual organisms don't ""adapt themselves."" They are adapted, or they're not, meaning that they survive and reproduce, or they don't. Over time, a species can become adapted, via a process that no member of that species controls. Who would deny that? It's just ""homeostasis."" And I'm sorry, but this is not how reproduction and inheritance work. A bear has no control over which of its genes make it into which of its individual sex cells, or which of its sex cells will unite with that of its mate, and still less which of its mates' sex cells will be the one that its own sex cell unites with. Nor does any other organism. When you're dealing with inheritance, the patterns are exactly what one would expect if the process were not directed by the organisms doing the reproducing. If you think otherwise, then the burden of proof is yours to show that there is any such causal link between the organism's ""subconscious awareness of surroundings"" and its changes over time. Personally, I think that's a recipe for getting precisely nowhere, because figuring out what a non-human organism's conscious awareness of anything is like, is a hard enough problems; when you start invoking sub-conscious awareness, it seems even tougher. The whole thing remains at the level of mystery. But if you think you can establish this sort of causal link -- or that someone else could -- then go ahead. Make me a believer. Meanwhile, the ""children's story"" quip is just empty bluster. Initially, brown bears probably weren't at much disadvantage at all. As seals became more used to the predator in their midst, however, lighter fur could've become advanatageous. This need not imply that all the brown bears never survived, just that they survived less often, and left fewer descendents. If you want to see an even better example of how the process works, check out The Beak of the Finch , by Jonathan Weiner, on the work of Peter and Rosemary Grant. Hardly a children's story. Whatever ""it"" is, you need to find many better words before I'm even convinced that it exists, let alone that it plays a role in evolution. Yes, but is the difference the possession of some thing or property called ""life?"" Or is it a difference in the organization of the matter in question? Ditto. Please no response on this one til I respond to the second.","intelligent-designs-black-box","12:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","95"

I don't recognise ""natural selection"" as anything but a literary figure of speech. I certainly do not see it as a scientific mechanism of any kind. At best it's a fancy description of what and who is still standing after the dust settles. At best, it describes; it never explains what it describes. It never accouts for it. That's why 'random genetic mutation' had to be invented--to make up for that failing. [Me:] But even granting your point for the sake of argument: Is there a principled distinction to be made between what teleology can fix and what it can't? If not, then what distinguishes teleological causation from lucky chance after all? In practice, how could we tell the difference? [You:] I'm not sure what you are asking. I believe that recognising a problem, inventing and trying out solutions based upon what you know about that problem, with whatever mental and physical resources you have at your disposal, will lead to a greater number of successful solutions than 'blind-firing' or waiting on 'lady luck' will ever do. [Me:] But even granting your point for the sake of argument: Is there a principled distinction to be made between what teleology can fix and what it can't? If not, then what distinguishes teleological causation from lucky chance after all? In practice, how could we tell the difference? I didn't turn 'survival' into a 'thing', I simply said it could be a goal, an objective. Goals and objectives are not things either, and yes, they are all part of teleology. And the whole point of teleology is that goals and objectives, such as survival, DO do something. They affect what the doer does and how what the doer does is done. I object to using ""evolution' as the active subject performing an action mostly because the action it is proposed to be doing is itself, and that is absurd. Outcomes do not generate themselves. Teleologically a certain outcome may prompt a sentient being to bring it to fruition... ... but it is always and only the sentient being that a/recognises the situation, b. envisages solutions and outcomes, c/selects courses of action and follows through and d/ achieves goals. The problems, solutions, goals and achievements are not the actor, but only what the actor has, finds, or does. [Me:] In the case of the vanished birds of Guam, what particular effects did ""survival"" have on them? [You:] None, since they didn't. [Me:] In the case of the vanished birds of Guam, what particular effects did ""survival"" have on them? [Me:] If all that a teleological explanation can say is something like ""The organism's goal of survival led it to try to survive,"" I just don't find that terribly informative. [You:] Well, I do. For one thing, it tells me to look for very different behaviours from a dead fish in a shark tank compared to that of a live fish in a shark tank, if you'll accept this hypothetical image. [Me:] If all that a teleological explanation can say is something like ""The organism's goal of survival led it to try to survive,"" I just don't find that terribly informative. [Me:] Your medical student example doesn't help here. Having the goal isn't the cause of your would-be doctor's failure! And even if he were to succeed, having the goal wouldn't be the cause of his success. [You:] I want a million dollars. Teleologically, I buy a lottery ticket. Maybe I buy a lot of them. I still don't win a million dollars. I still did what I did because I wanted to. [Me:] Your medical student example doesn't help here. Having the goal isn't the cause of your would-be doctor's failure! And even if he were to succeed, having the goal wouldn't be the cause of his success. Analogies can be literary and pretty, without being rational or real. The difference between human [artificial] selection and 'natural selection' is that selection is always a teleological act. It takes a mind and a will to select. Nature as such has no embodied mind and will. Natural selection sounds great, but it's an oxymoron. It has no more to do with science than Dumbo the flying elephant. ... Because they were not mindfully, intentionally separated by a sentient being. You can mechanically sort things like potatoes and beans, but only a human being can choose/select one or another.","Matthew","342775","Here's part two. But here's the thing. In many cases where a given feature would be adaptive, the variation that would bring that feature about is not present, and fails to become so. Moreover, variations that could bring about adaptive features in one context are often present, or do become so, even in contexts where they have no adaptive consequences at all. What you need to do is, in those ""sometimes"" where you claim that adaptive utility ""causes"" the variations to appear, back that up with some evidence . Right now, there isn't any. You can't just assume that because variations sometimes produce adaptively useful features, those features' adaptive utility is what caused the underlying variation to occur. Except that your ""childrens' fable"" talk is, again, empty bluster. Bacteria are prone to high rates of mutation. Moreover, there is plenty of variation already found in any population of organisms, mutations aside. When you couple this with extremely rapid generation times, it is not at all difficult to understand why bacteria so regularly develop resistance. What you are also ignoring, still, is the fact that, prior to the evolution of resistance, the far more regular and predictable occurrence in populations exposed to antibiotics is extinction of that population. With beneficial consequences for those of us who have found such a population resident within ourselves at one time or another. This is the only reason why it ever makes sense to prescribe antibiotics in the first place: they've succeeded much more often than they've failed. So antibiotic resistance which does not yet exist somehow causes antiobiotic resistance to exist. Like I said: backwards . At least when Plato and Aristotle did this sort of thing, they made no bones about hypostasizing the causes! And if you would be more precise about just what constitutes "" too often"" and "" too fast"" and "" too cause-specific,"" I'd buy this. But right now, it looks like your subjective impression, nothing more. I mean, as to ""too often,"" we are talking about something that fails to happen more often than it does happen (with, as I said, positive consequences for those who have taken antibiotics). As to ""too fast,"" you need to think in terms of generation time. The speed at which bacteria reproduce allows vast numbers of generations in what we would count a relatively short measurement time. And as to ""too cause-specific,"" it's no big mystery. To the extent that they evolve resistance in any way that is useful to them, the bacteria will have to evolve resistance to those antibiotics they really have been and are confronted with. More problematically for your claim, they sometimes evolve resistance not only to specific antibiotics, but to whole related sets of antibiotics. I'm sorry, but now I think you're just being shrill. ""Natural selection"" is a name for a process, like ""Second Law of Thermodynamics."" The entities engaged in that process are real organisms, who really survive and reproduce in real environments, or who really don't do these things. You don't like the name? Fine. Pick another. The rest of us will keep calling it natural selection. As to ""random genetic mutation,"" well, I'm sorry, but it's hardly an invention. ""Random"" is exactly how to describe mutations. Not in the sense that they're uncaused, but in the sense that we cannot precisely when they will happen, or what precisely those effects will be, and in the sense that when they do happen, they don't appear to be directed to any particular end. My point is, when your alleged final causes fail to produce any effects at all -- when the birds of Guam go extinct, for example -- can you explain why? And once you do, will the rate of success prove to be at all different from what the non-teleological theory predicts? Because if it's not, then why should we assume that your teleological version is anything other than a redescription of the phenomena? Not without being ""things,"" they don't. ""Affect"" it? or explain it? The latter doesn't seem to involve hypostasis, but the former certainly does. And I don't object, so long as it's recognized that to speak this way is merely useful shorthand for a process the real agents of which are organisms themselves. Which fact, frankly, I've never found any biologist who used this shorthand to be ignorant of. Except that this ""outcome"" doesn't yet exist in order to ""prompt"" anything! Do you see why I'm saying that final causes necessarily involve hypostases? Plato and Aristotle happily acknowledge this. Except that, when it comes to evolution, individual organisms (with the exception of humans engaged in genetic engineering) cannot select the course of action needed to solve the problem. See my comments on the polar bears. Exactly my point! It produced no effects on them -- so it wasn't a cause . You lost me. I thought we were talking about teleological explanations of evolution , not of the behavior of living organisms as opposed to dead. So I fail to see the point of this comment. Which fails to explain why you didn't win. In the example of the birds of Guam, their failure to adapt is precisely what needs to be explained. And finally, we arrive at your definitional hang-ups again. Selection, as used in biology, does not have the requirement that you set up. You can claim -- according to what seems to be ""linguistic essentialism"" -- that the ""only true and legitimate"" meanings of ""selection"" must involve mental activity and must imply teleology. But with all due respect, you don't get to make that call . No one does. Not even Darwin: if most people had felt the way you feel about the term, it would've fallen into disuse very quickly. Heck, for an example of how little control Darwin himself had, just look at the word ""evolution."" It doesn't appear in the Origin . Yet apparently, that's what Darwin was talking about. I'm sorry, Jakers. But I really don't think your ""teleology!"" criticisms of evolution by natural selection amount to much more than semantics.","intelligent-designs-black-box","11:39 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","98"
"02-03-2009","12214",7,"Matthew","342668","There are three problems with putting things this way. First, the alternative to teleology that you provide should not be ""genetic accident."" It should be ""genetic variation , and natural selection."" I realize that you don't like the term ""natural selection."" But however we name it, the process by which some organisms survive and reproduce more effectively than others works just the same. If you leave it out, you're leaving out the greater part of how the evolutionary process is conceived to work without teleology. Second, that greater part is not remotely as ""chancey"" a process as you make it out to be. Genetic variation is, in some sense, random: we cannot always predict when or how it will occur. But under at least some circumstances, even mutations can be predicted (e.g. irradiation), and in sexually reproducing organisms, recombination leads predictably to variation. In any event, variation need not be a matter of chance for evolution to occur. What's even more important is that the process by which these variations lead to differential survival and reproduction (natural selection) is anything but random. More on this in a bit. Thirdly and finally, this may well be a false dichotomy. It is quite possible that, what looks undirected and contingent from the perspective of natural science may be teleological or even necessary from a philosophical or theological perspective. Possible, but not necessary -- meaning that if one's philosophical or theological metaphysic leads one to presume direction for the process, the natural process is compatible with that, but there is no necessity to that presumption: if one's philosophical or theological metaphysic leads one in the opposite direction, the natural process is compatible with that, too. In either case, the natural process is the same, and it does not indicate whether there is anything teleological going on or not. Do any of those online dictionaries provide multiple definitions for the term? Are any of those definitions introduced with something along the lines of "" Biol. ""? Because that's the case with my hardcover volume. It gives a biological definition, which mirrors that found in the biology textbook I bought a few months ago (when I decided I needed to know more about this stuff (Raven's 8th ed., if you're interested in the specifics)). Biologists have had to be more precise than just saying that an organism is ""suitable"" for its environment, or that it ""fits"" there somehow. The definition in my textbook glossary is that an ""adaptation"" is a feature that enables an organism to survive and reproduce in its environment. An organism is ""adapted"" to its environment to the extent that it has such features. There is nothing teleological or evaluative here. Whether or not organisms survive and reproduce is empirically observable. Whether or not any particular feature is an adaptation can certainly be disputed, and biologists engage in such investigation all the time. The role that the feature plays in enabling survival and reproduction needs to be examined. But again, it can be examined empirically. I grant you, the process by which organisms become ""adapted,"" by which they gain ""adaptations,"" may well be teleological. Or it may not be. And my view is that the non-teleological explanation of genetic variation plus natural selection is sufficient to explain this process. Perhaps why will become clearer as we go. You see, I don't think there's any such thing as a "" true meaning."" Meanings are matters of convention. Moreover, I certainly don't think that there's any link between ""legitimacy"" of meaning and ""original"" meaning. Terms take on new meanings all the time -- because the conventions that govern their usage change. This isn't a ""Humpty Dumpty"" problem, whereby any term mean can be used however one wants it to be used. No individual has control over linguistic meanings. But neither is language use as constrained as this ""original [and only true and legitimate] meaning"" idea indicates. That's simply a bad model of language, because it pays insufficient attention to how language actually works. I think you need to pay more attention to how biologists are using their terms, and stop saying that they're using their terms ""incorrectly.""","jakers","342776","NS is covered by the second part. Besides, what you call ""NS"" is just what happens after actual evolutionary alteration has taken place. All ""NS"" does is change the numbers. Any evolutionary force can create a change in an organism that will change the numbers of that organism and its genes. The issue is--is the force that changes the organism and its genes so that evolution continues strictly a matter of genetic chance, or is some organismic teleology involved. The population fluctuations that follow are merely an after-thought, mostly of interest to those who study ecology and the evolution of ecosystems, not the internal evolution of specific lifeforms. Irradiation is usually telic, not accidental, but where it is accidental, it is random, and predicting that an accident will cause damage to that which is involved is no great scientific feat. We are supposed to be discussing 'accidents' that not only do not damage anything, but actually make things much better. I've seen natural mechanisms produce serendipitously beneficial results, but I've never seen a random accidental one-off event that ever did that. Variation in and of itself is not evolution. Only an increase in variation is evolution. Well, I may not have followed your reasoning, but in case of 'science', I do not start , a priori, from a metaphysical premise and then look for 'facts' that I can mould to suit my expectations. Where I see evolution taking place today, and I do see it, there is always first a shift in environment, and then a fairly rapid change in physiology and behaviour to suit the novel environment. This observed rapidity and specificity screams, ""Non-random!!"". I clicked answers.com. This is what I got and it seems right to me. ""v., adapted, adapting, adapts. v.tr. To make suitable to or fit for a specific use or situation. v.intr. To become adapted: a species that has adapted well to winter climes. [Middle English adapten, from Latin adaptre : ad-, ad- + aptre, to fit (from aptus, fitting; see apt).] adaptedness adapt'edness n. SYNONYMS adapt, accommodate, adjust, conform, fit, reconcile. These verbs mean to make suitable to or consistent with a particular situation or use: adapted themselves to city life; can't accommodate myself to the new requirements; adjusting their behavior to the rules; conforming her life to accord with her moral principles; fitting the punishment to the crime; couldn't reconcile his reassuring words with his hostile actions. ANTONYM unfit"" I have no problem with that. I should hope that it would be examined empirically, or it wouldn't be science. It would a mythic tail made up to 'explain' stuff, like, why polar bears are white, or why penguins can't fly, but bats can.Without empirical argument you get the children's tales made famo9us by Rudyard Kipling's ""Just So"" stories, wherein, for instance, a crodile once seized the short trunk of an elephant and in the ensuing struggle, stretched it to its present length. I consider the ""random genetic mutation"" causal force driving evolution to be one of the more recent ""Just So"" stories. Well, you're not alone in your belief. over the past 80+ years almost the entire educated population on the planet has been converted to the faith. Alas, I lost my faith in the ""random genetic mutation"" fable several years ago. That is exactly what a ""true"" meaning is--one that conforms to convention, so that when two or people use it, they all give it the same agreed-upon meaning. If someone comes along and says to me, ""Well, unlike you ordinary folks, when me and my friends use this word, it no longer means what you think it means, it means what we say it means."", that's dishonest, and it ticks me off. Re-read what I just said. I did not say what you are saying I said. Sure. By common consent. Not by self-serving diktat. Unfortunately in the 150 years since ""Origins"", so many words have been distorted and misused for so long by people in a position to push their own agenda, that ordinary people have unconsciously accepted the junk that they were so carefully taught. That's why you'll often find corrupt usages of words from the glossary of evolution now accepted, in many dictionaries/glossaries, especially those written for the subject, as if they were legitimate. It's sort of a variation on the theme of, ""Tell an outrageous lie often enough, it becomes some, even most, people's truth."" Goebbels[sp?] did that in Nazi Germany. I don't believe that I put it the way you think I put it, but if I did, I meant the way I put it earlier, above. I think the word I used was ""illegitimately"". Illegitimate because they want evolution to back-up their a priori metaphysical assumption that the universe is materialist, mechanical, and ateleological. It is illegitimate to use teleological words and expressions in an attempt to prove that evolution is not teleological. If you are arguing for a mechanical reality, with no teleology, then leave out the teleological language and stick to words that do not imply awareness and intent, intelligence and willpower. If you cannot do that, then itv is simply because that is not what reality is. The fault lies with your philosophy, not the English language.

I think that the current paradigm is vacuous, but I would prefer to ignore it than than to debate it, but that apparently, is all that anyone here wants to discuss. [You:]Thus, to me, teleology is part of an Aristotelian tradition of causation, that is his 'final cause'. [Me:]Yes, I'm quite familiar with Aristotle.

And another important thing you're missing is... ...that these changes in gene frequencies across whole populations do not change by ""chance!"" That's the entire point of natural selection. You keep leaving this part out, which is the only reason you can characterize this is a contrast between chance or teleology. See? There you go again. You ignore half the story, by leaving out any mention of how natural selection works. More than half actually, since ""genetic mutation"" is merely a subset of genetic variation, and since genetic variation need not be ""random"" in order for natural selection to occur. But why quibble? If you're going to leave out any consideration of how natural selection works anyway, the game is lost before it starts. Give me a break. If that's so, then all use of technical language -- a phenomenon in which we philosophers have been known to indulge from time to time -- would be ""dishonest."" Plato, for example, would never have been to use ""eidos"" or ""morphe"" as terms in his own metaphysics. And the conventions of use don't necessarily pre-exist the terms, which is how neologism happens. (How much of our philosophical vocabulary can be traced to the terminological inventiveness of Aristotle? Among others, of course.) Somebody proposes a novel term, or a novel use of a term. Other people see the point and use it that way too, or they don't and they don't. There's nothing insidious about the process. It's just a part of how languages change over time. But you yourself simply refuse to discuss the matter if its not in terms of teleological ordinary language. As soon as someone wants to deal with the problem in terms of molecular biology and population genetics, you (erroneously) declare that has nothing to do with organismic evolution and won't discuss it. Insofar as you refuse to talk about how genes work, either at the molecular level or in populations, then you are not talking about biological evolution. I realize that you think you are, but you're not. Again you leave out the important part. Again! ""Ignoring it"" hardly indicates that you're correct to think that paradigm ""vacuous."" All it proves is that you have no interest in even trying to understand it. First, I did not say that Aristotle, or anyone else, imputed ""volition"" to stones and flames. Just ""purposes."" Presumably you think hammers and teeth have purposes without volition, so this does not strike me as controversial. Second, you did not initially say ""Aristotle."" You said ""an Aristotelian tradition ."" I therefore assumed that you were including various Aristotelian thinkers other than Aristotle himself -- including, rather pertinently, medieval theologians who explained all natural phenomena with reference to God's purposes. (Not, of course, to those purposes alone, but they were conceived to be a necessary portion of the explanations of natural phenomena.) But third, as to Aristotle himself anyway, I guess I had in mind the opening of Physics IV.8 (214b14): ""If each of the simple bodies has a natural locomotion, e.g. fire upward and earth downward and towards the middle of the universe...."" Now, while it might be thought that I am construing the ""naturalness"" of said locomotion in too teleological and purposive terms, there are more than ample reasons for thinking not. See for example Physics II.8 (198b10): ""We must explain then first why nature belongs to the class of causes which act for the sake of something...."" Or see the discussion of weather that follows, the point of which is made by 199a1-8 or so: ""We do not ascribe to chance or mere coincicence the frequency of rain in winter, but frequent rain in summer we do; nor heat in summer but only if we have it in winter. If then, it is agreed that things are either the result of coincidence or for the sake of something, and these cannot be the result of coincidence or spontaneity, it follows that they must be for the sake of something; and that such things are all due to nature even the champions of the theory which is before us [viz., a rejection of teleology] would agree. Therefore action for an end is present in things which come to be and are by nature."" As to the specifics, I doubt very strongly that Aristotle imputes volition or any other mental activity to the weather. Nonetheless, he finds meteorological (or perhaps climatological) phenomena to have final causes. For as to the general point, he finds everything in nature to have final causes. All the monotheists (Judaic, Christian, and Islamic) in his ""tradition of causation"" had to do was attribute the purposes of inanimate natural objects to the mind of God. (Or was that ""the psyche?""... ) So I hardly think my comment was much of a stretch. Further discussion of the point would be off-topic here, though we could take it to the philosophy section if you like. But somehow I doubt we're going to find too much to disagree about concerning whether Aristotle thought there was purpose in nature.","intelligent-designs-black-box","07:34 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","104"
"02-05-2009","12214",7,"jakers","342624","Or, in this case, after they have been changed to be out of sync with the normal state of affairs, which has not changed. I believe that with bacteria it's called 'reverse' or 'revertant' mutation? It is not accidental, but an actual mechanism. Anything that happens with a dependable, predictable regularity, is not random. Actually, it is a plain statement of fact that any event, including a genetic mutation, that can be depended upon to generate a particular enzyme at a regular, predictable, rate, cannot be called defective or unreliable. It cannot be called 'random'. The mere fact that the Luria-Delbruck experiment, and others like it, have been repeated thousands of times, always with the same predictable outcome, is proof enough that the event and the outcome are not matters of chance, stochastic, accident. And ponder this--if it were not a mechanical regularity developed as a defense mechanism over millions of generations, why does that experiment and others like it fail miserably when some truly original antibiotic is first used on batches of unexposed microbes for the first time? Let's see, in terms of being resisistant , bacteria score, --Luria-Delbruck, 100% success every time; brand new antibiotic, 100% failure, every time. Nothing random here.","Peeling","342955","Some experiments are indeed conducted to examine reversion rates, mainly because of the degree of control it affords the experimenter. Others are not, and the results are the same either way. As for your latter claim, that such mutations cannot be random because of their 'dependable, predictable regularity' - we're really going to have to sort that out before we can go any further. I propose we hold the parts of your response not directly related to this in abeyance until we reach agreement, at which point I'll come back and deal with them point-by-point. So, what is the real nature of this 'dependable, predictable regularity' of which you speak? It is the dependability of a die showing a six if it rolls a thousand times. It is the predictability of being dealt an ace if you play a thousand hands. It is the statistical inevitability of a low-probability event occurring, given a number of opportunities that dwarfs its improbability. Well, that's very interesting, because harmful mutations occur with exactly the same kind and degree of regularity and predictability - so they must be deliberate teleological acts too! What you call a plain statement of fact is nothing of the sort. There is a small but finite chance of any given single-step mutation occurring to any given bacterium during, for instance, cell division - a chance which can be increased via environmental mutagens, be they chemicals or UV light. In even modest colonies those tiny odds are overwhelmed by the number of opportunities for those mutations to occur, and from that arises the 'dependability' of there being at least one mutant of type 'X' already in the population when the environment changes in its favour. If the colony is very small, the outcome is far less dependable. There's nothing irrational about this, it's not a 'just so' story, you can't hand-wave it away. It's proof of nothing of the sort. The events are stochastic, while the outcome is statistically predictable because of the number of opportunities for the event to occur. This is just basic maths. The L&D experiment takes it a step further, settling the question of whether the events occur before or after the environmental change. Once again you are badly mistaken. First of all, individual bacteria aren't 'resistant' or 'not' to antibiotic chemicals. Rather they have a tolerance level: a maximum concentration in their environment with which they can coexist - and this applies to even the most novel antibiotics. Within any given population of bacteria, some will have higher tolerance levels and some will have lower, thanks to genetic variance. Antibiotics are developed by discovering chemicals to which the pre-existing range of tolerance levels is low, possibly because higher tolerance levels incur some sort of performance penalty - natural selection at work as usual. That's why it's so important for antibiotics to be administered carefully, at the right dosage and at the right time. A high enough dose will wipe out all the bacteria because none of them can tolerate that concentration of the drug. Resistant strains arise, not because the bacteria have been given time to 'figure it out', but when drugs are administered either improperly or too routinely. In the former scenario the concentration of the drug is low enough for the most naturally tolerant bacteria to survive and reproduce - and without competition from their more efficient low-tolerance bretheren, they can flourish, representing the new median level of tolerance, with further genetic variation around that point. If a high enough second dose can be applied without killing the patient, the situation can be remedied, but if care is not taken a strain can arise that is tolerant to all non-patient-lethal doses of that drug. In the latter scenario, routine administration of antibiotics, in livestock particularly, purely and simply increases the odds of the antibiotic being encountered by a very low-probability high-tolerance variant - which will then, instead of being out-competed and vanishing as it would do in the absence of the antibiotic, thrive in the wake of the devastation wrought by the drug. The reason the L&D experiment works 'every time' for the bacteria (with chemical antibiotics anyway) is that the experimenters aren't actually trying to kill all the bacteria, which they easily could do with a massive dose. Instead they run the fluctuation test at carefully chosen concentrations of antibiotic to determine the rate at which mutants emerged - stochastically and prior to exposure - capable of tolerating those levels. The original L&D experiment employed a bacteriophage as an antibiotic, to which resistance can be, IIRC, an all-or-nothing affair, in some cases mediated by the shape of a particular surface protein the phage connects to, triggering the injection of its payload. The result however was exactly the same: mutants appearing stochastically prior to exposure during colony growth. I hope that clears a few things up, so we can get back on track.","intelligent-designs-black-box","08:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","105"
