"01-21-2009","12214",3,"jakers","340826","It does not follow that because I know that you have expressed yourself incorrectly or illegitimately that I also know what you 'really meant'. All you have to do is avoid words that necessarily imply or denote awareness and intention on the part of the subject, whenever/wherever that subject is not a living or sentient entity. Like the man says, ""It's not rocket science!"" Unlike children, we cannot ascribe awareness, volition, judgement, and all the rest, to a toy soldier or plastic doll. That's what I call animism, I cannot allow you to do it with molecules, processes, genes, and the like. Not if you refuse to accept the dictionary definition, but the word in question needs to be defined or all discussion comes to a grinding halt! Without a mutually acceptable definition for intelligence we have absolutely no way of discussing 'intelligent',-- nor 'design', come right down to it. Then let us proceed on the basis that 'design' is always and everywhere, teleological, i.e., 'intelligent'. Since that fact doesn't matter to you. Now all you have to do is show that complex processes that produce or serve someone's or something's purposes, that accomplish the ends of that which is external to themselves, can arise by mechanics plus chance in cases where that something is inanimate and insentient. Such as in the case of a 'gene', a 'molecule' or 'evolution', per se. I have no recollection of ever refused to allow any discussion of insentient articles, particles, or processes in _ateleological_, i.e., in mechanical terms. I do not believe that I have ever done so, but if I did, I did not mean to do so, and simply made a slip of the tongue. Can you quote the statement wherein I am supposed to have made this error, back to me? I will thank you for it. If you are implying some kind of mechanistic determinism between 'matter', as in molecules, and 'form', as in the actual organism as an operating system, then I simply have to refuse to accept your assumption. Which brings the debate back to another screeching halt. I do not believe that 'building materials' determine what actually gets built. You can claim that in one particular instance the 'laws' of mechanics [or chance] independently determine a certain form, and that that form determines a particular function. I have no way of knowing whether or not that claim is true. Therefore that path is closed to us. This is what I was afraid of. What, exactly, are you referring to when you use the word, ""sequence""?!? Are you trying to slip it into the discussion as if it were synonymous with the word 'system', or even 'process'? Because it it is not, and I will not accept it as such. This is what the noun, 'sequence' means-- Well, I guess that is why we are at cross-purposes, since it is obvious to me that whatever ""Intelligent Design Theory"" you are referring to, it is not my own understanding of intelligence and design at work in the evolutionary process. Now, since I am not going to pick up Dembski's banner, you'll have to look elsewhere for an opponent, since the purpose of your thread was and is to attack his opinions, and not the concept of ""Evolution by means of Intelligent Design"", in general.","Peeling","341115","When you go so far as to suggest corrections - yes, it does No, it isn't. It's just unecessarily time-consuming, given that this discussion isn't about teleology. You seem think the only question that matters is whether the process of evolution is teleological or not, but that isn't the exact subject in hand. Well, since I'm not, and you know full well I'm not, what's the problem? If I may say so, you seem awfully eager for that to happen On the contrary. We have no need to thrash out a priori definitions because my basic argument is a posteriori : there exist problems that intelligence is of little or no help in solving. Equivalently, there are problems no design process can reduce. I really don't. In a completely different discussion, sure, but not this one. I'm only touching upon that issue to correct some fairly major misconceptions you have about evolutionary processes. Here you go: and: In response to these objections, I pointed out that simulations of the interacting molecules in question, employing only known physical forces, mirrored their behaviour in real organisms. Dont fret so much! The 'sequence' in question is the sequence of base pairs in a DNA strand, which determines the sequence of amino acids in the protein derived from that strand, the chemical interactions between which determine how it folds and therefore its stable three-dimensional shape. A shape which - even if we suppose it doesn't determine the nature of its interactions with other molecules in the organism - is demonstrably vital for those interactions to proceed as they do. True enough. I'm not completely sure what your understanding is at this stage, but one thing seems clear: you do treat teleology as a magic bullet. It's never occurred to you to wonder what its limitations might be, in terms of the problems it can reduce (ie help solve). Well, yes and no. The OP highlights a specific problem with the concept of CSI, how it's measured, and why CSI cannot be assumed to be a marker for intelligent design. And it does so quite straightforwardly by demonstrating that there are problems requiring a solution of modest CSI that intelligence is of no practical help in solving. But a corollary of this is the more general observation that intelligence is not always useful, and I think that does speak to your opinions on the subject. I'll respond to the rest ASAP.","intelligent-designs-black-box","10:30 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","32"
"01-22-2009","12214",3,"jakers","341015","I know that an organism's development is not a separate and distinct organism, per se. I know that that it is a part of every organism, that it is an essential property of all organisms. To suggest otherwise, that a 'developmental process' can be examined as if it were more than simply one part of being an organism, is playing with semantics. Excuse me for my ignorance, but I have no idea what ""WEP-key problem"" is. I don't even know what the the WEP-Key is, let alomne what is problematical about it, let alone how in any way it makes the plausibility of the necessity of intelligent design in the creation of a sophisticated 'key/lock system' somehow dubious or suspect. (Would you consider yourself legitimately proven wrong if we employed a language devoid of teleological terms in our discussion, forcing you to lose) Of course, if what we were discussing was part of any reality in which teleology was absent. But since that is not our reality, nor even a part of our reality, your hypothetical is impertinent to our discussion. Yes, if you are asking me if Pi has been 'described accurately', or not. No one said anything about describing anything perfectly, completely, and absolutely. Until they do, 'defining' something and 'describing it accurately' are effectively synonymous. I pointed out that ... there is _no necessary connection_ between semantic expressions and true meanings Trying to discuss biological evolution without speaking in teleological terms is, I suspect, impossible. So either evolution is a teleological biological process, as I suspect, or you are going to have a brutal semantic task on your hands. ( Using the term 'target' in a teleologically agnostic context) ""Teleologically agnostic""?!? In a debate over teleology is or is not present in biological evolution!?! I have no idea how you can claim that intelligent design is irrelevant to any understanding of complexity in systematics, language, biology, or any other context in which complex specified information is generated. As I've said, the farther you get from a simple 'either/or', yes or no', 'heads or tails' problem, the greater the degree of teleology necessary to effect any satisfactory solution to a problem. Well, I do not know what their ""criteria"" are nor do I know what they mean by ""convergence"" wrt to evolution or the generation of complex specified information. So until someone explains that to me, and I evaluate that information, I can make no comment upon it. The whole point of simplification is to eliminate the time and energy necessary to the consideration of impertinent possibilities. The 'solver' must first limit his 'search space' to solutions that are recognisably pertinent to the problem at hand. On the contrary, no non-designer could ever find that 'solution', because a/, no non-designer would know that there was any 'problem' in the first place, or any 'good/better/best solution to that unrecognised problem. Therefore the problem, and its solution, would both arise and disappear again, unremarked and unpreserved. An effective 'dimple', would, over the long term, have no more effect than an ineffective dimple, as, over time, 'dimples arise and vanish, randomly, as any 'non-designer'. The problem with your 'genetics' scenario is that it depends upon the belief that any accidental change in any gene necessarily, mechanically, determines a change in organic outcome. The change can be significant or insignificant, positive or negative, in terms of well-being of the organism, or rather, it's off-spring. IOW, the mutation is totally irrelevent to the well-being of the organism. It matters not whether that organism is doing well or is faced with a problem, since any random change forced upon it mechanically by an accidental change in the shape of a genetic molecule is impertinent to any state of affairs, whatsoever. Therefore, where there is no problem, but a great big 'solution to the non-problem' is created, then a great big problem is created. Or, if there is a great big complex problem, and the accident forces an impertinent change upon the organism, that problem doesn't get solved. The only time a random, non-teleological change in a molecule is going to effect a complex change in an organism that is positive for that organism, is a matter of pure chance. And unless it is wondrous lucky, wherever there is a serious problem in effect, there is little hope that random chance genetic mutation will suddenly, for no reason at all, produce an effective solution to that immediate problem. And that is a very serious problem for any organism that wants to go living and produce offspring that can thrive in a world where random chance is forever bringing up new complex problems. Heck, it would be just as much a problem in a world where the environment never randomly generates new complex problems, because it means that mechanically, an organism is forced to change randomly in a world that never does. This is not problem-solving. This is problem-creating. To coin a phrase, if you are not part of the solution [teleology], then you are a part of the problem. The problem with your 'genetics' scenario is that it depends upon the belief that any accidental change in any gene necessarily, mechanically, determines a change in organic outcome. The change can be significant or insignificant, positive or negative, in terms of well-being of the organism, or rather, it's off-spring. IOW, the mutation is totally irrelevent to the well-being of the organism. It matters not whether that organism is doing well or is faced with a problem, since any random change forced upon it mechanically by an accidental change in the shape of a genetic molecule is impertinent to any state of affairs, whatsoever. Therefore, where there is no problem, but a great big 'solution to the non-problem' is created, then a great big problem is created. Or, if there is a great big complex problem, and the accident forces an impertinent change upon the organism, that problem doesn't get solved. Wrong. This is not a 'feed-back' mechanism. This is a mechanical sorting mechanism, and it would apply no matter what, in every situation of every kind. In and of itself it contributes nothing to the solution of problems, it simply 'marks the exam papers'; something that can be done mechanically, as in sorting large eggs from small. I don't see why if they they did not 'need' to do it, why they would ever do it all. Like it or not, all of the lifeforms I've observed, unlike say, falling rocks, seem to have a built-in 'need to do it', i.e., to survive, to prosper, to carry on their identity further along in time. (Adding a second random walk, with the 'most successful' trial propagating into both slots in the next generation) I cannot believe that, in fact you will have any 'success', since both 'random walks' suffer from the same liability as the single 'seed' random walk, above. At best, you will only require half of eternity to achieve 'success'. (Suppose success was not binary, but the number of matching digits) Matching digits are not binary, by definition?!? Any kind of 'ratchet', or constraining mechanism based upon a 'value' criterion is teleological. As I pointed out earlier, 'best' is a value judgment, hence a teleological term. Their personal awareness of any goal, as in the case of abstract digits, is irrelevant. What is pertinent is the personal awareness, and goal, of the digit shuffler who intelligently designed a tool, a digital 'ratchet', in order to input teleology into the process. This is ridiculous. If recognising is essential to design, and it is, then you cannot speak of 'design' without 'recognition'. I could never recognise success if I had no idea of what i was looking for, and I certainly would not try everything and anything that popped out of the box if the box had had not been pre-loaded with pertinent possibilities only. How can there be 'self-replication' without a sense of 'self'? And how can their be simple 'replication' with an ability to recognise and distinguish 'same' from 'different'? As above, the teleology is only necessary and present in the generation of positive solutions to immediate problems. Sorry? What was it that you described that I agreed was inevitable? My memory isn't what it once was. But, as I've tried to make plain, differential reproduction rates ['fitness'] is not what I'm talking about when I speak of intelligent design. I disagree. I can't see where they have anything to do with evolution per se. For instance, the differential reproductive rates of both rabbits and cane toads has soared in Australia, without either organ evolving even a little bit.","Peeling","341238","I disagree. It's highly imprecise and misleading to talk about 'organisms evolving'. Your irises do not evolve open and closed in response to light. Your muscles do not evolve in response to the demands of exercise. And when my parents got together and produced my unique genetic makeup, there is no meaningful sense in which I as an organism could be said to have evolved, since my genetic makeup has never been anything other than it is now. To take the latter misconception first: there is nothing implausible about an intelligent designer constructing a sophisticated key-and-lock system. However, what happens when an intelligent designer finds himself faced with a problem equivalent to finding the right key for a sophisticated lock? Especially if he doesn't know at the start whether there even is one. This problem was explained in my original post: I'm thinking of a number between 0 and 340 billion billion billion billion. What is it? Obviously you can't answer with any meaningful chance of being right. ID theorists - including yourself - invoke teleology as a magic bullet to make all problems solvable. Intelligence understands purpose, it has goals, etc etc. In which case, if I tell you that the number in question is the WEP-key (the encryption key) for the wireless router in my house, and that I will give you that house if you can tell me what the key is - does that help? Whyever not? You know the purpose of the number; you have a goal and the motivation to accomplish it - why isn't your teleology helping? So you claim it wouldn't be fair to discuss the presence or absence of teleology in evolution using a language devoid of teleological terms because evolution is teleological. That's circular reasoning. A perfectly and completely and absolutely appropriate response to which is 'pull the other one, it's got bells on'. Fine; I'll go along with that. If '3' can be an 'accurate description' of Pi, then words with telic undertones can 'accurately describe' the behaviour of ateleological phenomena - we'll just call the discrepancy rounding error. So your ability to employ telic terms in connection with evolution has no implications for it truly being teleological. Phew! I'm glad that's sorted out. For a while there I thought you were saying something quite different: which suggested to me you did believe semantic expression had a necessary connection with true meaning. Clearly my bad. But as I keep saying, this isn't any such debate. Nor was the word 'target' even used in the specific context of biological evolution. As I said right from the outset, it's a term referring to a subset of a space. The space could be 'stones' and the target set could be 'stones smaller than a centimeter across', and we could be investigating whether a given mechanical filter could discriminate between members and non-members of that target set, and could therefore have produced the pile of small stones we just found. Or, it could be that the target set comprises solutions to a problem we're desperately trying to solve, and we're trying to find an algorithm that will locate those solutions so we can save the world. Like I said: teleologically agnostic. I made no such claim. What I said was is that all you want to talk about is whether a given process is teleological or not, whereas the discussion is about the degree to which a process can reduce a given problem. And with the greatest of respect you are as wrong now as when you first made that claim The trouble is, you're hung up on the complexity of the observed solution (or phenomenon) and you're ignoring the topology of the problem space that surrounds it. That's what your argument needs to address. The complexity of the solution is all but irrelevant. Counter-intuitive, perhaps, but true nonetheless. I provided criteria necessary and sufficient for an evolutionary process to converge in my earlier post. Convergence here means to approach and/or enter a subset of a space. I'm aware of that What I'm trying to make you see is that you're assuming such a simplification would not exclude solutions (or indeed the only solution). It's all very well waving your hands and saying that a teleological agent would avoid doing that, but how? What can he do? If the solution is as isolated and all-or-nothing as large values of CSI supposedly indicate, what guarantee do you have that an abstraction of the problem exists to significantly reduce the problem space without wrongly excluding the solution? Does such an abstraction exist to help you find my 128-bit number? No. So straight away you assume that the problem can be simplified. What if it can't? CSI, if correctly measured, is indicative of irreducibly complex problems with isolated solutions. Not if the problem is 'how to self-replicate'. Or indeed 'how to self-replicate more effectively than other things consuming the same resources'. You've already admitted that differential reproductive rates - colloquially known as survival of the fittest - are a fact; a tautology; inevitable. Yet here you are, denying a tautology. What is abundant representation in the gene pool if not preservation ? Again, not if the dimple contributes to improved self-replication. The effective dimple will, inarguably, prevail and remain while others fail and disappear. Of course, I'm not trying to argue that evolution could produce such a thing (it couldn't), merely that a designer couldn't either. Thus measuring high-CSI solutions in nature is no way to find evidence of design. You said right at the start that genetics aren't really your bag, so I hope you won't be offended if I tell you that what you've said here is wrong in every important respect. Let's take it step by step. Yes and no. If the same genetic change occurs in very similar organisms, the consequences (in terms of changes to the organism) are demonstrably similar. If the same gene changes in the same way in very different organisms, the consequences may be different (but often aren't, hence genetic engineering). So context is important. This much is true in that the 'fitness' of an organism is relative to its environment rather than any absolute scale, but it's such a catastrophic oversimplification as to be utterly misleading. In a given organism, some mutations (such as one that disrupts RNA-protein translation) are negative in pretty much every imaginable environment, while many others prove neutral or mildly negative in some environments while being hugely beneficial in others. Failing to recognise that leads to your first categorically false statement: You've taken something that's true (the effect of a given mutation on organismic fitness is not determined purely by the mutation or the organism to which it occurs), and twisted that into a falsehood (the effect of a given mutation on organismic fitness is random ). The effect of a given mutation on organismic fitness is context dependent. That's not the same as random. This is both false and irrelevant. First, mutations can be neutral or nearly-neutral in one environment and strongly beneficial or detrimental in another. Second (and we're talking about bacteria here for the most part), even if a given mutation does induce a reproductive disadvantage in the current environment, if it crops up often enough it will be present somewhere in the population if and when the environment changes. The proof of this was the fluctuation test developed in the middle of the last century (you might want to acquaint yourself with the details), which demonstrated the stochastic occurrence of antibiotic resistance in a flask of bacteria prior to antibiotic exposure. If you have a hundred billion bacteria, a one-in-ten-million mutation that happens to confer antibiotic resistance will appear in the population thousands of times over in a single generation, all the time, 24/7 - along with mutations making the organism more thermophillic or phobic, acid-loving or hating, even capable of digesting nylon waste products. If an antibiotic or a hotter or colder or more or less acidic environment is never encountered, or nylon isn't going to be invented for another million years - well, tough. Sucks to be a mutant. True. But your belief that evolution is teleological and therefore organismic has made you fixated on the fortunes of the organism rather than the species. Plus, you're stuck in the mindset that evolution has to respond to change; you're imagining a problem occurring and then a lucky mutation striking to make everything better. That can and does happen, so long as the organisms are able to continue living and breeding, albeit less well, after the change, but it is just as possible that a pertinent variation already exists somewhere within the gene pool. This is not merely conjecture; it is a repeatable observation of fact. Well, for one thing any feedback mechanism operating without a teleological agent would have to take the form of a tautology. It must be something inevitable - because otherwise it would need somebody to set it up and make it happen. You are pointing out a strength in my argument, not a weakness. For another, you're playing with semantics again without addressing what's actually happening. If I ran a simulation, scored self-replicators on how abundantly they reproduced in a single generation, and then seeded the next run of the simulation with corresponding quantities of those self-replicators, you'd happily call that a feedback process because a teleological agent (me) was involved. Even though I'm not contributing anything! The self-replicators are already doing 'my job' for me. Incorrect. If the 'problem' in question had only a yes/no solution, get it perfectly right and survive, otherwise perish, you would be right to say that differential reproductive rates could contribute nothing to the solution. But in that case, nor could teleology. Disagree? Then what's my router's WEP-key? Imagine your life depended upon knowing it, if that helps Differential reproductive rates (DRR) bias the otherwise stochastic search. Only if success is all-or-nothing, or resources were unlimited (population can expand freely forever) would DRR have no effect. Let me answer your question with a question: if you have a bunch of self-replicators, and some of them operate in a way that could be interpreted as a desire to survive and thrive, and some of them don't, whose descendants do you think you're going to encounter if you come back in a million years or so? Next up, the WEP-key problem. We're in agreement right from the start that a single 'random walk' of a 128-digit number is going to take effectively forever to reach a particular unrelated 128-digit number. Absolutely correct - if 'success' is purely yes/no. In that case, the two random walks operate strictly in parallel - halving the expected time to 'half of eternity'. Sorry; too much 'binary' going on What I mean to say is, what if the feedback was not just 'yes, all 128 digits correct' or 'no', but a scalar value of the number of matching digits in the trial. So instead of the two trials just generating (no, no) ad nauseam, they generate, for instance, (64, 65). Now the next generation consists of two variations on the second guess, the one that scored 65. The next score might then be (66,64), and so on. Statistically, the equilibrium point of this mechanism is 96 matching digits, which is the point at which it becomes equally likely that both next-gen trials will be worse as for one of them to be better. More seeds push the equilibrium point up, such that with a hundred seeds the optimal solution comes within the scope of the stochastic variation. Oh, absolutely. This is very much a teleological illustration. In almost every circumstance, you are right. Certainly in this illustration of evolutionary processes at work, 'best' is a contrivance. However... The 'best' self-replicator is an objective, quantitative measurement of fact. No telic agent is required to offer an opinion: the best self-replicator is the one that reproduced most abundantly. A ratchet in which the bias arises inevitably via differential rates of self-replication does not require a telic middle-man. Not in the case of self-replicators. As we noted before, a telic agent actively seeking the best self-replicator by scoring variants on how abundantly they replicate and seeding the next generation accordingly, is contributing absolutely nothing to the process. He may as well not be there. The process will produce better and better self-replicators all on its own, without anyone having to want it to happen. True - but you can speak of recognition without design. You referred to a process involving pure recognition as 'intelligent design'. It wasn't design. The intelligence is not in control of what solution emerges, and (as other contributors have pointed out) it may not even understand how the solution works. In what sense has the intelligence designed a solution he doesn't understand? The point of this thread in a nutshell Oh dear, more semantics. You want me to stop using the word 'self' now? Ok, you tell me what legitimate term I should use for a mechanism whose activity results in the existence of duplicate mechanisms. I don't know where you're getting this from. Whoever said anything about recognising or distinguishing same from different? But evolution doesn't necessitate the generation of positive solutions to immediate problems. Evolution can progress perfectly well via the accretion of variety prior to the emergence of problems (or opportunities). The feedback effect of self-replication. I understand that. But differential reproductive rates are pertinent to the uninformed comments you made about the impossibility of ateleological processes yielding complex solutions - so I undertook a slight detour to correct you. Um. No. Their numbers have soared. DRR generally refers to relative reproductive rates between variants of the same species sharing a pool of resources. Sorry if this is all getting a bit long-winded, but there's a lot to cover.","intelligent-designs-black-box","07:48 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","33"

Nothing you've said to this point has had anything to do with how teleology works. But if you'll allow me the teleological device that children call, '20 questions', and you'll answer me truthfully, I might be able to locate it, this way-- You have a number between 1 and [any number, but 1 billion, let's say]. I ask-Is it greater than 500 million? No, says you. Is it greater than 250million? No. Is it greater than 120 million? Yes. Is it greater than 190 million? Yes. Is it Is it greater than 220 million? No. And so on, until by eliminating half the possibilities per answer, I eventually arrive at your chosen number. That's teleology.","Peeling","341401","Yikes - I sincerely apologise! Mocking was not my intention. 'Magic bullet', to me at least, is a term like 'red herring' or 'strawman': it applies to any explanation invoked without sufficiently close consideration of its plausibility. Just as one can point out a strawman argument without intending offence, I believed the same to be the case with 'magic bullet'. Sorry. Hmm. That does make this conversation considerably more difficult A router is the thing connected to your phone line that allows your computer to access the internet. A wireless router connects to your computer, well, wirelessly, via a broadcast signal. In order to prevent other equipment listening in, the information sent between router and computer is encoded using a WEP-key - a large binary number - known only to those two pieces of equipment. Not at all. It is simply an example of a particular kind of problem-space, one which in which the usefulness of intelligence in locating a solution is minimal. Not much better than a purely random search, in fact. Its purpose here in this thread is to demonstrate that the usefulness of intelligence depends on the problem . In short, if we observe a complex solution without understanding the true nature of the problem space in which it lay, we cannot simply make assumptions about the degree to which intelligent design would have helped in locating that solution. Ah, but that's not adding teleology to the mix. You've possessed that from the moment I posed the question, and you can't answer it. What you're doing is drastically changing the topology of the problem space, changing the results you get from each trial from ""Yes/No"" to ""Lower/Higher"". You're saying, in effect, that you can't solve the problem I've presented, but you can solve a different one. Which is great - so long as biology only ever presents an intelligent designer with nice, reducible problem spaces like the one you propose we switch to using. Do you have any evidence to support that?","intelligent-designs-black-box","10:23 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","40"

I would guess that in a more relevant scenario, the only difference is time - and that, we have plenty of.","Peeling","341409","I think jakers would say - and I agree - that both are ID, just different methodologies. After all, you deliberately chose a feedback mechanism that would cause the system to converge on the desired answer, rather than one of the many that wouldn't. Literally the only exception to the requirement for teleology in a feedback mechanism is in the case of self-replication-with-mutation leading to better self-replicators, because 1) 'better' and 'worse' self-replication refers to an objective quantity, not a value judgement, and 2) self-replication also short-circuits the telic agent's job of biasing the next generation toward the most successful members of the last generation.","intelligent-designs-black-box","10:39 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","41"
"01-24-2009","12214",3,"jakers","341517","Here on planet earth we know that causation can be accidental, mechanical, or teleological.","Matthew","341577","I, for one, am not at all sure that we ""know"" causation can be teleological. I think Nietzsche was right: teleological explanations (of natural phenomena, at least) confuse causes and effects. Take birds, for example. They did not evolve wings because an ideal capacity for flight caused their forelimbs to develop in certain ways. Rather, it was the development of birds' forelimbs that caused them to gain a real capacity for flight. Or go back to that example in the article Trebor cited about scientists making indefinitely replicating RNA. Some of the mutated strains of RNA became numerically dominant over others in the mixture. But this isn't because dominance was a telos that caused the ultimately dominant strains to mutate as they did. It's because the particular ways they mutated caused them to dominate. Both outcomes can be explained perfectly well in mechanistic terms. There is no need to invoke teleology in order to explain how they came about. I hasten to add, this doesn't mean that teleology is impossible, just that it is unnecessary. As theologian John Haught points out, the question ""Why is the water on the stove boiling?"" could be answered in terms of molecular motion or in terms of my desire to have a cup of tea, and neither answer excludes the other. But as he also points out, only one of those answers is scientific. And so I hasten to add further, I'm not sure what adding teleology into the sciences would clarify. If we construe, say, birds' wings as purposefully designed, this just seems to imply all sorts of unanswerable questions about their designer's purposes. E.g. why give birds wings, but not amphibians? why give some birds wings, but not the capacity for flight? etc. Perhaps I'm just overly pessimistic about the possibility for finding answers to such questions, but I don't think so. Or perhaps I'm missing your point on this thread entirely.","intelligent-designs-black-box","05:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","45"
