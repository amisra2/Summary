"01-13-2009","12214",1,"None","None","None","Peeling","340052","I had what I consider an interesting idea the other day - although of course your mileage may vary. I've posted it on a couple of pro-ID forums, attracting views but no replies. Obviously no significance can be attached to that, but it does rather leave me with nobody to talk to. So I'll post it here. By way of a preface, here is Intelligent Design Theory's premise in a nutshell: 1. We know there is such a thing as intelligent design: we do it ourselves. 2. Scientists should always exhaust the known before resorting to the unknown when seeking an explanation. 3. When considering any given biological feature (for our purposes typically the DNA from which a protein or group of proteins are derived), there are two possible contributing factors: design and evolution. In the latter case, the scale of the task facing evolution in creating the feature depends upon the existence - the plentiful existence - of proximate intermediate features. That is to say, DNA sufficiently similar and sufficiently widespread for the attainment of our target sequence to be statistically feasible via known mechanisms (mutation etc). 4. If we don't know what, if any, useful intermediate features could have prefaced the evolution of our target structure, 2) compels us to refrain from assuming their existence. We must instead go with what we know, and attempt to estimate the odds of the feature forming from an unrelated strand of DNA without the intermediate steps being useful. This is treated as statistically equivalent to a random search (create a DNA strand at random and see if it's the right one). 5. The amount of Complex Specified Information (CSI) in a feature is a measurement of those odds. And we know intelligence is capable of producing CSI because it can be measured in - well, this forum post for instance: what are the odds of a random sequence of characters duplicating it? Even if you allow for all the different possible sequences of characters conveying the same general meaning, they are still prodigiously outnumbered by permutations that are utterly meaningless. Before I present my argument, there are a couple of common criticisms of the above premise I'd like to cover: The Chicken and Egg problem Intelligent design may be a 'known', but it's also true that the only known intelligence in the universe is the product of the very process under investigation. This gives rise to a chicken and egg scenario. However, while this objection correctly highlights the ultimate futility of invoking intelligence as an explanation for the existence of itself, it could nevertheless be the case that we were designed by something that itself evolved. After all, the things we design remain designed, regardless of whether we ourselves evolved with or without external intelligent intervention. Thus the objection fails. CSI is a negative test This is a considerably more robust complaint: the amount of CSI measured in a biological structure depends to a large extent upon our ignorance. For instance, there are many, many variant genes in nature producing different proteins all serving as perfectly good insulin - that's why until recently diabetic patients were successfully treated with porcine or bovine insulin. The measured CSI of the DNA responsible is therefore reduced by our knowledge that there are multiple equivalent sequences (many targets for a random search to hit means lower CSI). If we didn't know they existed, our measurement would be higher. Also, we've observed insertion mutations occurring in the lab. An insertion mutation makes a DNA strand longer, and longer strands mean more permutations and thus yield a higher CSI measurement. So our measurement of CSI in the strand would be different depending upon whether we happened to observe that mutation. The ID counterargument is that it's always possible to suppose we've missed something that would influence our results, but we cannot rely upon such a supposition unless we can attach some meaningful probability to the event. And while we can make statements concerning the rate at which mutations occur, it's computationally impractical to 'rewind' evolution to any great extent to find functional intermediates from which mutations could plausibly have generated the DNA we see today - and even less practical to estimate how widespread such an intermediate would have been in an earlier population (or in many cases even the size of that population). By the letter of the law it's arguable that ID wins this argument by a nose, but an impartial observer would also concede that it is the impracticality of identifying a statistically quantifiable evolutionary history, rather than any theoretical weakness, which undermines the evolutionary position. To put it another way, the difficulty faced by an evolutionist in constructing a quantifiable evolutionary history is nothing to do with whether he's right or wrong about there being one. To put it yet another way, ID advocates only win because they don't have to do any work to support their position. Or do they? Intelligent Design's Black Box The idea I had last week starts with a simple question: I'm thinking of a number between 0 and 340 billion billion billion billion. What is it? The answer to that question represents a paltry 128 binary bits of CSI - equivalent to a 64 base-pair DNA strand and astronomically less than ID theory would measure in this sentence alone. So why can't you, an intelligent human being allegedly capable of creating far greater quantities of CSI merely by posting a legible response, answer me? It's claimed that intelligence understands meaning and purpose, and that's why it can find solutions evolution cannot. Very well: if I tell you the number in question is the WEP key for my wireless router, does your understanding of its purpose help in any way? Would you care to make a second guess? What the superficially trivial question above demonstrates is that intelligence cannot effortlessly hose out CSI on demand. Any problem analogous to my router's WEP key - such as finding a comparatively short, functionally isolated sequence of DNA - would be for all practical purposes just as intractable to an intelligent agent as to an evolutionary process. Returning to the original question, imagine instead of merely answering 'yes' or 'no' to your guesses, I tell you how many digits you got right, or whether the answer is higher or lower. Either would enable you to track down the target in short order - but in doing so you are utterly reliant upon patterns in the problem-space itself: the existence of a detectable route leading from an initial wrong guess to the right one. We find the same to be true in language. Imagine you see a cat, sitting on a mat, and decide you want to email your friends Alan and Zorg about it. To Alan you write 'I saw a cat sat on the mat' which according to ID theory (allowing for punctuation characters) represents about 128 bits of CSI. Next you try to email Zorg, your alien friend from the planet Zap. But there's a problem: Zorg doesn't speak English and in Zappian there's no consistent word for 'cat' or 'the' or 'sat' or 'mat'. There is a sequence of characters meaning 'I saw a cat sat on the mat' - but you have no idea what it is, and your intelligence is of no practical help to you in finding out. What we're seeing, then, is that in measuring CSI, ID theory is making two assumptions, not one. First, it's assuming that evolutionary intermediates we don't know about don't exist - which as we've discussed is just about justifiable according to the letter of the law. But it's also assuming patterns exist in the problem space that would enable an intelligent agent to find the solution. And as we've just seen, it's perfectly possible for no such patterns to exist - it's perfectly possible for intelligence to be no practical use at all. Thus by the same reasoning that excluded presumption of evolutionary intermediates, we must also exclude the presumption of intelligently traceable patterns - and in doing so we eliminate design as the default hypothesis. ID theorists do have a task before them, one comparable to that faced by evolutionists: they must quantify how much intelligence could contribute to the design of any given biological structure, by finding the patterns that would allow an intelligence to cull vast swathes of potential solutions at a stroke rather than having to consider or test them individually.

The ID argument we're dealing with here isn't in fact information-based. I agree that, in the same way the shape of a lock defines the shape of the key that will open it, an organism's environment defines - and thus encapsulates the information regarding - the ways in which that organism can survive and reproduce. And in my opinion evolution is sufficient explanation for how that information is transferred to the genome. However, it's also possible to transfer such information via design. The example of dropping freshwater fish into salt water or vice versa is an apt one in that respect: evolution would be unable to transfer the information in time to preserve the species. The 'official' ID argument for design (as opposed to the various poorly thought-out 'information can't arise ex nihilo' claims in circulation) is not that the environment doesn't represent the source of the information, but that evolution is an insufficiently powerful information pump. Many do, it's true - but that's not issue here. The issue is whether that genetic diversity could plausibly arise in the first place via evolutionary mechanisms, or whether there are genetic 'solutions' in nature that are too remote and isolated in permutation-space for an evolutionary search to have found them. My contention here is that the assumptions made in ID theory, which lead to the conclusion that some biological features are too functionally isolated to be found by evolution also - if fairly applied - eliminate intelligent design as a plausible origin. In other words, ID and evolution face the same problem: they must both show that biological features do not exhibit CSI in order to make their case.","intelligent-designs-black-box","07:08 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","4"

Bat wings for example are one of the easier problems for evolution to solve (we can even see potential transitional stages in other animals like the flying squirrel). The co-option of existing structures is the bread and butter of evolution. Now, if bats and birds had four legs and wings, that would be more of a head-scratcher. Civil and courteous, remember? Anyway, the topic primarily concerns structures at the protein level, about which there is at least some hope of measuring the level of CSI involved, so the evolution of wings isn't exactly relevant.","intelligent-designs-black-box","08:15 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","5"

I think that you are correct in this assumption, but since you do not define either 'intelligent' or 'design', I cannot be certain that we are not already at cross-purposes. True. I believe Mr. Sherlock Holmes said something to this effect wrt detective work. Well, that may be your personal approach to 'Evolution by Intelligent Design', but I believe that most people [and the majority of human beings are not geneticists and/or molecular chemists] would say that 'biological evolution', [to their way of thinking and mine], is about whole organisms, not molecules.

Evolution is an effect, not a cause, and trying to anthropomorphize that 'effect' into a 'cause' facing a 'task' smacks of animism. Evolution, as an effect, is an empirically observable fact. That is, there can be no doubt that over time and generations the forms that organisms take usually change. That is a non-issue, AFAIAC. The issue is determining the cause[s] that drive those changes. What you are saying here is that evolution drives evolution, which, among other things, is vacuous. Well, that's a bald assertion, and although it may even be true, I cannot accept it at face value. You'll have to take little time and explain to a non-scientist, amateur ontologist, just what it is that you intend that we should understand from these words, and why we should accept that understanding as true.

I have no interest in constructing a strawman, and if anyone can demonstrate that I have I will revise my understanding accordingly. I summarized the premise of ID not to cast it in any particular light but as a convenient reference for the argument that followed. As it happens, I haven't been able to find a consistent ID definition of the terms, either! On the ARN forums, for instance, the contributors were directly challenged to provide those definitions, and the various responses included: I think in this case Intelligence means something capable of producing design. Perhaps even the ability to make choices. Intelligence as it relates to ID is just to differentiate between optimal design on one side and apparent design on the other. (Wm DEmbski) In this context intelligence means what which nature, operating freely, could not or would not produce. (Del Ratzsch) I'll present and justify my definition of the terms in a moment, so bear with me. I agree: most people would say that, because for macro-scale multicellular creatures, the obvious selectable traits are visible morphological change (the size and shape of a limb or tooth, the configuration of a skull and so on). However, these macro changes are traceable to genetic or epigenetic traits at the molecular level. When you think about it, as a limb changes shape over generations it is not the limb that is evolving. After all, the physical limb itself is not handed down (sorry) from father to son. Rather it is the developmental process that produces the limb (in the foetus and growth into adulthood) which evolves, in turn resulting in a different end product in each successive generation. A moment's consideration reveals the inarguable truth of that. And the developmental process is regulated at the molecular level. Oh, don't be so hasty Bear in mind that at the scale upon which bacteria operate, molecules are significant physical structures. The bacterial flagellum, for instance, is an outboard motor constructed directly out of proteins, which are in turn directly, physically translated via RNA from DNA sequences. The physical shape of the folded molecular structure of those proteins is what makes the motor work. So there's nothing abstract about the relationship between DNA and the organism's physical form or abilities. Yes, I do define them as different things - and I'll explain why in a moment. Yes, our usage of those terms does differ markedly. You employ what I would call a narrative interpretation: design as a means to an end, contrasted with evolution having no ultimate goal. We're going to get into even more trouble over the term 'undirected', because evolution very much is directed, channeled and constrained by the environment. Of course, in narrative terms 'directed' once again implies a goal and an agent cognizant of that goal, so me using the word in conjunction with evolution is going to get us in a tangle. I'll therefore do my best to avoid using it. No, I mean evolution, in which statistically random variation is but one factor. It's a terrible mistake to equate evolution with pure chance. Evolution strikes me as being neither effect nor cause, but a process, akin to 'walking'. I wouldn't think it improper to describe, for instance, the reaching of the moon as a task to which the process of 'walking' is ill-suited I appreciate your concerns but they are groundless. I do not reify evolution in any sense; I used the phrase for evocative effect only. Evolution is a process, and the 'task' it faces in our mental exercise is the attainment of real-world sequences of DNA. The scale of that task - how well suited evolution is to completing it - equates to how plausible an explanation evolution is for what we see. And in terms of DNA sequences, evolution can reach a given sequence easily if there are abundant similar sequences already in existence - a scenario which can arise in a number of ways, the most readily understandable being that the previous, 'similar' sequence was of particular benefit to the organism's reproductive chances and became widespread in the population as a result. I apologise for leading you to that conclusion; it was not my intent. Evolution is a process, driven by events that induce variation (mutation, recombination, dietary change etc etc) and other influences which cull and select from that variation. It's fairly straightforward, probably more so than my wording suggested. The point is simply this: if we speculate that a particular 'target' (again, no teleology implied - 'target' here simply means a DNA sequence we know to exist) was reached by a process which involves producing random variations of existing DNA sequences, that process's chances of 'success', and of therefore being a plausible explanation, are intimately tied to the prior abundance or otherwise of substantially similar sequences. For example, if our target is the word 'Bellow' appearing in a population of words, the chances of it being reached by a process of random variation are substantially increased if there are already a million copies of the word 'Yellow' kicking about. That really is a shame. In case you change your mind, here is my working definition of 'design': Design: The culling of potential solutions in the abstract. You may well balk at that initially, but bear with me. Start by thinking about a problem in terms of the 'space' of all potential solutions, both good and bad. In principle at least you could find the optimal solution by trying everything and picking the solution that worked best. Interestingly enough, that method requires absolutely no understanding of the problem. Literally, brute force and ignorance. And it will suffice perfectly well if the problem-space is relatively small, like the combination lock on a briefcase. In most situations, however, the problem space is far too large for brute force and ignorance to triumph. One alternative is evolutionary: take a number of random starting solutions, pick the best, create a bunch of random variations from it, pick the best, rinse and repeat. Another alternative is design . This involves abstracting the problem to a simpler form with a smaller problem space. This drastically culls the range of alternatives that need to be considered or tested, enabling a solution to be found more quickly. The success of the process depends upon how well the abstraction - the model - of reality matches reality itself. The essence of my argument here in this thread is that CSI is a measurement of how badly any kind of abstract simplified model of the problem would fit the reality. You cannot simplify the problem of my router's WEP key, or the email to Zorg. They are, to borrow a phrase, irreducibly complex. And in the face of such problems design is helpless.","intelligent-designs-black-box","12:55 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","7"

But I have no intention of making myself look like an ##### by arguing blindly against someone else's particular area of expertise. Which is all that can happen in any debate we have that is framed in terms of genetics and molecular chemistry. Why not simply accept the dictionary definitions of 'intelligent' and 'design'? I don't see why the issue has to be muddied by looking for peculiar definitions for commonly understood words. A quick peek at my on-line dictionary gives me this information-- Definitions from The Online Plain Text English Dictionary: Intelligent # (a.) Endowed with the faculty of understanding or reason; as, man is an intelligent being. # (a.) Cognizant; aware; communicate. # (a.) Possessed of intelligence, education, or judgment; knowing; sensible; skilled; marked by intelligence; as, an intelligent young man; an intelligent architect; an intelligent answer. Definitions from The Online Plain Text English Dictionary: Design # (n.) A plan or scheme formed in the mind of something to be done; preliminary conception; idea intended to be expressed in a visible form or carried into action; intention; purpose; -- often used in a bad sense for evil intention or purpose; scheme; plot. # (n.) A preliminary sketch; an outline or pattern of the main features of something to be executed, as of a picture, a building, or a decoration; a delineation; a plan. # (n.)[b] Specifically, intention or purpose as revealed or inferred from the adaptation of means to an end; as, the argument from design.[b] # (n.) The invention and conduct of the subject; the disposition of every part, and the general order of the whole. # (n.) The realization of an inventive or decorative plan; esp., a work of decorative art considered as a new creation; conception or plan shown in completed work; as, this carved panel is a fine design, or of a fine design. # (n.) To create or produce, as a work of art; to form a plan or scheme of; to form in idea; to invent; to project; to lay out in the mind; as, a man designs an essay, a poem, a statue, or a cathedral. # (n.) To draw preliminary outline or main features of; to sketch for a pattern or model; to delineate; to trace out; to draw. # (n.) To intend or purpose; -- usually with for before the remote object, but sometimes with to. # (n.) To mark out and exhibit; to designate; to indicate; to show; to point out; to appoint. # (v. i.) To form a design or designs; to plan. [bold added] Just for starters, I would say that wrt biology, organisms, and biological organismic evolution, I best like the word senses that I have set out in 'bold'. ""Traceable"" in what sense? If you are implying some kind of mechanistic determinism between 'matter', as in molecules, and 'form', as in the actual organism as an operating system, then I simply have to refuse to accept your assumption. Which brings the debate back to another screeching halt. I do not believe that 'building materials' determine what actually gets built. As in 'bricks determine the shape and dimensions of a wall [or anything else] that is made of them'. I will go so far as to say that 'building materials' do limit what can or cannot be made of them. For instance, bricks are simply useless for kite construction. My main point, though, is that substances, building materials, can do nothing at all on their own. Even piles of rubble require gravity. Therefore I think it very unlikely that acid molecules decide or determine or even direct or guide other molecules so that, once you've accumulated enough molecules all strung together, you end up with an elephant or an albatross or whatever it is that these self-directed molecules turn themselves into. Which brings it all down to this--do molecules decide what to do with themselves, or does something that is not a molecule do that for them? Same point. I'll accept that genes can 'regulate' developmental biological processes. But only in the same sense of the word 'regulate' that I would apply to the thermostat on my wall wrt to room temperature, or to the 'cruise control' governor that monitors and 'regulates' my car's speed. This is what I was afraid of. You can claim that in one particular instance the 'laws' of mechanics [or chance] independently determine a certain form, and that that form determines a particular function. I have no way of knowing whether or not that claim is true. Therefore that path is closed to us. Yes, I use ""design"" in a teleological sense. I have not contrasted 'design' with 'evolution', however. Only you have done that. And you are still using the word evolution as if it were some kind of causal force. If you keep using the word that way, then it becomes interchangeable with ""Mother Nature"", or even ""God"". That just doesn't work for me. My point, above. I can accept that. Let us then agree that we will use the word 'evolution' in the sense of a developmental process in the course of which life forms become differentiated and variegated within the passage of at least two generations. Let us further agree to never commit the mortal sin of referring to 'evolution' as anything else. Do you see?!? You call it a process, which is correct, but since when does a process 'face'[implying awareness] a 'task'? Your language is still animistic, [meaning that it imputes awareness and cognition to an inanimate something--in this case an abstraction, a process. And that is reification. Let us say rather that it ""performs"" a task. The what, where, why, and how of that 'task' we can come to later, but you should be aware that even the word 'task' implies certain psychological qualities. Let us use the word 'operation' instead, shall we? You are still doing it. First, if you use words like 'target', 'goal', 'solution', 'answer' ,'objective', etc., then you are speaking teleologically. Denying it makes no difference. Trying to discuss biological evolution without speaking in teleological terms is, I suspect, impossible. So either evolution is a teleological biological process, as I suspect, or you are going to have a brutal semantic task on your hands. That sounds like 'selection' or 'choice', both of which imply a system of values, a criterion of judgment and discrimination, and of course, awareness, particularly of alternatives. All of which are mental phenomena. So I guess you'd best not use ""Natural Selection"", unless you wish to impute these qualities to Darwin's proposed 'culling'. True. But for trial and error to work without any teleology, ( i.e., randomly, relying solely upon hitting upon the 'right' answer accidentally), will, by simple mathematical probability, take more time than the universe has got! Except in single digit, [and very, very low single digit] possibilities. You are almost reduced to 'either/or' simplicity. That might work [I wouldn't know] for things as simple as atoms and molecules, but when it comes to any degree of systemic complexity, it would never work. And even bacteria, being cells, are way past being that simple. So I think we can cross that one off our list. ""Pick the best"" is pure teleology. AKA, intelligent design. Well, all this abstract and analytical thinking strikes me as anything but mechanical and/or accidental. ??

The only way to be sure is to ask the IDCreationist what he means when he uses the word. Specialized fields tend to take common words and assign a different definition. This is true of pseudo science like IDCreationism and Creation Science, as well as real science. For example, take the word ""evolution"": (from The Online Plain Text English Dictionary) Which definition you choose depends on who you are talking too and in what context. For example, if you could talk to Charles Darwin you would find that he understood the meaning of the word to be definition #1, which is why he objected so strongly to the use of the word in reference to his theories. Darwin included no sense of becoming better or more complex, and not necessarily all that different. The modern definition of evolution, the one used by evolutionary biologists, is #3a, as far as the first comma. Evolution is not necessarily always the result of natural selection as there are 5 or six other recognized mechanisms of evolution, at least three of which create the genetic variation mentioned in the dictionary definition. Moreover, development of new species is not a requirement for evolution to occur. New species may or may result in evolution - sometimes yes, sometimes no. At any rate, speciation is an observation of the actions of the mechanisms of evolution. The definition of evolution that I learned on the first day of my first class on evolution was: a change in the allele frequency in a population of organisms over generations. That's it. Of course, a paleontologist would be more likely to use definition #3b. Creationists tend to use other definitions that usually include speciation, increase in complexity, and improvement, but they always run away from defining those terms. Of course, it is typical for non-biologists to confuse the definition of evolution with events that fit the definition, and theories that explain the events. Those are all legitimate uses of the word. However, if there is no change in the genome, it isn't evolution. Moreover, even though I am several inches taller than my father was (as are my brothers), it isn't evolution. So, yes, in order to have a discussion with IDCreationists they need to define their terms. Otherwise we are free to assign our own definitions.

You could easily get around this impasse simply by replacing the word ""evolution"" in those kinds of statements with words such as ""life"", or ""biochemistry"", or rganic energy"", or something. It simply bothers the heck out of me to hear you say that evolution' is what is doing evolution. We agreed that evolution is a process. A process is not a thing that accounts for itself. Just like your example, 'walking', walking does not account for any part of walking. Walking is what it is. It cannot explain itself. So, for the last time, please stop saying that volution' does this or explains that, and choose some other word. If you do not like my suggestions, offer me one of your own and maybe I can accept it. Otherwise, this conversation cannot continue. As for teleology, it is either a part of biology or it is not. You cannot have your cake and eat it. You either abandon teleological terminology, and switch to mechanical terminology, or you admit that evolution is a teleological process. Now, there are several interpretations of the word 'teleology', some more sweeping than others. I try to keep it simple. For me, in everyday conversation, teleology is a way of explaining phenomena by their ends or purposes. Now, explaining phenomena is what science [and philosophy] is all about. I only know of three ways of explaining phenomena--a/ the teleological, b/the mechanical, and c/the supernatural. We both are content to leave c/ aside, I believe? Now that means that if we are to debate , we must take different positions. No point if we're both of the teleological persuasion, or both of the mechanical persuasion. I choose the teleological position. Therefore I shall speak in teleological terms wherever I see evidence that an end has had something to do with the achieving of that end. To show that no end, at least, no end wrt the evolutionary process, was ever accomplished by intrinsic efforts to achieve it, then you must speak in terms that never suggest that they do. But since even ""survival of the fittest"" and ""natural selection"" are both teleological, you are going to have a hard time of it. But, with all due respect, that is your problem, not mine. Language exists for the exchange of ideas, etc. It does not exist, although it is very often used to do so, in order to distort, or veil, or compromise ideas.

Must I really tiptoe around the words 'direct' and 'guide' and choose 'channel' instead, to avoid conceding the whole debate? Is even 'channel' sufficiently ateleological a verb? The plain fact is that almost every verb, being a 'doing' word, has connotations of agency. Heck, in English there isn't even a version of 'whose' meaning 'belonging to it ' rather than to a person!

Consequently I must plod through tortuous, mind-numbing alternatives like 'environmentally-induced differential replication rates', worrying all the time whether 'induced' is going to set off alarm bells and result in an hour's carefully crafted reasoning getting brushed aside unanswered. I'll do my best, but the language we're obliged to employ is skewed in your favour. If you're determined to take ungentlemanly advantage of that, I propose we continue the debate in 68000 machine code instead In the former case, the nature of intelligence is so poorly understood that it remains to be accurately defined in anything other than circular terms, as your bolded definition exemplifies. In the latter: That is one meaning of the word, and I can hardly argue with your personal preference, but if you insist that it can be the only meaning of 'design' we employ in this discussion, we're going to have to find another word for: because that's the subject of this thread: what designing a solution to a problem actually entails. This objection can be dealt with on two levels. First - and your beliefs notwithstanding - it is the case that simulations of proteins at the molecular level, in which only the known natural forces are represented, accurately mimic their behaviour in real organisms. Second, regardless of whence we suppose the 'motive force' behind these molecules originates, it is also demonstrably the case that if the protein sequences are altered, their shape and consequently function can be altered or disrupted - and if those proteins are introduced to similar organisms lacking them, function is induced. So even if they are merely tools in the hands of a teleological force, the question of how they came to be the right tools, how 'right' they need to be, and whether variations of them could have been used for something else in the past, remains pertinent. Luckily for us they possess it, along with a number of other intermolecular forces Unlikely or not, it is proving obstinately difficult to find a definite crack into which to insert novel forces. I make no claims one way or another as to the significance of that question in absolute terms, but it is not relevant to the subject in hand. The physical structure of biological molecules is undeniably vital to their operation - for whatever reason. So the question remains: how did those molecules arise? Is the idea that they were designed plausible? To answer that question it's necessary to examine what it really means to design a solution to a problem, not just in philosophical terms but in terms of the problem-space involved and how solutions within it may be discovered. The example of the 128-bit WEP-key demonstrates that not all problems are equally tractable to intelligence. Consider again the contrast between the ease with which we two can communicate, and the impossibility of communicating with an alien whose language consists of character sequences - of the same length as English and thus representing the same amount of CSI according to ID theory - that are isolated in permutation space. You skipped the part about developmental processes evolving rather than the organism - should I take it that the point has been made? As I pointed out earlier, simulations in which only the mechanical forces are represented mimic the real-world behaviour of proteins accurately, so it's not unreasonable to proceed on that basis. Perhaps 'contrast' is the wrong word. Certainly a teleological agent could conduct an evolutionary search for a solution if it wanted to, but the point is that an evolutionary search can proceed without the need for such an agent in the specific case of self-replicating, mutating (in the general sense of 'changing') structures in an environment of limited resources. I have to ask - why? You clearly understand what I meant. I'm perfectly capable of writing ""the statistical chance of the process hypothesised to have produced the observed result actually producing it"" if absolutely necessary, but it's an awful mouthful and it doesn't clarify the point so much as obscure it with verbiage. I think the majority of readers would more readily identify with ""the scale of the task facing evolution"", and more intuitively grasp its import, without feeling the need to read too much into the teleological undertones. As I've already noted, the prevalence of terms with teleological connotations in the language we're using, and the consequent difficulty of speaking upon any topic without bumping into them, has no implications for the presence or absence of teleology in the actual subject under discussion. Semantics do not define what can be true, merely how easily and accurately truth may be described. In these matters the word ""target"" is routinely employed to mean a particular subset of a space, the reaching of which by any given process being what interests us. I plan to continue to use it in that fashion. You say 'first', but omit a second; presumably it would have contained your response to the substance of what I said, namely how the prior existence of abundant similar sequences influences the likelihood of stochastic variation hitting upon the one we're interested in. I'm not going to disagree, mainly because it doesn't matter. The fact remains that when you design something, you cull alternative solutions in the abstract. You may then produce and compare several prototypes, to see which of the solutions you thought would be good actually are good - effectively a test of how accurately your simplified abstraction of the problem modelled the reality of it. My contention here is that if the CSI possessed by a given solution is genuinely high, simplifications of the problem would be far more likely to wrongly exclude it than to find it, rendering 'design' an implausible explanation. The simple mathematical probability calculations to which you refer are apt for problems like that of the WEP key - but as we've already seen, teleology is of next to no use in such situations either. Unless, of course, you'd like to venture a guess and prove me wrong...? Trial and error does not require teleology to work within reasonable timescales. It requires three things: 1. A degree of continuity. By this I mean that successive trials must be - at least most of the time - limited variations upon previous trials. 2. A feedback mechanism resulting in trials that were more successful forming the basis for future trials more often than those that were less so. 3. A problem space in which 'success' is not binary, and which is not entirely chaotic and discontinuous. The 128-bit WEP key problem is not reducible by evolutionary means. Even if the first two criteria are satisfied by the process generating the trials, the binary nature of success prevents that process from converging upon a solution. It will indeed take longer than the universe has existed. But if the feedback mechanism reports the number of correct digits as the degree of success, and the more successful trials more often form the basis of subsequent variant trials than the less successful ones (say, changing a single digit each time), the 'perfect' solution can be found in a fraction of a second. In the case of variable self-replicating structures in an environment of limited resources, all three requirements are inherently satisfied. There is continuity: subsequent 'trial' structures are variations upon what came before. There is an inherent feedback mechanism ensuring that variations upon the more successful structures are represented more abundantly in subsequent trials - because success is reproduction. And success is not binary: there are many possible self-replicating structures; some are merely better/faster/more efficient than others. If an intelligent agent is 'picking the best', perhaps - although I'd dispute the idea that he's 'designing' anything. Recognising that something is a solution is not the same as designing one. But in the special - indeed unique - case of 'best' equating to 'best at self-replication', you don't need an external intelligence to do the picking. I refuse to fall into the trap of saying the replicators 'pick' themselves, by the way Rather, the best self-replicators will inevitably predominate in future trials. It cannot be otherwise. ID theory operates on the presumption that, until demonstrated otherwise, 3) is not satisfied, and that the evolutionary process must therefore fail to converge upon solutions. However, for a process of design to converge upon a solution, criteria comparable to 3) must be satisfied! If they are not, then no abstraction or simplification of the problem can be expected to lead to a viable solution; no guiding rule or principle exists to be intelligently noted and employed. The designer is reduced to taking pot-shots in the dark.","intelligent-designs-black-box","09:28 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","13"

That is exactly what you do have to do. Yes. It describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result, outcome, whatever but strictly to a cause/s force/s in action. That is why 'selection' is always teleological. In order to select or choose anything, an end must always be in view. There must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end. The only time ""channel"" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological. In the same way, 'sorting' can be considered non-teleological, hence mechanical, and thus suited to your glossary, because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone. But 'selection' always requires volition and awareness. So 'selection' is always teleological. ""Agency"" is not the issue. Agency is simply causality. An agency can be teleological, mechanical, or purely accidental. And of course every ""doing verb"" connotes agency, aka, causation, because we human beings have a tendency to suppose that every time something happens, that something caused it to happen. That should pose no problem for you. The only time that agency or causation should trouble you is when that agency is not accidental or strictly mechanical, but shows evidence of the end determining the means, that is the end or effect acting , at least in part, in determining itself. What, as I'm sure you know, Aristotle called a ""final"" cause. Aristotle distinguished four causesefficient, final, material, and formalthat may be illustrated by the following example: a statue is created by a sculptor (the efficient) who makes changes in marble (the material) in order to have a beautiful object (the final) with the characteristics of a statue (the formal). The only one you have to avoid is ""final"", connoted or denoted, stated or implied. That is not my understanding of the word. It is simply the possessive case of either 'who' [which is always a person] or 'which', [which does not have to be a person, but can be anything to which a property is attached. As in, ""The river, _whose_ waters originated in the hills, ..."" Their is nothing teleological in the word. Even when applied to a person, there is no connection to causation. Not only can I do so, I must do so, and so must everybody else including yourself. As I have already explained.
