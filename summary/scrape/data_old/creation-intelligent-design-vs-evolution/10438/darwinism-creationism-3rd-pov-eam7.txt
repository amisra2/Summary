               You make a good argument.  However, the idea that eliminating phylogenetic recapitulation in the womb would require "an impossibly unlikely confluence of multiple mutations" sounds suspiciously like Michael Behe's claim that a complex system such as the eye could not possibly have evolved in a single step.
              </div>
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           I appreciate that, but there's an important difference. Behe's argument relies upon the false assumption that there is no 'half an eye' - no intermediate step - that is in any way useful; it's all or nothing.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           My argument is that if you already have a sequence of developmental events A and B, where B depends upon A, then there may well be no single mutation that can eliminate A
           <i>
            and
           </i>
           transform B so as to work in the absence of A, and it's also very unlikely that any stepwise accumulation of mutations would be viable. A mutation that makes B work in the absence of A could be catastrophic in the
           <i>
            presence
           </i>
           of A, and a mutation that eliminates A would be catastrophic for B.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           This would not hold true for every developmental step, but it's reasonable to predict that it would crop up from time to time.
           <br/>
           <div class="bbcode_container">
            <div class="bbcode_quote">
             <div class="quote_container">
              <div class="bbcode_quote_container">
              </div>
              Nor do I buy the argument that a swimbladder or gills or any of that other fishy stuff is so integral to embryonic development that multiple simultaneous mutations would be required to streamline it out of the picture.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           You may not buy it, but you cannot discount it. Given evolution's opportunistic nature, the gene combinations responsible for those structures may have become entangled with the formation of other structures.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Actually, there's an even simpler explanation which doesn't involve that kind of developmental dependency: say we start with a creature with gills. The first mutation that eliminates them from the adult form
           <i>
            might
           </i>
           be one that prevents them forming in the first place, but it might not be - it might be one that catalyses reabsorption. Now we have a two-step process in place - what happens if another mutation 'streamlines' the development process by preventing the gills forming at all? What will the 'reabsorption' step do now? Maybe nothing, maybe something catastrophic. Again, you might end up stuck with the first solution hit upon.
           <br/>

              <div class="bbcode_quote_container">
              </div>
              The reason the embryo doesn't streamline its development is that it faces no survival pressure in the womb.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           Of course it does! Physical isolation from other organisms doesn't necessarily mean you aren't in competition. A longer, more complex and potentially more error-prone developmental process will yield statistically fewer live births than a simpler, safer one. Unless the attendant benefits in adulthood outweigh the risks, such a process is at a selective disadvantage.

              By the way, you've anthropomorphized twice in your post, once with the use of the term, "rewriting," implying that DNA is something like a "book of life" or "recipe," and also with your use of the concept of directions, implying that DNA is essentially a map of development. If so, then there must be a reader or interpreter of this book/recipe/map, which brings us back to the homunculus.  Now, I realize perhaps you're just stating it this way for the sake of clarity.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           For you to realise that, I must be succeeding in being clear by using such shorthand - so why complain about it?
           <img alt="" border="0" class="inlineimg" src="images/smilies/smile.gif" title="Smilie"/>
           <br/>

              </div>
              Still, I have to wonder if all this habitual anthropomorphizing colors our perception of biological processes.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           Perhaps. On the other hand, there are senses in which DNA
           <i>
            is
           </i>
           read by an interpreter, eg. the formation of proteins. I think it remains a useful aid to visualisation.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Ironically, by far the worst culprit for anthropomorphising the function of DNA was wascallywabbit, who insisted for the longest time that it was nothing but a jotter in which the organism noted down words to jog its memory.

               This phrase does not appear in Sheldrake's paper, nor does he say anything to the same effect.  What he does say is this:
               <br/>
               <br/>
               "The results show a statistically significant increase in the latency with the test beads relative to the controls (p= 0.009 using Rose's proportional criterion; p= 0.007 using mean latencies; p= 0.008 using trimmed means)."
              </div>
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           Which has misled you into believing an increase in latency occurred in the test chicks. It did not.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The mistake both you and Sheldrake are making is to assume that the decreasing latency in the chrome pin control results
           <i>
            also
           </i>
           underlies the yellow LED test results, and that morphic resonance aversion is counteracting it. You and he both assume that after an arbitrary 'settling in' period (cherry-picked by Sheldrake to eliminate just the part of the graph that he didn't like) the lab tech's learning curve w.r.t manipulating the yellow LED and chrome pin suddenly equalised. Note: it's not enough that she became equally proficient; you assume she abruptly became steadily and equally
           <i>
            more
           </i>
           proficient over time with both implements.
           <br/>
           <div class="bbcode_container">
            <div class="bbcode_quote">
             <div class="quote_container">

              </div>
              Latency means the desire is there but hidden.  The chick wants to peck but the beads but holds back due to aversion.  A statistically significant increase in the latency of the test chicks relative to the controls means the test chicks showed greater aversion over time than the controls.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           Like I said, unless you assume - with no reason or evidence to back you up - that the same decreasing latency trend underlies both sets of results, you cannot infer
           <i>
            increasing
           </i>
           aversion.
           <br/>
           <div class="bbcode_container">

              </div>
              This is what Sheldrake predicted on the basis of morphic resonance.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           No, he didn't - he stated as much in his paper. When formulating his prediction he couldn't conceive of any reason why the chrome bead latency would change, so he made the explicit prediction that the LED latency would increase. It
           <i>
            didn't.
           </i>
           <br/>

              This is incorrect.  Perhaps you're confused owing to the fact that at first both groups tended to peck more readily.  Rose and Sheldrake agreed this was an artifact of the improving skills of the lab-tech.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           No, I am correct. Those same trends continued throughout to some degree - only the
           <i>
            diversion
           </i>
           in the trends altered. At no point did the birds exhibit a trend of greater aversion towards either stimulus,.
           <br/>

              </div>
              The student who actually ran the experiment needed a few trials to get the hang of it.  By simply lopping off the first few trials, the trend toward increased aversion becomes clear.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           There was no trend towards increased aversion, only different degrees of
           <i>
            decreased
           </i>
           aversion, easily explicable via the different learning curve and inherent attractiveness of chrome pin and yellow LED.
           <br/>

              Absolutely not.  Sheldrake includes all trials after the first few when the lab-tech was getting the hang of it.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           Exactly - he assumes that at the precise point where the graph turns in his favour, the student had 'got the hang of it'. Actually, it's worse than that: he assumes that the student continued to get better for the whole of the rest of the experiment
           <i>
            at the same rate with both implements
           </i>
           despite having increased in proficiency at
           <i>
            different
           </i>
           rates with each implement in the past.

              Seems like you're working from Rose's attempted rebuttal rather than the original paper, then ignoring Sheldrake's response in which he refutes all of Rose's transparently lame objections.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           I haven't read any rebuttal, I only followed the link you provided earlier to the original paper.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Ok, now I've read the rebuttal, and Rose makes some additional points regarding the influence of base and ceiling values on the data. After the initial learning period the birds pecked with such eagerness at the yellow LED - for the whole of the rest of the experiment - that it was practically impossible for any experimenter-induced
           <i>
            increase
           </i>
           in enthusiasm to register. The chrome bead, on the other hand, was always far less popular a target for pecking, thus leaving room for the lab-tech to improve his technique and improve the peck-rate.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           That's by
           <i>
            far
           </i>
           the simplest explanation for the results: the test results didn't show a trend towards reduced aversion because they
           <i>
            couldn't,
           </i>
           while the control results
           <i>
            could,
           </i>
           thus inducing the apparently significant diversion.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I'll check out Sheldrake's rebuttal and get back to you.

           Ok, from Sheldrake's rebuttal:

              We agree that the continued decline in latency in the control chicks (not predicted by either of us) is best explained as a result of Ms Harrison's increasing familiarity with the chicks and the test procedures.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           So Sheldrake agrees that that trend was experimenter-induced.

              and hence by morphic resonance subsequent chicks showed an increasing tendency to avoid it, even though they themselves had not been made sick. This increasing aversion to pecking the yellow light countervailed the tendency to peck sooner as a result of the experimenter's practice.

           See? He assumes, with no justification, that the exact same trend underlies both sets of results.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           His attempted rebuttal of the 'ceiling' effect pointed out by Rose is smoke and mirrors. The alleged 'trend' in fig.3 is statistically insignificant. The only significant trend is to be found in the chrome bead results, which are the only ones
           <i>
            capable
           </i>
           of exhibiting such a trend (they are not capped by the experimental ceiling).

           Science has nothing to do with certainty. I highly recommend you watch Jacob Bronowski's "The Ascent of Man" episode 11: "Knowledge or Certainty," a famous documentary that explores whether we can ever have absolute knowledge in science.

               My argument is that if you already have a sequence of developmental events A and B, where B depends upon A, then there may well be no single mutation that can eliminate A

           This is the kind of argument I expect to see from creationists.  It's simply a matter of shifting the context from womb to outer environment, and you're arguing against the viability of random mutation as the source of novelty in evolution.  I happen to take this view myself, which is why I support Miroslav Hill's proposal for adaptive mutation of genes (really just an updated version of Darwin's pangenesis) as well as Sheldrake's proposal for form-based inheritance.

              Given evolution's opportunistic nature, the gene combinations responsible for those structures may have become entangled with the formation of other structures.

           It's interesting how, as soon as you begin looking at it from the point of view of the embryo, you start to see the implausibility of neo-Darwinian evolution.  Yet any argument that applies to the womb can also be applied to evolution in the context of the outer environment.  Be careful of what you write.  Creationists could easily remove your words from their embryonic context and claim you're talking about the implausibility of evolution in general.

              dace: "The reason the embryo doesn't streamline its development is that it faces no survival pressure in the womb."
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Of course it does! Physical isolation from other organisms doesn't necessarily mean you aren't in competition. A longer, more complex and potentially more error-prone developmental process will yield statistically fewer live births than a simpler, safer one. Unless the attendant benefits in adulthood outweigh the risks, such a process is at a selective disadvantage.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           And this is my point exactly.  Given the potential problems that can crop up during a lengthy gestation full of odd detours through the phylogenetic tree, embryogenesis ought to have been streamlined by the same process of random mutation that allows for advances in the adult form of the organism.  But it hasn't happened because novelty doesn't stem primarily from random mutation.  It stems from pressures on the organism in its environment and the adaptations it undertakes so as to improve its chances for survival.  These adaptations, as Darwin argued, are then inherited by offspring.  But in this case, the risks are faced by the expectant mother while the organism that would have to creatively adapt is adrift in the oceanic bliss of the womb.  Since the embryo itself isn't going to adapt, and the mother can't do anything but wait for the process to play itself out, the only adaptations that occur are those that arise spontaneously from accidents in the replication of genes.  And here we see just how paltry is the effect of such accidents.  After millions upon millions of years, we're still recapitulating in the womb the same old developmental processes of our early vertebrate ancestors.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           It all comes down to what our default assumption ought to be.  Neither side has been proven.  The originator of genetic reductionism, August Weismann, stated that he had no evidence for his belief but simply couldn't imagine any other possibility.  He assumed that organisms possess no endogenous intelligence by which to adapt genes in accord with behavioral and morphogenetic adaptations.  Thus organisms cannot transmit their living adaptations to progeny.  He also arbitrarily disallowed the possibility that organisms transmit information in any kind of long-distance sense, such as the way a radio transmitter links up to disparate receivers on the basis of electromagnetic resonance.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           So there's no evidence that inheritance is limited to whatever mutations spontaneously arise from within DNA.  Just pure assumption from the get-go.  Nor is there any evidence that genetic transcription is the motive force in development.  It's not as if anybody's ever traced a causal chain from the activities of genes to the creation of multicellular structures or even the patterned activities within cells themselves.  All we have is a link between genotype and phenotype.  This gene means you'll have blue eyes.  This one means you'll have dimples.  This one means you'll have a gift for mechanical analysis.  It's simply assumed that since we have the front end (genotype) and the back end (phenotype) there must be a causal chain connecting them which accounts for the construction of all the organs and tissues of the body.  But what if genes don't contain anything like a blueprint of the body but merely influence its development so as to promote differences between individuals?  Perhaps the actual basis of development is the ability of organic systems to directly mimic previous similar systems.  Like Newton positing gravity to explain planetary motions, we simply posit memory as a universal feature of nature.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Because we cannot discount the possibility that memory is a property of nature, we cannot assume that genes provide the basis for development in general.  Instead, we must have evidence, but the only thing we know on the basis of hard evidence is that genes differentiate between individuals, not that they provide the general template for the species.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The beauty of Weismann's reductionism is that it explained something complex (the complete living organism) according to something simple ("germ-plasm" or genes).  And it's true that the information contained in genes is stunningly simple in relation to the body and its organs.  But now, in light of "evo-devo" research, we discover that developmental genes are virtually identical in everything from people to flies.  What distinguishes us is the way in which our genes are operated, and this process of operating genes is as complex as anything we've ever found in nervous, endocrine or immune systems.  What's the point of explaining one complexity in terms of another?  The entire foundation of genetic reductionism has simply vanished.  Where before we stood on terra firma, we now stand on thin air.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           But there's more.  It turns out that complexity is fundamental to nature.  Nature is not based on static simplicity but process complexity.  A whirlpool, for instance, is a self-organized system that derives energy by rapidly reducing the pressure gradient resulting from a large body of water trying to fit through a small opening.  The only law of physics that gives shape to a whirlpool is the second law of thermodynamics.  Because energy is always being leached in the form of entropy, natural systems must draw in more energy than is lost.  It's not about physical laws determining the actions of passive matter but this gray area in which matter is not passive but takes the form of a complex system actively striving to maintain enough energy flow to stave off the ravages of entropy.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           It's often thought that evolution is a property of life.  In reality, life is a property of evolution.  Before there was life, there was evolution of complex chemical systems that derived energy by tapping into temperature and/or pressure gradients.  The greater its internal complexity, the more energy a given chemical system can harness.   The problem is that increased energy flow today means increased entropy tomorrow.  In order to overcome increased entropy, the system must further complexify in order to harness even more energy, setting the stage for even more entropy down the road.  And so on, and so on, and so on until you've got human beings trying to develop new sources of energy while coping with all the garbage and pollution and infrastructure decay resulting from prior energy-intensive development.  From complex chemical systems of the early Earth to human civilization, it's all a single thread of complex self-organized systems overcoming entropy by drawing in more energy.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Evo-devo and complexity theory constitute a one-two punch that has knocked reductionism out of the ring.  It's holism from here on out with reductionism demoted from theory to mere methodology.  Naturally, we still wish to break down complicated phenomena into simpler underlying phenomena wherever possible.  It's just that we'll never reduce any complex, self-organized system into laws, on the one hand, and matter on the other.  The system must be taken as a thing in itself, and to understand its actions, we must interpret them in light of its overall needs and not some combination of abstractions and atoms.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           So where does this leave biology?  Do we have to start from scratch, scrambling to apply the lessons of complexity science to organisms?  Not at all.  Biology has always had a holistic component.  The theory of evolution doesn't follow from biochemistry but stems from observations of embryos recapitulating their ancestral forms.  Darwin explicitly denied Descartes' notion (then being trumpeted by T.H. Huxley) that animals are machines.  Rejecting the view of the fundamental passivity of matter, Darwin saw evolution as an expression of the creativity inherent in matter.  C.S. Peirce generalized Darwin's doctrine by arguing that even the principles of physics are mere cosmic habits that came into being in time and reinforce themselves over time.  Henri Bergson argued on the basis of neurological observation that brains are not passive memory-storage devices but serve to filter out the masses of extraneous memory continually pouring down on us from our living past.  In other words the problem is not remembering what is important but forgetting what is not.  Bergson's arch-enemy Bertrand Russell referred to this insistent pressure of the past on the present as "mnemic causation."  Though Russell disdained everything uttered by his more famous French counterpart, he did at least concede the possibility that the present is influenced by the deep past in addition to the immediate past of standard causation.  Russell's associate Alfred North Whitehead went much further, arguing that science was in for a wholesale shift from physio-centric to bio-centric, from static instant to living process.  Embryologist Paul Weiss, who argued that "morphogenetic fields" organize development from the egg, was once president of the National Academy of Sciences, giving the lie to the idea that holistic biology has always been the reserve of marginal thinkers.  South African naturalist Eugene Marais demonstrated that an organizing field, over and above ordinary chemical communication, maintains the integrity of termite mounds.  The physicist Walter Elsasser, who solved the equations for the Earth's electromagnetic fields before turning from physics to biology, published his insights in numerous biological journals.  He defined holistic memory not just in terms of personal memories and habits but "all informational stability in the organism that does not yield to an understanding in terms of mechanistic models."
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Sheldrake's notion of morphic resonance, far from being an oddball theory out of left field, is the crowning achievement in a long lineage of holistic thought in biology.  For the first time we have a testable means by which the present comes under the influence of the past.  Though complexity theory can explain how a generic system self-organizes and self-perpetuates, it can't explain why one
           <i>
            particular
           </i>
           system comes into being and not another.  This is where memory comes in, and there's no longer any reason to assume that species-memory is strictly a matter of genes.  If an organism is a holistic, complex system, why assume its memory is reducible to particles?

              dace: "What matters is the degree of similarity relative to the differences. If the differences are tiny, then resonance will occur only among very close similarities. This is presumably what would happen naturally, without any intelligent intervention."

              <br/>
              Superficially that sounds reasonable, but in reality it's deeply flawed. If you ask me how different two creatures could be, why should I assume you mean 'while both still being bacteria'? Why isn't the scope species, genera, the whole scope of life itself? And given that we classify creatures as bacteria based on their similarity in the first place, what possible answer has the question "How different could those two creatures be while still being similar?" It's circular nonsense.

           Morphic resonance doesn't operate according to abstract classifications.  It doesn't have to answer questions about difference and similarity.  Like gravity or electromagnetism, it's a property of nature.  The circular nonsense is what happens when you try to fit nature into the logic of human abstraction.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Is a tornado circular nonsense?  Think about it.  The damn thing comes into being by reducing the gradient that provides the energy that gives it its form. Sound weird?  It's called self-organization.  It's the principle not only of organisms but evolution.  It's how a species comes into being.  By finding and exploiting a previously untapped gradient, a new kind of organism is sculpted by the forces it unleashes, distinguishing it from its former kind.

              dace: "Each pool of memory is a subset of a larger pool. Perhaps a better metaphor would be the parts of a tree. The trunk is the set of memory shared by all living things. One of the boughs emerging from the trunk is the set of memory shared by all animals. Out of this bough comes the limb of mammalian memory, and out of this limb comes the branch of primate memory, and out of this branch comes the shoot of hominid memory, and out of this shoot comes the twig of Homo sapiens memory. We still draw from all the prior branches, all the way down to the trunk."

           Only if you assume reduction of living process to static units of information.  The genetic reduction of evolution is premised on the genetic reduction of the organism.  The complex (organism) is rendered simple (gene).  But gene is not so simple after all.  Turns out it undergoes extremely complex operations, flickering like a lightning bug in perfect coordination with thousands of others.  Now you're missing a premise.  It's been yanked out.  Now there's no basis for the conclusion that the evolution of species in the outer world is but the shadow of genetic mutations in microscopic chromosomes.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Instead of determining the process, maybe alterations in DNA during speciation merely mark at the genetic level the real action taking place in the resonance between current and past organic forms.  Of course, we have a word for this "place."  It's called mind, and it's the ground of consciousness.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           In other words, it's all real.  We're alive.  This is all really happening.  And that's the part the abstractions leave out.

               It's interesting how, as soon as you begin looking at it from the point of view of the embryo, you start to see the implausibility of neo-Darwinian evolution.

           It's interesting how, as soon as Peeling so clearly explains why evolutionary theory explains the embryology that we see while Sheldrake-worship theory doesn't, you miraculously interpret the information as showing some implausibility of evolutionary theory's explanation.  It takes a concerted effort to apply such a bass-ackward input filter.

               It's simply assumed that since we have the front end (genotype) and the back end (phenotype) there must be a causal chain connecting them which accounts for the construction of all the organs and tissues of the body.

               But what if genes don't contain anything like a blueprint of the body but merely influence its development so as to promote differences between individuals?  Perhaps the actual basis of development is the ability of organic systems to directly mimic previous similar systems.

           And what if we decided to accept ideas merely because somebody suggests them without any evidence?  Perhaps this is the more reasonable approach even though logic and experience both dictate that such an approach is completely idiotic.

               It's not about physical laws determining the actions of passive matter but this gray area in which matter is not passive but takes the form of a complex system actively striving to maintain enough energy flow to stave off the ravages of entropy.

           "Actively striving"?  Define "actively striving."  The photosynthetic reaction occurs in perfect congruence with the laws of the universe.  You don't need to attribute anything additional for an explanation.  Again, you're lacking parsimony.

           Who needs abstractions?  You don't understand chemistry, so you have to approach it as abstract?  Perhaps this is your problem.

               This is the kind of argument I expect to see from creationists.  It's simply a matter of shifting the context from womb to outer environment, and you're arguing against the viability of random mutation as the source of novelty in evolution.
              </div>
             </div>

           Oh dear me, no. The argument pertains to potential restrictions on
           <i>
            how
           </i>
           evolution can proceed, not
           <i>
            what
           </i>
           it can yield. Evolution can produce a human without gills or a swimbladder, but it can't necessarily streamline those features away entirely. That was in fact what you asked for: a genetic explanation for why certain features would be revised away in a particular manner.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Imagine you have some scaffolding covered in tarpaulin. It functions well enough as a domicile. Then, within and using the scaffolding, you construct a house, and you live for a while within the house within the scaffolding. Then you remove the tarpaulin, then you remove the scaffolding. That process of constructing houses can be arrived at by stepwise evolution: repeat it several times, adding one more modification each time.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           However, although it's possible in principle for houses to be built without ever using scaffolding, it may
           <i>
            not
           </i>
           be possible to evolve stepwise to such a process from the one above. The scaffolding may get in the way of the scaffold-less process of construction, so that has to be the first change you make to the process - except that without it, you can't build the house any more, so you need to change the house-building process first, except you can't because the scaffolding is in the way... your only option is to make two precisely complementary changes
           <i>
            simultaneously
           </i>
           , which is comparatively unlikely in an evolutionary scenario.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           None of this says anything about the ability of evolution to produce the result we're interested in: a process for constructing a house. It only speaks to the optimisations it can or cannot be reasonably expected to make to that process.

              Be careful of what you write.  Creationists could easily remove your words from their embryonic context and claim you're talking about the implausibility of evolution in general.

              And this is my point exactly.  Given the potential problems that can crop up during a lengthy gestation full of odd detours through the phylogenetic tree, embryogenesis ought to have been streamlined by the same process of random mutation that allows for advances in the adult form of the organism.  But it hasn't happened because &lt;snip&gt;

            </div>
           </div>
           ...of the reasons I've already laid out.

              He assumed that organisms possess no endogenous intelligence by which to adapt genes in accord with behavioral and morphogenetic adaptations.  Thus organisms cannot transmit their living adaptations to progeny.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           That does not entirely follow. The lack of any conceivable mechanism for reverse-engineering phenotypic change into genetic change precludes it happening in some ways, but there are other routes by which behavioural adaptations in particular can be transmitted between generations. The fact that animals raised in captivity - even naturally solitary ones - can struggle to function in the wild demonstrates that exogenous pathways for inheriting acquired behaviour exist within their species.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Indeed, that's yet another empirical nail in the morphic resonance coffin: if chicks can supposedly learn something as specific as 'don't peck the yellow LED' via morphic resonance, then no animal, wherever and however reared, should struggle to occupy its usual niche when released into the wild.
           <br/>

              He also arbitrarily disallowed the possibility that organisms transmit information in any kind of long-distance sense, such as the way a radio transmitter links up to disparate receivers on the basis of electromagnetic resonance.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           That's terribly woolly thinking. A reciever does not resonate with the transmitter, it resonates with the proximate electromagnetic waves. By what method do waves of 'chick averse to pecking yellow LEDs' propagate?

              But now, in light of "evo-devo" research, we discover that developmental genes are virtually identical in everything from people to flies.  What distinguishes us is the way in which our genes are operated, and this process of operating genes is as complex as anything we've ever found in nervous, endocrine or immune systems.  What's the point of explaining one complexity in terms of another?
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           The complexity of life is layered; cumulative. Just because genes are leveraged in a complex fashion now does not mean such was always the case, any more than the complexity of the genes themselves has been invariant, or the complexity of the macro forms produced by those systems. All life in existence today has had a few billions of years to accrue the most baroque complexity, so naturally understanding it is going to be difficult. We may never understand it entirely - but that doesn't mean there's nothing there to be understood. I don't see any merit in saying "That explanation is just so darn complicated, I can't understand it, so I've decided a different explanation that I can understand must be right instead".

              It's not about physical laws determining the actions of passive matter but this gray area in which matter is not passive but takes the form of a complex system actively striving to maintain enough energy flow to stave off the ravages of entropy.

              Sheldrake's notion of morphic resonance, far from being an oddball theory out of left field, is the crowning achievement in a long lineage of holistic thought in biology.

           Not really. You have no theoretical basis for determining what morphic resonance ought to be able to achieve and thus what you ought to test for: the constant goalpost-moving in response to my questions is evidence enough of that. And when your tests fail - as they did with the chick experiment - you simply invent a way of juggling, pruning and reinterpreting the results to fit your preconceptions. You still no doubt maintain that the chicks demonstrated increased aversion to the yellow LED, despite there being
           <i>
            no
           </i>
           evidence to that effect.

           Well, that's nice to know. Care to explain how it 'naturally' exhibits steeper attenuation with bacteria than with humans if there is no boundary to what constitutes 'a bacterium' in morphic resonance terms?
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Earlier you said this:
           <br/>
           <div class="bbcode_container">
            <div class="bbcode_quote">
             <div class="quote_container">

              What matters is the degree of similarity relative to the differences. If the differences are tiny, then resonance will occur only among very close similarities. This is presumably what would happen naturally, without any intelligent intervention.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           On the face of it, this makes no sense whatsoever. If the differences are tiny, then morphic resonance should be strong. But here you're saying that if the differences are tiny, morphic resonance will be weak unless the differences are
           <i>
            really
           </i>
           tiny.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           That's clearly nonsense. All you're saying is that you get to make it up as you go along: you get to look at two humans and say 'yeah, close enough to resonate' and then look at two bacteria of different species that are far, far more similar than any two humans and say 'Yeah, but they could be
           <i>
            even more
           </i>
           similar so they won't resonate'.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           <i>
            Because
           </i>
           that's clearly nonsense, I gave you the benefit of the doubt and presumed you had merely clumsily worded a quite different idea: that resonance is based on the
           <i>
            actual
           </i>
           degree of difference compared to the
           <i>
            potential
           </i>
           degree of difference. Except that still doesn't work because to measure 'potential' you need to draw a circle around what counts as 'a bacterium' and measure its diameter - and you can't do that without imposing arbitrary classifications, which you've just said morphic resonance doesn't.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           So I suppose we have to fall back to the original interpretation where we throw any notion of a metric of similarity out of the window and you get to decide how similar two organisms are on a passing whim.

              Instead of determining the process, maybe alterations in DNA during speciation merely mark at the genetic level the real action taking place in the resonance between current and past organic forms.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           You've already said morphic resonance does not propagate molecular details, so no, maybe they don't. Nor do I see what we gain by replacing the admittedly mind-bendingly complex but empirically successful bottom-up view with this even more rarified top-down flight of fancy.

           Point being that all randomly driven evolution is unlikely compared to intelligently driven evolution, as Darwin originally conceived it.  Because the intelligence of the organism has been removed from the equation, it's popped up again in the form of intelligent design.  Hence the creationist monkey on reductionism's back.

              Indeed, that's yet another empirical nail in the morphic resonance coffin: if chicks can supposedly learn something as specific as 'don't peck the yellow LED' via morphic resonance, then no animal, wherever and however reared, should struggle to occupy its usual niche when released into the wild.

           Morphic resonance is not magic.  It doesn't perform miracles.  An animal with no experience in the wild is going to have a very tough time adjusting, even with the help of species-wide holistic memory.

           .  Paley claims that life is the product of God's mechanical genius.  An organism gains its form through divine craftsmanship.  Call it the intelligence theory of life.  The second theory was proposed by August Weismann in the 1890s.  An organism gains its form through the inheritance of morphogenetic information contained in its germ-plasm.  The complex organism is effectively "reduced" to its germ-plasm (genes).  Though the organism is still a machine, its "maker" is whatever random mutations in its genes happen to be beneficial and are therefore environmentally selected.  The first theory was undone by evolution, while the second theory was undone by evo-devo and the refutation of reduction from complex body to simple genome.  These are the mechanistic theories, and both are wholly discredited.  To continue clinging to the second is no more scientific than clinging to the first.  There is no longer any difference, so far as scientific credibility is concerned, between a creationist and a reductionist.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The next two theories are holistic, and the dispute between them is the fundamental concern of 21st century biology.  First we have the theory coming into focus under the guise of complexity theory, which is derived primarily from the study of nonequilibrium thermodynamics.  Life originated from self-organized chemical systems characterized by autocatalytic reactions, meaning that the result of the final reaction sets the stage for the first step.  The processes occurring in our cells are simply continuations of autocatalytic reactions that began four billion years ago.  Species are differentiated via genes which, rather than containing information for the construction of the organism, merely channel the autocatalysis in a slightly different direction, causing a different outcome at the morphological level.  This is akin to C.H. Waddington's concept of chreodes, whereby a hillside is carved with grooves that represent developmental pathways, and ontogeny is represented by a ball rolling down the hill.  The function of genes is to redirect the ball from one set of grooves to another.  Since the body is not reduced to genetic information but is taken as a holistic, complex system, the fatal flaw in reductionist information theory is avoided.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Much like Michael Shermer arguing against creationists, I've spent far too much time battling proponents of a failed theory.  The complexity theory of life is formidable.  It is not easily falsified, as is the reductionist model which, after all, never had any evidence to back it up.  As Stephen Jay Gould pointed out, from the time of Weismann forward, no one ever proposed a testable hypothesis that could either verify or refute the reduction of organisms to morphological information.  It was simply assumed, due to lack of imagination, precisely the problem with creationists, who simply can't imagine how life could exist without an intelligent designer.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           However, as brilliant as the complexity theory is, it still falls short of a convincing explanation of life.  Where is the explanation of atavism?  Where is the explanation of parallel evolution?  What about personal memory?  What about consciousness and intelligence?  And can we really account for the activities of cells without any kind of coordinating force, such as the electromagnetic force that lines up magnetic particles?  The fourth theory of life, proposed almost simultaneously by physicist Walter Elsasser and biologist Rupert Sheldrake, accepts the holistic framework of complexity theory but adds to it an inherent memory by which organisms negotiate the many biochemical pathways at their disposal.  Choices are made unconsciously in accord with whatever the organism has always done before.  During development of new structures, it does what its kind has always done before.  In novel situations, it can use its intelligence to set out on a new course.  Out of the organism's inherent memory is derived mind and all the seemingly impossible properties that follow from it, including representational intelligence.  In short, organic order in matter leaves a wake in mind, and this wake then informs subsequent activity.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Perhaps the memory theory of life is incorrect, and somehow the complexity theory will account for all known features of life.  I doubt it.  Nonetheless, this is where the action is.  If you want to be relevant to the science of life as it unfolds in the coming years, you will need to get a solid grounding in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, not to mention the dynamics of instability, a.k.a. "chaos theory."

              Not really. You have no theoretical basis for determining what morphic resonance ought to be able to achieve and thus what you ought to test for: the constant goalpost-moving in response to my questions is evidence enough of that.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           There has been no moving of the goalpost, and frankly, you're starting to come across as arrogant.  How would you know that morphic resonance is untestable if you haven't studied the theory?  That you presume to know is evidence of your failure to take on a proper scientific outlook.  First become acquainted with the theory.  Then criticize it.  No one who's acquainted with the theory doubts its testability.  That's not even an issue.  The issue is whether it has passed its tests.

              And when your tests fail - as they did with the chick experiment - you simply invent a way of juggling, pruning and reinterpreting the results to fit your preconceptions. You still no doubt maintain that the chicks demonstrated increased aversion to the yellow LED, despite there being
              <i>
               no
              </i>
              evidence to that effect.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           It appears that your critique is correct.  There was no absolute increase in aversion in the test group.  The only increase was relative to the control group.  Both groups decreased their aversion with each subsequent batch, but the control group did so more rapidly.  Thank you for clearing up my confusion on this issue.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           It is odd though, don't you think, that each time a new batch of chicks went into the cage, they pecked more readily than previous batches?  No one would have predicted that.  It seems inconceivable to me that this trend could be attributed to improved skills of the lab-tech throughout the entire experiment.  Sure, the first day or two, but the whole run?  Not likely.  It's certainly anomalous.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           There is one more point to be made, however.  The first batch of test chicks were injected with saline solution after pecking the yellow LED.  Subsequent chicks were far more averse to the yellow LED than the chrome LED.  How else can we explain this except with morphic resonance?  As Sheldrake noted, what's important is not the absolute willingness to peck yellow LEDs but the chicks' willingness to peck them relative to the chrome LEDs.  The results bear out this crucial difference.  Despite my misunderstanding of the experiment, which you've kindly corrected, it still appears to bolster the hypothesis.  The mistake was mine, not Sheldrake's.

               Point being that all randomly driven evolution is unlikely compared to intelligently driven evolution, as Darwin originally conceived it.  Because the intelligence of the organism has been removed from the equation, it's popped up again in the form of intelligent design.  Hence the creationist monkey on reductionism's back.

           For the third time now you're equivocating between results and the process by which those results are achieved. Stepwise evolution of a process can yield the results we're interested in, but not necessarily the optimal process by which those results might be achieved. That is the answer to your original question concerning recapitulation; this whole 'creationist monkey' diversion is a red herring.

              Morphic resonance is not magic.  It doesn't perform miracles.  An animal with no experience in the wild is going to have a very tough time adjusting, even with the help of species-wide holistic memory.

           See, this is the kind of thing I mean when I talked about goalpost moving. The lack of metrics means it feels like you get to make it up as you go along.  On the one hand you expect to see chicks becoming averse to pecking an LED within just a few weeks, while on the other you see no problem with millions upon millions of years of morphic instinct evaporating in a single generation. I find that horribly contradictory.

           Not at all - the fact is receivers do not resonate with transmitters. You cannot gloss over that when describing morphic resonance - how much big science is being done to identify the carrier waves of properties like gravity?

              This is disrespectful.  You know, I don't have to continue talking to you.  I'm trying to help you by steering you away from the cult of reductionism, which cannot accept its demise no matter how obvious (and it was obvious long before evo-devo came along and definitively finished it off).  I hate to see bright young people taken in by cults, creationist or otherwise.

           I'm sorry for speaking harshly about something close to your heart, but when you hold up Sheldrake's 'chick' experiment as evidence, and stand by it no matter how many times its flaws are exposed, it tarnishes whatever value your message might possess. For morphic resonance to have any kind of credibility you must distance yourself from bad science done in its name, and Sheldrake's chick experiment - and especially his write-up - was bad science.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I think you've been a bit hasty in branding me a reductionist and thus dismissing me out of hand. I'm quite aware of the fact that one cannot always arbitrarily divide a system in half and understand each half in isolation - my day job would be much easier if you could. But nor do I fall into the 'what use is half an eye?' trap. While an eye can and should be understood holistically, it can also be understood in terms of the incremental steps by which it attained its modern form. That can tell us a great deal about what is steering the process: is it goal-based and holistic, results-fed and reductionist, or a bit of both on different levels? The fact the end result is very complicated does not on its own give us the answer, as you seem to think it does - we need to investigate the stages by which that complexity accrued.
           <br/>

              There has been no moving of the goalpost, and frankly, you're starting to come across as arrogant.  How would you know that morphic resonance is untestable if you haven't studied the theory?  That you presume to know is evidence of your failure to take on a proper scientific outlook.  First become acquainted with the theory.  Then criticize it.  No one who's acquainted with the theory doubts its testability.  That's not even an issue.  The issue is whether it has passed its tests.

            </div>
           </div>
           Perhaps it's my fault. When you talk about two humans resonating and two bacteria not, it's hard for me to conceive of one set of goalposts that could accommodate both observations without rendering the theory of morphic resonance purely descriptive. Similarly, when you talk about chicks learning to avoid a yellow LED in a few weeks while simultaneously saying the instantaneous loss of million-year-old wild instincts isn't a problem.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The former in particular sits very ill with me. What exactly is it about bacteria that would induce such a tremendously steep attenuation of morphic resonance compared to two humans? Your earlier reply, that their similarity means small differences matter more, is a contradiction. If A, B and C are all creatures, and A is more similar to B than to C, then A and B should resonate more strongly, right? Only you're saying that because A and B are more similar the differences matter more, so they resonate
           <i>
            less
           </i>
           than A and C. Uhhhhh....

              It appears that your critique is correct.  There was no absolute increase in aversion in the test group.  The only increase was relative to the control group.  Both groups decreased their aversion with each subsequent batch, but the control group did so more rapidly.  Thank you for clearing up my confusion on this issue.

              It is odd though, don't you think, that each time a new batch of chicks went into the cage, they pecked more readily than previous batches?  No one would have predicted that.  It seems inconceivable to me that this trend could be attributed to improved skills of the lab-tech throughout the entire experiment.  Sure, the first day or two, but the whole run?  Not likely.  It's certainly anomalous.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           It depends upon what scope for improvement there is. I look at the results and see a short familiarisation period where bumbling ineptitude gives way to competence, followed by a more gradual gaining of expertise. To the best of my knowledge, all non-trivial activities follow a similar pattern.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Without knowing what the procedure actually was it's hard to speculate, but I can imagine the lab tech getting more adept at both physically wielding the stimuli and picking up and responding appropriately to signs of interest on the part of the chicks. Remember, the chicks were far less interested in the chrome pin than the yellow LED in absolute terms, so there's much more of a scope for improvement on the part of the lab tech.

              There is one more point to be made, however.  The first batch of test chicks were injected with saline solution after pecking the yellow LED.  Subsequent chicks were far more averse to the yellow LED than the chrome LED.  How else can we explain this except with morphic resonance?
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           I think that might be a misunderstanding.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Every batch of test chicks and control chicks were injected with something after pecking the LED or chrome pin. In the case of the test chicks the injection contained lithium chloride which made them mildly ill, in the case of the control chicks the injection was pure saline and didn't make them ill. That constituted the 'training' phase of each batch. Those
           <i>
            exact same chicks
           </i>
           (both the test and control groups) were then exposed to both the chrome pin and the yellow LED in order to establish whether any greater or lesser aversion to either had been induced by the training. This was the 'test' phase of each batch. Both these phases were performed with each daily batch of chicks.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           There are therefore two kinds of results we can observe: changes in latency of a single batch of chicks between their first and second exposure to the chrome pin or yellow LED, and any trends in those latencies over the course of the experiment. The results were as follows:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           1. Trained on Chrome (not made sick), Tested on Chrome:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           In any given control batch, chicks on average exhibited no detectable change in aversion between training and testing on the chrome pin. There was an unexpected overall downward trend in the aversion of each successive batch over the course of the experiment.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           2. Trained on Chrome (not made sick), Tested on LED:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The LED was, as noted, much more attractive than the chrome pin, so it's not meaningful to compare the training/testing results. There was no trend toward increased aversion to the LED over the course of the experiment. However, Sheldrake
           <i>
            reports
           </i>
           this as an increase in aversion by subtracting or dividing the results from 1. above.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           3. Trained on LED (made sick), tested on Chrome:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Again, becase the LED was much more attractive than the chrome pin, comparisons between training and testing results are meaningless. The chrome pin latencies followed the same downward trend as elsewhere.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           4. Trained on LED (made sick), tested on LED:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Pronounced increase in aversion between training and testing: these chicks had learned their lesson. Still no trend toward increased aversion to the LED on the part of each successive batch over the course of the experiment. Again, Sheldrake reports this as an increase in aversion by subtracting or dividing by the chrome pin results.
           <br/>
           <div class="bbcode_container">
            <div class="bbcode_quote">

              <div class="bbcode_quote_container">
              </div>
              As Sheldrake noted, what's important is not the absolute willingness to peck yellow LEDs but the chicks' willingness to peck them relative to the chrome LEDs.  The results bear out this crucial difference.  Despite my misunderstanding of the experiment, which you've kindly corrected, it still appears to bolster the hypothesis.  The mistake was mine, not Sheldrake's.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           The mistake is to assume that the same trend underlies both the control results and the test results, which is what would need to be true for the
           <i>
            divergence
           </i>
           in the results to require further explanation. I don't feel that's a safe assumption for two reasons:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           1. If the divergence was evident and the control group showed the expected
           <i>
            lack
           </i>
           of a trend, I feel we would be justified in looking for an explanation favourable to morphic resonance. One anomaly, one explanation. Such was not the case. Sheldrake must therefore propose not one but two forces at work: experimenter experience influencing both sets of results equally, counteracted by morphic resonance in the case of the yellow LED. But if experimenter experience is a factor, why can't it be the sole explanation for the chrome pin trend, end of story?
           <br/>
           <br/>
           2. If the stimuli were equivalently attractive to the chicks to begin with, I feel we might be justified in attaching significance to the later divergence of the results. However, the chicks always preferred the yellow LED, so much so it would have been
           <i>
            impossible
           </i>
           for the trend in the control results to be reflected in the test results. Once you appreciate that, you can see how flawed Sheldrake's interpretation was.
           <b>
            Experimental capping made it impossible for the LED results to exhibit the downward trend Sheldrake assumes was counteracted by morphic resonance.
           </b>

Because the intelligence of the organism has been removed from the equation, it's popped up again in the form of intelligent design. Hence the creationist monkey on reductionism's back."

               For the third time now you're equivocating between results and the process by which those results are achieved. Stepwise evolution of a process can yield the results we're interested in, but not necessarily the optimal process by which those results might be achieved. That is the answer to your original question concerning recapitulation; this whole 'creationist monkey' diversion is a red herring.
              </div>
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           You're creating a false distinction.  Randomly-driven novelty can yield the relevant results - - but not necessarily.  So too, randomly-driven novelty can generate the optimal process which achieves those results - - but not necessarily.  There's no fundamental difference between the results and the optimum route of achieving them.  In both cases, maybe random mutation will produce the relevant outcome - - or maybe not.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Even if the unlikelihood of producing the optimum route is greater than the unlikelihood of producing the optimum results, it's still all extremely unlikely in any given case.  But hey, over enough time, even the loftiest peaks of Mt. Improbable can be scaled by a process of evolution dependent on random mutation - - right?
           <br/>
           <br/>
           By the way, not all evolution is necessarily stepwise.  Just as the complex structure of a tornado emerges in full out of nothing more than a temperature gradient, many features of organisms may emerge in full without having to be built up stepwise.  As biology moves away from reductionism and toward complexity theory, a key argument of creationism will be nullified.

              See, this is the kind of thing I mean when I talked about goalpost moving. The lack of metrics means it feels like you get to make it up as you go along.  On the one hand you expect to see chicks becoming averse to pecking an LED within just a few weeks, while on the other you see no problem with millions upon millions of years of morphic instinct evaporating in a single generation. I find that horribly contradictory.

            </div>
           </div>
           I would find that contradictory as well.  So it's a good thing I never claimed that millions of years of collective memory evaporate in a single generation.  Memory is precisely that which does not disappear with time.  It's just that as populations evolve into new species, they no longer tune in to their ancestral populations.  Still, there's never a complete break.  Just as a twig is still connected to its branch, a species remains mnemically bound to its genus.

              <br/>
              <br/>
              Not at all - the fact is receivers do not resonate with transmitters. You cannot gloss over that when describing morphic resonance - how much big science is being done to identify the carrier waves of properties like gravity?
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           None, of course.  It's well known that there's no carrier of either gravitational or electromagnetic waves.  Though the existence of such a carrier was assumed in the classical era of science, the "luminiferous ether" was refuted by the Michelson-Morley experiment (or more specifically Einstein's interpretation of Michelson-Morley).  Genetic reductionism is the ether of the 20th century, positing genes as the carrier of biological inheritance when no such carrier is necessary.  Just as gravitational and electromagnetic waves are propagated across space without any material intermediary, acquired adaptations are inherited without having to be carried on the backs of mutated genes.

           Weismannian-Mendelian theory, which ultimately came to be known as "the modern synthesis," (since superceded by evo-devo) posits that phenotypic changes are derivative of changes in genes.  (We now know that developmental genes stay the same while their epigenetic tags, also composed of DNA, are what mark evolutionary changes at the genetic level).  As to the overall egg cell donated by the mother, according to Haldane's synthesis, none of this material determines phenotypes.

              Perhaps the terminology is tripping me up, but why employ the term 'goal' with its connotations of intelligence?

            </div>
           </div>
           All self-organized complex systems have the goal of gradient reduction.  The movements of a tornado follow precisely the concentration of warm air near the surface.  So, is a tornado intelligent?  Surely we can agree that this is not the case.  Yet it is goal-directed.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I think what this means is that intelligence evolves out of the germ of goal-direction.  Once again, we see how life not only involves evolution but is a

            product
           </i>
           of evolution.

              For morphic resonance to have any kind of credibility you must distance yourself from bad science done in its name, and Sheldrake's chick experiment - and especially his write-up - was bad science.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           Absolutely not.  Rose and his team ran the experiment beautifully.  He assumed that so long as the experiment was performed in his lab under his direction that he would be able to definitely refute morphic resonance.  When he failed, he tried to conceal the results through selective use of the data.  Now that's bad science.

              Perhaps it's my fault. When you talk about two humans resonating and two bacteria not, it's hard for me to conceive of one set of goalposts that could accommodate both observations without rendering the theory of morphic resonance purely descriptive.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           Again, you're attributing words to me that I've never spoken.  I've never said anything about two bacteria not resonating (assuming they're the same kind of bacteria, and one bacterium precedes the other in time).  Morphic resonance operates on the basis of similarity.  The most similar thing to a given organism is itself.  Thus a bacteria resonates with itself foremost and its predecessors secondarily.  If the differences between species of bacteria are smaller than the differences between, say, primate species, then bacterial resonance is narrower than primate resonance.  Nonetheless, so long as there are similarities in contrast to differences, resonance will occur.  It's only natural.

              Every batch of test chicks and control chicks were injected with something after pecking the LED or chrome pin. In the case of the test chicks the injection contained lithium chloride which made them mildly ill, in the case of the control chicks the injection was pure saline and didn't make them ill. That constituted the 'training' phase of each batch. Those
              <i>
               exact same chicks
              </i>
              (both the test and control groups) were then exposed to both the chrome pin and the yellow LED in order to establish whether any greater or lesser aversion to either had been induced by the training. This was the 'test' phase of each batch. Both these phases were performed with each daily batch of chicks.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           This is the part I was missing.  I read the description of the test procedure yet didn't grasp the divide between training phase and testing phase.  To me, testing was just another word for training.  This caused untold confusion in my ability to understand the results.  Thanks again.

              There are therefore two kinds of results we can observe: changes in latency of a single batch of chicks between their first and second exposure to the chrome pin or yellow LED, and any trends in those latencies over the course of the experiment. The results were as follows:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              1. Trained on Chrome (not made sick), Tested on Chrome:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              In any given control batch, chicks on average exhibited no detectable change in aversion between training and testing on the chrome pin. There was an unexpected overall downward trend in the aversion of each successive batch over the course of the experiment.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              2. Trained on Chrome (not made sick), Tested on LED:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The LED was, as noted, much more attractive than the chrome pin, so it's not meaningful to compare the training/testing results. There was no trend toward increased aversion to the LED over the course of the experiment. However, Sheldrake
              <i>
               reports
              </i>
              this as an increase in aversion by subtracting or dividing the results from 1. above.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           Okay, this is where you go wrong.  The mean latency of chicks tested with the control chrome bead falls, while the latency of these same chicks tested with the yellow diode rises.  The trends move in opposite directions, not the same direction, as you've asserted.  Rose simply left this result out of his paper.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Moreover, you've overlooked a crucial point in the training phase of the experiment, during which "naive chicks" revealed an increasing aversion to the yellow diode with each successive batch.  This figure is arrived at by using Rose's own proportional methodology of comparing the number of chicks who pecked within ten seconds to the total number of chicks trained.  Because previous chicks who pecked at the yellow diode were injected with lithium chloride, newly trained chicks showed an aversion to pecking at the yellow diode.  In other words, their collective memory was weighing on them, discouraging them from pecking at the bright, attractive diode.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           It seems I conceded too much ground in my last post.  Go back to the original paper.  You will find the results of the increased aversion among subsequent batches of training chicks in figure 3.  The increased aversion among chrome-tested chicks to the yellow diode is presented in figure 5.

In other words, their collective memory was weighing on them, discouraging them from pecking at the bright, attractive diode.

              <br/>
              It seems I conceded too much ground in my last post. Go back to the original paper. You will find the results of the increased aversion among subsequent batches of training chicks in figure 3.

           "Fig. 3 - Proportion of naive chicks in successive three-day periods that did not peck within the first 10s at the test stimulus, the yellow LED, during the initial training procedure (p= 0.610). "
           <br/>
           <br/>
           p = 0.610 = this result is not statistically significant, even if you can draw a line through the data and eyeball it to see a rise.  There is not a strong enough pattern in the data to draw any conclusions.

            difference
           </i>
           in latency between saline injected chicks pecking the normal bead and the yellow diode, not whatever you think it shows.  Not only that but the results do not change significantly over the trial "p= 0.169 for the chromium-plated bead; p= 0.121 for the yellow light). " - there are only differences once the two results are
