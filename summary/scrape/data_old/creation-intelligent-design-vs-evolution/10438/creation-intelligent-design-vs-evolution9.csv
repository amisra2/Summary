"06-06-2008","10438",9,"dace","312652","As to peeling, it seems I've given him too much credit. Yes, he's bright, but he too demonstrates the smug self-certainty of the narcissist. Like electrolyte, he notes that people often give up talking to him after awhile. Unable to reflect on his ingrained inflexibility, he assumes it's because no one can keep up with his brilliant argumentation, which consists mostly of rapid-fire irrelevancies that nonetheless carry the superficial impression of plausibility. Again, there's no point bothering with someone whose only interest is defense of his own prior belief system. Incredibly, he still thinks he has a point about the invoking of preconditions to evade falsification, though as I've noted twice now, whatever applies to morphic resonance in this context also applies to genetic information. He still doesn't get it that embryogenesis ought to have streamlined according to neo-Darwinism but not according to Darwin's view, whereby organisms make adaptations in the context of the outer environment and pass them along to their offspring. If genetic mutation is the source of novelty, then it's not the organism doing the work of evolving but its genes. Instead of adapting, the animal can only hope that a useful adaptation will pop up at some point from its germ-plasm. That adaptations must enter the germline in order to be heritable is a problem for neo-Darwinism. Nowhere in his many randomly shifting responses has he demonstrated that he understands this simple point. Why do certain people make use of their intelligence to evade the truth instead of grasping it? That's really all that's left to discuss here. As to the Rose experiment, the corrected version is now up. The key findings are contained in figures 3 and 5. Chicks injected with a harmless solution appear to have been influenced by the experience of chicks who were injected with lithium chloride after pecking at a yellow diode. In the initial training period, each chick was exposed to the control or LED for a period of 30s, and the number of seconds taken to the first peck was recorded with a stopwatch. <snip> Chicks that did not peck at all within the test period were recorded as having a latency of 30s, and these ""untrained"" chicks were dropped from the experiment , although they were left in their pens.","Peeling","312655","An analysis predicated on the unshakeable conviction that you must be right I think if you check back over our exchanges, you'll find that my 'defensive' statements were limited to the occasions where you raised strawman arguments against existing theories: the macaw, the patchiness of embryogenetic streamlining, the induction of instinctive behaviour. From those criticisms of your poor application of logic you have chosen to infer that I am wedded to a particular evolutionary mechanism. I doubt there is anything I can say to convince you otherwise at this point, since you have arrived at what is for you a satisfactory conclusion and will in all likelihood be reluctant to abandon it. The bulk of my posts has been devoted to a critique of your theory and its supporting evidence. Noted quite wrongly, however. Hypotheses about particular information being encoded genetically can be positively tested and falsified. No such test exists for morphic resonance - or at least, you seem unable or unwilling to describe one. Assuming for the sake of argument that I'm right about Sheldrake's experiment and it shows no evidence of morphic resonance at work, would that in any way falsify the theory? This is a question you've avoided answering several times now, I can only surmise because the answer is not favourable to your cause. I don't 'get it' because the logic you've tried to wield in support of this misapprehension began poorly and deteriorated as time passed. I get the impression you weren't expecting to be challenged on this point. In the same empirically-established way that a group of ten bacteria will in all likelihood not hit upon a billion-to-one mutation while a billion-strong colony probably will, it is inevitable that some events - particularly those requiring multiple simultaneous and complementary changes - will be unlikely to occur within the available population. With no evidence to support your case, you've simply asserted that particular optimisations to embryogenesis lie on the scaleable faces of Mt Improbable. There's no way you can make any safe deductions from that. If you had some figures to back you up it would be a different story. Again, because it's not true. There are multiple sources of adaptive novelty. Recombination in sexually reproducing populations, for instance - a mechanism whose potency is only strengthened by the discovery of complex gene regulation. And again, we're standing in the shadow of the macaw strawman: the idea that the particular adaptive mutation or recombination that did happen is the one that species had to wait for. Quite. The results shown in figure 3 are utterly insignificant at p = 0.61. No scientist would infer an effect from such a result. Figure 5 is more interesting, since the results are at least close to being significant (p = 0.12). When reviewing the updated paper, however, I noticed this for the first time: Here we find the likely explanation for the (albeit insignificant) control-chick trend observed in figure 5. It also explains why the same trend would not be observed in the naive test chicks. Consider what is being said above: if a control chick does not peck at all when first presented with the chrome bead, it is removed from the experiment and never exposed to the yellow LED . That means that the 'chrome pin' results in figure 5 are the mean latency of all the control chicks, whereas the LED results in figure 5 are the mean latencies of the control chicks which had already pecked the chrome bead . In other words, those chicks who were generally sluggish and disinterested were excluded from the second phase of the experiment. Now consider the experimenter practice effect, which as we've noted Sheldrake invokes throughout the experiment. Look at figure 1. The number of control chicks pecking the chrome bead within 30 seconds progressively increases, which means that as the experiment proceeds, the experimenter's competence induces more and more sluggish, disinterested chicks to make it through to the second phase of the experiment and take a stab at the yellow LED. So rather than not contributing to the LED results at all, they now contribute high latencies, with the inevitable consequence that the proportion of birds with low latencies decreases. That explains why the same trend is not observed in the naive test chicks: all of them were presented with the yellow LED. There was no previous step to filter out the generally disinterested ones. A summary of the various 'trends' observed: 1. Control chick chrome pin mean latencies dropping (fig 5): As Sheldrake says, experimenter practice. 2. Control chick yellow LED mean latencies increasing (fig 5): See figure 1: experimenter practice meant the more sluggardly and disinterested chicks pecked the chrome pin and thus made it through to be tested against the yellow LED, increasing the number of high latencies recorded and thus inducing an apparent upward trend in the mean latencies. 3. Naive chicks not pecking the yellow LED within 10s (fig 3) Utterly insignificant result (p = 0.61), and that's even with the false positive from 2) factored in. 4. Deviation of test and control results (chrome pin vs yellow LED) (fig 4): Improving salesman vs good product 5. Deviation of means in control chicks (fig 6): This is a reformulation of figure 5, adding the two trends together. Unfortunately as noted above the LED trend is induced by the chrome pin trend, so Sheldrake is wrongly doubling up the effect. I think that more or less takes care of everything. It's nice to have an explanation for the discrepancy between the naive test chicks and the naive control chicks wrt. the yellow LED - at least it saves you from having to invent one.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","07:53 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","126"
"06-06-2008","10438",9,"dace","312652","Electrolyte, who imagines he's being stalked by a wascally wabbit... ... can't understand why WW and I would both react the same way to him. You see, most people get frustrated talking to someone who can't listen, who can't admit wrong and who loudly proclaims ad nauseum the imagined errors of those who don't see things his way. He's so fixed in his sense of authority that he can claim I'm wrong about the quaternary structure of protein even though he's not a biologist, and all my information comes from biologists. All we know is that genes are necessary in the formation of bodies, not that they contain information describing organic structures and instinctive behaviors. But it doesn't matter that I've explained this. But electrolyte doesn't know about NET, so it can't possibly be our current explanation, particularly since it's probabilistic, and our current explanation can only be deterministic. As to peeling, it seems I've given him too much credit. he [Peeling] assumes it's because no one can keep up with his brilliant argumentation... Again, there's no point bothering with someone whose only interest is defense of his own prior belief system. As to the Rose experiment, the corrected version is now up.","electrolyte","312665","Wow, no wonder dace thinks Sheldrake's writeup says exactly what dace wants it to say. He's capable of reading anything and thinking it says what he wants it to say. Watch: Stalked? I don't think this. When did I say this? When did I imply this? I didn't. Yet, here you are making the claim. And when did I say this? I have people who wind up on the business end of the Truth Stick of No Mercy react in the same general way all the time. It's that the arguments you forward -- every damn one of them -- are incredibly similar, your selective education is incredibly similar, your selective ignorance is incredibly similar, and your reactions are incredibly similar. Seriously, it's like you borrowed his brain (or else he left it in his pants pocket and you happened to find his lost pants). See? More similarity. Here, it's the projection we've come to know and love from both wabbit and Archangel. You can't listen: here I am explaining why what you say I said isn't what I said at all; you can't admit wrong: multiple people explained why Sheldrake's analysis is bunk, and Peeling did so exhaustively, but you maintain that it's great evidence for resonancism; you proclaim ad nauseam imagined errors: say, deterministic bias and inability to explain processes at the atomic/molecular level. You're right: I'm not a biologist. But I'm a biochemist and teacher, and all of my information comes from biochemists and molecular biologists. No, that's not ""all we know."" And -- just like wabbit -- you are trying to impart some meaning of ""information"" upon this topic when there is no reason to do so. Why do these things have to be ""described"" informationally? You whine and moan about Occam's razor, but when faced with a singular solution -- genetics -- you cry that there must be ""information"" and that the answer must be ""genetics and [something else]"" even though you have no evidence for the latter; in other words, you are purposely violating Occam's razor. I'll admit that I should have used more precise wording. My intent was to ask why we need to appeal to morphic resonance. ""What's wrong with our current explanations? How are these phenomena not explainable by appealing to the particles of the system (i.e. why do we need to invoke resonancism)?"" Nothing's wrong, they're not unexplainable, and we don't need to invoke resonancism. If we want to be technical, cell processes are also subject to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, yet we can explain those processes on the molecular level. Now yelling that NET makes you right is... well, dumb. Also note that despite my multiple responses to your statements in which you claimed to know a lot about crystals, pressures, and protein folding mechanisms, you came back with responses to only a couple. Peeling hardly needs me to defend him, but I don't think you've given him possibly enough. Perhaps you're just jealous that he can read. No, it's just that you can't. But that's not saying much. Pot, kettle. Kettle, pot. Discuss. And Peeling has ripped it (and your other points) to shreds, too.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","10:38 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","128"
