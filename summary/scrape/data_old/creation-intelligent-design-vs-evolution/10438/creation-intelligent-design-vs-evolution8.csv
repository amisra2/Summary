"05-21-2008","10438",8,"dace","311421","You're creating a false distinction. In both cases, maybe random mutation will produce the relevant outcome - - or maybe not. But hey, over enough time, even the loftiest peaks of Mt. Improbable can be scaled by a process of evolution dependent on random mutation - - right? By the way, not all evolution is necessarily stepwise. Just as the complex structure of a tornado emerges in full out of nothing more than a temperature gradient, many features of organisms may emerge in full without having to be built up stepwise. I would find that contradictory as well. So it's a good thing I never claimed that millions of years of collective memory evaporate in a single generation. Memory is precisely that which does not disappear with time. It's just that as populations evolve into new species, they no longer tune in to their ancestral populations. Still, there's never a complete break. Just as a twig is still connected to its branch, a species remains mnemically bound to its genus. Morphic resonance is not magic. It doesn't perform miracles. An animal with no experience in the wild is going to have a very tough time adjusting, even with the help of species-wide holistic memory. On the one hand you expect to see chicks becoming averse to pecking an LED within just a few weeks, while on the other you see no problem with millions upon millions of years of morphic instinct evaporating in a single generation. None, of course. It's well known that there's no carrier of either gravitational or electromagnetic waves. All self-organized complex systems have the goal of gradient reduction. Absolutely not. Rose and his team ran the experiment beautifully. He assumed that so long as the experiment was performed in his lab under his direction that he would be able to definitely refute morphic resonance. When he failed, he tried to conceal the results through selective use of the data. Now that's bad science. Again, you're attributing words to me that I've never spoken. I've never said anything about two bacteria not resonating (assuming they're the same kind of bacteria, and one bacterium precedes the other in time). Morphic resonance operates on the basis of similarity. The most similar thing to a given organism is itself. Thus a bacteria resonates with itself foremost and its predecessors secondarily. If the differences between species of bacteria are smaller than the differences between, say, primate species, then bacterial resonance is narrower than primate resonance. Okay, this is where you go wrong. The mean latency of chicks tested with the control chrome bead falls, while the latency of these same chicks tested with the yellow diode rises. The trends move in opposite directions Moreover, you've overlooked a crucial point in the training phase of the experiment, during which ""naive chicks"" revealed an increasing aversion to the yellow diode with each successive batch. This figure is arrived at by using Rose's own proportional methodology of comparing the number of chicks who pecked within ten seconds to the total number of chicks trained. It seems I conceded too much ground in my last post. Go back to the original paper. You will find the results of the increased aversion among subsequent batches of training chicks in figure 3. The increased aversion among chrome-tested chicks to the yellow diode is presented in figure 5.","Peeling","311475","No, I'm not. Stepwise adjustments to a process resulting in a different outcome and optimisations to a process preserving the same outcome are not equivalently difficult problems for evolution to solve. Maybe a coin will land heads ten times in a row - or maybe not. Maybe it will land heads up a thousand times in a row - or maybe not. Hey look: I managed to phrase those statements so they sound similar - that must mean I can use them interchangeably! You cannot equivocate between events of radically different probability like that. Furthermore, it's meaningless to say that both are possible without reference to the number of opportunities available for each event. So long as there is, somewhere on that mountain, a gradient that can be scaled by the available opportunities for variation, yes. What you're doing is picking an arbitrary piece of rockface, claiming that evolution ought to be able to scale it, and complaining when it can't. Which pretty much misses the whole point of the Mt Improbable analogy. 'Next thing you know' is not the same as 'instantly fully formed'. That was not what I was referring to. It was perfectly clear what I was talking about : I find it ludicrous to suppose that something as esoteric, novel and specific as aversion to a yellow LED could propagate within weeks, while literally millions of years of resonating species memory could fail to inform an animal raised in captivity how to behave in the wild. Evasiveness is not an attractive quality. I'll say it again: receivers do not resonate with transmitters but with electromagnetic waves - do you contend that there are waves of 'chick averse to yellow LED' propagating through the universe? No, it has the effect of gradient reduction. Why introduce teleological terms to describe an effect? The experiment was performed just fine, but it was a bad experiment in principle. First, it failed to exclude enough factors for the proposed effect to be reliably discerned, and second the LED results were too close to the experimental cap for trends in both directions to register. Sheldrake's write-up is worse science because it ignores both these problems. Why narrower and not stronger? You can't have both the strength of the resonance and the attenuation of the resonance based on the similarity between two organisms because the two effects conflict with each other. More similar = more resonance, yet more similar = steeper attenuation = less resonance. If I have two organisms and tell you nothing except the fact they are 90% similar, you cannot tell me how strongly they should resonate, can you? You've nothing to base the attenuation upon. I could be talking about two bacteria, two primates, two anything. Now think: if I tell you it's two bacteria, what information are you using to arrive at the decision that the attenuation should be steep? Answer: you're using your knowledge of what counts as a bacteria to decide that 90% similarity is not that high, relatively speaking. You're using the definition of 'bacteria' as your benchmark for potential variability. You don't include yeast cells in your estimate because you know they don't 'count'. But why don't they count? If A and B are both bacteria and C is a yeast cell, why isn't C an example of a really, really different kind of A? Unless you arbitrarily draw a line around what's allowed to count, a line chosen to yield the 'right' answer, there's no reason to suppose the existence of yeast cells - or primates for that matter - wouldn't broaden the attenuation of bacterial morphic resonance beyond the species level. No, they dont. They merely diverge, in the same way that a man whose parachute has worked will diverge from a man whose parachute hasn't. The 'trend' in figure 3 is in no way statistically significant (p=0.6, compared to the typical required value of 0.05). Figure 5 shows the LED results with the chrome pin results subtracted. I'll reiterate for clarity: there was no statistically significant trend towards increased aversion to the yellow LED. There was a statistically significant trend towards decreased aversion with respect to the chrome pin. Sheldrake himself explains this via increasing competence on the part of the experimenter. He assumes the divergence between the chrome and LED results is caused by two factors: 1. Equally increasing competence on the part of the experimenter with both the chrome pin and LED (so the graphs should look the same all else being equal) 2. Morphic resonance precisely offsetting factor 1 (making the graphs diverge and removing all sign of a secular trend from the LED results) These assumptions are unfounded for three reasons: 1. Sheldrake himself asserts that competence with the two stimuli advanced differently earlier in the experiment - what justification does he have for supposing this has changed? 2. The LED and chrome pin were not inherently equally attractive to the chicks, so improving experimental technique would inevitably influence the chrome pin results more strongly than the LED results. Thus any trend induced by equally increasing experimental competence with the two stimuli would be a divergent one (as seen), not a parallel one as Sheldrake assumed. I dub this the 'bad product, good salesman' effect: a good salesman will improve the sales of a bad product more significantly than he will improve the sales of a product that sells itself. 3. The LED results were experimentally capped, such that it would be impossible for them to exhibit the same trend as the chrome pin results, even if morphic resonance aversion had been removed from the equation by not making the LED-trained chicks sick.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","07:59 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","106"

This is the point of Dawkins' Mt. Improbable analogy. But it doesn't happen because there's no survival pressure on the embryo, and this, as Darwin correctly observed, is what drives evolution. No amount of information is enough when the receiver is broken. For instance, children who are not exposed to language never learn to understand sentences or to speak coherently. The language instinct won't kick in unless the preconditions are in place. This is true whether we regard the instinct as being encoded in genes, as Chomsky suggests, or if it's passed onto us holistically by past speakers. Either way, if the preconditions for reception aren't in place, it doesn't catch. For animals introduced to the wild, their instincts may not kick in, regardless of whether those instincts are conveyed to them holistically or genetically. Receivers do not resonate with electromagnetic waves. The charged particles in receivers are excited into motion by electromagnetic waves, thereby bringing the receiver into resonance with the transmitter of those waves. Morphic resonance does not operate across space. It operates across time. Another way of saying this is that time is two-fold. On the one hand, time is in motion. We see this perfectly well all around us, moment to moment. On the other hand, time is perfectly still. We see this within, in our consciousness of presence. No matter what time it is, it's always now. Five minutes ago, now was five minutes ago. Five minutes hence, now will be five minutes hence. Time is absolute presence, and via consciousness we are plugged in, each of us in our mind a microcosm of the absolute presence of time. The material present is always in motion, but the mental present is always the same. Only from the point of view of matter-energy-space is time on the move: one moment disappears as another moment takes it place, and so on. From the point of view of mind, time is not passage but accumulation. The absolute now is always expanding, taking in more and more of the past. The material configuration of a body is always changing, but the presence of its form is absolute. For mind, past is present and therefore always informing what is currently materializing. The now of material presence is locked in the embrace of absolute presence. This is what enables morphic resonance. No need to posit waves of form traversing the universe. When the effect involves a system achieving its goal, or telos. There's no way of understanding the motions of the particles comprising a tornado without considering the telos of gradient reduction. It's not as if abstract laws of physics are determining every little particulate motion. The only law driving the system is the 2nd law of thermodynamics, which demands that in order to maintain active, a system must compensate for energy loss due to entropy by drawing in more energy. This it achieves by reducing a temperature or pressure gradient. Only the strength of the resonance is based on the similarity of the organisms. The attenuation is based on the general, background similarity of the species to which the organisms belong. Strength comes from foreground while attenuation comes from background. This is a really interesting observation.

The point of Mt Improbable is not that a leap up the sheer cliff face to the summit is possible 'given enough time', but that the sheer cliff face is not necessarily the only route to the top. If there is a gentler gradient, each step along which is evolutionarily plausible, higher ridges and peaks may be attained without undue difficulty. More pertinent to the example at hand, the Mt Improbable argument does not state that there must always be a scaleable slope to any given peak - only that we should never find organisms atop such peaks unless there is . And in the case of streamlined embryogenesis, we don't. That's fine: Mt Improbable can covered in such lifeless, inaccessible outcrops for all we care. So long as we can find a scaleable gradient to the places where we do find life, evolutionary theory is not compromised. Which is just another way of saying you can make it up as you go along. If I manage to convince you the chick experiment was flawed, you can simply say that the preconditions for reception must not have been met. No possible observation can shake your conviction in morphic resonance. Then why don't captive animals exhibit physical deformities? If the reciever is as 'broken' as you claim, why isn't its 'general form' compromised? Isn't it strange that the 'missing data' the breakage of resonance induces just happens to correspond to the skills it would have learned from its parents had they been present? Occam's razor makes carpaccio out of all this. Or one could equally say that the present moment merely contains static representations of a neighbouring configuration. Time capsules, as I recall them being referred to. Well that's ok then - for a moment I was worried that the notion might rely on some bizarrely implausible speculation Why not? Which has been exactly my point all along: you can't determine the resonant state of two organisms without introducing abstract classifications like 'species' to divide the surrounding world of lifeforms into those which contribute to attenuation and those which do not. If you dispense with such classifications, every organism, every single one, operates against exactly the same 'background' spectrum of lifeforms - you just insisted as much by denying that morphic resonance operates across space. Therefore, any two organisms should be subject to the same attenuation of resonance. Only by arbitrarily dividing up the background into 'counts' and 'doesn't count' can you fine-tune attenuation to fit observations.

Whoever posted the article online messed it up. What is purported to be figure 5 in the online version is actually figure 6. (You'll notice that the two figures are identical). Sheldrake is now aware of the discrepancy, but so far the error remains, so I'll have to describe the actual figure 5, as it appears in Biology Forum 86 (3/4), 1992, 431-44. First of all, there's no mention of ""test minus control"" on the left side of the figure. These are absolute numbers, not comparisons. Secondly, there are two trend lines, not one. The top line charts the change in latency of control chicks tested on chrome beads while the second line, underneath, charts the change in latency of control chicks tested on yellow LEDs. The top line slants downward while the bottom line slants upward. The three day results are displayed for chrome beads and yellow LEDs, and they clearly match the trend lines. So, as I said, and as Sheldrake says in his write-up, control chicks demonstrated increasing latency with the yellow LEDs, while they demonstrated decreasing latency with the chrome beads. The trends move in opposite directions, not at different speeds in the same directions. Rose simply left this result out of his analysis, as it contradicted his assumption against biological memory, a.k.a. morphic resonance. I should add that this is an odd assumption to make, since we experience memory constantly, and we have no reason to believe this experience is based on a computer-like storage of information in our brains. If memory is holistic, meaning not reducible to brains (which merely facilitate our consciousness of memory) then there's no reason to reject a priori the existence of collective memory. I apologize for the confusion. Figure 5 as it appears in Biology Forum shows absolute figures, not test minus control. As to the alleged insignificance of figure 3, even if this is true, it only demonstrates that the experiment should be replicated. A statistically insignificant result becomes significant when it keeps popping up with each replication. Sheldrake is not assuming increased competence on the part of the lab-tech throughout the experiment. He and Rose agreed the lab-tech got better initially, not that any further increase in competence occurred. Among control chicks, the yellow LED results did not exhibit the same trend as the chrome results. Aversion to the yellow LEDs increased while aversion to chrome beads decreased. The control chicks appeared to be influenced by the experience of test chicks, which were injected with lithium chloride after pecking the yellow LEDs. This would indicate collective memory. Distressed that his experiment not only failed to falsify but even verified Sheldrake's hypothesis, Rose backed out of his promise of jointly publishing the results. Unfortunately, his cowardice is not atypical of scientists faced with unanticipated results.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","03:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","109"

Naturally, given enough time, a species will locate the gentler slope so as to avoid the cliff. And I disagree that there are no scalable slopes for embryogensis. The reason we don't see evolution in embryological development is not that it's impossible from the point of view of random mutation but that novelty in bodily form is not driven primarily by random mutation. It is driven, as Darwin asserted, by the adaptations of organisms struggling for survival in a hostile environment and the inheritance of these adaptations by descendants. You snipped the most important part. ""Either way"" refers to genetic memory or holistic memory. Either way , if the preconditions for reception aren't in place, the information doesn't catch. You're arguing against your own theory. There isn't even an issue here. Again, to take the example of language acquisition, whether the language module comes to us via genes or resonance with past speakers, if you're not exposed to speech as a young child, you will never develop language. Got it? A completely groundless claim. Can any observation shake your conviction in genetic reductionism? You see how pointless such ad hominem comments are. They don't move the debate forward. It's not the receiver that's broken but rather the preconditions required for the receiver to do its job. No, there's nothing ""strange"" here. If an animal is never exposed to the wild, it lacks the necessary background for the instincts - - whether conveyed holistically or genetically - - to kick in. Obviously morphic resonance is a simpler explanation than relying on storage of relevant information via random genetic mutation. I mean, come on, are you serious? Every time we change our way of thinking or behaving, we have to wait around for just the right mutation in order for it become instinctive? Wouldn't it be simpler if we just resonate with our forebears, so the newly-formed instinct comes through with or without genetic change? Be careful. Occam is a double-edged razor. Time capsules do not contain representations. The representation occurs only in the mind of the person who opens the time capsule. What the capsule itself contains is matter arranged in a particular way. This is not the same as a representation. For material objects, the law is A = A (the law of identity). For representation, the law is A = B (a thought ""stands in"" for the object being thought of). Representation cannot exist in material form, whether in time capsules, books, brains or genes. Representation is strictly a function of mentality. It's the interpretation of material configurations. Like believing that the law of identity applies everywhere in the universe except in books, brains, genes, etc? So many questions. I suppose it is possible that abstract laws of physics determine the actions of a tornado. Of course, it's also possible that the devil is responsible for tornadoes. Problem is, from a scientific standpoint, both conjectures have no meaning. The only actual scientific theory anyone has ever come up with to explain tornadoes is based on the subset of physics known as nonequilibrium thermodynamics. I'm sorry if this is not the answer you were hoping for. You need to get yourself up to speed on this. Read Into the Cool by Eric Schneider and Dorion Sagan. This is a brilliant book, and best of all, it has nothing to do with Rupert Sheldrake! Morphic resonance is not based on species identity but on similarity, which could conceivably apply to other species. This is how we can explain parallel evolution, such as the astonishing similarity of marsupial and placental mammals that evolved on different continents. Marsupials fell into the developmental pathways of already-established placentals. No abstract classifications involved. Morphic resonance, of course. It's for precisely this reason that Sheldrake posits morphic resonance, so as to provide a mechanism by which an embryo is placed under the influence of the appropriate developmental pathway and not simply tossed about on a sea of morphogenetic noise. We resonate with whatever is similar. That's what determines what counts and what doesn't. Sheldrake is proposing that similarity is the mechanism of organic memory. This applies only to organic forms, such as atoms, crystals and complex, self-organized systems, including organisms. Nonetheless, you've made a really useful observation, one that I've never come across before. Resonance would be different for bacteria than for, say, primates. Contra Gould, evolution does have a direction, from simplicity to complexity (involving ever greater efficiency at gradient reduction and energy harvesting). Since primitive species are more similar to each other than more evolved species, bacteria would experience more background noise relative to foreground information. Perhaps this does mean that resonance is weaker among bacteria than primates. If so, not only does energy efficiency increase with evolution, but so does resonance efficiency.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","05:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","110"

It says to not have any more entities or assumptions than necessary. Genetics is not an assumption. It is known and therefore necessary. Who said that it must happen that way? Perhaps the instinct was the cause of the selective advantage. Or perhaps the favorable action increases with certain physiological changes, and since those changes are favorable, they are passed down with further modification until the physiology causes what we arbitrarily call an ""instinct."" Another round to Mr. of Ockham, but not in your favor. There is no problem from a scientific standpoint. The evidence says that the laws of the universe determine the actions of a tornado. None of the evidence says that tornadoes follow the resonance of previous tornadoes. What the hell do you mean ""have no meaning""? Two hydrogen atoms spontaneously bond. Does this ""have no meaning,"" too? If this has no meaning, does that mean that spontaneous bonding of hydrogen atoms doesn't occur? Are you really wabbit back for round two?

Sheldrake is now aware of the discrepancy, but so far the error remains, so I'll have to describe the actual figure 5, as it appears in Biology Forum 86 (3/4), 1992, 431-44. So, as I said, and as Sheldrake says in his write-up, control chicks demonstrated increasing latency with the yellow LEDs, while they demonstrated decreasing latency with the chrome beads. The trends move in opposite directions, not at different speeds in the same directions. Rose simply left this result out of his analysis, as it contradicted his assumption against biological memory, a.k.a. morphic resonance. As to the alleged insignificance of figure 3, even if this is true, it only demonstrates that the experiment should be replicated. A statistically insignificant result becomes significant when it keeps popping up with each replication. Sheldrake is not assuming increased competence on the part of the lab-tech throughout the experiment. He and Rose agreed the lab-tech got better initially, not that any further increase in competence occurred. Neither Rose nor I anticipated that the latency of the control birds would show a progressive decline, and we agree that this is probably due to an experimenter practice effect. From the point of view of the hypothesis of formative causation, the important finding is that in the test birds, the experimenter practice effect was counteracted by some other influence. Although neither Rose nor I had anticipated such a trend in the control data, we agree that it was probably due to an experimenter practice effect Among control chicks, the yellow LED results did not exhibit the same trend as the chrome results. Aversion to the yellow LEDs increased while aversion to chrome beads decreased. The control chicks appeared to be influenced by the experience of test chicks, which were injected with lithium chloride after pecking the yellow LEDs.","Peeling","312421","Not having access to that publication I cannot comment on the graph itself. I con only note that none of the trends mentioned in relation to figure 5 are statistically significant in themselves. He left the result out because a) it was statistically insignificant and b) not backed up by a matching 'trend' in the test chicks. What possible morphic resonance effect would make only the control chicks exhibit increasing aversion to the yellow LED and not the test chicks? It demonstrates nothing, that's what 'statistically insignificant' means. It's true that repeating the experiment many times would make it finer-grained, allowing smaller trends to be detected with statistical significance, but you can't use this result as any indication that you would expect to find such a trend. Incorrect. He makes the statement twice: Clearly he must be talking about the latter part of the experiment which he deems significant, otherwise he would have no reason to talk about the practice effect being counteracted. Earlier on he also says, with regard to figure 2 which shows the control chick trend over the whole of the experiment: It is as I said: Sheldrake (probably rightly) assumes an experimenter practice effect is responsible for the chrome pin trend, but then makes a further unsafe assumption: that the same trend also underlies the LED results. This despite the stimuli being very different (chicks loved the yellow LED and didn't love the chrome pin: my 'good salesman, poor product' effect) and the experimental capping which meant it was impossible for the test chicks to demonstrate the same underlying trend even if nothing were counteracting it. Neither to any degree of statistical significance, and in particular naive test chicks did not exhibit a corresponding trend of aversion to the yellow LED. Then why were naive test chicks not similarly affected? Since morphic resonance should have informed both naive groups equally, it seems reasonable to me that the two sets of results should be combined - which eliminates even the insignificant trend observed in the control chicks.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","10:58 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","113"
"06-02-2008","10438",8,"dace","312277","And I disagree that there are no scalable slopes for embryogensis. You snipped the most important part. ""Either way"" refers to genetic memory or holistic memory. Either way , if the preconditions for reception aren't in place, the information doesn't catch. You're arguing against your own theory. There isn't even an issue here. A completely groundless claim. Can any observation shake your conviction in genetic reductionism? You see how pointless such ad hominem comments are. They don't move the debate forward. Obviously morphic resonance is a simpler explanation than relying on storage of relevant information via random genetic mutation. I mean, come on, are you serious? Every time we change our way of thinking or behaving, we have to wait around for just the right mutation in order for it become instinctive? Wouldn't it be simpler if we just resonate with our forebears, so the newly-formed instinct comes through with or without genetic change? Be careful. Occam is a double-edged razor. Time capsules do not contain representations. Representation cannot exist in material form, whether in time capsules, books, brains or genes. Representation is strictly a function of mentality. It's the interpretation of material configurations. So many questions. I suppose it is possible that abstract laws of physics determine the actions of a tornado. Of course, it's also possible that the devil is responsible for tornadoes. Problem is, from a scientific standpoint, both conjectures have no meaning. The only actual scientific theory anyone has ever come up with to explain tornadoes is based on the subset of physics known as nonequilibrium thermodynamics. I'm sorry if this is not the answer you were hoping for. You need to get yourself up to speed on this. Read Into the Cool by Eric Schneider and Dorion Sagan. This is a brilliant book, and best of all, it has nothing to do with Rupert Sheldrake! Morphic resonance is not based on species identity but on similarity, which could conceivably apply to other species. Morphic resonance, of course. It's for precisely this reason that Sheldrake posits morphic resonance, so as to provide a mechanism by which an embryo is placed under the influence of the appropriate developmental pathway and not simply tossed about on a sea of morphogenetic noise. We resonate with whatever is similar. That's what determines what counts and what doesn't.","Peeling","312428","Whether or not you disagree is irrelevant. Evolutionary theory states only that we should be able to find a scaleable slope leading to every phenomena we do observe. Since a streamlined embryogenesis of the type you postulate (eliminating gills and swim bladder) is something we don't observe, there's nothing for evolutionary theory to explain. Your challenge to it, on the basis of something we don't see, is therefore meaningless. The issue, which you're dodging again, is that you have no working definition of the 'preconditions' for holistic memory. You just make it up as you go along. If some holistic memory goes missing, you just say the preconditions mustn't have been in place. You never have to say what they were or why they were missing. Please, prove me wrong: describe a consistent scheme under which isolated chicks could 'pick up' something as abstract, esoteric and fleeting as 'don't peck the yellow LED' while a creature reared in captivity would consistently and inevitably fail to pick up on millions of years of 'holistic memory'. I did not say you would do that, which would indeed be ad hominem. I merely said you could - which is true. If morphic resonance does not require wild animals to pick up millions of years of accumulated holistic memory, then it certainly doesn't require a few chicks to learn to avoid a yellow LED over a period of a few weeks. If that's what you think has to happen in every case, I'm not surprised you're turning to morphic resonance Not in this case. We're talking about behaviours animals raised in captivity lack in comparison with their wild cousins. Why is it simpler to first say those behaviours are instinctive and then invent a reason why they aren't being activated, than it is to say the behaviour isn't instinctive and the organism was simply denied the opportunity to learn by example from its parents? They do in the book I'm thinking of. ""The End of Time"" if I recall correctly. We're probably not talking about the same thing here. That much, at least, is wrong - or at least it's question-begging. For representation to be strictly a function of mentality you would have to prove that mentality is not a function of the material. I will; it sounds very interesting. But I'm sure you aren't suggesting that the formation of a tornado causes the individual particles of which it is composed to break the laws of physics, hmm? Failing which, they must be in accordance. Nature may abhor a gradient, but it has to play nice when eliminating them. But again, only when it suits you. Placentals and marsupials - yep, there's morphic resonance at work. Two species of bacteria? Well, that depends - have they done anything that looks similar lately? Inventing morphogenetic noise and then inventing a solution to it doesn't strike me as much progress. In any case, resonating with whatever is similar - fine. The missing variable is the attenutation of that resonance, and what causes that to vary between organism-pairs. You cannot invoke similarity again to define attenuation; it contradicts itself. Though I despair at the idea of propagating this nonsense further, I can't in good conscience pretend there aren't answers, so here's the one I would favour: there's no variability in attenuation. Morphic resonance, based as it is on form, is incredibly strong between all bacteria - but doesn't have a great deal to do. Rather like the strong forces at work in the nucleus of an atom, genetic/chemical imperatives are overpowering on that scale. Only at the macro scale of intercellular organisation can the comparatively weak marshalling force of morphic resonance make itself felt to any great effect. There really is no reason to try and explain anything a bacterium does by morphic resonance anyway. Mind you, I feel the same about all organisms but I think the attenuation issue is a killer. Background levels of similarity just won't cut it - you can't seriously suggest that just the right number of bacteria have existed so as to fine-tune morphic resonance attenuation down to the observable (ie species) level. That's just mad. No: better to let genes have their say and postulate morphic resonance as a parallel or layered effect like other exogenous inheritance pathways.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","12:34 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","114"
"06-04-2008","10438",8,"electrolyte","312384","Genetics is not an assumption. It is known and therefore necessary. Perhaps the instinct was the cause of the selective advantage. Or perhaps the favorable action increases with certain physiological changes, and since those changes are favorable, they are passed down with further modification until the physiology causes what we arbitrarily call an ""instinct."" Another round to Mr. of Ockham, but not in your favor. The evidence says that the laws of the universe determine the actions of a tornado. None of the evidence says that tornadoes follow the resonance of previous tornadoes. What the hell do you mean ""have no meaning""? Two hydrogen atoms spontaneously bond. Does this ""have no meaning,"" too? If this has no meaning, does that mean that spontaneous bonding of hydrogen atoms doesn't occur? Are you really wabbit back for round two? ""Organic""? Look, you may get some kicks using some obscure meaning of ""organic"" while talking about biochemistry , but that's pretty asinine. In this context, ""organic"" refers to the carbon-containing compounds related to organisms. Else, referring to atoms and crystals as ""organic"" just proves that you have no effin' clue what you're talking about.","dace","312591","peeling, That we don't see evolution in embryogenesis is highly significant since it ought to occur, as it would be beneficial to the mother. When you claim that the absence of streamlining means it must be impossible from a neo-Darwinian perspective, you're begging the question. You're assuming that the neo-Darwinian model is the only way evolution can happen, but that's precisely what needs to be proved. The idea that probabilistic influence is unscientific because it can't be falsified is not a serious claim. Probabilistic causation has been part and parcel of physics since Boltzmann's statistical interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics. In fact, probabilistic behavior is built into the foundation of matter. An electron is literally a probability wave. Does that mean quantum mechanics is unfalsifiable? What about Prigogine's dissipative systems? Do we just toss that out because we can't always predict how such systems will behave? Probabilistic causation is perhaps the single most important trend in modern science. You're way out of the loop on this one. There's no issue regarding chicks in the lab vs. animals released into the wild. Either way, if the preconditions are met, resonance will occur. If the preconditions have not been met, resonance will not occur. To take the example of language, the precondition is that the baby must be exposed to speech. This applies whether the capacity for language is conveyed via genes or resonance. You're arguing against yourself. I have made this point before, and I will not be making it again. You can't expect to consistently achieve evolutionary novelty out of gene duplication, symbiosis, sexual recombination or allele fixing. Ultimately, neo-Darwinian evolution depends on random genetic mutation. No, it doesn't necessarily have to happen that way every time, but that's how it would be in most cases, and no, we don't have time to wait around. New behaviors that are beneficial become instinctual very quickly, and clearly the neo-Darwinians (or better yet Wiesmannians) have no explanation. Your comments are getting increasingly loopy. It's obvious you're tapped out. You're just tossing up anything that sounds like maybe it would refute Sheldrake's hypothesis. At this point, you're working purely on ego. There's no effort whatsoever to arrive at knowledge. Your entire objective here is to avoid conceding error. You lack the character to come clean and admit that your own favored theory might not be right after all and that there are possible alternatives, including Sheldrake's. The problem is that you have a false sense of security. You figure you've just got to be right, no matter how off base your arguments, simply because you're got the power of the herd backing you up. You're a conformist going along with what you imagine everyone else is saying, an attitude that could hardly be more antithetical to science. But there's hope for you. Once the power of the cult of determinism has begun to wane, you may just find that your eyes are opening of their own accord. The same cannot be said of elecrolyte, who will take his delusions to the grave. Is this really somebody you want to be ideologically allied with? Check out some of these comments: No one has ever demonstrated that genes store the information by which an egg develops into an animal. Moreover, no one has even proposed a test which could either verify or falsify this assumption. This is well known among biologists and was reported by Stephen Jay Gould shortly before his death ( The Structure of Evolutionary Theory (pp. 201-202). But it matters not to the wide eyed true believer. It is known and therefore necessary! My point was that according to Weismannian theory, some kind of genetic alteration is necessary for newly evolved traits to be inherited. Because electrolyte feels he must disagree with everything I say, here he argues in favor of Lamarckism, whereby traits are passed down simply because they're favorable. And he thinks he's pulled off some kind of philosophical coup. Pure delusion. You almost have to admire his childlike certainty. Needless to say, no laws of nature have ever been proposed that would explain something as complex as a tornado. Until non-deterministic, non-equilibrium thermodynamics came along, we had no clue. And of course I never said it did, as anyone could easily discover. Yet he makes the point anyway, as if no one is going to figure out he's making a straw man argument. So authoritative is he that no one could possibly question him, any more than he questions himself. Uh-oh, getting a little testy. Notice that he can't distinguish the bonding properties of atoms, well described in the literature of deterministic physics, and the probabilistic behavior of complex, self-organized dissipative structures such as tornadoes. It's all the same to him, all under the will of God - - er, I mean, deterministic law. This comment indicates clinical-quality paranoia. Perhaps he'd prefer me to be the wascally wabbit because at a deep unconscious level, he realizes he's Elmer Fudd. Note that he can't veer from his rigid understanding of a term. He can't adjust his thinking to a different context, in this case the use of ""organic"" to denote any structure that forms organically rather than being stamped into shape by some external pressure. Crystals, for instance, form through a process of crystallization, not because physical pressures determine one form instead of another. Proteins also crystallize. Starting with a simple amino acid chain, proteins develop three more levels of structure, the last of which, the so-called quaternary level, is completely undetermined by physical pressures. Known as the ""multiple-minimum"" problem in molecular biology, the quaternary level of the protein typically has several minimum energy configurations but usually arrives at the ""correct"" configuration. (And when it doesn't arrive at the correct configuration, it is destroyed). From a deterministic standpoint, we have no idea how proteins know which way to fold up. Of course, this is one of literally countless examples of how events in the body are irreducible to matter under the absolute control of abstract, eternal law. The old paradigm is broken, and no amount of whining or gnashing of teeth is going to change that. In short, peeling, this debate has run its course. I've already given up talking directly to electrolyte, and I will no longer respond to any of your comments regarding the general theory. Do not take my lack of response as confirmation that you've made anything resembling a persuasive argument. As to the particularities of the Rose experiment, I'm still open to further discussion.

Literal physical pressure can solidify a liquid into crystal form. In fact, some substances will take different crystal forms based on literal physical pressure. In other cases (like crystallization from a supersaturated solution), crystals form and are shaped based on the molecular characteristics (geometry, van der Waals forces, etc) of the substance that is crystallizing.

You're saying that because we don't see something that existing evolutionary theory doesn't require, we ought to infer the existence of a different process under which the same events would fail to happen? That's deeply flawed logic. Good, because it's irrelevant. The issue is not that of necessary preconditions. The existence of preconditions for the proper functioning of a system is hardly news. The issue is that the theory of morphic resonance is purely descriptive. The chicks in Sheldrake's experiment could (as indeed they did) show no trend towards increased aversion and it wouldn't put the slightest dent in the theory because that get-out clause is always there: some unknown precondition was not met. While at the same time you're willing to ascribe placental/marsupial similarities to morphic resonance by assuming some vague preconditions are in place. It's a meaningless exercise in cherry-picking. Just as with the macaw example that started all this, you're throwing up a strawman. You assume that a tendency toward some new or variant instinctive behaviour must first be invented and then encoded. From that you wrongly deduce that the time available for 'just the right' mutation to occur is impossibly short: a single generation. If a mutation (or some persistent environmental interaction - let's not get hung up on just genes here) induces a tendency toward some new behaviour, then by the time we observe the behaviour the 'encoding' is already in place. Again, there's no problem for evolutionary theory to solve. I was under the impression that ad hominem arguments were... oh, I can't remember exactly; you said there was something wrong with them at any rate. Or perhaps the problem is that you haven't tackled a single one of the criticisms leveled at Sheldrake's experiment, other than to make a series of factually incorrect statements about the contents of his writeup. Or maybe it's that the theory itself is a one-size-fits-all explanation for any conceivable observation, from which we can learn nothing. Excellent. The thought never crossed my mind. People with this kind of weight of logic and evidence on their side stop talking to me all the time. I wouldn't let it trouble me if I were you. RE the experiment: Because the significance of the results was stated below the incorrectly pasted graph. Unfortunately you're wrong again. In each batch all chicks, both test and control, were naive when first exposed to the yellow LED. So why wasn't the (statistically insignificant) trend towards increased aversion exhibited by the control chicks when first exposed to the yellow LED mirrored in the test chicks when first exposed to the LED (ie prior to ever being injected with anything)? There's no reason not to combine the results of both control and test chicks when assessing whether morphic resonance influenced their naive level of aversion to the yellow LED. Again, you're cherry-picking the results you like and ignoring the ones you don't. I did not claim otherwise. Indeed I said precisely that: repeating the experiment many times makes it possible to detect smaller effects with greater confidence. What I said is that if you do the experiment once and the results lack statistical significance, you cannot infer any likelihood that they would be borne out were you to repeat the experiment ten thousand times. If you could, you wouldn't need to bother repeating the experiment, now would you? The results were statistically insignificant. Thus they don't tell you that you should repeat the experiment, and they don't tell you that you shouldn't. They only tell you that the effect, if there is one at all, is likely to be too slight to be detected by that experiment. He explicitly states that he does. He assumes that the same trend underlies both graphs, with morphic resonance aversion offsetting that trend in the case of the yellow LED. Read his words: Which they were. Sheldrake says so: Look at figure 1 if you don't believe me. See any downward trend at all in that graph? I still can't see the relevant graph, so you'll forgive me for not incorporating it into my argument earlier. The trend towards increased aversion is not statistically significant, and is contradicted in any case by the trend towards increased training success shown in figure 1. Moreover, it is not mirrored in the results of naive test birds prior to injection. Once their results are factored in (and you've no reason for not doing so, since both sets of birds were naive and both ought to have been subject to morphic resonance), the statistical significance drops completely out of sight, from 0.12 to 0.61). Sheldrake assumes that if morphic resonance were not occurring, the chrome pin and LED results would exhibit the same experimenter-practice-induced trend towards decreased aversion. But the yellow LED was so attractive that once the experimenter got over their initial fumbling there was no experimental room for the results to exhibit such a trend. Only the less-popular control pin had the necessary experimental headroom to exhibit the trend it did, which enforced a divergence even in the absence of morphic resonance. Which makes the inference of morphic resonance an unsafe deduction. Look at the P value of that result: 0.61. A 61% chance of getting a result at least that extreme by pure chance. You really can't get much less significant than that. And it doesn't mean the experiment should be replicated: it means nothing.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","07:43 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","120"
