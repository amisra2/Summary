This implies that the probability of a mutation should be calculated after the fact because evolution is progress along some specified path towards a goal. What a foolish, foolish assertion. Why is a single ""perfect"" mutation required as opposed to one of millions that take place in a population at every generation that may offer a slight reproductive advantage? As Gould often asked, do ""historical patterns of development represent a set of mechanically limited and excellent, perhaps even optimal, designs,"" or ""do they represent just one possible solution among numerous entirely plausible alternatives of strikingly different form, each yielding a subsequent history of life entirely different from the outcome actually experienced on earth?"" (Gould, Stephen Jay. 2002. The Structure of Evolutionary Theory . The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA. p. 1159) Thus, the likelihood of a mutation is not determined because subsequent evolution would have been impossible without it. The mutation preceded the path of evolution. There was no goal towards which evolution was aimed. Ted Dace (not a scientist), Bertvan, and ww all seem to have evolutionary theory backasswards.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","10:20 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","17"
"10-02-2007","10438",2,"bertvan","286152","Bertvan; Hi Chemist99a, My most immediate disagreement with the article you cite is the assertion that information is physical. Information can be expressed physically, such as by language or other communication systems, but ideas and concepts are themselves immaterial. I also happen to believe an immaterial mind exists separate from a brain. It is a difference between materialism and immaterialism. My second disagreement with the paper is a computer would be useless to model living systems, because a computer cannot model volition, the defining characteristic of life. My third disagreement is that DNA sequences resemble blueprints. I see the genome more as a resource utilized by the intelligent system to manufacture proteins and containing a memory to assist (not dictate) the development of the organism. Bertvan: If that is what Darwin actually said, then Darwin was closer to EAM than to Neo Darwinism. In any case, I do not believe natural selection would have any power to organize genomic accidents of any kind into functional biological systems.","chemist99a","286159","Ok then remove the brain and see whats left of the mind. As to information being physical - information is always embodied in material form there is no evidence that it can exist outside of such a context. And as you might recall information was defined as an aspect of entropy (actually negentropy), also please recall that materialism includes both matter and energy within its borders. You are of course entitled to believe whatever you choose and of course to accept the consequences of that belief when you act on it. Well firstly we do not know that ""volition"" must be embodied in living organisms only - computers MIGHT be capable of exhibiting it. I think you will find that there is NO valid reason for believing otherwise. And volition itself is NOT a defining characteristic of life. No biologist would buy that assumption. Sponges, bacteria, corn plants etc etc etc are mindless organisms and so far as can be determined do not act out of volition. The code sequences are of course ""blueprints"" in much the same sense. But genomes are utilized through a series of automatic nonvolitional and unintelligent reactions. NIR - no intelligence required. If you are a materialist, and Ill let you define your own philosophical assumptions, we can agree to disagree. I am a religious agnostic, but not a materialist. I believe science can be done under either assumption and I will not call you a threat to science because of your philosophical assumptions. Well he did invoke use and disuse (not necessarily intelligence) along with his theory of pangenesis but he was incorrect in both instances. After all he was shooting in the dark in a highly speculative way with regard to the mechanisms of both variability and inheritance. Its unfortunate he was not aware of the contemporary work of Mendel, but them is the breaks. Its quite obvious that molecular biology and genetics have moved leagues beyond Darwins level of information. And what you believe natural selection can and cannot achieve is moot its capabilities are well known and nicely demonstrable both in theory and in practice. Vast tomes of empirical evidence says your belief is not valid.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","04:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","20"

But I guess that Creationists aren't too interested in facts. They prefer to attack the myths they spin rather than real evolutionary theory. What is is about Christianity that makes Christians lie so much?

"04-30-2008","10438",2,"None","None","None","dace","310210","I'm delighted to see this thoughtful, courteous exchange regarding the ideas proposed in my article, ""The False Dilemma between Neo-Darwinism and Intelligent Design."" Since I'm coming in after the fact, I'll bring all my responses together into a single post. chemist99a writes: On memory. I have indicated to you several times that the genome becomes modified by binding information about past environments the linage has been subjected to. That means that DNA ""remembers"" past environments. There is your memory component. Neo-Darwinism is fully consistent with the idea of ""memory"" (a record of the past) being a core element of evolution. >>> I've made this point myself, though not in this particular essay. The gene-based theory of inheritance is essentially a theory of memory. The idea is that species retain their characteristic forms and instincts from generation to generation by storing the relevant information in genes which are then passed on from parent to offspring. The trouble with this view is that the amount of information that would have to be stored is incalculably vast while the storage capacity of genes is limited. The same problem applies to storage of personal memory in the brain. The solution is that both genes and brain cells operate in much the same way as tuning devices in radios. Let's say 91.5 FM is playing Beethoven while 97.5 FM is playing Buck Owens. Clearly, 91.5 is not a code containing all the information needed to reproduce a violin sonata, any more than 97.5 is a code from which a country ballad can be assembled. To put it in logical terms, the station setting is necessary but not sufficient for the music that plays over the radio. It may be that genes and brain cells are also necessary but insufficient to account for memory. All the evidence for the role of genes in the inheritance of forms and instincts is evidence as to necessity. So far as I know, no one has ever proposed a testable hypothesis that could verify or falsify the proposition that genes or brain cells are not only necessary but also sufficient to account for memory. There are thus two possibilities: 1) biological memory is reducible to material storage of information, and 2) biological memory is a two track process involving both stored information and the act of ""tuning"" into past organic forms on the basis of similarity. In this case, genes merely ensure that the proper proteins are available to the developing organism. sinjin quotes Geoffrey Falk: ""In a new paper Ted Dace contends that the dispute between the rival views of evolution is between two failed theories. The mechanistic ideology of Neo-Darwinism weakens the case for evolution and leaves the field clear for Creationism. Sheldrake and Elsasser have found a basis for the inheritance of adaptations making this endless clash of ideologies redundant. ""Exercise for anyone with even a high-school knowledge of how evolution works: Poke SUV-sized holes in the following, embarrassingly wilber-esque objections to neo-Darwinian evolution, from the same paper: ""'The Hyacinth macaw can crack a nut with its beak that you or I would need a sledgehammer to open. Is all that colossal strength nothing more than a side-effect of a chance mutation in the macaws genetic toolkit? How many millions of such coding mistakes had to come and go before the right one announced itself, and at last the bird got its meal? So stupendously unlikely is the perfect mutation at the perfect time that calculating the odds against it taking place even once exceeds our imaginative capacity. It is, in fact, a miracle.' ""Note that Wilber has since (unconvincingly) claimed that he was deliberately oversimplifying his comparable presentation of the mechanism of evolutionand thus intentionally deceiving his readersin a book intended for the general public (A Brief History of Everything). Yet, his cohorts in ""integral skepticism"" (ha!) quite clearly believe exactly what he claims to have purposely wrongly presented. ""Whether or not any of the other avant-garde claims made in Dace's paper are valid, when perfect nonsense (or deliberate lies, take your pick) like the above is presented as if it were insightful wisdom, one is being generous in even reading further."" >>> The nonsense is entirely Falk's. Note that he never explains exactly what it is that's taught in high school biology that contradicts my statement. Is he referring to mixing of genes during sexual reproduction? Is he referring to allele fixing? Is he referring to Lynn Margulis' symbiosis? He doesn't say, perhaps because none of these factors can explain radically new traits in evolution. Gene mixing and genetic drift can account for minor changes but not the kind of wholesale transformations that occur with the emergence of new species (not to mention new classes and phyla). Symbiosis only pushes the question back a step: if a cell gains the ability to produce energy by absorbing mitochondria, where did the mitochondria gain this ability? Or perhaps Falk was thinking of the new developments in the field of ""evo-devo"" (though of course this sort of thing would never have been taught in a high school biology class). What evo-devo shows, according to Sean Carroll, author of Endless Forms Most Beautiful , is that large-scale bodily change does not necessarily require genetic mutation. What it requires instead is mutation in the DNA directly preceding the relevant gene, which causes the gene to operate differently. In other words, the basis of novelty in organisms is not genetic mutation but DNA mutation. Not much of a distinction. In the end, it still comes down to seemingly random mutation that has an astonishingly beneficial impact. Evo-devo research has demonstrated that what counts is not so much the genes themselves but how they're used. Assuming that the knowledge of how to manipulate genes is not paradoxically encoded in the genes themselves, this implies the existence of endogenous intelligence at the cellular level. Falk conceals the weakness of his position with the use of charged language and meaningless insult. If he had a real argument to make, he'd make it. chemist99a writes: The Hill results are not consistent with EAM. EAM would predict that exposure IS required to produce the mutations. In HILLs work the mutations were occurring in cells never exposed to the toxins etc. >>> I've since learned that Hill only assumed the resistance was produced prior to exposure to the toxin. However, this assumption is understandable. He found that each time he added healthy cells to the flasks containing the toxin, thioguanine, a greater proportion mutated and survived. Each new population seemed to have a better knowledge of how to mutate. It may be that this knowledge is the result of holistic memory. Once the cells were exposed to the toxin, they tuned into cells that had been exposed before. The more cells that had previously made the adaptation, the stronger the ""signal"" that the new cells tuned into. Incidentally, Hill was director of research at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Villejuif, France. He and his assistants conducted their research using the most careful methodology available. He got the same results whether using thioguanine, ethionine or high temperature. There is no reason to doubt his results, though obviously further replication would be helpful. >>> the author clearly does not grasp the means by which complexity emerges in biological systems. >>> Complex systems, where living or merely lifelike, always emerge in whole, not in part. Complexity is fundamentally holistic. The shift to complexity in biological thinking represents a definitive rebuke of the reductionist interpretations that characterized 20th century theory. >>> we now are being asked to toss out causality and mechanism. We are asked to abandon all of physics! To toss it all out and go back to just exactly what? To a causeless universe? To chaos? To a total lack of any explanations for anything at all? Back to GOD? Such a Brave New World the author proposes. When you take your car to the mechanics in his world they will tell you that your car is possessed by curse and needs exorcism? Is that what he advocates? >>> No. I am not advocating that mechanism be abandoned in the sense of causality, only in the sense of contact mechanics, an event that occurred in physics centuries ago and was reinforced by both Maxwell and Einstein. Of course, we could say that morphic resonance (i.e. formal similarity) is the mechanism by which current organisms tune in to their predecessors. I didn't use the word mechanism that way in this essay because I didn't want to create confusion by using the same word in two different ways. pandion writes: ""So stupendously unlikely is the perfect mutation at the perfect time that calculating the odds against it taking place even once exceeds our imaginative capacity."" This single sentence takes the whole train off the tracks into a huge train wreck of logic. This implies that the probability of a mutation should be calculated after the fact because evolution is progress along some specified path towards a goal. What a foolish, foolish assertion. >>> That there are no distant goals in evolution does not mean there are no immediate goals. The macaw wants to eat. To do so, it must crack a very hard nut. It thus develops its jaw muscles in order to achieve its goal. Nothing foolish about any of this. In fact, it's foolish to deny that evolution is driven, in part, by purpose and intelligence.
