You need to re-examine the paper because it does not say what you're claiming it says. After an initial period of experimental fumbling where the peck-rate at the yellow LED sharply increased , the tendency of the test birds to peck the yellow LED remained unchanged. At no point did the test birds ever demonstrate a trend of increasing aversion to pecking the yellow LED. What did happen is that the control group's tendency to peck the chrome bead gradually increased throughout the experiment. This is most parsimoniously explained via the same experimental fumbling that Sheldrake himself invoked to explain the initial increase in peck rate at the yellow LED: the lab tech was simply getting better at inducing the birds to peck at the chrome bead. There's no other reason why they would do it more often, since they weren't rewarded for it. If you've been going around the net claiming that these batches of birds showed an increased aversion to pecking the yellow LED, you have a lot of apologising to do.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","04:37 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","64"
"05-09-2008","10438",5,"dace","310666","Not evolution per se but an evolution which relies on natural selection combined with random mutation. And I never said anything about a single step. How many millions of such coding mistakes had to come and go before the right one announced itself, and at last the bird got its meal? So stupendously unlikely is the perfect mutation at the perfect time that calculating the odds against it taking place even once exceeds our imaginative capacity. It is, in fact, a miracle. The macaw wants to eat. To do so, it must crack a very hard nut. It thus develops its jaw muscles in order to achieve its goal. It's implausible that random mutation would provide the necessary solution in any reasonable amount of time. But let's say the macaw and the tough nut is the one example in which a random mutation did the job. What about all the other millions upon millions of similar examples? Every organism on earth is suited to its environment in numerous ways. Are we to explain every one of these traits in every one of these creatures by an astronomically improbable mutation? There are two possibilities. One is adaptive mutation, implying cellular intelligence, while the other is holistic, species-wide memory, allowing adaptations of organisms to be picked up by their descendants without the need for genetic transmission. It may be that both of these scenarios are correct. Certainly, once we admit to the existence of intelligence at the level of the whole organism, we cannot deny the possibility that it exists at lower levels of structure, right down to the cell. According to Walter Elsasser, memory runs on two tracks, genetic and holistic. If it's strictly genetic, why do organisms reveal the same general patterns of their predecessors while exhibiting wildly varying individuality in their chemical makeup? No inconsistency. If there's no imperative to act more quickly, there's no reason why a second batch would complete faster than the first. When you say ""the exception that proves the rule,"" it means yes, there's an exception, but the rule is still essentially correct.","Peeling","310683","Yes, you did: You might now wish you hadn't said that, but that's not the same thing. As others have pointed out, you're making the false assumption that the survival traits organisms developed were the only ones possible, and furthermore that they had to hit upon the precise mutation or recombination they did in order to realise those traits. In reality there were many, many potential evolutionary avenues, and many, many ways in which each avenue could be followed. Or neither - and since you have no evidence for either, that seems the most likely option. Computational power at the level of the computer does not imply it at the level of the transistor. Such as...? I can only conclude you haven't the first clue what a fluctuation test is, if you think it doesn't induce a survival imperative. That's what I thought you thought it meant. There are two interpretations that make sense, and that isn't either of them. One interpretation is that 'proves' was used to mean 'tests'. Black swans are the exception that proves the rule 'all swans are white'. Similar to ""the proof of the pudding is in the eating"". Ultimately, however, the phrase is a legal one, and applies to the valid inference of a rule from a stated exception. A sign saying ""50% off today!"" implies that as a rule the price is double what it is today. If in fact the vendor only doubled his prices one day a year, he could be guilty of false advertising. Going back to the swans: observing a black swan does not validate the rule that 'all swans are white'. Rather, the statement ""This swan is black"" allows us to infer (proves) the rule that not all swans are black.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","05:01 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","66"

"05-09-2008","10438",5,"dace","310668","Morphic resonance neither discerns nor equivocates . A natural form of memory, it retrieves past organic form on the basis of similarity to current organic form. Fine molecular details do not propagate via morphic resonance. Only general forms propagate. Who says they don't? It's called speciation. A species is, in essence, a collective pool of memory. Once a population has its own pool of memory, it's a species. An organism can certainly engage in something novel once. But for it to keep doing it and for its descendants to keep doing it just the same way, there has to be a kind of memory. It can be particulate, as in DNA, or it can be holistic, which is harder to understand because it's not tangible. That didn't stop Newton from proposing gravity and shouldn't stop us today from recognizing that the particulate form of memory is never going to be sufficient, either in explaining development or evolution.","Peeling","310685","To retrieve past organic form on the basis of similarity, it must discern between the non-similar and equivocate the similar. The trouble is, you have no consistent definition of 'similar'. Two seperate species of bacteria are far more similar to each other than you are to your immediate ancestor. So I ask again: how can morphic resonance be at the same time so discerning as to only equivocate between bacteria of the same species, yet so loose as to permit resonance between you and your mother? Again, inconsistent. If you're right and only 'general forms' propagate thus, Sheldrake was completely wasting his time testing those chicks - the tiny neurological differences present in a yellow LED-averse chick could never propagate via morphic resonance into another chick. Even if you claim the differences were not neurological, the same logic applies: for a chick's mind to 'resonate' with those of its predecessors all the fine detail would need to be smoothed over - a 'thought' as fine grained as 'don't peck the yellow LED' could never propagate. Which throws another spanner into your works. According to you, morphic resonance tells an organism what shape to be. But the novel trait that has made this population a new species only informs a small part of that organism's form, yes? A longer neck, webbed toes, whatever. But now the resonance with the ancestral species is broken, what tells the rest of the organism what shape to be? It can be epigenetic, sure. But there's no need to invoke morphic resonance. Nobody's saying it is - if by 'particulate' you mean 'genetic'. Epigenetic inheritance is integral - that's why you can't grow a baby in a test-tube: you need the biological systems of the mother - and essential nutrients, the production of which is inherited in different species entirely - to regulate and cooperate in its development. Life has grown into a tangled web indeed, but we don't need morphic resonance to explain it.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","05:22 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","68"

This is an argument in favor of intelligent design, not evolution. Weismannian or ""neo-Darwinian"" evolution would take vastly more than 43 generations. Fallacy of abuse. Indicates inability to argue the point directly. General patterns include the whole form of the organism, the forms of of its organs and organ systems, its tissue types and its patterns of instinctive behavior. Within cells it includes such patterned activities as constructing membranes, utilizing ATP packets, generating and distributing proteins, etc. General patterns include anything beyond mere chemistry. Chemical details vary enormously within strictly regulated general patterns of activity. This is proof in and of itself that organisms are fundamentally holistic, meaning that the whole has causal primacy over the particular.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","03:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","69"

Not only has it never been proven, but no one has ever proposed a test that could either verify or falsify this proposition. Speciation is explained by evolution, not genetics. Try to take a little more care with your posts. Genetics has absolutely nothing to say on the matter of why ontogeny (roughly) recapitulates phylogeny. Why do developing organisms recap, to a degree, their phylogenetic history? This is a total mystery to reductionist biology, as I discuss in my paper, which was posted at the top of this thread: ""Darwin saw in embryonic recapitulation proof positive that life is evolutionary. Since natural selection operates on adaptations made by creatures after theyve left the womb, its to be expected that juvenile and adult forms will vary over time while embryos remain roughly the same, echoing ancestral heritage. But for neo-Darwinism, which transfers the source of adaptations from life experiences to genetic mutations, recapitulation is a huge problem. Embryos are just as vulnerable to genetic accidents as adults. Mutations that streamline embryogenesis thereby reducing the time and energy requirements of gestation ought to be environmentally selected right along with those that beneficially alter the adult body. Do we really need a swimbladder and fins in the womb? Cant we just bypass all that and go directly to human form? The persistence of recapitulation in utero signifies that inheritance results not so much from ever-malleable genes but species-wide memory of a past that cannot be altered."" The Occam reference is misplaced. In fact, Occam works against you. In the reductionist model, every event that takes place in the body must be explained by a unique mechanism. The number of ""entities"" multiplies beyond our capacity to calculate them. By contrast, Sheldrake's holistic model sweeps away all these mechanisms and replaces them with one: morphic resonance. The cell knows how to distribute proteins because it directly ""remembers"" how it has done so in the past. No proliferation of unwieldy mechanisms. Clean and simple. Occam would approve.

Of course, in retrospect you can always say that a given event was caused by whatever came right before, but in advance you don't know what will occur."" Clearly, we were discussing determinism, not morphogenetic fields. And my point remains the same: if you wish to deny the existence of human freedom, you must demonstrate that everything that happens in the brain is determined by prior physical events. It's interesting that you have a tag that links to a video on Ron Paul: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bCRc2ub8hU - Rap track of the decade. So, we do agree on something after all. Ron Paul is a libertarian. Though I'm more of a left-libertarian, I greatly admire Paul. Libertarian social philosophy is predicated on the existence of freedom. If we're all essentially machines whose actions are determined by physics, we might as well be slaves. If we're enslaved to physics, what difference does it make if we also happen to be enslaved to a corporation or the White House? The die has already been cast. This illustrates a basic problem in mechanistic thought, going all the way back to Galileo, Descartes and Newton. Since reductionism denies everything human, including mind, feeling, consciousness, free will, etc, we're left with a schism of thought. On the one hand, we have mechanistic reductionism, falsely known as ""science,"" and on the other hand, we have our human lives, including, mind, feeling, consciousness, free will, etc. The dominant philosophy of modernity is incoherent.

Perhaps you thought that with the phrase ""at the perfect time"" I was referring to a particular moment within an individual's lifetime. What I meant was simply a time when the mutation would have done some good for the species. Macaw's weren't always in a place where they could capitalize on their newfound jaw strength. Who says I assumed anything? Naturally, there are many possible evolutionary routes, and if another route were taken, it would be just as implausible as the one that actually was taken. Point being that no matter how an organism adapts, random mutation is a very unlikely source. The only reason it's assumed to be the basis of novel forms and instincts is that theorists all the way back to August Weismann have been unable to imagine any other possibility, precisely the problem with creationism, whose advocates simply lack the vision to recognize that life could appear in its many forms without divine input. But now there's no longer any reason to make this assumption. Weismann's whole outlook was based on the idea that the organism in all its complexity can be reduced to a simple ""germ-plasm,"" which we now know as DNA. Well, it turns out it's not the genes themselves which count but how they're operated, and their operation is incalculably complex. So there's no longer any basis for genetic reductionism, no longer a reduction from something complex to something simple. As such, there's no reason to assume that all biological inheritance comes through genes. Holistic inheritance has been thrust onto us whether we like it or not. Oh, yeah? Aside from such well-known phenomena as atavism, parallel evolution and embryonic recapitulation, none of which can be explained without recourse to holistic memory, we also have evidence from chemistry, adaptive mutation in cell cultures (Miroslav Hill), transferal of plants to different environments, the frequency of phenocopies, the transmission of aversion (Sheldrake and Rose), the evolution of animal behavior, and collective human memory. The evidence from chemistry concerns changing melting points. Each chemical substance has a particular temperature at which it melts. Morphic resonance predicts that melting points of long-established chemicals will not change noticeably, while recent, man-made chemicals will change significantly. This is because what keeps the melting points the same for perennial chemicals is not some abstract, timeless law of physics but simply the force of memory acting on the crystals. Sheldrake's prediction has been verified among numerous man-made chemicals. This is taken from the appendix of the new edition of A New Science of Life : ""For example, saccharin, the oldest artificial sweetener, was first synthesized in 1878. In 1902, its melting point was 220 Celsuis. By 1996 it was 229 C, a 9 degree increase. Phenolphthalein, used in chemistry laboratories to indicate when substances are acid or alkali, was first made in 1880. In 1907 its melting point was 252 C; in 1989 it was 262 C, a 10 degree increase. The crown ethers are a family of crown-shaped molecules used as chelating agents, first synthesized in 1976. The most widely-used member of the family, 18-crown-6, started off with a melting point of 390 C. By 1989, it was 450 C, a 60 degree increase."" He gives many more examples and notes the well known fact that such increases don't occur with long-established chemicals. He goes on to note that when aragonite-type crystals are heated into calcite, the original aragonite structure mysteriously reappears when the calcite is cooled down, leading researchers to invoke a ""memory effect."" Transplanting to different climates: In The Variation of Plants and Animals Under Domestication , Darwin noted that wheat and barley quickly adapt to different climates, whether hotter or colder, and pass on these adaptations to their offspring. No need to wait around for a million or two years for just the right mutation. Phenocopies: In the 50s, CH Waddington found that after exposing drosophila eggs to ether, many developed four wings instead of two. After 29 generations, many unexposed fruit flies also showed the phenotypic mutation. He called this genetic assimilation, meaning that the genes had assimilated the change. Decades later, Mae-wan Ho found she needed only ten generations of exposure before subsequent unexposed generations showed large numbers with the alteration. What demonstrates morphic resonance is that phenocopies began showing up frequently in control flies once enough exposed flies demonstrated the mutation. In the case of control flies, there was no possibility of genetic transmission. Animal evolution: Morphic resonance was demonstrated before and after World War II by birds that learned to open milk bottles in Western Europe. Known in England as blue tits, their ability to open bottles and steal the cream at the top spread locally and then suddenly began popping up in several far-flung locales far beyond their flight range. In contrast to the apocryphal 100th monkey story, this one is thoroughly documented. Another well-documented case concerns cattle whose movements had long been controlled by expensive cattle guards. Eventually ranchers found they could save money by simply painting a fake cattle guard onto the ground. The cows reacted the same way to the fake ones, demonstrating that their fear of cattle guards had become instinctive in only a few generations. Again, no need to wait for that magic mutation. British and Swiss newspapers have confirmed the same phenomenon among sheep. Human memory: Sheldrake conducted a test on collective human memory with Japanese nursery rhymes. Test subjects were asked to remember real lines mixed in with made up lines that closely resembled the real ones. Test subjects fared far better at remembering real lines. Several other experiments conducted independently by psychologists on collective human memory have produced the same results. This is a common error in logic wherein ""some"" is confused with ""all."" That you have an example in which a property at the level of the whole is not present at the level of one of its parts does not mean that in all cases a property at the level of the whole will not be found at the level of the part. In order to prove your point, you need to actually demonstrate that brains are necessary for intelligence, that intelligence cannot exist in any other form. This is of course an impossible task. Very had to prove a negative. Such as literally every single fluid in the body. Blood, saliva, bile, mucus, you name it. Every single one. They're all like that. They all reveal huge chemical variation from person to person, including genetically identical twins. Same genes, different chemistry. How does a reductionist explain that? Hey, if you've got a refutation of morphic resonance based on fluctuation tests, I'd love to hear it. But you need to explain it in detail. Great. Now you've taught me something too.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","06:49 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","75"
