"11-30-2007","10648",2,"PoliticalRef","292066","Most evolutionists are unwilling to consider the science examining intelligent design. A bias against even the possibility that an intelligent designer exists within much of the scientific community.","electrolyte","292079","You fail to grasp the objection. The objection is not that there must not be an intelligent designer. (Well, that's one possible objection, but not the one that damns your position.) The objection is that there is no science of ID. ID is decidedly anti-science. Is there a basic idea therein that might fall into the realm of science? Yes. Does the idea as a whole qualify as science? No. ID proposes a ""hypothesis,"" but no testing, no theory, no description of nature, no avenue for expanding knowledge. It says, ""Ah, we can't figure it out, therefore we'll quit trying."" Contrastly, there are scientific refutations of ID principles. IC is bunk because it ignores the phenomena of scaffolding and exaptation. Structures that fit the definition of ""IC"" have had their evolutionary pathways derived. Dembski has admitted that SC just relies upon IC. Intelligent Design as a scientific movement is bankrupt, but because members of the religious reich donate so much money to the cause, the political movement of ID is alive and kickin'.","aggressive-evolutionists-abandon-logic-intelligent-design-evolution-debate","02:16 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","16"
"11-30-2007","10648",2,"PoliticalRef","292069","Is this not precisely what I wrote? Evolution does not address the origin of life. This is one of its enormous gaps.","electrolyte","292080","""The theory of gravity doesn't address photosynthesis. That's one of its enormous gaps."" Do you see the fallacy, or are you more affected by gravity than other materials around you?","aggressive-evolutionists-abandon-logic-intelligent-design-evolution-debate","02:19 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","17"
"11-30-2007","10648",2,"PoliticalRef","292076","So where did we come from? How did all of the matter in the universe propel outward? Is this one of millions of universes that never cease to start, expand, contract, end and then start again? You cannot answer every question with science. A role for philosophy exists in this world.","electrolyte","292081","So you've gone from evolution and ID to cosmology. You have a real problem with maintaining established realms. ID addresses evolutionary theory, not abiogenesis, and not cosmology.","aggressive-evolutionists-abandon-logic-intelligent-design-evolution-debate","02:23 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","18"
"11-30-2007","10648",2,"PoliticalRef","292066","I am perfectly willing to consider the science examining evolution. Most evolutionists are unwilling to consider the science examining intelligent design. A bias against even the possibility that an intelligent designer exists within much of the scientific community. Pretend that you are not biased all you want, the bias is unmistakable. I also do not claim that proof for God exists, only that we should consider the possibility. More questions, not less, are always preferable.","lesz","292091","What science would that be? It's not as though ID Creationists have a research program they are pursuing. Strictly speaking, all of science has to assume methodological naturalism. Even religious scientists have to do this. Appealing to ""Goddidit!"" can never be science. You can consider it all you want philosophically, you just can't figure it into science, not at present. It's not as though Creationists have any idea how to test Intelligent Design, because ""Goddidit!"" isn't a scientific theory. And no matter how much ID Creationists like to pretend they aren't all about god and biblical creation, they are transparent in their disingenuity.","aggressive-evolutionists-abandon-logic-intelligent-design-evolution-debate","05:59 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","19"
"11-30-2007","10648",2,"PoliticalRef","292072","At what point would you acknowledge that the complexity is so remarkable that some sort of intelligence must be behind it? Remember, the universe is not static as was thought for centuries. Something caused it to propel outward. The cell is much more complex than we could have imagined only a few years ago. All the result of random chance? At what point does faith in randomness become much more obsurd than faith in an intelligent designer? All good questions I think.","lesz","292093","At the point where it would be more miraculous to suppose complexity was generated by a natural process. That is a matter for physics, not biological evolution. Since evolutionary theory is the opposite of ""faith in randomness"", I wish Creationists would stop repeating this canard. The only thing about evolution that appears to be random is the occurrence of genetic mutations that cause phenotypic variation. After than, the forces of natural selection that lead to the evolution of complex adaptations are highly non-random. Why can't Creationists get this straight? And all of them with good answers.","aggressive-evolutionists-abandon-logic-intelligent-design-evolution-debate","06:04 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","20"
"11-30-2007","10648",2,"PoliticalRef","292073","So then you will agree that evolution is useless in getting at possible answers on what really matters, how we got here? If you concede that then I'm happy to end this discussion. I recall, however, visiting the Smithsonian and seeing a detailed description of how amino acids combined to form the building blocks of life. Evolutionary theory does address origins and its explanations are unsuppported by evidence.","lesz","292094","No, and no. First, evolution provides the only scientific answers for how humans got here: we evolved from non-human ancestors. that record is written in both the genes and the fossils. Science might even be able eventually to tell you what the forces of selection were that propelled this evolution. Second, Evolutionary theory is NOT a theory of the origins of life: it's a theory about the origins of species once life exists. There is a separate scientific discipline that deals with origins of life, called abiogenesis. And there are several lines of scientific evidence that suggest plausible ways of how that might have happened. Why can't Creationists get these details right?","aggressive-evolutionists-abandon-logic-intelligent-design-evolution-debate","06:09 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","21"
"11-30-2007","10648",2,"PoliticalRef","292076","So where did we come from? How did all of the matter in the universe propel outward? Is this one of millions of universes that never cease to start, expand, contract, end and then start again? You cannot answer every question with science. A role for philosophy exists in this world. Your answers are tortured and really fail to address the points that I am making. I appreciate the debate however.","lesz","292096","The questions you ask are probably amenable to science. However, even if science were for whatever reason to fail to answer them, why would anyone expect theology -- because that is the branch of philosophy you are referring to -- to be more successful? There is undoubtedly a role for philosophy, but I am not sure that theology really deserves to be called philosophy. It certainly isn't science!","aggressive-evolutionists-abandon-logic-intelligent-design-evolution-debate","06:13 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","22"
"11-30-2007","10648",2,"PoliticalRef","292066","I ascribed potential motivations to the author of the article because I believe it is useful to consider where one is coming from. I did not write that the author explicitly wrote that no God exits, only that he suggests it. I did not write that the author of the article explicitly stated that evolution disproves God's existence, only that it implies this. etc.","Kronus","292115","So in order to discuss an article you made up a bunch of stuff that wasn't in the article, implied it was in the article, and failed to discuss anything that was actually in the article. I see. Will this be a one time thing, or is this the sort of thing we should expect from you on a regular basis? Just wondering.","aggressive-evolutionists-abandon-logic-intelligent-design-evolution-debate","09:48 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","23"

Only proving their version of reality is what is important. They would rather cling to unprovable assumptions which are based in nothing more than man made outcomes derived from wishful thinking. They insist they have supplied us with proof that life first appeared on Earth 4.3 Billion Years ago and are offended when I don't accept their proof as reliable. My question is, how can any rational person really believe that what is theorized to have happened 4.3 billion years ago is so reliable as to be beyond questioning. These people scoff and mock 5000 and even 2000 year old history from written records by educated people who are renowned in History for their record keeping accuracy while accepting these massive assumptions regarding what might have happened 4+ billion years ago on a dead Planet, if the Planet even existed at all back then. The irrationality of the so called intellectual of today boggles the mind.

It's taught in junior level physics: Force. What? The universe is obviously expanding. Therefore it cannot be one of those. Of course you can't answer everything with science. However, your reliance on, ""Don't know, Goddidit"" is childish and quite primitive. Furthermore, your inability to define what you want and to even address my various points is rather annoying. When you cannot even define what you want, how can you expect others to answer it? You are still guilty of what you accuse others of. And you have failed to disprove that ID is not different in principle then Animism.","aggressive-evolutionists-abandon-logic-intelligent-design-evolution-debate","02:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","26"

In psychology, psychological projection (or projection bias) is a defense mechanism in which one attributes to others ones own unacceptable or unwanted thoughts or/and emotions. Projection reduces anxiety by allowing the expression of the unwanted subconscious impulses/desires without letting the ego recognize them.","thelmoose","292172","Irony and hypocrisy are good. How about projection? A different take, but captures the concept of one utterly unable to look at one's own behavior.
