The theory of evolution doesn't address the origin of life. Rightly so. ID is not science. When has science ever, ever taken the position of ""well, we can't seem to figure it out, therefore it is impossible to figure out""? Science doesn't do that. I could also go on about ""irreducible complexity"" and ""specified complexity,"" but it'd be lost on you, wouldn't it? Because even the ID line is the Big Tent. The ID bigwigs know damn well that they can't argue against common descent: the evidence is too strong. Well, that's your claim, anyway.

It just describes some of the changes the ID movement has gone through since the Dover trial. It's pretty much just straight forward journalism, with almost no editorializing.

The chimpanzee shares 98% of the DNA of humans yet they are demonstrably a lower animal with nothing in common to humanity creatively or intellectually. CHICAGO Observed in the wild and tested in captivity, chimpanzees invite comparison with humans, their close relatives. They bear a family resemblance that fascinates people, and scientists see increasing evidence of similarities in chimp behavior and skills, making some of them think on the vagaries of evolution. For some time, paleontologists and evolutionary biologists have known that chimp ancestors were the last line of todays apes to diverge from the branch that led to humans, probably six million, maybe four million years ago. More recent examination shows that despite profound differences in the two species, just a 1.23 percent difference in their genes separates Homo sapiens from chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes. And certain similarities between the two species, scientists say, go beyond expressive faces and opposable thumbs. Chimps display a remarkable range of behavior and talent. They make and use simple tools, hunt in groups and engage in aggressive, violent acts. They are social creatures that appear to be capable of empathy, altruism, self-awareness, cooperation in problem solving and learning through example and experience. Chimps even outperform humans in some memory tasks. They have no imagination or sense of reason that allows them to create as we do so easily.

How did we figure out how to make vaccines or what a vaccine is? How did Mendel start the field of genetics? So everyone at NASA and all their fancy shamancy expensive stuff is all just fake? Have you ever spent time with a chimp? Or watched videos of them? Or bothered to even research them? Or how about talking to a zoologist? how about one of their keepers? Or how about someone who actually knows what they are talking about for a change? http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/17/sc...ml?ref=science Well then. You stand corrected. Now it just remains to be seen if you'll admit you are wrong. History isn't betting on it. But wait, you said that science is unprovable. How did we build up the world, conquer the air, sea and space without unprovable science?!

(Also known as ""Marty! You're not thinking fourth dimensionally!"") Science doesn't say that a high DNA similarity means that mental capacities must be highly similar. A significant number of the differences have to do with the brain, actually. But you didn't know this because presenting your strawman requires maintaining your willful ignorance of these facts. Evolution explains why the DNA of chimps (not ""monkeys"") is so similar to ours. Creationism does not.

I did not write that the author explicitly wrote that no God exits, only that he suggests it. I did not write that the author of the article explicitly stated that evolution disproves God's existence, only that it implies this. etc. I am perfectly willing to consider the science examining evolution. Most evolutionists are unwilling to consider the science examining intelligent design. A bias against even the possibility that an intelligent designer exists within much of the scientific community. This article displays that bias as do your responses to my post. Pretend that you are not biased all you want, the bias is unmistakable. I also do not claim that proof for God exists, only that we should consider the possibility.

Intelligent design lacks science as a whole as it is incapable of producing experiments to prove its assertions or provide geological evidence or even contemporary evidence that its claims are indeed valid. Essentially Intelligent design is nothing more then Goddidit. Things are too complex to explain at the current moment, with the current understanding, therefore God was responsible. ID is fundamentally no different then Animism. What cannot be explained now is the work of God. But instead of rain and sun, it's now the eye.

Therefore I realize that simply because we do not know does not equate to Goddidit. Artur C. Clark once wrote that ""any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" That can easily apply to the natural world. What we believe to be unexplainable only is that way because we have not advanced to the stage where we can explain it. The earliest religion, Animism attributed things like rain, sun and lightning to Gods because they were at a loss to explain the natural world. Those natural occurrences were too complex for them to understand at their developed level. ID is in principle no different. And ID is clearly hiding that their so called intelligent Designer is the Christian God. No religious group other then evangelical Christians have jumped on board in numbers and in funds. The Discovery Institute is funded by Evanglical Christians. Force. Which we know is not intelligent. It can be controlled by intelligent forces but it itself is not intelligent. So? You're displaying the very rational as Animists. ID can be summed up in one phrase: Stuff Complex, Therefore God. If you accept ID, you must accept Animist, or you are a hypocrite. Again, you are guilty of what you accuse others of. Cells did not come by what they are today by 'random' chance. While it is true that mutations are indeed random, the selection of genes and thereby allele frequencies is dictated by a wide variety of factors, few if any are random. Only when you do not understand evolution. For one who is guilty of what he accuses others of, I'm not surprised. What do you mean how we got here? Evolution explains how life grew from primitive single celled organisms into complex multi-celled organisms. That alone explains how we got here. If you're looking for a theory of everything, that's a interdisciplinary study of various sciences, psychology and cultural studies. But mankind is very far from a single unifying theory. I have no idea what you mean by ""how we got here."" That's abiogenesis. Not evolution. How can you accuse people who accept evolution of not studying the science of ID when you won't even bother to study evolution?","aggressive-evolutionists-abandon-logic-intelligent-design-evolution-debate","01:35 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","14"
