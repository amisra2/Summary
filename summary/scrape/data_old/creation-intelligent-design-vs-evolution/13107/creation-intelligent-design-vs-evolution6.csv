"08-22-2009","13107",6,"Archangel","366029","Why continue a debate with someone who is in such denial of what we say that he continually claims we are not answering issues we have directly responded to? It has been proven time and time again that you just ignore what is offered and continue to insist you're right when you're as wrong as wrong can be. As evidence of my point, here below is my prior post which shows clearly that I produced evidence of precisely what you say I didn't, as well as one only needing to have the common sense to recognize the obvious fact that walking on water is defying the known natural physical laws of this world, to point out just one of Jesus supernatural acts. Yet you claim I am running away rather than repeating myself.","obvious_child","366370","Come again? Where have you provided evidence that God changed the physical laws regarding how light changes in a medium with actual evidence? Where have I denied that you did that? Please show me the post where you provided actual evidence of God's secret change of the physical laws. Otherwise, you are lying. All you responded with is Biblical stories of miracles. Thus the logic is, if the Bible said so, it must have happened, if someone took the time to write it down, it must be true. You presented absolutely no testable, empirical evidence. You are arguing that we should take on face value that a miracle happened on Earth, therefore that your argument which makes God a huge liar is valid on the basis of God's historical capacity to produce miracles based on what a single book without verification says. You wonder why we consider you a crackpot? That is probably the funniest thing you've said here. And ironic given how you have deliberately ignored the vast majority of my posts in this thread disproving your bad arguments. You accuse me of doing things you do on a regular basis. Please, show me where I ignore what you offer and insist that I am right. Otherwise, you are indeed lying. Which is what I argued before. The logic presented is if someone took the time to write it down it must be true. How did I ignore what you offered when I have several posts refuting the argument you just gave? I won't get an answer to that because YOU ignore everything you don't like and what people offer to you. The argument you gave and this is a rehash of what I already posted and what you have deliberately ignored is that the Bible presents absolutely no testable evidence that such miracles actually occurred. It presents absolutely no empirical evidence that such physical laws were changed. It presents absolutely no hard proof that such events actually occurred. Your crack pot logic dictates that if the Bible said it here, therefore whatever asinine arguments you make in defense of your invalid beliefs of your interpretation of your God (despite making it a liar which you have deliberately ignored time and time again despite accusing others of doing the same behavior) are valid on the same argument. Just because someone took the time to write it down does not make it true. I'm still waiting for you to show when I claimed I was a Christian. http://www.4forums.com/political/365486-post63.html No response http://www.4forums.com/political/365609-post69.html No response http://www.4forums.com/political/365482-post61.html No response You are the biggest hypocrite this site has ever seen.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","06:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","79"

If I hand you a written testimony of how an event occurred, namely how I did it, but in reality I actually did something very different from what I wrote and then hid the evidence, have I lied in the written testimony? If I hand you written testimony of how an event occurred, namely how I did it, but then give you evidence strongly suggesting that my written testimony is false, have I lied in the written testimony?

"08-23-2009","13107",6,"None","None","None","Penfold","366429","It seems there is a 15year old Indian kid who understands parallax calculations, unlike Archie. We know how far away stars are. There is no ""arbtrary"" about it, it is a straightforward question of mathematics and geometry. No trickster gods necessary. "" In order to calculate how far away a star is, astronomers use a method called parallax. During Earth's orbit, near stars seem to shift their position against the farther stars. This is called parallax shift. By observing the distance of the shift and knowing the diameter of the Earth's orbit, astronomers are able to calculate the parallax angle across the sky. If you follow the line on the diagram from the Earth in January to the appearance of the star in January, then the line from the Earth in July to the appearance of the star in July, you will see that they intersect in the middle. This is the true location of the star. The distance of the star can then be measured using trigonometry. The smaller the parallax shift, the farther away from earth the star is. This method is only accurate for stars within a few hundred light-years of Earth, since when the stars are very far away, the parallax shift is too small to measure. The method of measuring distance to stars beyond 100 light-years is to use Cepheid variable stars. These stars change in brightness over time, with a regular period. This period is directly related to the luminosity of the star--brighter stars have a longer period of light variation. Comparing the apparent brightness of the star to the true brightness allows the astronomer to calculate the distance to the star. This method was discovered by American astronomer Henrietta Leavitt in 1912 and used in the early part of the century to find distances to many globular clusters. .... "" How do astronomers measure the distance to stars? Is it accurate? To persist in the stupidity of denying this, a method not found wanting in 100 years, and of fact that the unit of distance measurement of light YEARS can not be used to measure time, is frankly mad. One light-year is equal to 9,500,000,000,000 kilometers. That is the distance traveled by a photon in one year. If we triangulate the distance between two stars which are equally distant from us as being 9,500,000,000,000 kilometres, then we can confidently say that light from one of those stars will take one year to travel to the other one. It follows from this that stars one hundred times further apart will be 100 light years from each other, and so on. The distance can be a measure of the time light takes to get between two points. If two points are a million light-years apart, then light will take a million years to get from one to the other.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:24 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","83"

But I must compliment you pinfold, as much as you continue to miss the point I was making, at least you took the time to post a thoughtful response. Here's what I said though, and it's all about the FACT that just because stars appear to be hundreds, thousands, or even millions of light years away from us based on our Linear perspective of time and distance, that doesn't mean that the stars were actually placed there that long ago. Here again is what I said: But for a more practical answer, imagine this. In the beginning, space was a void which spanned all of eternity. Only one object/energy source encompassed all of it from one end of its massive emptiness to the other, and that person was my God Yahweh. And in one second or minutes time, he spoke all of the stars that have ever existed, at different intensities and strengths, which causes them to burn out at different times. But he placed them at the very inner and outer limits of time and space at that time. Liken it to a farmer with a hand full of seeds. He pulls back his arm and throws those seeds to the end of the plot of land he is sowing at that time. To the ants on the ground, if they measured the time it would take to reach the farthest seed, it would represent a great distance, but to the farmer it was just one arms throw in time to disperse hundreds of seeds at one time. Now here we are as finite creatures who can only see time from our linear perspective. Time is plastic. Our linear measure is man made for our convenience only. That you place what we call the measure of so called light years is arbitrary at best. But I am getting too deep for you and this discussion. The point is that our God has the ability to place the stars in every corner of not only what we again, arbitrarily call our universe, but throughout all of time and space. But to we puny finite humans who have invented telescopes, it appears that these stars we are seeing today are ancient, based on the perceived yet arbitrarily arrived at distance you believe they are from us. That perception doesn't mean that is actually how long they have been there.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:48 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","84"
"08-23-2009","13107",6,"None","None","None","unkerpaulie","366435","Archangel, here's why obvious child keeps accusing you of arguing that your god is an epic liar. Your theory about God ""throwing"" stars into the universe, yet allowing the light from all these stars to be visible on earth within a single day, requires God to have increased the speed of light by trillions of times. You further argue that God did that on that creation day, then reverted the speed of light back to its regular constant, to make it appear as though these stars are millions of light years away. By this, God would, in future generations, fool scientists into thinking that they are looking at distant stars (which they are), whose multimillion (and sometimes billion) year history only occured in the last 10000 years or so, but sped up dramatically. So what we are looking at is the superslow unfolding of the history of stars that were temporarily sped up, then brought back to normal speed. Not only is this theory both scientifically impossible and biblically inconsistent, it also means that God intentionally took time to create an elaborate fabrication of cosmology on a scale that can be no less described as epic. And you actually believe this is true, because you feel you it helps you to cling to your religion better than believing that stars that are millions of light years away from us must be at least millions of years old if we are able to see them. Review your ""star throwing"" thesis again. If you actually comprehend what you wrote, and the logical repercussions of such an event even taking place (even though you support your thesis with absolutely nothing) you will probably understand why obvious child continues to accuse you of calling your own god an epic liar. I'll save you the trouble of writing your rebuttal to my post and write it for you. You're going to emphatically declare, again, that my errant analysis of what you wrote is a result of my inability to grasp spiritual truths, (but you're not going to say exactly how its wrong, or attempt to correct it) and that it makes no sense trying to reason these things with me, since I'm already committed to my atheistic philosphies. You may also include that since I have nothing but limited man-made logic with which to reference my analysis from, I have no right, nor should I have the audacity to judge the infinite wisdom of God. This is your latest evasion tactic. We can't refute spiritual arguments, so you turn every discussion where you feel overwhelmed by evidence and logic into a spiritual one, simply by quoting some obscure and off topic scripture, rather than reasoned and rational points, then when we point out how your religious rant doesn't come close to addressing the point, you reply that it does, but we lack the spiritual insight to perceive it. Good job. I'm impressed. Did you come up with that concept by yourself?

I said that God spoke all of creation into existence, the statement of Him throwing the stars like a farmer throws grain was an analogy in order to create a mental image to show that millions or billions of years needn't have passed for it to have occurred. Yet from our linear point of view, it would obviously appear to have happened in the distant past. I have also showed how attempting to actually reason with the likes of you and child is a waste of time since I have shown that Jesus DID in fact trump many of the physical laws we are subservient to with the miracles he manifested. These miracles which were witnessed by untold numbers of people at the time, yet you still insist that believing that God isn't limited by His own laws is somehow wrong. Miracles Of Jesus 2 These are solid evidence that Jesus/God isn't submissive to the physical laws which rule the natural world He created us within. So you can call my belief a theory all you like. And you can insist that your finite intellectualism can comprehend what actually occurred before any humans even existed, and apart from Gods word, which gives us the only insight into what actually took place before life existed on Earth. But you will come no closer to actually grasping it apart from the supernatural. Thanks for attempting to write my rebuttal but that kind of takes the reason for debating away, doesn't it? I realize though that you would like nothing more than to spew your atheistic drivel without challenge from me, but that just isn't going to happen here. The fact is that I can't speak to Gods timing based on what He has said in His word, because He doesn't give times or dates. All I can do is attempt to discern how and when He accomplished what Genesis speaks to apart from the man made philosophy of evolution which at its core erases God from the equation of how man came to be here. Genesis doesn't speak to timing as I said, but neither does it speak against my interpretation in any way. What I do know for certain is that your interpretation of the available evidence is wrong. So expecting us to come to some happy medium seems a long shot at best. Gen 1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Gen 1:2 The earth was without form, and void; and darkness [was] [fn] on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. Gen 1:3 Then God said, ""Let there be light""; and there was light. See ""in the beginning:"" Blue Letter Bible - Lexicon And see ""the heaven:"" Blue Letter Bible - Lexicon Also see, ""Let there be light:"" Blue Letter Bible - Lexicon Here are the 3 verses in the original language if you want to break it down word for word.
