Did you think if you posted it for a third time I would respond? Once again, what exactly am I supposed to defend against? Would you mind maybe posting a concise question? Oh, and as for your latest post-you're getting your age of the universe from a blog . Do you see the problem?

Now, I'd ask how the iron core of the planet was heated up since the planet was ""void and empty"" not to mention why we have huge amounts of crystal and magnetically oriented rock all pointing to a molten start, but I know better than to ask simple questions to someone as completely irrational as Arch.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","01:51 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","513"

"09-08-2009","13107",35,"None","None","None","Databed","368764","Well that's when creationists (legitimate scientists too) step in a redefine what a species is. Turns out, even if two breeds cannot breed successfully, they can still be considered the same species because of the gene flow between the two breeds carried by intermittent breeds. This means in order for a new species to emerge, it cannot be able to breed with ANY of the breeds that fall in between. Since a chihuahua can breed with a dachshund which can breed with a hair terrier which can breed with a collie which can breed with a Labrador which can breed with a St. Bernard, you don't really have a new species. This is reasonable, but the solution is to simply kill all the in between dogs, in which case, without changing the two species being considered at all, you have now drawn a firm line between them and created a new species. Natural evolution works like this as well. Fast changes in a species forced by changes in environment and then the rapid weeding out of the changes that are not successful. This creates gaps in the fossil record and gives creationists a good weapon to refute evolution. A jump from one species to the next can be obscure since there is always a gene flow between them though the species that existed between are now extinct. You wont see this as dramatic as with dogs since man made conditions change much faster than natural conditions. You do see the same level of changes in genes, although fewer changes in physical characteristics. This is why we still can breed any two breeds of dog through artificial insemination. There just simply hasn't been enough time for the genome to diverge and you will only see physical characteristics resulting in impossible interbreeding. In enough time, any two breeds of dog and the new breeds bred out of them, will have incompatible DNA among other dogs.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","12:29 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","519"

It is amusing (and further reinforces my point about his irrationality) in that he argued that the planet was never molten from the beginning, that it was 'void and empty.' Now, to people who actually understand geology, that's beyond crazy. I'd love to see Archie's even more irrational claim as to how the iron core of the planet turned molten not to mention the mantle since he argued the planet was ""void and empty."" The problem we all make here is assuming that Archie is rational. Someone who argued that the planet was ""void and empty"" and therefore eliminates all of the geological changes caused by heat is clearly not rational. Archie is not a rational person. Why do we treat him like he is?","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:08 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","525"
