"08-23-2009","13107",7,"Archangel","366478","Since you can't follow what I actually say paulie let me clarify it for you. I said that God spoke all of creation into existence, the statement of Him throwing the stars like a farmer throws grain was an analogy in order to create a mental image to show that millions or billions of years needn't have passed for it to have occurred. Yet from our linear point of view, it would obviously appear to have happened in the distant past. I have also showed how attempting to actually reason with the likes of you and child is a waste of time since I have shown that Jesus DID in fact trump many of the physical laws we are subservient to with the miracles he manifested. These miracles which were witnessed by untold numbers of people at the time, yet you still insist that believing that God isn't limited by His own laws is somehow wrong. Miracles Of Jesus 2 These are solid evidence that Jesus/God isn't submissive to the physical laws which rule the natural world He created us within. So you can call my belief a theory all you like. And you can insist that your finite intellectualism can comprehend what actually occurred before any humans even existed, and apart from Gods word, which gives us the only insight into what actually took place before life existed on Earth. But you will come no closer to actually grasping it apart from the supernatural. Thanks for attempting to write my rebuttal but that kind of takes the reason for debating away, doesn't it? I realize though that you would like nothing more than to spew your atheistic drivel without challenge from me, but that just isn't going to happen here. The fact is that I can't speak to Gods timing based on what He has said in His word, because He doesn't give times or dates. All I can do is attempt to discern how and when He accomplished what Genesis speaks to apart from the man made philosophy of evolution which at its core erases God from the equation of how man came to be here. Genesis doesn't speak to timing as I said, but neither does it speak against my interpretation in any way. What I do know for certain is that your interpretation of the available evidence is wrong. So expecting us to come to some happy medium seems a long shot at best. Gen 1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Gen 1:2 The earth was without form, and void; and darkness [was] [fn] on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. Gen 1:3 Then God said, ""Let there be light""; and there was light. See ""in the beginning:"" Blue Letter Bible - Lexicon And see ""the heaven:"" Blue Letter Bible - Lexicon Also see, ""Let there be light:"" Blue Letter Bible - Lexicon Here are the 3 verses in the original language if you want to break it down word for word. Genesis 1 (Blue Letter Bible: NKJV - New King James Version) Genesis 1 (Blue Letter Bible: NKJV - New King James Version) Genesis 1 (Blue Letter Bible: NKJV - New King James Version)","unkerpaulie","366514","So the first lie is the one God himself created. You pull an utterly garbage theory about God speaking all the stars into existence and speeding up time for certain distant stars out of thin air. You have absolutely no biblical nor scientific nor historical evidence for any of this trash. And in your argument you continuously argue that God is lying to man by making what we observe about the stars ""obviously appear to have happened in the distant past"", distant past meaning millions of years ago instead of thousands. Archie, if you're going to debate, let's see some evidence of your claims. Where's the evidence that time is ""plastic""? Where the evidence that the speed of light can change and has changed in the past? Where's the evidence that time isn't linear? Put up or shut up archie. Yeah, I already wrote this rebuttal for you. And providing passages in the bible of what was written about events of Jesus is NOT PROOF that these events actually took place. First of all, miracles don't exist and never happened. Second of all, you pointing to a written story means nothing. I could also point you to a written passage full of ""evidence"" of harry potter riding a broomstick all around hogworths, witnessed by the entire school population. Didn't I already write this rebuttal? So predictable. Ok, so you admit that that you have no biblical support for your theory. Neither do you have scientific or historical evidence. But you know that you are right and we are wrong, despite the fact that a mountain of evidence supports the notion that the universe is billions of years old. Nothing about plastic time or throwing stars around in here, sorry.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","10:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","92"

"08-24-2009","13107",7,"Archangel","366422","[B]Why continue a debate with someone who is in such denial of what we say that he continually claims we are not answering issues we have directly responded to? It has been proven time and time again that you just ignore what is offered and continue to insist you're right when you're as wrong as wrong can be. As evidence of my point, here below is my prior post which shows clearly that I produced evidence of precisely what you say I didn't, as well as one only needing to have the common sense to recognize the obvious fact that walking on water is defying the known natural physical laws of this world, to point out just one of Jesus supernatural acts. Yet you claim I am running away rather than repeating myself. Come again? Where have you provided evidence that God changed the physical laws regarding how light changes in a medium with actual evidence? Where have I denied that you did that? Please show me the post where you provided actual evidence of God's secret change of the physical laws. Otherwise, you are lying. I already did explain the obnoxious childs dishonesty accipiter. You really need to read the posts before embarrassing yourself asking ridiculous questions. The ignorance that child contributes here is enough for any 5 forums, much less this ONE. I'll save you the trouble of writing your rebuttal to my post and write it for you. You're going to emphatically declare, again, that my errant analysis of what you wrote is a result of my inability to grasp spiritual truths, (but you're not going to say exactly how its wrong, or attempt to correct it) and that it makes no sense trying to reason these things with me, since I'm already committed to my atheistic philosphies. You may also include that since I have nothing but limited man-made logic with which to reference my analysis from, I have no right, nor should I have the audacity to judge the infinite wisdom of God. You notice that this liar never actually supported his claim that I ever ARGUED THAT GOD IS AN EPIC LIAR!!!","obvious_child","366524","SPAMMING IS A BANNABLE OFFENSE. PLEASE REVIEW THE FORUM TOS BEFORE POSTING AGAIN As evidence of my previous point, all you do is cite a book that is not verifiable nor provides actual evidence. I see you utter failed to address the fatal logic in your argument: if someone took the time to write it down, it must be true! Furthermore, for someone who accuses another of not addressing your posts, why have you gone out of your way to ignore the vast majority of my posts? Simple: you're a raging lying hypocrite. Notice this quote: I notice you have yet to provide the asked evidence. You accuse me of ignoring your arguments, yet WHERE is your evidence? Relying on a book where the argument comes down to ""if written therefore true"" is a craptastic method of discussion. Huh. Guess who said that? Unkerpaulie. When faced with a hard argument, you have no replies other than insults. If I am so ignorant, where is your evidence that God changed the physical laws regarding the behavior of light in a medium? And since you believe God changed the physical laws regarding water, where is the evidence of it in nature? Or do you really accept the crackpot belief that if written therefore true? Try again dear failure. http://www.4forums.com/political/365140-post7.html You have yet to refute my first post on this thread. More insults, No actual argument as to why my argument is wrong .

I see absolutely nothing in your posts proving how my argument which argues that your argument makes your God a liar is false. All you claim is that I have never backed it up. Except that you go out of your way to ignore posts that do just that, even when they are directed cited for you. You just ignore the posts where they are cited and pretend that I never backed my argument up. If you think my argument is so false, why didn't you answer post #81's series of questions? http://www.4forums.com/political/366413-post81.html Because you know you are wrong but aren't anywhere mature enough to admit it.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","04:26 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","95"

"08-24-2009","13107",7,"unkerpaulie","366435","Archangel, here's why obvious child keeps accusing you of arguing that your god is an epic liar. Your theory about God ""throwing"" stars into the universe, yet allowing the light from all these stars to be visible on earth within a single day, requires God to have increased the speed of light by trillions of times. Not only is this theory both scientifically impossible and biblically inconsistent, it also means that God intentionally took time to create an elaborate fabrication of cosmology on a scale that can be no less described as epic.","Matthew","366581","Or to have created the photons at the midpoint along their journey! Don't forget that possibility! Granted, there is no conceivable way to test either possibility anyway.... At least in the ancient Aristotelian/Ptolemaic cosmologies employed by most early and medieval Christian thinkers, the distances are not so vast as to raise the issue of God's honesty in the first place. That, for me, is why creationism is such a preposterous idea. Regardless of whether the untestable changing-speed-of-light idea or the equally untestable photons-created-in-mid-transit is how God did it, he's a deceiver either way. He gave us the power of reason, which serves us perfectly well for explaining any number of natural phenomena. But use it on some phenomena, and it gives us systematically false results -- even though God himself set things up that way, and (as Descartes noted) gave us no way to discern that falsehood. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: One might as well worship a trickster deity like Loki or Coyote.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","04:20 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","100"
"08-24-2009","13107",7,"iangb","366539","There are, presumably, some escapes from these two questions if you are determined to be literal.

"08-24-2009","13107",7,"iangb","366589","Quite - see the linked OP! It's solipsism all over again. However - seeing as we both agree that YEC is daft anyway , that my idea shares this quality shouldn't affect YECers' acceptance of it. The real aim of my proposal was designed to allow YECers to maintain their belief in 'creation circa 4000BC', but prevents them from claiming that the scientific evidence is wrong in showing an old universe. Science shows a true history of the universe - and, if you choose to believe it, God set it all going a few millennia ago.","Matthew","366624","Agreed! I may have been a bit unclear. I was trying to point out the daftness of believing that the world is only 7-10,000 years old. But your point is very well-taken: Remember that geologist from Rhode Island who got a PhD studying fossils of extinct marine reptiles? Is this essentially his outlook? Still, it seems a bit dicey for most of 'em. If they admit that the scientific evidence is right, then declaring that, despite appearances, the earth is only 7-10,000 years old looks even crazier than it does now.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:56 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","103"

Here is Chuck Smith, a renowned bible teacher who's audio commentary of Genesis 1:1-8 was taken from the Blue Letter Bible. Listen to him and you will hear many general points and interpretations I have argued here. He doesn't use my analogy of God throwing the stars as a farmer throws seeds, but he does speak of God calling light into existence. He also speaks to the 7,000 to 10,000 year age of the creation event.
