You represent a small percentage of the creationists out there who aren't embarrassed to admit what they believe. Maybe not so much embarrassed - I think its just that they realize this fight is futile for them. Most would rather have silent faith and take comfort in the fact that even if they're wrong about everything, they will never have to know it.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","12:36 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","556"
"09-12-2009","13107",38,"Databed","369259","Nice try Arch. Actually, since you brought it up, the mitochondrial DNA extracted from the Neandertal that you speak of shows conclusively that Neandertal and modern humans do indeed share a common ancestor. They even estimate that the common ancestor existed around 600,000 years ago. Im sure now that you know the science behind it goes against your argument, you will refute the science instead of using it for your purposes as you attempted above. Neandertal DNA Also, we never believed that modern humans evolved from Neandertals. Even without DNA comparisons it was obvious that we evolved along parallel lines. I think you knew this and if you didn't, then you are ignorant to things you don't want to understand. I'm still waiting on any evidence that ERVs are not the result of retroviral insertions. I also expect you will of course show some scientific evidence which shows that the DNA we found in Neandertals does not indicate a common ancestor with modern humans.","Archangel","369336","Here's the point I am attempting to get across to you Db; the interpretation from fossil evidence that asserts that a sub-species of human called Neanderthal interacted with early man is ludicrous and just another lie based on more self serving assumptions. The reason I know this is because all of these alleged sub species of humans were simply different types of extinct apes, and the belief that any of this took place so long ago is also just misinterpreted evolutionist propaganda. This so called science lives by the motto that if you tell a lie enough times it will become the truth. Which explains why you puppets constantly parrot the same misinformation as if they are facts.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:08 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","557"

Yet doesnt show any sort of proof he exists today, and all there is to say he does is a ~2-3000 year old book. or B) A bunch of men, with absolutely no understanding of modern science, decided to write down their 'ideas' about how they came to be. A story, just like the campfire tales of the bogeyman you tell your kids. Simply because they did not have the knowledge or technology to learn about their world. And through the course of the next few millennia we learned more and more about our world, and proved many things through careful experimentation and observation. So much so (with lots more to still be learned) that we dont need that book to give us answers, we are smart enough to get them ourselves. The Bible has never been any more than a roadblock to knowledge. It states you dont need to learn anything about the things around you because 'God did it'. When it should just be a starting point to want to figure out things for ourselves by learning and growing as a species. Saying ""God made us"" adds nothing to our wealth of knowledge, its an excuse to not look further, to stifle progress. And you wonder why atheists tend to be smarter people, its because they had the balls to question what came before them, and made up their own mind through their own observation. NOT by blindly following an ancient book. There is no problem with being spiritual and conscious of a world that is greater than you. The problem comes with following a religion that fails to change with the times or promote learning through science. All the good things religion teaches (morals, love, peace, etc) exist by themselves. Religion merely supports them, it didnt create them. Yet there is no other good deed religion (and god by extension) has ever done.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","02:05 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","566"

"12-03-2009","13107",38,"None","None","None","T.Q","381284","Wow Archie, that site is weak. But what else could anyone expect from you? 7. There are mountains on the bottom of the ocean floor (Jonah 2:5-6). Only in the last century have we discovered that there are towering mountains and deep trenches in the depths of the sea. Jonah 2:6 says: "" I went down to the moorings of the mountains ; The earth with its bars [closed] behind me forever; Yet You have brought up my life from the pit, O LORD, my God."" Odd, doesn't say anything like ""I saw mountains on the ocean floor"". Instead, it says ""I went to the moorings of the mountains"". A rational person, ie anyone not looking to try and make a book of fables seem factual, would take this as a description of depth, down to the ""roots"" of the mountains. But no one ever accused Archie of being rational. or how about this: 10. The Bible states that God created life according to kinds (Genesis 1:24). The fact that God distinguishes kinds, agrees with what scientists observe namely that there are horizontal genetic boundaries beyond which life cannot vary. Life produces after its own kind. Dogs produce dogs, cats produce cats, roses produce roses. Never have we witnessed one kind changing into another kind as evolution supposes. There are truly natural limits to biological change. Typical creationist BS 11.=garbage. Read up Archie 12. Are you kidding me? 13. Apparently not. People really are that stupid 14. Yeah, let's ridicule the ToE (which we don't even attempt to comprehend), but the idea that we were made by magic out of dirt is realistically supported. How else to explain why all life is composed of elements found on this planet? 15. OK, now the stupidity is starting to hurt... 16. What was the water supported on? Where'd the light come from? He hasn't created the stars, moon or sun yet? How do you divide light from darkness? By definition, darkness is the absence of light. Woops, we're past the point that ""accurately express all known aspects of the creation"". Apparently, ""all known aspects of the creation"" consist of floating water and light. 18. Hate to be the one to break it to you, but a sphere is a tad different than a circle. And, while we're on Isaiah, if we're supposed to take ""circle of the earth"" to mean ""the earth is a large spheroid body"", then what are we supposed to make of the preceding verse's use of ""foundations of the earth""? Where are these foundations Archie? 19. OK, explain to me how ""I tell you, in that night there will be two [men] in one bed: the one will be taken and the other will be left"" is ""... a clear indication of a revolving earth, with day and night occurring simultaneously"" 20. XXX? Seriously, you would consider this as support for the factual nature of the bible? 21. Diffused light does not equal seperated light. Really, this is the best you can come up with? 22. Seriously? At this point, I can feel the stupid clawing at my brain. Gah...","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:23 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","568"
