It also says that the earth has corners. Furthermore, it doesn't free-float in space. It orbits the sun. The Bible also says that the earth is fixed and immovable: 1 Chronicles 16:30: ""He has fixed the earth firm, immovable."" Psalm 93:1: ""Thou hast fixed the earth immovable and firm ..."" Psalm 96:10: ""He has fixed the earth firm, immovable ..."" Psalm 104:5: ""Thou didst fix the earth on its foundation so that it never can be shaken."" Isaiah 45:18: ""...who made the earth and fashioned it, and himself fixed it fast..."" Bible thumpers can't have it both ways. They will even twist what their own Bible says to justify a belief in their own mythology. See? Twisting what the Bible says to support mythology. The referenced verse says: ""By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible."" Clearly, this means that the word of God is not visible. It doesn't mean atoms. That site is a laugh, Archy. One would have to be pretty mindless to actually think that it contained any scientific facts. The Bible isn't a book of science.","JPSartre12","381347","For all practical purposes, the earth IS fixed in space.

These guys will just cherry pick it and choose rigid interpretations which attempt to apply them literally. Of course when we ask why life on earth is symbiotic and complimentary from the lowest life forms up to the apex creatures in each species, yet they claim they all came about completely through disconnected random mutations. When reminded of this contradiction these mental midgets will always change the subject and claim it is we who are incapable of understanding the science behind it all. Go figure, huh? Yet they are incapable of recognizing that it is we who point out the dead ends inconsistencies of their science and world view. The greatest lesson I have learned in my time here at 4forums is that it is impossible to actually educate the unteachable stubborn heart and mind of the unbeliever. All we can actually do is to share the truth and ignore their tantrums and rants in protest against the truths we share.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:42 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","574"

There is an interesting website that I would like to recommend to everyone. It takes the history of the Bible and explains in great detail who wrote the books of the new as well as the old testament. These folks then disprove every facet in the Bible. This site even disproves Christ as the son of God by using the Bible itself. Makes for must reading. the site is SCIENCECLUBOFLONGISLAND","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","08:49 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","580"
