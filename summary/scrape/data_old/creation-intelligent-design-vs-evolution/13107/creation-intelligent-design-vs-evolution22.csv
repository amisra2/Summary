So you never insult? You're really good a accusing people of doing things that you do.","obvious_child","367772","Do you reject that your side once argued the same argument? I'd like to get you on record saying you never did this first. It makes citing the post more enjoyable. O'rly? Explain to me how Archie's argument which relies upon a magical near billion cubic miles of sediment makes any sense. Furthermore, explain to me how it is valid because lots of people reject it. You tried this before and failed. What makes you think this time will be any different? You wrongfully attribute your poor arguments to your opponents rather than the person who made the argument. It's like blaming the Democrats for an inherited deficit when your party was the one who spent the money because they are more numerous. What kind of bat**** argument is that? Not in the way that Archie does on a regular basis here. I've never, ever threatened anyone with eternal damnation as a method of argumentation. The only time I do so is utilizing another religion's beliefs as a way to show that no one has the answers, and thus it is foolish to have such absolutist ideas. If you cannot prove they are wrong, how do you expect to prove your own? And since you can't prove your own, how can you rationally make absolutist statements? I've never called people spiritually dead. I've never done all of that XXXX he does. Relying on threats is a sign of how weak one's argument is. The difference between you and Archie is that you are actual able to understand things you initially reject. Steeeve and Daewoo have taken the time to explain things to you and you understand them. Archie doesn't. No matter how simple we make the discussion. No matter how nice we are to him.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","01:13 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","316"

Inductive reasoning is what you use every second of every day of your life, when you put your foot down without looking at precisely where it's going to land (because you assume that the ground will still be there) or when you consider it safe to cross the road because you can't see any traffic approaching (and you assume that this is a true indicator that the road is safe to cross), or when you use your iphone to call a friend (because you assume that the scientific principles of electromagnetism are both true and currently in effect). The scientific method is simply a more formal version of this reasoning - with regards to evolution, scientists have directly observed phenomena such as speciation, 'rapid adaption', mutation and natural selection and are 'assuming' that such phenomena have applied to the planet's past and future, just as you assume that your kettle will always be hot when it has just boiled because you have previously observed this to be the case, or just as the doctor can surmise he's dealing with a burn victim because of past experience. As to the details about the very start of life on earth; it's not all that important. You don't need to know precisely the mass of the water in the kettle to know that you're still going to burn your hand.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:29 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","319"

It couldn't ever be you evolutionists who refuse to acknowledge that you are not only ignoring, but are breaking every established rule of proper and accepted scientific methodology which has always been required for validating REAL scientific conclusions. You refuse to admit that all of the current beliefs you hold to cannot be shown to be founded on anything solid in the way of actual scientific evidence and you seem oblivious to the importance of holding evolution up to the same standards that is required for every other type of science we rely on. But where evolution is concerned, apparently nothing more than inductive reasoning is necessary before coming to absolute conclusions regarding alleged events which supposedly occurred 4.5 BILLION YEARS AGO!!! Said events being the complete foundation upon which this modern theory for the origin of all life on Earth is based no less. Go figure huh? I mean, can a more important scientific issue be accepted as fact based on anymore flimsy evidence than you are offering here as you claim that it is I who don't get it? But once again, It must be Archangel who doesn't understand the intricacies cuz it could never be you pseudo intellectuals who can't prove or support any of your perceived claims who don't get it. That possibility would never occur to you, would it! You are in serious denial and all any of you have to fall back on is the repeated assertion that I don't get it when all I have asked for is real and trustworthy evidence that what you say occurred 4.5 BILLION YEARS AGO actually occurred. That isn't asking too much when we are discussing most important issue in life, which is how life on Earth came to be.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","08:12 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","321"
"09-01-2009","13107",22,"Archangel","367684","But you know what else is true about my friends? You can poll all of them individually and you will find that I have never used our friendship to ask them via PM to aid me in attacking or ganging up on any other poster or posters in any debates I have ever been involved in. Can you make the same claims about your little clique of rabid secular humanists? I think not.","Accipiter","367791","I was referring to the above arch.

Do you really believe that you are the victim of organized attacks by a group of secular humanists?","Archangel","367794","I don't just think it, I know it. I know that members such as Daewoo, LA and the obnoxious child have reached out to members, both new and established for different reasons regarding how to deal with me. Whether it be to align against me in specific debates or to place me on ignore in order to freeze me out. And I have been contacted by some recipients of these PMs and told of these things. Until being warned to cease and desist, and called out on it publicly by one member who was a recipient, the obnoxious child used to contact new members and attempt to align them against me from the get go. This is the quality of the opposition I have been faced with by some of these hate mongers. There was even an organized campaign to inundate the admin with PMs and complaints about me in an effort to get me banned. And all because I refuse to back down and compromise my principles and accept the lies this diabolical opposition promotes at every turn. An opposition which you embrace to your own detriment.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:50 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","323"
"09-01-2009","13107",22,"Archangel","367762","So please stop accusing me of attacking you when all I am doing is telling you the truth regarding the hypocrisy you represent here. Do you get it Matthew? Every time you argue in favor of evolution against the Genesis account you are calling the God you claim to believe in, a liar. Stop that and I will debate evolution with you as a creationist against an evolutionist all day long without calling you a hypocrite..","Matthew","367795","You use this phrase, ""the hypocrisy you represent here,"" three times in this post. It's very much meant to refer to my character, rather than the truth or falsity of anything I say. See, Arch, here's the thing. If you want to tell me that I'm wrong to interpret the Bible non-literally, and explain to me why you think so, I'd have no problem with that. But you won't explain it. Instead, you tell me that I myself already know that I'm wrong, and that I'm saying otherwise anyway. Which is to say, that I'm lying. So it's entirely personal. It has nothing to do with presenting reasons why what I say is not correct, and everything to do with confronting my character (as you see it, of course). May I speak for myself here? Because the fact is, I am not saying this at all. You are saying it about me. I have already said, on multiple occasions, that the Bible expresses truths, but in a non-literal fashion. If you wish to argue against that position, fine. But it's not to impute lying even to the Bible's human authors, let alone to God himself. A non-literally expressed truth is not a lie. As I said earlier, it is becoming increasingly clear -- especially since some comments you made on the abortion threads -- that the root of the problem is this: you make no distinction between how you understand scripture, and scripture itself. It's why you present quotes, but never explain them. You simply declare that the scriptures never come back void -- and then presume that they always come back to others the way they come back to you. Since your opponents thus know what the scriptures mean, when they disagree with you, it's because they're dishonestly ignoring what they know to be the meaning of scripture. I'm not going to stop it, Archie. Because I honestly believe that God is our creator; that the Bible is not literally true, but nonetheless expresses spiritual truths; that life on this planet, including human life, evolved; and much else besides that is realated to these ideas. Honestly. I can see no reason to continue engaging someone who is going to construe any falsehoods I might assert not as honest mistakes but as hypocritical lies. It's a classic case of ""poisoning the well"": the very act of defending myself from the charge of dishonesty is just more evidence of my dishonesty. Until you accept that I am an honest participant in the discussion and treat me accordingly, I shall not discuss anything further with you.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","10:00 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","324"
