Iuris does not deny that evolution cannot be proved but states that the weight of evidence outweighs the evidence of creation by so much that it tips the balance , so to speak. If one believes that there is a God and that the Bible is the literal word of God then one must believe in Genesis. As I have stated , this may be true and if it is then what we see as reality and what IS reality are different things. The essence of faith, ones sense of spirituality and knowledge of God over coming all doubts. As a pick and mix Christian I never was going to be able to sustain the argument that I admitted I did not actually believe. I still sometimes think that if God were to create a world which really does prove that man cannot be 'worldly' and still serve God he would have created the very scenario that we see today.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:44 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","481"

"09-07-2009","13107",33,"gansao","368600","Eureka Iuris! A brilliant answer. Thank you ! I simply cant defend my position any more because I do not have the belief and faith that would sustain it! I respect the person who believes that God created the world as described in the Bible. It MAY be true but as you say it would mean that science is ..well wrong and that would have to mean that we live in a world where reality to us is not in fact real.","Archangel","368616","I will say only one thing regarding this post gansao. And that is that you must place as much faith in the evolutionists interpretation of the available observations we all have access to, as I do in believing that God created the world we inhabit. Especially given that neither side can prove our positions from a scientific standard or certainty. The difference is that Creation is dealing from a position of the Supernatural where no scientific evidence is testable or required. But evolution constantly claims to be a valid scientific field. Then why now, in the face of my unblinking opposition which has exposed the weakness and gaping holes in this alleged science, do they win you over by admitting that nothing they believe in as a science is provable? In other words gansao, you don't need scientific proof to believe in Gods Creation account by faith because you know that God is neither a liar nor an unreliable advocate. But you should always require scientific evidence for evolution if they are going to just turn around and submit more unprovable scientific claims in the next post while admitting that nothing they offer can REALLY be proven every time they are challenged for actual facts by someone like me. Can't you see they are speaking out of both sides of their mouth as they attempt to manipulate you with non answers, irrational fallacies and their ability to manipulate the process of common sense thinking?","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","11:30 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","484"
"09-07-2009","13107",33,"Iuris","None","You can argue that the biblical flood caused ALL the alluvial layers all over the planet. But that would be a seriously major event, and would, honestly, require magically creating a massive amout of water. An event that would have had to leave OTHER traces - traces we have not found. On the other hand, we DO observe how alluvial layers are formed right now, and if we extrapolate from those processes, we see a simply older earth that fits together. Or rather, we observe what fits together and try to come up with an explanation of why it is so. If I am honest, I'd like a serious scientist who believes in the global flood to look at the evidence and reconstruct it. DO SOME SCIENCE WITH IT. If the water left alluvial layers, where did the material come from? Where are the missing mountains that were transformed into sediments? If a massive amount of water came into being, where did the rain start? Where did the massive stresses of it create stresses in the earth crust that it should have? But I never see any of this done.","Archangel","368618","Your question is answered in one simple verse from Genesis, and that is Genesis 7:11. Gen 7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. As for the rest of your objections, they are pure speculation and nothing more. I submit that evidence for the questions you raise exist but are adopted by your version of geology and interpreted to oppose the Flood version of events.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","11:52 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","485"

I'll repeat one line from your post.. Arch... 'In other words gansao, you don't need scientific proof to believe in Gods Creation account by faith because you know that God is neither a liar nor an unreliable advocate' This is what I have been repeating throughout my posts..to prove a scientific point to a man of faith you may have to disprove god. So by definition, you cannot prove that point if that is the case. This has been described as madness, blind faith, stupidity etc etc but that is what happens to the faithful, they are constantly tested and tempted. You know why and you know the consequences. As I believe in evolution I can only respect the creationist view. actually, it gets even worse, I dont think that it matters! Whatever is, is. I wanted undisputable proof of evolution because I knew it didnt exist and the more that some become abusive and angry the easier it was to dismiss their arguments and to frustrate them but as soon as Iuris stated .. Iuris..'At the strictest sense, no past event is actually provable - we cannot observe it any more, we can only infer that it took place from it's consequences. One cannot prove the theory of evolution in this fashion, since it is already in the past and also can not be recreated on a realistic time scale.' I had to be honest and recognise his honesty. From a scientific point of view creationism is unscientific. From a creationist point of view evolution is dishonest and incomplete. If I did not have a creationist in the family I would not give it a second thought but it makes a kind of sense if you see it from the creationists point of view.........","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","12:09 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","486"

Here's what I mean gansao; Let's imagine that the Genesis account told its story as it is up to a point and then described the process of evolution taking over and leading from lower life forms up to human beings who were the evolutionary pinnacle as evidence that life change stops at this apex creature which is a true reflection of God since we resemble His characteristics of reason, imagination and creativity. In other words, let's say God started out creating only the lower animals and allowed evolution to create the process of creation culminating with Human beings which are the final reflection of Him. If this were presented in Gods word then I would be its greatest advocate. The big lie of evolutionists is that we creationists have some axe to grind with evolution since we are somehow threatened by it. That is far from the truth. All I am concerned with is the absolute truth from the living Gods perspective. I don't care if it led to evolution at all as I would accept that without question if I had any inkling at all that it was true. The fact is that the bibles account doesn't read that way. And there is no way to rationally marry the two belief systems and remain scripturally consistent. Therefore I reject evolution in favor of the scriptural account without question and defend what I know is true and trustworthy in spite of what the opposition insists is their truth. Because I know that their truth is a manufactured lie of men. Where as my truth is from God, the maker of all that is. So it isn't necessary for me to have all the questions of the creation account answered in absolute terms in order to know and trust that as long as God knows the answers to these questions, then that knowledge is right, true and secure in Him as a worthy and perfect creator.

"09-07-2009","13107",33,"gansao","368581","You are wrong .The Aristotlian view of the universe can be totally disproven. There are no room for doubt of the modern view of the solar system. I think therefore I am..you are again wrong. I do not have to give these people a thing.They were the first ones to insult me, maybe you should read the posts before the lectures. I am debating this issue independantly to anyone else. If you had read the previous posts you would know that . Maybe you are ignorant of my recent previous posts. Maybe you are ignorant of the title of the thread","obvious_child","368650","Incorrect. We can present working evidence that the Aristotlian view is incorrect. Can we absolutely prove for certain without any doubts it is wrong? No, for the same reason we cannot certainly prove that we are nothing more than a dream of some other being. We have absolute working evidence of evolution. Does that mean we can prove it without any doubts? No. Quite pedestrian. Prove to me that we are not some figment of another being's dream. You are demanding criteria that nothing can ever meet. The whole ""Think therefore I am"" is quite 5th grade. It fails to recognize that what you think is really thinking at all, but merely the linear dreams of another being where you in reality do not exist. Prove to me this is wrong. Good luck. Be that as it may, many people here have little tolerance for bull****. Really? Tell me, Biblical Creation is not when literally interpreted YEC? And you declared that evolution and religion have a problem. Except you made no statement that only select interpretations have problems, thus implying that you do not understand what evolution actually is. Correct me with a post showing you did this if you think I am wrong.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","05:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","489"

His views, particularly on homosexuality and creation are non-negotiable and therefore cannot be changed. Clearly, Archie has no problem living life as a giant walking contradiction. And I think you underestimate the capacity of people to peg him. After all, many of his own claims are self-refuting. Often his own cited link refutes him. If we just stopped talking to him, I'd bet a great many people who read his stuff would come to the same conclusions we have. When you talk about ""star throwing,"" changing the physical laws of the universe without leaving a trace and requiring nearly a billion cubic miles of sediment to magically appear, you are not rational and that is painfully obvious to most people.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","05:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","492"
