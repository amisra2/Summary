Must we go back 4.5 billion years in order to find foundational evidence that gravity exists? If not, and we don't, then of what value is your inane question? Just as Pluto is observable in real time, so is gravity. And if you must know, I never think of gravity in terms of a theory at all. I think of it in terms of being a natural force which I must respect in life since it permeates the world I live in. Does that answer your question?","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","11:52 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","391"

"09-04-2009","13107",27,"Archangel","368052","You mean when it comes to statements you make, context actually matters? Yet when it comes to statements we make, it can just be thrown out the window by you as you continue to insist for years how we argued things we never said at all? Is that how reality works in your corrupted brain little child? I mean I have reposted the exchanges I had with TQ proving that I never implied that people who do math are atheists, but you still assert that I argued that The fact is that you stated very clearly that, ""You know what, Archie is right. Evolution is a total scam."" It doesn't matter how much you deny it now or what you actually meant to say in that post because you made the statement of fact and that's all that counts according to your way of thinking, so it applies to your statements also. Why should I worry about honest context if you don't have to?","obvious_child","368197","Um yeah. Hence when you quote us, we cite the context and everyone laughs at your epic failures. O'rly? Are you rejecting that you never argued oil wasn't a hydrocarbon? That post 81 was the same as post #96? That a permathread link is the same as a single post link? That math isn't atheism? You do know I have actual archival links to your entire arguments of truly dumb statements. Please cite. After all, T.Q called you an XXXXX for your failure to do basic math and you responded to that post calling his world view ""atheistic."" Tell me how that doesn't mean you think math is atheism. Please, cite it. I won't even have to reply. People will simply click the link, read the post and then laugh at your failure to even understand what I wrote. When you, who clearly doesn't understand sarcasm links to that to back up your claim, is read by someone who does understand, you destroy your credibility better than anyone else. So please, go ahead. Just as you do every day with the dirt joke. Oh and I have that link archived to showing you argued that it is not the statement upon which grammar is dependent upon, but the person making the statement. That one is particularly amusing consider you said I screwed the grammar up and Taz didn't despite my linking to Taz's post showing I quoted him verbatim. That will always be a funny memory of your incompetence. Oh Archie. Grammar is dependent upon the statement, NOT THE PERSON! Silly. Show me where I have not. Good luck with that.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","12:45 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","393"

"09-04-2009","13107",27,"None","None","None","obvious_child","368199","I got a question. If I have a standard 8.5 x 11 sheet of white paper, and every day I do something minor to it, say, add some color, fold it, cut it, burn it slightly, submerge it in water, subject it to a little acid, tomato sauce, a little radiation, maybe some gravel, that kind of stuff, after a 1,000 days, is that 8.5x11 sheet of white paper the same as it was when I started? To those who deny macro evolution, it is identical.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","12:49 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","395"
"09-04-2009","13107",27,"None","None","None","Databed","368207","You say you can observe that Pluto orbits the Sun. My point is that nobody has ever witnessed this happen. Therefore to say it does cannot be tested or proven (according to your logic). I compare the micro-evolution you fall back on to a micro-orbit. There is absolutely no way a bunch of micro-orbits result in a macro-orbit and none of your science can prove this (unless you wait another 250 years). This is even less absurd than your claims on evolution. It would be like Pluto leaving a 360 degree vapor trail and STILL denying it orbits the Sun. The thing is, measuring evolution is exactly the same. We make observations. We SEE it happen in labs. From a genetic perspective, it can be shown to happen all the time and this is without ANY historical evidence. We don't even need the wealth of fossil data to show this. To deny it is possible (even POSSIBLE) is simply absurd. You are blinded by your faith and you don't even know it. The truth is simple. YOU ARE NOT SPECIAL. Who are you to claim you understand God more than any other feeble human, past or present.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","03:23 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","396"
"09-04-2009","13107",27,"Archangel","368142","Sorry, I meant macroevolution. I have been discussing the impossibility of macroevolution occurring throughout this whole debate and have likened microevolution to rapid adaptation which does occur in nature. What hasn't occurred and never will is one species of animal evolving into another species which I did explain in the post in which I mistakingly used the term micro rather than macroevolution.","Accipiter","368217","There have been laboratory experiments with fruit flies which have produced the beginnings of speciation. Two populations of fruit flys were separated and kept in separate environments and fed different food. After many generations these fruit flys were brought together and it was found that only flys from the same environment would mate. Given enough time they would become separate species unable to mate.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","08:16 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","398"

And by that I assume you mean that the fruit fly evolved into something other than a fruit fly, right? It was no longer a member of the same genus of creature at all, but had evolved into another type of fly other than a fruit fly? Is that what you're saying? In other words, Fruit flies are properly named Drosophila melanogaster, so their genus is Drosophila and their species is Drosophila melanogaster. There are a bunch of similar kinds of flies that are in different species, and so would have a different two-part name, but would all be Drosophila. Are you saying that after many generations one group of these fruit flies had evolved into a new and unique genus? If so, please produce evidence of this if you can.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","08:36 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","399"

"09-04-2009","13107",27,"Accipiter","368224","Just do a search on, Diane Dodd Speciation","Archangel","368226","What! You aren't interested enough to defend your own claim with evidence? Or do you already see the holes in your evidence? For example, doesn't your evidence show that all of the segregated fruit fly populations remained fruit flies at the end of the experiment? All be it flies which preferred other flies with the same diet? Diane Dodds fruit fly experiment suggests that isolating populations in different environments (e.g., with different food sources) can lead to the beginning of reproductive isolation. These results are consistent with the idea that geographic isolation is an important step of some speciation events. Evidence for speciation As you can see, the result of this experiment promotes the idea of reproductive isolation. The rest of the claims are nothing more than the idea that isolation might lead to some speciation events. But nothing is concluded in absolute terms at all. This just confirms the giant leaps made with little or no actual evidence upon which they are based, at all. With that said, I must ask you, in what valid science is an ""IDEA"" conclusive evidence of any absolute fact at all?","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:31 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","401"

The experiment clearly does not demonstrate the evolution of one species into another but speciation within the same species. It only speculates that is what would happen. It may well be that the amount of generations it would take to one species to evolve into another may be too many for it to be demonstated in the lab. Nevertheless, Archangels point that it has not been demonstrated still holds.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","10:50 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","403"

And do you know why evolutionists love to use fruit flies as subjects in experiments like these? it's because their lifespan is so incredibly short, around 2 weeks long, so many generations can be observed in a shorter amount of time making the probability of observing an actual change more likely. But as we saw with Iangb's e coli experiment, even 40,000+ generations of e coli wasn't enough for it to evolve into anything other than another strain of e coli.

We are mythbusters who refuse to allow you to propagate your religions lies and misrepresentations regarding the origin of life on earth. And that's no fun for you, is it!
