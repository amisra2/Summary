The only difference is I don't stop when it runs contrary to a personal belief. Pretty much. And it works! Well, if I had to guess, I would say either a collision or a near collision. Let's see what they article says: ""The working theory is that WASP-17 was sent spinning in the wrong direction by a gravitational ""close encounter."""" What do you know, I was right. We can also theorize why the sun appears to rise and set, but we can't explain why for certain. If I didn't know that you viewed this as a fatal flaw, I would congratulate you on finally understanding the scientific method. Sketchy to you, because you have a preconceived view of how ""it"" actually is. As I said before, the only difference between how I view science and how you view science is that I don't sort it into ""good science"" and ""bad science"" based on whether or not it meshes with my personal beliefs. I tried ""patiently explaining"" and gave that up as a lost cause about 3 years ago. Yes, speaking of arrogance, tell us more about your superior spirtual perspective... yeesh, there are none so blind...

"08-27-2009","13107",11,"unkerpaulie","366884","Interesting article, the grammar and spelling could use some work. You theorize that all animals and even humans evolved directly or with very few intermediary phases from fish that emerged from the sea. And then you attempt to connect this theory to genesis 1 , of course reinterpreting ""day"" to mean a long undefined period of time rather than a period of evening/morning cycle as the bible very clearly states. Nonetheless, the real problem I see with this theory is the lack of supporting evidence. You say that we have no reason to believe that man evolved from primates, because we have never found the missing link between species (even though we have many specimens that form a very gradual evolutionary chain). How do we then conclude that man must have evolved directly from fish species that walk out onto land? We have no signs of any such evolutionary chain at all. Your case is built upon the fact that human embryos resemble fish embryos, then rodent embryos, then humans, during fetal development. This is also the case with nearly all mammals, including apes, and very likely including extinct homonids. So the link between fish and man seems even more distant than that of man and ape. And it supports the idea, somewhat, that ALL lifeforms are derived from fish forms. However, it doesn't support your model. Imo, what you need to do is create a model that actually matches the real evidence we have, not create a model that matches your already formed beliefs, then only pick out pieces of evidence that fit with that model.","Mosheh Thezion","366980","well.. if you take this basic model, and instead accept that man evolved not directly from apes, but along side it, from a group of common ancestors, which themselves are derived from fish. i.e.. there is a link between humans and apes... but there is no link between humans and bears.. and dogs... or between dogs and elephants... While yes... many species may of evolved over extermely long periods of time, and were around at the time of the Dinosaurs... and our ancestors may be traced back to there... The major species themselves... such as elephant.. and bear... are not related enough to be from a common ancestor. And.. we know as a fact that all land animals came from fish which crawled onto land... and we can presume that there were many many varieties of fish that rose onto land... we can easily see that those varieties are the reasons why there are no missing links between land animal species... and is why in the fossil record, some animals seem to just apear out of no where.. yes... all land animals... evolve in the same way in the womb.. if we were born at 4 weeks.. we would be a fish... as would all animals.. if at 5... we would be a rodent like creature... at 8.. we take on human form... other animals.. the lower ones.. go through this same process.. but they stop along the way into their present form, while we.. continue to develope into humaniods... The basic premise i propose is still good.. even if my delivery is alittle off. i wrote it many years ago, and it needs an update... to be sure. in essence, by recognising the application of qualitive energy, to a closed system, we can see how it would be applying pressure, like a constant screw twisting force, onto our genetic make up, so as to push our evolution... a predestined evolution along at a much faster pace than would be allowed for using mutations and natural selection... but the process is still linked to evolution processes, combined with mass extinctions which allow those with advantages to survive and continue to develop. an predestined evolution based creation, based on applied qualiative energy which pushed genetic transistions into ever more complex forms. -Mosheh Thezion","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","04:00 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","161"
"08-27-2009","13107",11,"zsu2357","366909","O.K. no expert here but if you go with the 6 days 7th rest theory,wouldn't that put the age of the earth around 5-6 thousand years old? like i said no expert here.","Mosheh Thezion","366981","If moses wanted to say the world was 6000 years old, he would have done so.... he could do math. He did not... instead he wrote a metaphoric tale of development, and never said anything about how long it took. you will notice that when adam and eve's child, leaves.. and goes north hto the land of Nod... there he takes a wife.. Where did his wife come from??? clearly.. there were other humans on earth... The 6000 years idea, comes from modern scholars, who think its a good idea to add up the lives of the generations of humans desrcibed in the Torah, between Adam and Abraham.... But... If Moses wanted them to do so, he would of saved them the trouble, and simply said, the world stared 3000 years before Abraham. But he did not... and the whole idea of 6000 is not based on anything accept quick math, by modern people... who dont take the time to think about it. If the universe is 15 Billion years old... it does not reduce the idea of God.. in fact it only increases the awesome glory of God. The 6000 year deal... is unfounded. -Mosheh Thezion","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","04:12 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","162"

"08-27-2009","13107",11,"None","None","None","Archangel","367009","Gen 1:11 Then God said, ""Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, {and} fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit after their kind with seed in them""; and it was so. Gen 1:12 The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit with seed in them, after their kind; and God saw that it was good. ================================================== ================================================== Gen 1:20 Then God said, ""Let the waters teem with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the heavens."" Gen 1:21 God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind; and God saw that it was good. Gen 1:22 God blessed them, saying, ""Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."" Gen 1:23 There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day. Gen 1:24 Then God said, ""Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind: cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth after their kind""; and it was so. Gen 1:25 God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind; and God saw that it was good. Gen 1:26 Then God said, ""Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."" Gen 1:27 God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. Gen 1:28 God blessed them; and God said to them, ""Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth."" Gen 1:29 Then God said, ""Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree which has fruit yielding seed; it shall be food for you; Gen 1:30 and to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the sky and to every thing that moves on the earth which has life, {I have given} every green plant for food""; and it was so. What is fascinating is that nobody is even attempting to actually refute my arguments. Like children, all you can do is mock that which you can't argue against with actual evidence. I am contributing to the content of this discussion with substantial and relevant questions and facts which require an answer if evolution is to be defended as a valid science. Yet all I can expect from the so called defenders is mockery and childish sniping. You wont even touch the meat of the verses above which remains as true today as they were on the day God spoke vegetation and animal life into existence and the plants yielding seeds ""after their own kind"" which is still the way our self sustaining and self perpetuating world works. Man may be involved in genetic manipulation, but not nature as each form of life stays with its own kind as animal life remains balanced and consistent as it was at the time of Creation. You people will post irrelevant and useless studies about e-coli supposedly evolving, yet after even 40,000 generations we see no evidence that it has evolved into anything more than another strain of e coli. Yet you posted it because you are impressed by its results when they prove nothing more than MICRO-EVOLUTION which we believers have referred to as ""Rapid Adaptation"" for years. And neither can you show that one species of animal has ever evolved into another species of animal even though you assert that macro-evolution is a reality. The same physical laws which God established when He spoke creation into existence still apply today. Now, you wont ever post actual positive observable or repeatable evidence that MACRO-EVOLUTION has ever occurred, yet you will respond to this post with your usual insults and mocking snipes which do nothing more than reveal your steadfast refusal to accept the true and real physical laws which are outlined in and have always applied in the Genesis account.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:14 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","165"
