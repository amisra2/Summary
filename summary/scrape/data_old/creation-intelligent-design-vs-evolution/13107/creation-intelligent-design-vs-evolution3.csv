And frankly speaking, anyone with a functioning brain can look at the facts themselves without me saying anything and conclude that literal biblical creationism is total XXXX. Look at Arch. We point out how his argument makes God a liar and what he does do? Insult us.","Penfold","365278","He has nothing else. Bleating about the stars being placed in such a way as to look older than they really are means that his God either intended us to believe something not true, or intended us to live in ignorance of reality. His confusion over light/years vs time/distance suggest Archie cleaves to the latter.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:13 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","31"

That third option is the one you atheists and secular humanists refuse to consider, and that is that God spoke the stars into creation at the same time as Genesis says He spoke everything into existence in 6 days time as Genesis declares. What is dishonest and deceptive about your position is to then extrapolate from that info that it is God who is being deceptive. It is like saying that because you reject the gospel of Jesus as I accurately and honestly share it with you, that it is me lying about that gospel because you have rejected it. It is the most irrational and dishonest reasoning possible, yet it defines the way your minds work.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:32 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","32"
"08-13-2009","13107",3,"Archangel","365276","Really? I have argued that God is an epic liar? Can you point out me arguing that at all you EPIC LIAR? Once again you are interpreting what I have said through that sick and unbalanced mind of yours, and then extrapolating that I am now arguing in favor of calling my God an EPIC LIAR. Is it absolutely impossible for you to debate issues while actually responding to what we really say rather than reading into what we say and redefining it to fit your warped and perverse perspective? I mean, how sick and disturbed must your powers of reason and logic be for you to interpret my argument that Man, because of our linear view of time, is misreading the fact that God placed the stars in space at the same time much more recently than it appears to us to have occurred, that God is then an epic liar? Is God responsible for how we interpret the evidence when we attempt to do it apart from placing Him first and foremost into the equation? Is He the liar? Or are you who think like that deceiving yourselves by ignoring His place in the creation of time and space? It is just completely beyond you to think from an honest and objective perspective, isn't it obvious child! But for a more practical answer, imagine this. In the beginning, space was a void which spanned all of eternity. Only one object/energy source encompassed all of it from one end of its massive emptiness to the other, and that person was my God Yahweh. And in one second or minutes time, he spoke all of the stars that have ever existed, at different intensities and strengths, which causes them to burn out at different times. But he placed them at the very inner and outer limits of time and space at that time. Liken it to a farmer with a hand full of seeds. He pulls back his arm and throws those seeds to the end of the plot of land he is sowing at that time. To the ants on the ground, if they measured the time it would take to reach the farthest seed, it would represent a great distance, but to the farmer it was just one arms throw in time to disperse hundreds of seeds at one time. Now here we are as finite creatures who can only see time from our linear perspective. Time is plastic. Our linear measure is man made for our convenience only. That you place what we call the measure of so called light years is arbitrary at best. But I am getting too deep for you and this discussion. The point is that our God has the ability to place the stars in every corner of not only what we again, arbitrarily call our universe, but throughout all of time and space. But to we puny finite humans who have invented telescopes, it appears that these stars we are seeing today are ancient based on the perceived yet arbitrarily arrived at distance you believe they are from us. But since you are unable to even grasp the hugeness of our God, you also fail to appreciate that light years are a measure of distance rather than time. So by that definition alone, it is foolish to equate it with Earth time rather than Gods ability to reach any distant place in time and space and place stars there.","Accipiter","365281","The problem with this idea is that once you arrive at the belief that god is magic no further learning is needed. I see far to many religious people that know absolutely nothing about the universe they live in as a result. Whats worse is those that try to apply science to defend the literal inturpation of the bible. All they succeed in doing is to confuse the already ignorant religious population.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:33 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","33"

"08-13-2009","13107",3,"Archangel","365286","God IS NOT MAGIC you simpleton. He is the supernatural creator of all that is. He is omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent. He is infinite in that He has no beginning and no end. As He described Himself to Moses who asked Him whom he should tell Pharaoh had sent him, God responded with; ""Tell him I AM sent you."" Try to comprehend that description of our Creators nature and compare it to the wisp of wind you represent in time and space. And then ask yourself what hubris allows you to mock him as you do when you will most assuredly be standing before him in just a blink of an eye, as time is measured. Just because we interpret the available evidence differently, for you to assume from that, that we believers know nothing about the universe we inhabit is arrogance to the max. Read my first paragraph in this post again and tell me that our ignorance has been proven by you humanists in any way at all. Or if in fact, you secularists don't prove your massive ignorance every time you attempt to discuss God, His eternal nature and His character? And at least we can spell.","Accipiter","365291","Ok so why not call it the god is supernatural argument, would you find that more to your liking? Arch there is no defense against the god is supernatural argument so why dont you leave it at that or are you a simpleton?","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","08:36 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","36"
"08-13-2009","13107",3,"Archangel","365293","WOW, as spiritual discussions go, I may as well be dealing with infants. And what is so sad about that statement is that I feel like I am unfairly insulting infants.","Accipiter","365296","Now you have been reduced to making childish insults with nothing of substance in you post. Why not include an argument next time or is that to tough to do?","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:04 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","38"
"08-13-2009","13107",3,"Archangel","365305","You call your statements above, arguments? Why can you post nothing more than insulting and nonsensical drivel yet when I comment on it I am just making childish insults? Why the hypocrisy and double standards in every debate with you deniers of God and His truths? Why can you make the most ignorant and irrational statements from the spiritual perspective, and feel intelligent for it, yet when I call your statements ignorant and shallow, I am being childish and insulting? This just proves that your side has no sense of fair play, honor or justice as you blindly assume that your thinking is correct when you deny the spiritual aspect of your own nature, and actually believe that you are intelligent for doing that. Talk about denying ones own nature and reality, you people epitomize it. Yet it is supposedly me who is lacking arguments?","Accipiter","365309","Because when you reach the point where you begin making childish insults with nothing else in your post, I have won.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","11:04 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","40"
"08-13-2009","13107",3,"Archangel","365319","First of all, this statement wasn't a childish insult at all. It was a statement of fact which defined the shallowness of your insults and the ignorance of their substance. It is your insulting response which is childish. So the only venue which you have won anything in is in your own small mind.","Penfold","365331","Projection is the fundamental mechanism by which we keep our selves uninformed about ourselves.

Furthermore, your own site rejects your argument. In fact your own site which you keep spamming from argues against literal creationism . http://www.4forums.com/political/365222-post22.html Notice: In harmonizing the revelation God has provided us in his Word, the Bible, and in his world, the universe, it seems to me that it is much preferable to spend our efforts on models that do not require us to believe that God has given us fictitious history - either in Scripture or in nature. You just argued that God created a fictitious history and passes it off as the truth. Therefore you argued your God, in your interpretation is a Liar.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","11:03 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","45"
