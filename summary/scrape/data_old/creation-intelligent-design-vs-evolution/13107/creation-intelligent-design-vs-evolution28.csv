By the way, why are you the one demanding evidence when the stories that you speak of as fact are not only ABSURD but also contradict each other. Sure....global flood 6000 or so years ago. Where is the evidence for this? Why should you be allowed to go on touting these stories with no substantiation but instead, much evidence that they are in fact untrue. Why don't you give some evidence that a global flood occurred? You are relying on outdated testimonies based on a primitive understanding of the world. It will soon become a thing of the past as it cannot survive the information age. Just wait.","gansao","368255","I think you will find the title of thread is Effective arguments for DISPROVING Biblical creation.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","12:09 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","408"

When have I once referred to the biblical creation account in refuting the fables you are attempting to defend? The ONLY person here who has referred to the bible at all is you, and only you. And the reason for that is because like the typical philosophical coward that you are, you must change and redirect the subject since you have come to realize that you can't disprove or refute any facts I have offered regarding the myth of evolution. For this reason you have reverted from attempting to defend your false religion to attacking my real and true religion which allows me to place my faith in the true and living God of Creation. But here's the rub Db, I realized long ago that I don't need to use the creation account in order to defeat the lies of evolution. Which is why I have debated evolution completely on your level without pitting the spiritual principles of the bible against the pseudo scientific claims of evolutions myth. But you go right ahead and attack my spiritual perspective of how life came to be. You just further expose your ignorance by not recognizing the difference between a spiritual explanation and an allegedly scientific one which I have successfully refuted at every turn, resulting in turning you into the guy who wrote the inane post above which I am responding to now. But like I said, welcome aboard. I've worn these old time evolutionists out and having you to play with was fun for the couple of posts that you held in there for. Oh, and one more thing my lost friend. People like you have been saying that God and His word are things of the past for thousands of years now, yet here we are in the 21st century and His word and followers of HIM like me still exist in droves. So remember, because this applies directly to you. The wisdom of this world is foolishness to God. And one of the false philosophies he was referring to in that passage is evolution. Just so you know. So don't ever say that God wasn't thinking about you when He inspired His word.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","12:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","409"
"09-04-2009","13107",28,"Databed","368264","Sure, I apologize. But we have posted plenty of evidence that should at least be considered. The fact is that is is not being considered, and I believe it is due to the reason listed above. I must note that my previous posting was closer to the topic than the thread had been. We were not even speaking of Biblical accounts. I pose to Arch, just as he does to us, Biblical creation cannot be true due to the fact that we see no evidence ANYWHERE. There is no evidence of a global flood. There's not enough water to flood the world. There is no evidence for Adam and Eve. In fact, the simple fact that we have found pre-homo sapiens hominids already disproves this account. We see fossil evidence for animals existing way before any humans. The Bible contains absolutely NO information that was not commonly known at the time it was written. It doesn't include anything about other galaxies, solar systems, or even anything about the other 75% of the globe that had not yet been explored. It also contains nothing about dinosaurs or any of the extinct animals that had not been discovered. Shouldn't have God accounted for these things? I realize that Christians have explained away the age of the Earth by saying God is not temporal. This is not in the Bible I might add, but even if it was, didn't it take definitive proof of the age of the Earth before this was used by creationists to account for an old Earth? Maybe not exactly on the subject of creation, but relevant still: There is no evidence that God carved any stone tablets. In fact, it makes sense that people were deceived by Moses who would have been quite good at carving stone. He did, after all, come from Egypt where most of the stone carvings from the time originate. He would have had plenty of time, even according to the Bible, to obtain and create these tablets. Where is evidence for God's hand in any of this? Haven't many of the accounts and interpretations of the Bible been COMPLETELY disproven? The Earth is not the center of the universe. The Earth is not flat. The Earth is older than the Bible claims (not just creation accounts). etc etc History and the Bible do not always agree. Accounts of historical events from other civilizations often contain similar stories, and it is easy to speculate they have common origins, but often the Bible is not consistent with older accounts of the same events. I'm not exactly the most knowledgeable of the details of the Bible (I consider it historical myth), but I do know the basics. I'm sure your defense will in part be to pick apart these statements looking for discrepancies. You will probably ask for specifics, knowing full well what they are or at least what I'm referring to. So, can you you offer any proof that anything I have stated above is not true?","gansao","368272","Point taken....but to Christian creationists somethings are not negotiable .Man was created by God and the Bible is the word of God. They will state quite correctly that science is an approximation..and that is as easy for them to demonstate as disproving the Bible as a true account of the creation is for science. What happens during these 'debates' is that a bitchfest starts, tempers fray and insults abound. Also the Bible does not state that the Earth is flat, nor that it is the centre of the universe neither does it state the age of the Earth. Dont you know that?","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","01:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","411"

Unfortunately, i'm running erands right now and writing this on my iPhone. So hang on till I get back home and I'll respond accordingly. Ok?

"09-04-2009","13107",28,"Databed","368275","It was generally understood that the Earth was flat at the time the Bible was written. There are plenty of statements that at least imply a flat Earth. The general church account of the universe was a geocentric one. This was the belief by all accounts until Galileo found contrary evidence at which time he was persecuted by the Christian church (they have since admitted that this was in error and apologized). So maybe the Bible doesn't say it specifically enough to use as absolute, but this was the interpretation at the time people were writing the Bible.. The Biblical account of genesis DOES imply an age to the Earth. Why do you think there are so many Christians that actually believe the Earth is thousands rather than billions of years old.","gansao","368276","Some ancient Greeks new that the earth was round but let us go to what I actually stated.The Bible does not state that the Earth is flat. The Catholic church adopted the Aristotlian view of the world for what may have been very cynical reasons. Please show me where in the Bible it says that the universe is a geocentic one. The Bible does not state the age of the Earth at all.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","02:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","414"
"09-04-2009","13107",28,"Databed","368277","Maybe not, but I didn't say it was directly stated. If you trace the time line backwards as it is in the 1st testament, though there is no definitive way of doing this, you will find the Bible implies the Earth is only thousands of years old. If you were to make every assumption in such a way as to make the time line as long as possible, you still wouldn't be close, even though each generation is hundreds of years long. Just because one account leaves a window for you to add a few billion years, doesn't mean you can totally discount the one that doesn't. That leads me to another point: How do you explain the contradictions in dates, time lines, places that are presented in the different accounts within the Bible? I just read Genesis and found one within the first few pages. In one account, man comes before the animals. In another, the animals come first. I had never heard this one, so I'm sure creationists have a quick way to explain this away. I would like to hear it. Did I miss something?","gansao","368278","You tell me! My point was that the Bible does not state the age of the Earth.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","03:00 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","416"
"09-04-2009","13107",28,"Databed","368279","Um...ok. It is generally excepted that when there are two different accounts of the same story that one (or both) are false Can they both be true? NO. This means that at least part of the Bible is wrong which in turn gives reasonable doubt directed towards the entirety of the Bible. . This is not to mention the corruption within the Church clergy who compiled the Bible,. a primitive understanding of the world from people who would have observed and interpreted the stories which eventually made it into the Bible, the loss of accuracy from stories that would have been at least partially passed down through oral narrations, the possibility of people simply making things up, limited translation abilities etc etc. I could go on and on.","gansao","368280","Then there is no need to apportion incorrect statements where no statement has been made. Another assumption Another reasonable assumption but an assumption all the same. This is what I stated in a previous post ....but to Christian creationists somethings are not negotiable .Man was created by God and the Bible is the word of God. They will state quite correctly that science is an approximation..and that is as easy for them to demonstate as disproving the Bible as a true account of the creation is for science. and your following posts goes a long way to confirm my point.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","03:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","418"
"09-04-2009","13107",28,"Databed","368284","This is exactly what I have been trying to get Arch to admit that he believes. I guess if it is non-negotiable then there really is no point in arguing. It is simply blind faith and no matter what is thrown at you you will find a reason not to believe it. This is true even if your reasoning is as simple as, ""This idea contradicts my religion, therefore it is untrue."" I do commend you for being honest, gansao. Arch would have only said something to the effect of me not understanding the power what I am reading. I can read and understand English, thank you. We are on different wavelengths. I choose to believe what I can see, find evidence for, or prove. Christians tend to place logic and reasoning secondary to their faith. I could go on to attribute this to childhood brainwashing, but I do respect your belief. I just don't agree with it. ? Can you explain how science is an approximation?","gansao","368289","It's people like your goodself that keep me coming back to this forum Databed. We have had a very strong debate without insults. I am in fact the worst of Christians. I believe that the message of Christ is far more important than the story and I have a leaning towards Buddhism. I suppose therefore I am not a Christian but I think that the creationists raise reasonable points that are simply ignored by others. Your first paragraph is exactly right and that is why creationists and science will never agree. Archangel knows his God. He is at peace with himself and God and knows that when Christ returns he will be accepted by him. I envy that. Without getting too metaphysical just let me give an example. The Apollo moon shot calculations to get the spacecraft to the moon and back used Newtonian physics knowing that the General theory of relativity was a more accurate theory. I understand that Newtonian physics was quite accurate enough do the job. Newtonian physics was an approximation..nearly the correct explanation but was supplanted by Einstein. Einsteins classical physics are today known not to be the exact explanation ...string theory seems to make more sense except there are several different versions but they need multiple dimensions .................................................. ...","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","04:23 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","420"
