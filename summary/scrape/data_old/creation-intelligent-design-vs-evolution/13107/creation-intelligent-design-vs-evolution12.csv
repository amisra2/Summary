"08-27-2009","13107",12,"Archangel","367021","The bible is my source of evidence. [boldface added] If it is so weak a source then you should have no problem refuting it with scientific sources which prove without doubt that macro-evolution has occurred in the animal kingdom. I'm not asking you to accept my evidence without giving you the opportunity to prove it's wrong with scientific sources. I'm asking for scientific sources which actually prove your repeated yet unproven claims that evolution is real. So for once in your life can you accept my challenge and just produce evidence that one species of an actual animal has evolved from one species to another which would prove that macro-evolution is possible? I am showing you that the bible directly and specifically states that macro-evolution cannot naturally occur in nature. BTW, sorry if this frustrates you, but I'm repeating my prior post which still has been ignored... ...by all of your religious evolutionists who worship at the alter of Darwin; which by the way is Idolatry.","Matthew","367026","And the question is, why should those who reject either the Bible or at least your interpretation of it accept your source of evidence as their source of evidence? The Biblical account is weak even on internal grounds . At Genesis 1:26, God is clearly depicted as creating human beings after the other animals. But in the second creation account -- which you have simply ommitted from consideration here -- God is clearly depicted as creating Adam before the other animals at Genesis 2:7. The two accounts are simply not compatible. So the burden of proof is on you to explain why people who think that the above is sheer nonsense when literalized should nonetheless accept it as literally true. Until then, I don't think you're going to have too many people accepting it as ""evidence."" I sometimes get the impression that the only evidence you and many other creationists would accept is thousands upon thousands of years of video, recording how species change over time. That is of course not going to happen. Ergo, evolutionists can't prove their case. QED Never you mind that this sort of ""problem"" would render history and archaeology and forensics impossible. It renders creationism impossible to verify as well. The epistemological bar has been set so high at this point that literally no account of the past could surmount it. No, that's what you say. The Bible merely states that animals reproduce ""after their kinds."" Which, of course, every evolutionist on earth will happily grant you. You don't seem very familiar with the ways in which evolution problematizes the whole notion of ""species"" in the first place. Each generation is sufficiently similar to both its ancestors and descendents that they could all interbreed (barring something very unusual). But over thousands or millions of generations, differences can accumulate such that a very early generation may bear little resemblance to a much later one, and the two may be unable to interbreed. Moreover, it is quite readily observable in nature that many organisms do not reproduce after their own kind. Unrelated bacteria engage in ""lateral gene transfer"" between species, and there is evidence that this may happen in eukaryotic organisms, as well. Many plants will quite naturally hybridize with plants of other species, and the hybrids that are produced are often fertile, capable of reproducing with one or both parent species or with each other. There is even evidence that fertile hybridization occurs more frequently than previously realized in the animal kingdom, especially among invertebrates and fish. So leave to one side the issue of continuity and change over time. The idea that organisms are naturally limited to reproducing ""after their kinds"" is simply false , and this is readily observable in the here and now. If you want to make a big deal out of that phrase, then you have a massive empirical problem on your hands. Because it's completely irrelevant. Evolution is not a religion. It's a natural science that seeks to understand the origins of organisms via natural processes based on empirical evidence from field and experiment. Does this have implications for religion? You bet. Does it make evolution a religion? Not at all. Meanwhile, as far as idolatry goes, I think the most common form in America is the substitution of the Bible for God.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","11:59 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","171"

"08-27-2009","13107",12,"None","None","None","iangb","367033","The singular argument that Archangel clings to is that macroevoution has not been directly observed. All his other arguments have been stripped away from him - his response is either to pretend that they didn't happen (eg: claiming that the e coli never became stronger during the experiment) or to simply ignore the responses to them and repost his original text (eg: ignoring the entirety of this post and ignoring almost all of this one , which between them answer every problem he has come up with since his 'seven evidences of EvoFraud' post). In fact, I've even (in the first of those linked posts) explained the problem with demanding direct observations of 'macroevolution'. I'll do it again though in more detail, because it's an interesting tale. Right from the start, a big creationist argument against evolution was that it had never been observed. Then someone pointed out that selective breeding is a form of evolution, so the argument was quickly reduced to two forms, which persisted until quite recently (I have seen, and argued against, both). Firstly, there was an argument that selective breeding didn't actually produce any new genetic information. The theory ran that God had created wolves with loads of different genes for height, colour etc and all the breeders were doing was breeding dogs that eliminated some of those genes; making the dog more and more a 'pure-bred'. This argument was destroyed by the appearance of animals such as panda shepherds , where a new gene was specifically noted as mutating into existence between generations. The second argument was that all this 'evolution within a species' stuff was somehow irrelevant to the truth of evolution itself - what the creationists now demanded was direct observations of evolution from one species into another - a term dubbed 'macroevolution'. However, since that argument arose there have been several confirmed examples of speciation - both speciation in action (as exampled by the ring species linked to in my previous post) and examples of entirely new species arising. A decent list of some new species is here (yes, Archangel, it's TalkOrigins. However, please note that every single example is cited to an academic paper). So the creationist argument had to backpedal again. And now we find ourselves at Archangels last hope; that because 'macroevolution' - which now apparently means "" a reptile has evolved into a mammal, or that a mammal has evolved into a bird "" - has never been directly observed, evolution as a whole must be false. However, this is clearly an absurd demand. Macroevolution - evolution on a scale larger than a species, has been directly observed - see that link to the list of evidences of speciation . The greatly exaggerated demand for an observed case of 'reptile to bird' is very clearly a straw man, as the evolutionary model itself states that such changes occur over hundreds of thousands of years - and written records haven't been about for that long, never mind documented scientific studies. So rubbishing evolution on the fact that such large transitions have never been directly observed is pointless, because the theory itself states that such transitions occur over a longer period than humanity has been about for. It's like saying that Jesus doesn't exist because you can't find him in the 1908 census data for east London. 'Microevolution' has been directly observed. Speciation - as a result of prolonged microevolution - has been directly observed. The larger transitions are simply extentions of those two observed principles; and as I said in my previous (ignored) post, there is no argument that the extention is not a valid one. There is also fossil evidence of such large transitions, which has been linked to many times and which Archangel has, unsurprisingly, dismissed out of hand. You're out of arguments, Archangel. Repeating them won't help your cause.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","12:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","173"

I'm not asking you to accept it as valid evidence. I'm posting it as valid evidence and asking you to refute it with actual scientific evidence that one species of animal has EVER evolved into another species of animal. In this whole diatribe you still haven't produced any real evidence of any claim you make. So once again because yet another evo apologist can't offer evidence in order to defend what the Creation account says, he attempts to change the subject by derailing the discussion. Start another debate if you want to discuss the reason the two chapters say what they do, but for now, just offer proof that MACRO-EVOLUTION HAS OCCURRED, IN OPPOSITION TO WHAT THIS ALLEGEDLY CONFLICTING ACCOUNT SAYS, PERIOD!!! Again with ridiculous and juvenile assertions. You seem to have no problem producing reams of volumes of convoluted and contradictory conclusions which fail to hold up under the most basic scrutiny, yet with the complete fossil record which you hold up as evidence that evolution is allegedly a valid science, YOU NOW ADMIT FOR ALL TO SEE THAT YOU CAN'T PROVE MACRO-EVOLUTION IS A FACT. FINALLY WE GET ONE HONEST ADMISSION FROM AN EVOLUTIONIST EVEN THOUGH HE WILL NOW DENY THAT'S WHAT HE MEANT TO SAY. Balderdash and foolish bluster. That's all you offer. You may consider the evidentiary bar to be set too high to reach but I have no doubts or problems at all with my evidence. It's a no brainer that the Genesis account is the absolute and undeniable truth which will be born out when the eternal truth is known to each of us. Really? Then you are admitting that MACRO-EVOLUTION has never occurred at all? that evolution is based on the higher forms of biological life which currently fills the earth didn't all evolve from simple celled organisms going back billions of years in earths distant past? Is that what you're admitting here Matthew, my alleged christian brother? Really? Then they evolve and are no longer bacteria? Or are they another genus of bacteria!!! Which is it and support your answer with actual evidence rather than unsupported claims. You're speaking nonsense and gibberish which proves you have no idea what you are saying. All living organisms are composed of cells. A eukaryotic cell is a cell with a nucleus, which contains the cell's chromosomes. Plants, animals, protists, and fungi have eukaryotic cells, unlike the Eubacteria and Archaea, whose cells do not have nuclei and are therefore termed prokaryotic. In addition to having a nucleus, eukaryotic cells differ from prokaryotic cells in being larger and much more structurally and functionally complex. Eukaryotic cells contain subcompartments called organelles, which carry out specialized reactions within their boundaries. A eukaryotic cell may be an individual organism, such as the amoeba, or a highly specialized part of a multicellular organism, such as a neuron. Who are you trying to deceive Matt, yourself or me? Or is it the observers who read these threads? Beside the fact that once again you have just offered cheap lip service but evidence of nothing at all. You are apparently not smart enough to appreciate that all plants are of the same KIND of organism so for rapid adaptation to occur in the wild isn't macro-evolution by any standard of the term. Show me evidence that a plant has evolved into, let's say an insect and I'll be impressed. That is what macro-evolution claims has led to the advent of the human being after all. And that is the crux of this debate. Really? Then what other species of animals do the invertebrates evolve into? And what other species of amphibian, reptile or land mammal have fish evolved into? And why are you just claiming this rather than posting the evidence which will put this debate to rest forever? Why are you expecting me to take your unsubstantiated word for this in a debate where facts are required as evidence for your claims? And yet you haven't produced one iota of evidence to support your unsubstantiated assertions here. Real impressive brother. You're no better an advocate for your religion of evolution than you are for your religion of christianity. Balderdash! It's a philosophically based religion which requires more faith to accept than my monotheistic belief in the God of Israel. And Darwin's book,"" On the Origin of Species"" is your bible. Just remember Matthew, you cannot serve two masters, for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.

"08-27-2009","13107",12,"None","None","None","iangb","367055","Archangel, you seem to be confusing the term species with the term class . This handy link might help you along your way - class is mammal/reptile/fish etc, order is different types of a certain class (eg different types of mammal), then family is different types of a certain order and genus is different types of a certain family. Finally, you get to species, which is different types of genus. For example, Canis is the name for a genus containing the different species wolves, jackels, dogs and coyotes - all of which are of the class 'mammal'. Macroevolution in the biological sense generally involves one species becoming another, not one class becoming another. In macroevolution, the species a mammal macroevolves into... is often another mammal, or a different species. For example, wolves almost macroevolved into the different breeds of dog ('almost' because wolves and dogs are a step further down the list as they are different subspecies, so it's not quite). However, as my link in the previous (ignored - again!) post will show you, there are several observed cases of true macroevolution - for example, different species of mosquitoes. It's only on enormously long timescales that you get evolution between classes - and humanity hasn't been around that long.

Timeline of evolution Timeline of evolution This timeline of the evolution of life outlines the major events in the development of life on the planet Earth. For a thorough explanatory context, see the history of Earth, and geologic time scale. The dates given in this article are estimates based on scientific evidence. In biology, evolution is the process by which populations of organisms acquire and pass on novel traits from generation to generation. Its occurrence over large stretches of time explains the origin of new species and ultimately the vast diversity of the biological world. Contemporary species are related to each other through common descent, products of evolution and speciation over billions of years. Basic timeline: The basic timeline is a 4.6 billion year old Earth, with (very approximately): * 4 billion years of simple cells (prokaryotes), * 3 billion years of photosynthesis, * 2 billion years of complex cells (eukaryotes), * 1 billion years of multicellular life, * 600 million years of simple animals, * 570 million years of arthropods (ancestors of insects, arachnids and crustaceans) * 550 million years of complex animals * 500 million years of fish and proto-amphibians, * 475 million years of land plants, * 400 million years of insects and seeds, * 360 million years of amphibians, * 300 million years of reptiles, * 200 million years of mammals, * 150 million years of birds, * 130 million years of flowers, * 65 million years since the non-avian dinosaurs died out, * 2.5 million years since the appearance of Homo, * 200,000 years since humans started looking like they do today, * 25,000 years since Neanderthals died out. Can you appreciate that all I want is actual evidence that this fairy tale is real and true? That when you look in the mirror tonight, you are actually looking at the distant relative of a fish or a proto-amphibian. Now is that asking too much? The only fact that is relevant for the sake of this debate is that the e coli remained e coli after more than 40,000 generations and 20 years of evolution. All that needs to be pointed out in response to the links you have posted is that the alleged new species evolved from within their own species of creature. What did that mosquito evolve from if not from another mosquito, you simpleton? And what did the Panda Shepherd evolve from if not another dog? And what part did the breeder play in that breeding?
