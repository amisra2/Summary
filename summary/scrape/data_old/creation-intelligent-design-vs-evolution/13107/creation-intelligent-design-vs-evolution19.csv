I think you make some valid points, and I've benefitted from reading your point of view. At the same time, however, my take is that Archangel consistently demonstrates such profound ignorance about science, coupled with bold arrogance, that I'm not surprised to see so many (myself included) exhibit exasperation. In my opinion, Archangel is in the minority in this thread for good reason: because he is ignorant and anti-rational. Whereas I'm typically sympathetic to the plight of those in the minority, precisely for the reasons you've described, I don't think individuals, such as Matthew, should remove themselves from the discussion just because they are in the majority. Rather than adding one more frustrated voice to the ""gang"" opposing Archangel, I think he has set a new standard on these forums. I sincerely believe I would feel the same way were he to argue a point with which I disagreed. (For example, I am indeed an atheist, yet I have no doubt that I would enjoy, and benefit from, reading his motives for being Christian.) Essentially, I don't understand your ultimate point: you seem to be saying that Archangel's discourse is superior to Matthew's because Matthew is part of the majority, rather than the value of his actual writing. Please correct me if I'm wrong.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:09 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","275"

For the life of me I can't comprehend how allegedly intelligent and educated people can swallow the evo drivel which you people do, hook line and sinker. I marvel at the incomprehensibility of it all. You have been deceived. You are believing a lie. You are adopting a false philosophy being sold as a science when it isn't even a valid or legitimate science. And what is worse you are attempting to defend something that you yourselves can't even find the absolutely undeniable evidence which proves that what YOU believe is an actual factual reality. How do you convince yourselves that a so called science is true, when you can't even prove it in absolute terms? Would you accept the science/mechanics that the internal combustion engine was real and valid if nobody ever actually got even one engine to run? I think not. You would say it's interesting in theory but the science doesn't work. And that would be a valid conclusion. But not with evolution. You will readily accept claims made about events which allegedly occurred starting @ 4.5 billion years ago. Events which can't be proven to have occurred at all, so they can't be repeated in a lab because the details of what allegedly occurred are unknown at every level of understanding. Can you tell me precisely what the temperature was back then? Precisely what chemicals made up the atmosphere, if any existed at all? Can you tell me the make up of the primordial ooze which your fairy tale asserts the first proteins or enzymes spontaneously appeared in? Or the temperature or chemical make up of the lava oceans which existed back then, from which the primordial ooze was synthesized over the first couple of billion years? And if I'm so egregiously ignorant tester, then how come I know enough to ask these questions which you giants of intellect have no hope of answering in another billion years? And if you don't know the answers to those initial, most basic questions regarding our origins of life on this planet according to your religions philosophy, then how egregiously ignorant is it of you to presume that the rest of the theory is at all rational? Now come back and tell me that I just don't get it tester. Tell me how ignorant I am as none of you can answer these questions from one source which will give absolute and verifiable evidence regarding the questions I have asked above. Now please forgive my ignorance. I hope I didn't embarrass myself again. Oh, and by the way; I know I wont get an answer from you since you can't answer my questions. But I'm the ignorant one for asking them, right? And your side will once again come back and explain why Archangel is the dumb one around here to reject what any intelligent adult can plainly see is a fairy tale and a lie.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","10:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","279"

Arch makes a dumb argument, we refute it civilly and then he throws insults. That sounds like initiating incivility to me. Unless you think that Archie can do no wrong... You did. You accused the family who filed a lawsuit against a california county to remove a cross atheist. Except they were Jewish. And you had previously stated that Jews and Christians worship the same God. Therefore, as you stated that the family was atheist, then by association their God which is your God is not a God, and since it's not a God and you reject all others, you are an atheist by your own argument. I pointed this out and you later admitted you screwed up, which I commended you for. Notice how I backed it up. Archie never does this. Ever. Where did I say you said the sky was red?

Congratulations on your ""victory,"" Wonko.","Archangel","367652","My victory was a foregone conclusion since you have no hope of answering even the most basic questions regarding the origins of life on earth going back an alleged 4.5 billion years. Sadly though, you will still abandon your claimed christian beliefs in favor of the imaginings and lies of men who also cannot answer those most basic, or should I say foundational questions. I mean, if those chemicals, conditions and the precise environment which existed at that time can't be determined, which means they can't be replicated under controlled conditions or repeated for verification, then how can any reliable conclusions be arrived at? Aren't these long established scientific procedures required in order for real science to have taken place? So then how do you claim that evolution is real science when the very foundation upon which it is based in unprovable by every standard of science which exists today? Now make sure that you all run around the issues as you never answer any of my specific questions directly, and as you make this debate a critique of Archangels internet etiquette. All while as you ignore the attacks on me as I take on 5 or 6 of you at a time. But I expect that oughta end now, on this thread anyway as you all talk around me since you can't actually answer the posts I have written to tester and you. Like I said, philosophical cowards, the bunch of you. And if that true assessment offends you, then find a kiddy forum to post on. And please Matt, you flatter me by calling me Wonko, another one of your man made gods. I am but a humble servant who follows my Lord and honors Him by believing Him and trying to follow His precepts in my life. It is you who place yourself on His level as a God by claiming to know our human origins in opposition to what He says in His word. that, my friend is blasphemy in case you don't know it.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","11:11 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","282"

And yes I know what your position is like. I was on a creationist board before and everyone who tried to argue with me and a few others was annihilated to the point where they pulled archie like insults and banned us because they could not deal with our arguments. This is typical of YEC boards. They gang up and they lose and they resort to banning. Do not attribute your failures to your opponent when the failures are clearly of your own design. That's massive rejection of personal responsibility. And this mattes how again? Archie makes bad arguments, as do you. You fail to recognize that the problem isn't the number of people posting against you, it's the number of bad arguments you give. If 50 people screamed at you that 5+5 was not 10, would that make you wrong when you could conclusive prove that you were right? The fact that your group has to resort to god awful insults that would get you banned on any other forum is a sign of just how weak your arguments are.

I have to say, though, that I'm a little put off by this. In post 241, I didn't say that I found Archie stupid. Believe me when I say that I don't mean this at all facetiously, but I have given a great deal of thought over the last few years to the differences between unintelligence, ignorance, and stupidity, and how we use these terms. I have yet to call Archie either stupid or unintelligent. I do think that, based on what I see here, he is ignorant of evolutionary biology -- or perhaps, given some of the things he said earlier today, just extraordinarily careless about how he chooses to describe it. And the reference to Russell, well, that was a general observation, albeit one that the current exchange brought to mind. I suppose I could point out for clarity's sake that ignorance is no sin -- but being cocksure when you're ignorant, well.... So Archie's attacks on me are my fault? Come on, Marc. I have never called Archie stupid. I have never questioned his Christianity -- though in reaction to his recent treatment of me, I have let him know that I don't find his behavior very Christian. I have tried my level best to treat him respectfully. I have tried to direct my criticisms at what he says and explain why I think what he says is wrong, not attack him. But what I get is constant accusations that I don't really believe in God. That I don't care about what the Bible says. That, ultimately, I am not a Christian. Heck, today, he hit a new low: He accused me, on the basis of God only knows what mode of remote cognition, of not going to church this morning. !!! I am, quite frankly, tired of it. Not true! I teach about ""appeal to popularity"" and ""appeal to force"" all the time. But there's a difference between appealing to populartiy and reasonably arguing in favor of a popular position. You mean like all those conservatives encouraging civil discourse at the town hall meetings? Yeah, they'd never dream about drowning out liberals' comments under an avalanche of boos....","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","11:26 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","284"
