It's because the numbers are too vast for you to imagine, and you don't want to deal with that reality.","tester","367225","Folks often refer to you TalkOrigins.org because you consistently bring up arguments which have been fully dealt with for DECADES. There's little a poster here can add to rebuttals that have been written and revised by experts specifically so laymen can understand them. For a very concise rebuttal, please at least read the Wikipedia entry on Hoyle's Fallacy . Given the complete rejection of such nonsense by all of mainstream science, I think the onus is on you to bring up something new, rather than complain when people get tired of repeating standard answers to your silly criticisms.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","10:54 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","212"
"08-28-2009","13107",15,"Mosheh Thezion","366981","If moses wanted to say the world was 6000 years old, he would have done so.... he could do math. He did not... instead he wrote a metaphoric tale of development, and never said anything about how long it took. you will notice that when adam and eve's child, leaves.. and goes north hto the land of Nod... there he takes a wife.. Where did his wife come from??? clearly.. there were other humans on earth... The 6000 years idea, comes from modern scholars, who think its a good idea to add up the lives of the generations of humans desrcibed in the Torah, between Adam and Abraham.... But... If Moses wanted them to do so, he would of saved them the trouble, and simply said, the world stared 3000 years before Abraham. But he did not... and the whole idea of 6000 is not based on anything accept quick math, by modern people... who dont take the time to think about it. If the universe is 15 Billion years old... it does not reduce the idea of God.. in fact it only increases the awesome glory of God. The 6000 year deal... is unfounded. -Mosheh Thezion","zsu2357","367229","Didn't say I went for it I'm more of an evolutionist.Besides 6000 year deal would contradict all the fossil data collected (again no expert).","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","11:31 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","213"

Many here post serious and thoughtful responses to posts written by those they disagree with. And they deserve equally considered responses in return. But people like you, pinfold.

"08-28-2009","13107",15,"Archangel","367249","Actually it is. The end result of what abiogenesis claims is that from the basic original building blocks which came to exist in the primordial ooze through which all life on earth grew, to what is all modern proteins and complicated bacterium, allegedly resulted from those humble beginnings. So the calculation must include the journey from that beginning to the present result. I can't speak to the accuracy of this claim, but if it's correct, it works in the evolutionists favor since calculating a random infinite number of proteins would result in an even larger outcome, and not in their statistical favor at all. this makes perfect sense and also is necessary since nature would have also worked in incremental changes since evolution didn't jump from the simple original proteins to complex biological life forms by any means. Evolution was most definitely an incremental process if real, so by what standard would you expect billions of modern calculations being performed simultaneously to be expected as if the goal of abio was to result in complex life? Remember, it is you mooks who constantly argue that more complex life has never been the goal of natural selection by way of RANDOM MUTATION. Don't you remember that you claim it is a hit or miss proposition, this evolutionary scam of yours? And here is that sanctimony I mentioned above. Your side can't come up with a calculation which proves how reasonable your pseudo science IS, yet here you are claiming that my side isn't smart enough to comprehend the probability calculation which they did come up with. And you have a problem with this? Doesn't this mean, IF TRUE, that their calculated results work more in your favor rather than against it? If they worked with a larger number of functional enzymes/ribozymes present in a group of random sequences, the massive result they came up with would have been even larger, if the proposed claim is true that is.","T.Q","367257","No, it isn't. The end result of abiogenesis is a self-replicating molecule. The modern cell is a result of billions of years of evolution. I don't think you understand what they're saying here. You don't have to calculate the odds of the specific proteins presently found, merely any proteins which would serve a similar function, this substantially increases the odds. For example, what are the odds of me picking the ace of spade from a deck of cards? Now, what are the odds of me picking a spade from a deck of cards? Again, you're not understanding what they are saying. They are saying that there wasn't one interaction occuring every second/minute/hour(whatever time period you want to use), there were multiple interactions, probably numbering in the billions. A billion interactions taking place one after another takes a long time. A billion interactions taking place at once significantly shortens the time period, and increases the likelihood of a ""desired"" result-a self replicating molecule. And all it takes is one self replicating molecule. It's not sanctimonious to point out someone doesn't know what they're talking about when it's obvious they don't know what they're talking about. Nobody said anything about ""not smart enough"", that's your baggage. Again, you're not understanding what they are saying. Those who claim abiogenesis is impossible are stating ""only ribosomes x,y or z work"", because that is what is present now. The thing is, ribosomes a-z would probably work, it's just that x,y or z are the ones that were happened upon as a solution.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","02:59 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","216"

"08-28-2009","13107",15,"None","None","None","Accipiter","367315","Arch, how do you explain breeding animals? were all the types of dogs we see today created spontaneously by god just as they are today? Breading of animals is artificial selection and it works the same way as natural selection. god seems to have created the world so that natural selection and artificial selection are presented in a very obvious way. Why is god providing all the evidence to lead us to believe that there is a thing called evolution?","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:47 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","219"

Breading of animals is artificial selection and it works the same way as natural selection.","Archangel","367326","I don't have to explain the artificial genetic breeding of animals by Man accipiter because that is exactly what it is. ARTIFICIAL GENETIC BREEDING. It isn't evolution through natural selection by way of random mutations. Don't you get that yet? Nobody on my side of this debate is denying that Man can manipulate genes and cross breed animals into new varieties within their kind. But have you ever seen man turn a LIZARD into a DOG? I think not. Nor will you see it. That is what macro-evolution is claiming what led to your existence, and evolution does claim it happened in reality in that before dogs were dogs, they were first reptiles which evolved from amphibians which evolved from fish and so on going back to proteins and bacteria in the primordial ooze. So the question being debated here isn't whether Man can manipulate genes in breeding certain traits into different types of animals. It's about whether macro-evolution has ever taken place as evolution claims which is how they perceive that every diverse type and variety of life on Earth today originally came from the same single celled protein which was somehow born into and survived in a molten lava environment of helium and sulfuric acid long enough to grow, replicate, and over a couple of billions more years in that environment until the earth slowly cooled, and life somehow formed into more complex organisms. Now, while keeping what I have said in mind, please read what these 3 scholars surmised as the mathematical odds of what evolution claims, actually occurring. And for Gods sake please personally educate yourself regarding this subject before just jumping on the bandwagon of these lemmings who insist that this fairy tale called biological evolution is a fact when it is nothing more than a man made fairy tale. OK? And one more thing accipiter, note the bolded TITLES of these men I'm quoting. These are the men that tester's link implies don't get the math as he offered no real or actual opposing evidence at all which refuted their findings. Go figure huh? Nobel laureate Francis Crick calculated natures chances of producing one small protein: 1 in 10 to the 260th power.(10) Crick reminds us there are only 10 to the 80th power (1 followed by 80 zeros) atoms in the whole universe(11); he concludes even the elementary components of life ""cannot have arisen by pure chance.""(12) Mathematician Emile Borel states an event will never happen when the odds are less than 1 in 10 to the 50th power.(13) Sir Fred Hoyle calculated natures chances of producing the 2000 enzymes found in life: 1 in 10 to the 40,000th power.(14) He states: ""The Darwinian theory of evolution is shown to be plainly wrong.""(15) He concludes: ""Life cannot have had a random beginning(16)...but must have come from a cosmic intelligence.""(17) Nobel laureate Ernst Chain said: ""To postulate that the development and survival of the fittest is entirely a consequence of chance mutations seems to me a hypothesis based on no evidence and irreconciliable with the facts.""(18) Einstein said, ""I want to know how God created this world.""(19) Einstein knew the universe didnt happen by chance.

The reason is because nothing evo claims can be accepted as consistently conclusive in any way. It is speculation and wishful thinking at best. It is a conglomeration of disjointed assumptions which never tie together in a steady and unbroken information stream. If a scientist/engineer submitted the blueprint for a new machine which hasn't been built yet, and commissioned you to build it. Yet where one page ended and the next page began there were gaps in the plan which made it impossible to get a complete view of the finished working model, would you even attempt to build it? Much less have any faith that it would work if you attempted to build it? Of course you wouldn't. But that is precisely what evolutionists do with this pseudo religion/philosophy which attempts to explain how life came to be by erasing the intelligent creator God from the equation. This is a wannabe science, but isn't a science at all.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:57 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","224"
