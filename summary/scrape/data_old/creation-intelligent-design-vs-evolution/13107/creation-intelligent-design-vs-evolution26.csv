I have been discussing the impossibility of macroevolution occurring throughout this whole debate and have likened microevolution to rapid adaptation which does occur in nature. What hasn't occurred and never will is one species of animal evolving into another species which I did explain in the post in which I mistakingly used the term micro rather than macroevolution.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","06:00 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","380"
"09-03-2009","13107",26,"gansao","368115","Is there any undisputable evidence of one species evolving into another?","trebor","368151","Any 'evidence' can be disputed, no matter how strong the evidence is. However, there is evidence of one species evolving into other species where the evidence is so overwhelming that you have to be in strong denial not to accept. I mean, people dispute the moon landing, and the earth being round.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","06:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","381"

Is there some force making sure the creature does not stray too far from its original form? You seem unable to comprehend this, maybe lacking the intellectual intelligence.","Archangel","368158","That's the standard claim from you pseudo intellectuals, isn't it. But no, I'm not lacking any intellectual capacity at all. The fact is that you can't provide one iota of evidence that life evolved from proteins, to complex organisms, to all of the various species which currently exist. In other words, that even one species has evolved into another species, eventually resulting in MAN. You can't even show that evolution relies on the strict and very established rules of running repeatable and verifiable experiments which define the scientific method in every other branch of science. Scientific Method Uses Experiments and Controls: Good Experiments and Controls Generate Valid Scientific Conclusions | Suite101.com Nor can you determine what the foundational conditions and chemicals were that allegedly originally contributed to the evolutionary process which resulted in the life which currently exists on Earth today. So how could you possibly run any accurate, credible, reasonable or valid experiments since you have no actual foundational facts to input into any controlled and repeatable experiments? And of course the larger question is how are you defending a theory in which no foundational information regarding its origins can be determined at all? Does that make sense to you or does it seem completely backwards to you as it does to me? Because it seems rather obvious to me that anyone who would cling to a theory which isn't based on any provable, supportable or repeatable foundation according to the tried, true and proven scientific methods in a laboratory is seriously lacking intellectual intelligence. OOPS! That's your line isn't it. But it's apparent to me that until you can verify the foundational beliefs which allegedly occurred 4.5 billion years ago which you claim led to original life on Earth, then everything else you are claiming and placing your faith in is no different than trying to convince me that Aesop's Fables is a historical record. You might buy into that fairy tale, but I wont.

I asked you a very simple question: ""Do you ""believe"" in the Theory of Gravity?"". You ignored it. Databed asked you a very simple question: ""Is there some force making sure the creature does not stray too far from its original form?"". You ignored it. Accipter asked you a simple question: ""Arch I am wondering what you think about geology? Is it something god made look old for our benefit like he did with the universe?"" You not only ignored it, you belittled him for asking it. Meanwhile, you keep stomping your foot and throwing a fit, declaring no one is providing what you asked for. It's already been provided. You ignored it. You also refuse to answer the questions put to you. How you think any of these threads make you look good is beyond me.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","384"

As for the rest of your claims, I just don't get how you deny the evidence. You keep saying there is none, yet it is being presented to you right and left. People are giving you hard facts. They are directing you to reputable scientific articles where people have devoted their lives to amassing evidence. You think they are simply on a mission to disprove Christianity, but they're not. They simply want to understand the world around them. It is your delusion that they are out to knock religion and that atheism is their religion. That just isn't true. The fact the religious beliefs are the unfortunate victim of mankind's ongoing search for the truth of where we all came from and how our world works is just that, unfortunate. If our studies backed up the claims of the Bible, you'd be a logical person. Since that is not the case, your arguments are simply irrational. Give mankind a few more decades and I think your kind will be very rare. There is simply too much accessible information for people to fall victim to the brainwashing that takes place in so many families with young children.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","10:16 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","386"
"09-03-2009","13107",26,"Databed","368180","Evolution is a very difficult mechanism to demonstrate, but quite easy to understand. Its like proving Pluto orbits the Sun. By your logic, believing that Pluto orbits the Sun is ludicrous.","Archangel","368185","Absolutely ridiculous logic. You truly disappoint me, Db. We can observe Pluto in real time, and have, using the Hubble space telescope with observations resulting in immediate feed back. Here's an example for you. http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/observing/s...tatus_08_27_93 Note items 1.10 and 1.11 respectively. With this quality of real time observations we can and have measured Pluto's orbit around the Sun to exact levels of accuracy. So how do you compare that real time capability and those observations to the guess work and the infinite number of possible chemical and real time physical variations which existed and are complete unknowns by any standard of logical rationale which existed, the also unprovable 4.5 billion years ago that you evolutionists insist represents the age of the earth before any life existed on it? And what is even more telling is that like every single other evolution apologist, you completely redacted the questions I asked you for evidence of, as you offered nothing more than an excuse and an attempted justification for why evolution is easy to understand. The question is, if it's so easy to understand, why can't anyone prove what conditions existed which led to the process leading to our existence through random mutations by way of natural selection?","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","11:14 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","388"

You know, the process explained in this link which you all have completely ignored? Scientific Method Uses Experiments and Controls: Good Experiments and Controls Generate Valid Scientific Conclusions | Suite101.com Can you explain that to me? And tell me, have you read more than 350 posts to see any real evidence presented in this thread? Please feel free to post it as you then justify it in spite of the fact that no foundational evidence for how the modern belief system of evolution exists for all the reasons I asked you about above which you have so conveniently ignored. Don't any of you mental midgets who constantly claim that I am too ignorant to comprehend this science get it that unless the foundation upon which any science is built is first established, reliable and solid, then there is no way at all to know that your end result is accurate, true or real in any way? Is it beyond you pseudo intellectuals to appreciate that FACT of life, that the same rule applies be it building a science or simply building a house? That without a solid foundation, the house will never stand? So how do you just claim that evolution is a very difficult mechanism to demonstrate without being personally troubled that it can't be demonstrated? By the way Db, that solid foundation rule is also a spiritual principle in addition to being a scientific and practical one.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","11:42 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","390"
