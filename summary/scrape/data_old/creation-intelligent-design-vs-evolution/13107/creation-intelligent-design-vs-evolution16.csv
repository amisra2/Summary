I'm posting it as valid evidence and asking you to refute it with actual scientific evidence that one species of animal has EVER evolved into another species of animal. In this whole diatribe you still haven't produced any real evidence of any claim you make. So once again because yet another evo apologist can't offer evidence in order to defend what the Creation account says, he attempts to change the subject by derailing the discussion. Start another debate if you want to discuss the reason the two chapters say what they do.... ...but for now, just offer proof that MACRO-EVOLUTION HAS OCCURRED, IN OPPOSITION TO WHAT THIS ALLEGEDLY CONFLICTING ACCOUNT SAYS, PERIOD!!! [Matthew:]I sometimes get the impression that the only evidence you and many other creationists would accept is thousands upon thousands of years of video, recording how species change over time. That is of course not going to happen. Ergo, evolutionists can't prove their case. QED Again with ridiculous and juvenile assertions. [Matthew:]I sometimes get the impression that the only evidence you and many other creationists would accept is thousands upon thousands of years of video, recording how species change over time. That is of course not going to happen. Ergo, evolutionists can't prove their case. QED You seem to have no problem producing reams of volumes of convoluted and contradictory conclusions which fail to hold up under the most basic scrutiny... ...yet with the complete fossil record which you hold up as evidence that evolution is allegedly a valid science, YOU NOW ADMIT FOR ALL TO SEE THAT YOU CAN'T PROVE MACRO-EVOLUTION IS A FACT. FINALLY WE GET ONE HONEST ADMISSION FROM AN EVOLUTIONIST EVEN THOUGH HE WILL NOW DENY THAT'S WHAT HE MEANT TO SAY. [Matthew:]Never you mind that this sort of ""problem"" would render history and archaeology and forensics impossible. It renders creationism impossible to verify as well. The epistemological bar has been set so high at this point that literally no account of the past could surmount it. Balderdash and foolish bluster. That's all you offer. [Matthew:]Never you mind that this sort of ""problem"" would render history and archaeology and forensics impossible. It renders creationism impossible to verify as well. The epistemological bar has been set so high at this point that literally no account of the past could surmount it. You may consider the evidentiary bar to be set too high to reach but I have no doubts or problems at all with my evidence. It's a no brainer that the Genesis account is the absolute and undeniable truth which will be born out when the eternal truth is known to each of us. [Matthew:]The Bible merely states that animals reproduce ""after their kinds."" Which, of course, every evolutionist on earth will happily grant you. Really? Then you are admitting that MACRO-EVOLUTION has never occurred at all? that evolution is based on the higher forms of biological life which currently fills the earth didn't all evolve from simple celled organisms going back billions of years in earths distant past? Is that what you're admitting here Matthew, my alleged christian brother? [Matthew:]The Bible merely states that animals reproduce ""after their kinds."" Which, of course, every evolutionist on earth will happily grant you. [Matthew:]Unrelated bacteria engage in ""lateral gene transfer"" between species... Really? Then they evolve and are no longer bacteria? Or are they another genus of bacteria!!! Which is it and support your answer with actual evidence rather than unsupported claims. [Matthew:]Unrelated bacteria engage in ""lateral gene transfer"" between species... [Matthew:]and there is evidence that this may happen in eukaryotic organisms You're speaking nonsense and gibberish which proves you have no idea what you are saying. [Matthew:]and there is evidence that this may happen in eukaryotic organisms All living organisms are composed of cells. A eukaryotic cell is a cell with a nucleus, which contains the cell's chromosomes. Plants, animals, protists, and fungi have eukaryotic cells, unlike the Eubacteria and Archaea, whose cells do not have nuclei and are therefore termed prokaryotic. In addition to having a nucleus, eukaryotic cells differ from prokaryotic cells in being larger and much more structurally and functionally complex. Eukaryotic cells contain subcompartments called organelles, which carry out specialized reactions within their boundaries. A eukaryotic cell may be an individual organism, such as the amoeba, or a highly specialized part of a multicellular organism, such as a neuron. [Matthew:]Many plants will quite naturally hybridize with plants of other species, and the hybrids that are produced are often fertile, capable of reproducing with one or both parent species or with each other. Who are you trying to deceive Matt, yourself or me? Or is it the observers who read these threads? [Matthew:]Many plants will quite naturally hybridize with plants of other species, and the hybrids that are produced are often fertile, capable of reproducing with one or both parent species or with each other. Beside the fact that once again you have just offered cheap lip service but evidence of nothing at all. You are apparently not smart enough to appreciate that all plants are of the same KIND of organism so for rapid adaptation to occur in the wild isn't macro-evolution by any standard of the term. Show me evidence that a plant has evolved into, let's say an insect and I'll be impressed. That is what macro-evolution claims has led to the advent of the human being after all. And that is the crux of this debate. [Matthew:]There is even evidence that fertile hybridization occurs more frequently than previously realized in the animal kingdom, especially among invertebrates and fish. Really? [Matthew:]There is even evidence that fertile hybridization occurs more frequently than previously realized in the animal kingdom, especially among invertebrates and fish. Then what other species of animals do the invertebrates evolve into? And what other species of amphibian, reptile or land mammal have fish evolved into? And why are you just claiming this rather than posting the evidence which will put this debate to rest forever? Why are you expecting me to take your unsubstantiated word for this in a debate where facts are required as evidence for your claims? And yet you haven't produced one iota of evidence to support your unsubstantiated assertions here. Real impressive brother. You're no better an advocate for your religion of evolution than you are for your religion of christianity. [Matthew:]Evolution is not a religion. It's a natural science that seeks to understand the origins of organisms via natural processes based on empirical evidence from field and experiment. Does this have implications for religion? You bet. Does it make evolution a religion? Not at all. Meanwhile, as far as idolatry goes, I think the most common form in America is the substitution of the Bible for God. Balderdash! It's a philosophically based religion which requires more faith to accept than my monotheistic belief in the God of Israel. [Matthew:]Evolution is not a religion.

And Darwin's book,"" On the Origin of Species"" is your bible.

You cannot serve God and mammon.","Matthew","367435","I am about to get buried in grading for the better part of two weeks or so. While I do plan to check in and see what others are saying, I won't be able to post for a bit. A temporary last hurrah of sorts. And in much of the rest of my post, my point was precisely that you won't accept any evidence that anyone offers. More in a minute. All due respect, Archie, but go back and look at the very first post on this thread. You want to accuuse me of ""derailing the discussion?"" Please. At least my comments on this score have the merit of referring to my substantive post in response to the OP. There are reams of evidence out there. Book after book after book. All I could really do is recommend that you take a look at that stuff. But I'm afraid that it won't really matter, because there is simply no evidence that you would be willing to accept. Again, More in a minute. Why is this ridiculous or juvenile? I cannot think of one sort of evidence you would accept. Except, perhaps, a direct observation of a member of Species X giving birth to a member of Species Y. Aside from the fact that this isn't going to happen, it displays a profound misunderstanding of what evolution says about the whole notion of species in the first place . You are asking for a sort of evidence that is neither possible nor relevant. That is my point. Such as?... I have yet to see you show any of my views to be inconsistent, on any topic. No, I don't. You are reinforcing my conclusion that you simply didn't understand what I was driving at. True, but in my defense, I'm only denying that's what I meant to say because I didn't say it at all. You have badly misunderstood me. I'm not saying -- either intentionally or in a Freudian slip -- that ""macro-evolution"" can't be proved. I'm saying there is no proof any evolutionist could offer that you would accept. Why is that ""balderdash and foolish bluster?"" If direct observation is an epistemological requirement for science, then no attempt to reconstruct the past could ever be scientific. This would apply to evolution, but also to archaeology, to forensics, and even to creationism itself, since no one can directly observe these purport to describe. And your lack of any doubt at all is precisely why I find your entire religious view so deeply flawed. You are a finite and fallible human being. It is not possible for you to know anything -- anything -- with that kind of certainty. Now who's offering mere ""bluster?"" If this is what you're going to say, don't just say it and declare it a ""no-brainer,"" as if those who disagree are simply stupid. Defend your claim. You can start by explaining what you mean by "" the Genesis account."" To which of the two are you referring?... No. Once again, I am trying to make plain that you do not understand how speciation works. It is very telling that you omitted what I said next. I explained there precisely how each individual organism does , in fact, reproduce ""after its kind."" The difference in kinds does not come about from one generation to the next. It is noticeable only after the great number of intervening generations between a far-distant ancestor and the current generation are no longer with us. Someone -- I think it was Iangb, apologies if it's not -- brought up ""ring-species,"" like herring gulls or certain California salamanders. These species are interesting because they illustrate in space how the process works through time. Travelling around the ring, each population breeds with its neighbors, until you get back to the starting point, where two distinct populations exist and don't interbreed. What keeps them the ""same species"" is the gene flow around the ring. But if the ring breaks -- if a population somewhere in the middle goes extinct and the ring doesn't reconnect -- then gene flow is cut off, and the single species will diverge into two. You really need to consider how all this works. Its not balderdash or bluster, I assure you. It's population genetics. Love the "" alleged Christian brother"" remark, by the way. Again, you simply don't understand the whole notion of what a species is -- or rather, you don't understand just how problematic the whole notion of ""species"" is. They are still bacteria, according to the way we use the term ""bacteria."" But are they still the same ""species"" of bacteria? I'm far from an expert, I'll readily admit. But if they've got new genes, are they ""the same"" as they were before? Perhaps if the new genes don't make much functional difference, we wouldn't recognize them as being at all different. But if they were to make a functional difference, then we likely would. And if there are still other members of the original species around that don't even have the new genes, then we've got divergence. Can ""actual evidence"" clarify matters? I doubt it. Like I said, I'm no expert on LGT in bacteria and its implications for evolution, so I can't give you all the details. But the issue isn't the mechanisms of LGT. What's at issue is what constitutes a ""species"" in biology. And the ""actual evidence,"" far from presenting a clear answer, is what creates the problem. I'm sorry, Archie, but that's simply not the case. I new quite well what I was saying. The last I had read, there was evidence of lateral gene transfer occurring between an epiphytic liverwort and Amorella trichopoda , a flowering plant believed to be the most primordial flowering plant alive today. Let's look at what ""you"" say next: A quick Google search reveals that these are not your own words. Thanks for the citatation. In any event, these things are all true. They are also completely irrelevant to whether or not LGT can or can't occur between eukaryotes. Maybe what's going on between the liverwort and the amborella isn't LGT after all. Or maybe it is. But that will certainly not be because of anything in what you've ""quoted"" here. Based on the facts that these aren't your own words and that they aren't relevant anyway, I'd say it wasn't me who had 'no idea what he was saying.' (You once wondered when I'd invoke my God-given Christian rights to rebuke others. This is typically a bit out of character for me. I hope the above qualifies -- ""my alleged Christian brother."") An interesting thing to ask, given what you did in ""your"" immediately preceding comments. But I digress. (And I shall not bring up the matter again.) Again, this merely displays how little you understand the entire nature of the problem here. ""Kind,"" as you are using it here, is absurdly vague. Can one species of moss ""rapidly adapt"" to changed conditions in such a way that it no longer resembles its own earlier generations living in the original conditions and could no longer breed with them if they were still around? Perhaps more pertinently, can one population of a species of moss ""rapidly adapt"" to changed conditions in this way, even as another population doesn't since it's local conditions don't change, thereby yielding two ""kinds"" that can no longer interbreed, despite sharing common ancestors? If your answer to either of these is ""yes,"" then you believe in macro-evolution . You just think macro-evolution happens quickly, and thus call it ""rapid adaptation."" And simply defining ""plant"" as the relevant ""kind"" isn't going to save you. And I'd be perplexed. This isn't what evolution says happened. Flowering plants evolved from seed plants that didn't originally have flowers. Seed plants evolved from vascular plants that didn't originally have seeds. Vascular plants evolved from land plants that didn't originally have vascular systems. Land plants evolved from algae that couldn't originally survive on dry land. Algae evolved from single-celled eukaryotes that weren't originally photosynthetic. A similar ancestral chain could be put together for insects. It is only somewhere at the level of staggeringly ancient non-photosythetic single-celled eukaryotes that evolution hypothesizes a common ancestor between plants and insects. To claim otherwise indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of evolution. That's not what evolution claims at all. If you want a good look at what evolution actually says about human evolution, check out Carl Zimmers Smithsonian Intimate Guide to Human Origins . Yes, there really is such evidence. Again, you miss the point. Nobody is claiming that contemporary fish are busy evolving into, say, amphibians -- though it would be doggone interesting to crystal-ball mudskippers and see where their descendents are 10 million years from now! Indeed, if a species or genus or family of fish does end up evolving land-dwelling descendents 10 million years from now, it is certainly not bound to be an amphibian, a reptile, a bird, or a mammal. It couldn't be, since the evolutionary lines of those other groups have already diverged from that of the fish lineage in question. You seem to think of evolution in terms of pre-given kinds into which an earlier species evolves. But this isn't how it works. And my point about hybridization is twofold. First, it shows animals not reproducing after their kinds, if by ""kinds"" one means ""species."" Second, it enables evolution by changing the gene flow. I've already brought up Zimmer, so let me mention a couple of his other books: Evolution , which is a general treatment of the subject, including its history; and At the Water's Edge , which is specifically concerned with how land animals evolved from fish, and also how whales evolved from terrestrial mammals. But of course that's just the tip of the iceberg. I will never ask you to take ""my unsubstantiated word"" for anything. I will, however, ask you to go out and do some investigating for yourself. Just be prepared for a lot of material. See above. It is not my fault if you won't look for the evidence on your own. There is so much of it that it is beyond pointless to try to reproduce it all here. If you are so inclined, you can look. Yes, well, it remains the case that evolution is not my religion (or anybody else's for that matter). As for advocating on behalf of Christianity, I'd say that you're not exactly doing a bang-up job on these boards. Maybe it's because of how you behave toward your opponents? Imperious declarations of ""balderdash"" and ""gibberish"" rather than explaining why someone is wrong, hypocritical demands that others stick to your topic even what that topic itself has entirely derailed a thread, name-calling, questioning people's intelligence, attacking their motives, and questioning the honesty of their claims to be Christian simply because they don't believe and behave as you do -- not exactly a model worth emulating, in my estimation. (Guess I'm on roll with that whole ""rebuke"" thing!) Sorry, but no. Like all natural sciences, it's based on drawing inferences from empirical evidence. It does this no differently than we all do in daily life. And it's not at all incompatible with monoetheistic faith. Or at least, not with all versions of it. No, the Bible is my Bible. Darwin's book is about an aspect of nature, not about God or our relationship to Him. And given its complicity with greed-enabling and poor-demonizing economic policies, a better criticism of conservative Christianity could not be made! It's the grand irony: Conservative Christians frequently bash Darwinian biological ideas for their connection to Social Darwinism -- but the economic policies they advocate are merely Social Darwinism with their erroneous Biblical rationalizations substituted for the Spencer's erroneous biological ones. Mammon, indeed. -sigh- No more rebukes from me. Not really my style.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","03:00 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","229"

Archie is one of these, who's argued that the flood created all of the fossils and laid down all of the sediment layers despite that requiring almost a billion cubic miles of sediment. Archie has at least four times this month ignored that despite pushing arguments that require it. Because they are too ignorant to know better, the simple reasonable facts don't play a role in their thinking. One is dishonest, the other is just stupid.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","04:55 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","238"
"08-29-2009","13107",16,"Archangel","367369","If there is mountains of absolute and undeniable evidence which proves that evolution is a fact then why hasn't it been posted? The reason is because nothing evo claims can be accepted as consistently conclusive in any way. It is speculation and wishful thinking at best. It is a conglomeration of disjointed assumptions which never tie together in a steady and unbroken information stream. But that is precisely what evolutionists do with this pseudo religion/philosophy which attempts to explain how life came to be by erasing the intelligent creator God from the equation. This is a wannabe science, but isn't a science at all.","obvious_child","367454","It has. There are dozens, if not hundreds of threads much less posts that do just that. The thing is you deny everything you do not like and ignore everything you cannot deal with. Case in point, last week you argued the flood laid down sediment layers and all of the fossils despite having it earlier pointed out to you in the year that the sediment required would be almost a cubic billion miles. You ignored that again. For someone who makes grandiose statements about Evolution, you sure have a massive problem dealing with the utter and complete failures of your own beliefs. The faulty logic you give is if you reject it, it's not true. You mean like the thread where we produced dozens of evolution backed tangible products and all you did was scream like a little girl? Nothing conclusive eh? Sure, it's not science when evolutionary algorithms go into building a building. When geneticists apply evolution to produce diseases resistant crops. When Exxon oil explorers apply evolutionary timelines to hunt for oil. But then again, you're someone who would argue that quantum physics is all wrong yet cannot define what ""force"" is.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","05:00 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","239"
"08-29-2009","13107",16,"Archangel","367326","But have you ever seen man turn a LIZARD into a DOG? I think not. Nor will you see it. That is what macro-evolution is claiming what led to your existence, and evolution does claim it happened in reality in that before dogs were dogs, they were first reptiles which evolved from amphibians which evolved from fish and so on going back to proteins and bacteria in the primordial ooze. ...every diverse type and variety of life on Earth today originally came from the same single celled protein which was somehow born into and survived in a molten lava environment of helium and sulfuric acid long enough to grow, replicate, and over a couple of billions more years in that environment until the earth slowly cooled, and life somehow formed into more complex organisms. And for Gods sake please personally educate yourself regarding this subject... [Citation:] Nobel laureate Francis Crick[/B] calculated natures chances of producing one small protein: 1 in 10 to the 260th power. Crick reminds us there are only 10 to the 80th power (1 followed by 80 zeros) atoms in the whole universe; he concludes even the elementary components of life ""cannot have arisen by pure chance."" [Citation:] Sir Fred Hoyle calculated natures chances of producing the 2000 enzymes found in life: 1 in 10 to the 40,000th power. He states: ""The Darwinian theory of evolution is shown to be plainly wrong."" He concludes: ""Life cannot have had a random beginning(16)...but must have come from a cosmic intelligence."" [Citation:] Nobel laureate Ernst Chain said: ""To postulate that the development and survival of the fittest is entirely a consequence of chance mutations seems to me a hypothesis based on no evidence and irreconciliable with the facts.""","Matthew","367456","-sigh- Archie, I'm sorry, but this is just wrong. No evolutionist has ever claimed that lizards can turn into dogs. What is claimed is that dogs evolved from wolves. That wolves themselves evolved from other wolf-like carnivores. That wolf-carnivores evolved from other carnivores. That carnivores evolved from other placental mammals. That placental mammals evolved from earlier egg-laying mammals. And that egg-laying mammals evolved from a group of reptiles that were very similar to mammals in a number of respects (e.g. jaw and ear structure, dentition, legs and locomotion, etc.). There are also a number of ways in which these so-called ""mammal-like reptiles"" superficially bear more resemblance to modern lizards than to modern mammals. But the mammal-like reptiles are emphatically not lizards, and this is about as close as you're going to get to a lizards-to-dogs scenario. Again -- huh? A couple billion years of ""a molten lava environment of helium and sulfuric acid?"" I don't think so. Where are you getting this stuff? Right back atcha! Indeed it cannot. And what you are ignoring is that natural selection is not pure chance . Crick himself came to realize that his earlier views of abiogenesis were wrong. Here's a link: http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/reprint/7/1/238.pdf . Hoyle's understanding of Darwinian evolution is the only thing that is ""plainly wrong."" To reword yet repeat, natural selection is not random . Chain is absolutely right: Life did not develop and diversify "" entirely [as] a consequence of chance mutations."" He left out natural selection . It is time to retire the ""life can't have originated or diversified randomly"" non-criticism. Evolution doesn't propose that it did. To say otherwise indicates only that there is a flaw in the speaker's understanding of evolution, not that there is a flaw in the theory of evolution itself.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","05:26 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","240"
