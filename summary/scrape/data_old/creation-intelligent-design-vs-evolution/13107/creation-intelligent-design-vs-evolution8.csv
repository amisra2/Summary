All of which... even if YEC is wrong... does nothing to reduce the concept of God. so, even if YEC is wrong...

Indeed it doesn't. In fact, it eliminates several bad traits that such a God would have to have in order for it to work. I've never seen a valid argument as to why if YEC is wrong (which it is) it invalidates God despite the whining of people like archie.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","02:54 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","108"

"08-25-2009","13107",8,"Archangel","366569","You seem to think that I am alone in my beliefs, but I am just sharing what theologians have deduced from their studies of the bible throughout history. Here is Chuck Smith, a renowned bible teacher who's audio commentary of Genesis 1:1-8 was taken from the Blue Letter Bible. Listen to him and you will hear many general points and interpretations I have argued here. He doesn't use my analogy of God throwing the stars as a farmer throws seeds, but he does speak of God calling light into existence. He also speaks to the 7,000 to 10,000 year age of the creation event. Enjoy, and then comment if you like. http://www.blueletterbible.org/audio...1&ID=10238&t=a","unkerpaulie","366677","Finally, we get somewhere. This is a major admission on your part. I'm actually proud of you for your honesty. I listened to the audio twice. Some of the ideas I'm familiar with. Chuck offers quite a few theories, many of them which are plausible to a certain extent, but all of which have inherent problems. Apparently the idea is to have the listener pick one of the theories that seems to suit that individual the best. The theory that he mentioned that closely resembles what you are arguing here is that God created the earth only 6000 to 10000 years ago, but created it to look like an old planet, complete with fossils, degraded isotopes, varves, and other forms of evidence that suggests that the earth is much older. The reasoning extends from the idea that when God made Adam, he was already a grown and mature man even though he was created that same day. So if God could make a brand new 1-day old man complete with physical signs of age, he could also create a brand new planet and universe, complete with the appearance of being billions of years old. The good thing about this is that, in the creationist's mind, it explains the evidence of a very old earth while maintain that earth is actually young. But the bad thing is that it makes God out to be an epic liar. Why would God think it would be necessary to make the earth look old? Why would God think that he would have to lie to his creation? Couldn't God make a functional brand new planet look brand new? Were fossils miles below the surface of the earth really necessary details that God felt he had to create so that 6000-10000 years into the future his lies would be exposed? Couldn't God have prevented humans from learning the speed of light or principles of trigonometry? For all the years that man was ignorant of the evidence we now know, the biblical creation was completely unquestioned. But surely God would have known that the keeping lid on his deceptive scheme was running out of time. The evidence should never have been there, but it is. And if God made the world to look older than it really was, then surely he would have known that eventually this would have happened. Archangel, do you really believe, personally, that God actually created the earth 6000-10000 years ago, but also created multiple forms of evidence that would make the earth look like it is billions of years old?","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:49 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","111"
"08-25-2009","13107",8,"Mosheh Thezion","366646","Let me say... 1) that the abundant evidence of the sciences can be found to suggest the application of energy from an outside source, and for lack of a better term, that source would be what we refer to as God. 2) the bible does not actually say 6000 years... and reading genesis, we see that the days refered to.. are days to God... not days on earth, since the first day occurs before the earth even forms. 3) If we consider that Nature being created by God, is the means by which we are created, then even if evolution is correct, then it also is part of creation... because God would need a means to create.. a process of.. 4) just because millions may die... over and over again.. in evolution via mass extinctions is not a bad thing... becuse it evolved us as we are.. and WE should be grateful... not everything can live and survive.. otherwise it would be very crowded around here. 5) While a god may exist, there is no need or evidence to suggest that we can personify god to be like us.. as humans.. We.. as humans.. are like god... not the other way around.. and god would not be limited to any of the natural parameters which we as humans use to judge reality or existance... since a god, if he exists, would exist outside and beyond the limits of what we call universal reality. alittle food for though... Theory Atheists, always use science to justify their atheism.. and that is simply because they know so little about science... sorry... -Mosheh thezion","unkerpaulie","366681","Instead of telling us there's abundant evidence, why not actually present the evidence? What energy are you talking about? What was it applied to? Try reading your bible. The evening and the morning were the first day. God mad the sun to rule the day and the moon to rule the night. Genesis makes it very clear that these creation days were regular 24-hour periods. You sound like you're not even sure what you believe. And this is very unbiblical. Did God create man by hand-molding him out of clay and breathing into his nostrils? Or did man emerge over millions of years of evolution from lesser primate ancestors? Which is it? Cool, I think we should really start annihilating species out of existences to make more room for us. Overcrowded planets suck, don't they? Like I said, try actually read your bible. The bible personifies God, not us. And you know so much about science? You don't even know your own bible. And you have shown that you know absolutely nothing about science either.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","08:29 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","112"

For example, he points out that there are no recent fossil layers, nor are any recent strata being formed leaving evidence of recent events for future generations to observe as evidence that this time period existed at all apart from the after affects of floods. All fossils decompose into nothingness in todays world, yet you ignore this evidence since it doesn't fit with your perceived fairy tales. He points to trees standing upright or at angles through strata which your side estimates cover from hundreds of thousands to millions of years of evolution and he points out that you will ignore the reality that this evidence should kill your theory in its tracks for any rational thinkers. But that doesn't stop the evolutionist from making excuses and fallacious justifications in order to get around these realities. These are just a couple of the untold numbers of inconsistencies in evolutionary theory which your side will either ignore or explain away rather than face. But strangely enough, for the creationist who accepts the flood as a true historical event, all of these realities are completely consistent with multiple world wide fossil layers being laid down on top of each other as the waters of the Great Flood receded. Here's a modern day example of what I am saying: http://www.creationresearch.org/crsq..._2b/31_2b.html Especially since you can't even produce evidence that fossilization and stratification occurs today apart from major upheavals such as the great flood which lay down these layers immediately, rather than slowly over eons as evolution suggests. Although Adam was created mature and with the wisdom and knowledge to name every animal on Earth, God didn't lie or deceive at all in His creation of the Earth with its appearance of age in any way. The evidence of that is that we believers can still see Gods hand in what actually occurred based on our faith in Him and His word. It is all a matter of interpretation of the available evidence and your great error is in attempting to define the evidence while erasing God from the equation. That is why you evos are missing the boat. Since I disagree with the accuracy and the premise of your question, I could never answer it without redefining it. With that said, I believe I have answered it with my response above.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:59 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","114"

We have very well preserved remains of animals and humans in peat bogs and other environments that dramatically slow down decay. It takes a very long time for an anaerobic swamp to become petrified into solid rock, but to say that no fossils are being formed is a plain case of denying reality. This argument is so weak I'm surprised you even bother to mention it, as it has been debunked to death. Animals and plant remains that are found deep in the earth got that deep not because the animals burrowed into the ground, but because sand and sediment settled above them slowly, layer by layer, over many many years. Of course a vertical structure would take many many years to be completely buried by layers that are being formed horizontally. This is under the assumption that the flood even occured, for which there is no evidence that it did, nor that noah built a boat big enough, nor the he could possibly have all the animals survive in confinement for 3 years, nor that the planet has enough water for a worldwide flood. Do you REALLY want to tally the inconsistencies of genesis and compare that to the inconsistencies in the scientific theories you argue about? Here is where you really excel at avoiding the issue. We have evidence that the universe is very old, such as visible stars millions of light years away, varve formations that can be counted for over 2 million years, subterranian strata formations with fossils of extinct creatures, multiple radiometric dating methods that all independently date the earth to over 4 billion years. On the other hand, you have a book written by an old superstitious guy who borrowed cultural folklores and myths from other communities and wrote them down, adding his own religious bias. And of course you have faith, which, by definition, is the belief in something for which you have no supporting evidence for. All I can say is, what you claim to believe speaks volumes about the nature of your god.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","02:56 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","119"

Come again? You have evidence that all fossils decompose into nothingness? Or is this another one of your asinine 'i want it to be true, therefore it is."" By your reasoning, all of the fossils we have yet to uncover are ""decomposing into nothingness"" right now. What a hoot. See my signature. The irony here is amusing. tell me, where did miles upon miles of sediment come from? After all, you think that all of the fossil layers were put down during the flood, where did millions of cubic miles of sediment come from? We've gone over this in the past and you ran like a coward . See bottom of the California Tar pits. No more fossilization eh? And stratification occurs every day. The idea that stratification doesn't happen is insane. You just said that gravity does not exist, that soil does not move from higher elevation to lower elevation. stratification is really nothing more than layers of various material being laid down by various natural occurrences. I can see the basis of stratification outside my house right NOW as the wind blows dirt from a ledge onto the street. Cling to your lies.
