So I thought quoting some of the posts which have been ignored would be a good way to do it without having to repeat myself once again. As for your link about ERVs, so what? Every life form on earth has useless DNA, and much of it repetitive in different species which is why we share some of the same useless genetic strands as Apes and rodents and reptiles and birds. The question is, how does that prove your so called common descent instead of a common intelligent designer? Once again it just comes down to perspective and interpretation. We all know that we share 98% of our DNA with Bonobos and 96% with chimps. Yet, look at the difference between us and them. They are clearly lower life forms who have never evolved past their station as animals because they were created in that station as animals. Just as we were created as human beings and remain superior to all members of the animal kingdom and retain dominion over them just as God commanded in Genesis.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","10:48 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","528"

Why would an IDer place ERVs in such a way as to make it look as if they were constantly evolving and branching off into new species along the way? Also, keep i mind we know the source of these ERVs. You can always say that God put them there, and we can never prove you wrong in that, but you could use that to explain anything (which you pretty much do I guess). It doesn't mean you should... I doubt God would like his people interpreting what he did and claiming to know his mind. I would hope that a creationist would read and understand the assertion made by ERV mapping before refuting it. At least understand the mechanics of it from an evolutionist's point of view. In any case, at least understanding what you are refuting helps you to better understand your own point of view.

I mention that just for clarity since referring to Him as God is quicker and easier. Now, you are making another absolute claim here which implies that ERVs, meaning useless genetic code isn't present in all animals. You assert this alleged inconsistency and makes it appear that animals were constantly evolving and branching off into new species. But as usual, you haven't posted any evidence at all that anything you have asserted is true in any way, in reality. Prove that useless genetic code isn't found in every single form of life on Earth, including plants, and that one species has ever evolved into another species thereby proving that macroevolution has ever occurred. Really? We know with irrefutable surety the source and reason why useless genetic code is found, but not in every form of life as you say above? Then why haven't you posted any source evidence of this? Because I disagree with this conclusion completely. I would, and I did which is why I am saying that useless genetic/dead end code has been found in every animal type studied in the ongoing genome project. But what is more inaccurate and deceptive, not to mention just one more example of the evolutionists ignorance is the claim in and of itself that any genetic material in any creature is JUNK DNA or useless material just because science is currently unable to explain its value to the whole gene, or to its interaction with the larger cellular system. The facts will eventually be realized by your side that what is currently undefined genetic material and therefore considered junk DNA, very specifically impacts gene transcriptions in cells which we currently see no connections between. This is why with an overall appearance that we share 96% of our DNA with chimps, it is that very junk DNA which we can't currently predict, visualize or explain that contributes to our very stark and superior differences to them, not to mention the value of the obvious 4% known genetic difference. So what can I say Db, you can't even prove that your sciences interpretation of what the genome project is learning is accurate in regards to their interpretation of the available results. Which is my whole complaint about evolution in a nutshell. Because you see, if the original premise upon which all legitimate science is based, is FALSE as it relies on the FALSE science of evolution which most assuredly is corrupted in its origins; then every single subsequent byproduct/conclusion derived from it will be corrupted, misleading and ultimately contaminated. That's why no science should ever be attempted with the goal of proving or validating evolution because that will only lead to corrupted results in the end. Now feel free to prove me wrong rather than just change the subject again.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","10:37 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","530"

Has not my argument been all along that we interpret and define the same evidence differently? But even though, I defy you to find a secular explanation which disagrees with my conclusions. All you cowards do is sit back and throw stones as you accuse me of not understanding when you don't even dare to commit to offering a real opinion with any evidence to support it. So if you don't dare speak for yourself in proving anything you say, then don't speak for Db. I'm sure he can defend his position with out your help and without you telling him what he believes and knows. Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are some of the most cited evidences for evolution. They are part of the suite of junk DNA that supposedly comprised the vast majority of our DNA. ERVs are said to be parasitic retroviral DNA sequences that infected our genome long ago and have stayed there ever since. These short DNA strands are found throughout the human genome, and make up about 5% of the DNA,1 or about 10% of the total amount of DNA that is classified as transposable elements (i.e. 50%).2 Large scale function for 'endogenous retroviruses'","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","03:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","532"

It makes more since to me to use it the way I did, but if its already claimed, I will say God instead. Arch, there is a distinct difference between ordinary junk DNA and ERVs. The difference is that, while ordinary junk DNA can be ascribed to genetic drift modifying into unrecognizable sequences genes that are shut off or otherwise useless (1) , ERVs have a definite source within our DNA. These ERVs match exactly the sequences of DNA we find in today's retroviruses. We can also simulate the mechanism (that being a VIRUS inserting its DNA into a host's DNA), in a laboratory. We can calculate the odds of this happening to a sperm or egg and then that cell fertilizing or being fertilized, and therefore the frequency by which these should be popping up within ANY animal's DNA. When we look, we find them just as we expect. We then look for this ERV FINGERPRINT that is caused by the UNIQUE EVENT of a virus doing its thing as described above in multiple species. If two species have the SAME ERV FINGERPRINT , we know they have a common ancestor whose DNA was infiltrated by viral DNA during the UNIQUE EVENT described above. I think you may be unable to understand how I am describing that the ERVs propagate through DNA of many species because you refuse to understand the mechanism of evolution itself. I'm not saying you lack the ability, I just don't think you are willing to understand it.

"09-10-2009","13107",36,"None","None","None","unkerpaulie","369073","One of the recurring themes of the creationist position is that since science doesn't provide conclusive proof for anything (or for most things), then we should reject science and accept what the bible says because the bible is equally incapable of providing supporting proof, but at least with the bible you tell yourself that you will go to heaven when you die (another view incapable of bein proven). What archie and creationists in general fail to realize (or realize but pretend to deny), is that science isn't supposed to prove anything. All science does is tries to look at observable phenomena objectively, try to test reasons how these phenomena occur, and come to reasonable explanations based on these tests. Science is not a doctrine. Its a method. You can employ this method yourself and draw your own hypothses, test these hypotheses yourself, and use your own conclusions to make predictions about the phenomena. That's all there is to it. Evolution is a theory because the evidence suggests that evolution is a reasonable conclusion. Besides the events in genesis, which are not observable phenomena at all, there is no evidence that suggests that evolution is not true. And for all the evidence that casts doubt on the theory of evolution, the evidence that supports it far outweighs the counter-evidence. The reason you continually deny the validity of the scientific method on this particular issue (its actually quite hypocritical of you that you rely on the conclusions of science for over 99% of what you believe to be true) is because you begin with a foregone conclusion before you attempt to doing any testing. Because of this, it would be impossible for you to employ the scientific method. You are incapable of thinking scientifically because a prerequisite of the scientific method is objective observation, like I said above. So in order to defend your foregone conclusion you must pretend to deny the validity of the scientific method. You are going to attempt to refute this by demanding that I show proof of what I'm talking about, or evidence that supports evolution that outweighs the evidence against it. I'm going to deal with that objection in advance. I'm not going to post evidence, links, pastes or lists. This has been done exhaustively in the past on this forum, and will continue to be. More relevantly, that isn't what my post is about. I'm not arguing whether evolution is a valid conclusion or not. I'm discussing your incessant denial of the scientific method. The evidence for that is what you provide everyday here in every post you make. You have a very deep-rooted preconceived conclusion, which you regularly publish. You also assume that scientists (which you generally lump together as ""evolutionists"") also have a foregone conclusion in favor of evolution. This is a totally baseless assertion which you are incapable of supporting, and I suggest you either back up this accusation or keep your uninformed assertion to yourself. Because you inevitably must reject the scientific method, and because by necessity you must continue to pretend that you don't understand the concepts that lead to the conclusions other scientists come to, and because your own preconceived notion incapacitates you from making objective observations, then no matter how well explained and simplified the subject matter is presented, it will be always in vain. This is what databed did here, and yet the outcome is the same.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","04:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","539"
