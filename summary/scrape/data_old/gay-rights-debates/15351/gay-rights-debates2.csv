"06-02-2011","15351",2,"gansao","431148","I doubt it. They may say so but would they still be buddies with your son if he declared himself gay and brought his boyfriend out with him? A serious question, not a jibe Jito","snakespit","431355","I actually agree with Jito. My parents are openly anti-homosexual, as are the vast majority of my aunts and uncles. Their children and grandchildren by a vast majority are much more accepting and tollerant of homosexuality. It is the natural trend for society to become more liberal on social issues with each generation. I believe you will see a major sociological shift in opinion on many social issues as the baby boomers die off and the curent young generations age.","gallup-poll-majority-americans-support-gay-marriage","02:20 PM","gay-rights-debates","17"

Its just the same old mantra that unless you embrace homosexuals you must be homophobic and if you are homophobic then you must doubt your own sexuality.Its just guff.","gallup-poll-majority-americans-support-gay-marriage","01:09 PM","gay-rights-debates","21"

For me, unless they are a child molester or rapist, who they are nailing just isn't a factor. I simply fail to see why anyone would limit themselves. I have friends who are gay, lesbain, straight, married, single, black, white, Caribbean, Latino, native American, Indian, Spanish, Canadian, Christian, Atheist, Hindu, Muslim, Agnostic, Jewish, Democrate, Republican, Independent, pacifists, soldiers and they are all pretty damned awesome.","gallup-poll-majority-americans-support-gay-marriage","09:01 AM","gay-rights-debates","22"

Shared interests is the key.For me , having a gay friend would mean nothing. We would probably have plenty in common but having a gay friend when I was 19 to 21 would have been restrictive...we would have less in common. Im sure a young gay man would want to be part of a hetero bunch of friends as much as a hetero young man would want to be a part of a gay bunch of friends. Its not about being self assured . The self assured bit comes I when young hetero men want to harrass or hurt gays . There is a difference and it should be pointed out","gallup-poll-majority-americans-support-gay-marriage","03:12 PM","gay-rights-debates","23"

They are Inuit which is Native American. Of course I don't know someone of every race, religion, ethnicity, culture, etc on the planet. I just don't limit mysel based on those things. And don't give into stereotypes. My friend's very straight husband was a soft spoken hair dresser in his youth. My kids gay dad worked on a ranch, drove an old Mustang, rode horses, liked to fish and got into a pack of trouble.","gallup-poll-majority-americans-support-gay-marriage","04:09 PM","gay-rights-debates","24"

I would not care if my propective gay friend wrestled alligators and drove monster trucks.I wouldnt want to go out with him when he went looking for love and he would be useless to me when I went looking. A very important pastime for young people if I remember correctly. Id go for a ride in the Mustang though, as long as it was a V8 one not a piddly 2.8 straight six","gallup-poll-majority-americans-support-gay-marriage","04:37 PM","gay-rights-debates","25"

Unless you are Inuit yourself the word ""Eskimo"" being all right with you is of no consequnce and you sound like a ethnocentric jack-a$$.","gallup-poll-majority-americans-support-gay-marriage","03:20 PM","gay-rights-debates","26"

"06-12-2011","15351",2,"Sigma","431719","Why is 'Eskimo' offensive? I've never heard that before.","jitobear","432107","I actually do not know why. It is the Inuit themselves who have deemed it so - probably because it is not their name for themselves. In researching it a bit it is primarily in Canada and Greenland where this is the case, not so much in the US (Alaska). In Alaska are two groups that are called ""Eskimo"" the Unuit and the Yupik so that is probably why. In Canada and Greenland it is only the Inuit.","gallup-poll-majority-americans-support-gay-marriage","10:24 AM","gay-rights-debates","28"
