Their children and grandchildren by a vast majority are much more accepting and tollerant of homosexuality. It is the natural trend for society to become more liberal on social issues with each generation.

Im sure a young gay man would want to be part of a hetero bunch of friends as much as a hetero young man would want to be a part of a gay bunch of friends. Its not about being self assured .

It is the Inuit themselves who have deemed it so - probably because it is not their name for themselves. In researching it a bit it is primarily in Canada and Greenland where this is the case, not so much in the US (Alaska). In Alaska are two groups that are called ""Eskimo"" the Unuit and the Yupik so that is probably why. In Canada and Greenland it is only the Inuit.","gallup-poll-majority-americans-support-gay-marriage","10:24 AM","gay-rights-debates","28"
