You probably didn't know because it's not illegal, it's simply not recognized. There is nothing you can do with your partner, nothing you can promise her, nothing you can share that would cause you to break the law where a normal relationship wouldn't. If marriage is between two people, you can get married to whoever you want (provided they consent). You don't need the help of the government or any religion. If marriage is an official contract between two people, you can get married to whoever you want (provided they sign) and the government will enforce that contract to the scope of that contracts authority (two people). These facts in the context beg one question glaringly: What do homosexual advocates want? If it's marriage what is marriage that they do not already have it? What ever the marriage they want is let's call it Marriage C, where marriage A is some private relationship between a finite number of persons (who are married), and marriage B is some contractual relationship between a finite number of persons (who are married). Given the two conditionals the only marriage that homosexuals don't already have is by definition more than a relationship between two people, and more even than an official court-enforced agreement. Thus C is not only A and not only A+B. Since A and B described zero to n married persons as well as government enforcement of their agreements, and C is not less than or equal to that set; C must be greater than that set. i.e marriage C involves more than the married people and more than the government enforcement of contracts. My moral principle is liberty, and to maintain liberty there are a few simple rules. One of them is that everyone who must participate in a interaction has given their consent. In legal terms that means everyone that a contract may constrain (place duties upon, prevent from doing, etc...) must have their signature on the bottom or the contract is void. If you can describe to me what homosexual marriage would be where everyone involved agrees I would have no problem with it, that is not what I hear. When I take the demands of homosexual advocates and subtract what they already have all that's left is essentially tax breaks. Tax breaks are not a shallow goal to pursue, they are most noble; but there is nothing special about homosexuals which are making them endure taxation. At the heart of the issue there is no discrimination, only anti-discrimination. Homosexual advocates are complaining about not being given the same positive discrimination heterosexuals have. The indifference of the government and the general public towards homosexual marriage (A and B) is being demonized as an attack on A and B. A violation of rights. It is violation of rights to tax, but that is not what homosexual advocates are fighting for. If they ever do get it they will be perfectly content to sit back and enjoy the benefit of not being stolen from quite as much as unmarried people. What homosexual advocates want, and I have come to this point with many including Matthew; is government enforced public support and acceptance. Comparing homosexuals to a repressed race that needs guards to keep the angry mob away is a tactic I have seen. I like it when I see that, not because it's true; but because it illuminates the underlying perspective of the person who says it. There are no jim crow laws to strike down, there are no angry mobs. There are just a lot of people who don't think a homosexual relationship warrants their support. The repression exists only in the lack of privilege and that places the advocacy I have been describing clearly in the collectivist sphere of moral theories and answers a question I once had ""Why did the homosexual movement attach itself to the left?"" (no it was not because it was more atheistic.). The law (specifically DOMA) reflects only the truth, that marriage has not included homosexuals before and the law is as the makers intend. If I defined marriage as leaving your door open (don't even talk about whether that is reasonable all that matters is a change from the meaning of the word when it was used in law) that should not mean that all marriage law applies to such a person. My redefinition has not extended to the old definition, it is merely the abuse of language for political ends. Your original question was ""I'm curious to why people aren't ok with the idea of gay marriage."" What you think of my post will depend on what you consider marriage, if you think it's A+B you will go ""Well he's not really against it"". Otherwise you will say I am against it, and thus it is against C that I argued. What I will say is that I am not against it, that marriage a formal agreement between two or more people and if anyone wants to support a certain class of relationship they should state very clearly the criteria required for their support to prevent future tampering based on a single word.
