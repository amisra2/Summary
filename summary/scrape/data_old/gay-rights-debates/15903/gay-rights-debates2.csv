Go back and do some reading, you might learn something. A Gay Couple in Hawaii decided to get Married, they were denied a Marriage license, they filed a Lawsuit and the State Supreme Court granted them the license and said it was unconstitutional to discriminate on the basis that they were gay. In fear that other states would be required to recognize Gay Marriages due to the Full Faith and Credit Clause DOMA was passed, Applying a Definition to Marriage as being between one man and one woman. It also changed the wording of the Fair Faith and Credit Clause relieving the states from having to recognize Gay marriages from other states. DOMA is and always has been Unconstitutional and it's just a matter of time before the Supreme Court hears the case . For someone who claims to be all about Liberty and Freedom you sure have a stick up your XXX about Gay rights.....","gay-marriage-opponents-win-california-high-court-victory","09:08 PM","gay-rights-debates","16"

You've attempted to engage me before so you know full well that if you don't answer that question I will simply ask it again and I will keep asking it until you either shut up or give the answer. You could call it childish but that would make about as much sense as last time given that it was you who was refusing to answer the question and not I who refused to ask it. Second, how is it that a word without an official definition can be used in law? Even so far as to define rules for inheritance and taxation?","gay-marriage-opponents-win-california-high-court-victory","11:45 PM","gay-rights-debates","17"

In the Original Constitution of the United States of America Marriage was never Defined as being between a man and a woman. They applied no definition because they probably didn't think in the 1700's that Marriage needed a definition. They passed DOMA to specifically apply such a definition to discriminate against a group of people. Before DOMA the definition of Marriage would be .... 1 a : being in the state of matrimony 2 : united, joined Nothing about a man and woman , that was added for the purpose to discriminate.","gay-marriage-opponents-win-california-high-court-victory","12:48 AM","gay-rights-debates","18"

In your example you proposed that churches could be forced to only open at one time, you don't have the right to force that as opening a church is not a violation of rights. However it is perfectly justified to force you not to take others money through force or use force to extract submission, respect, recognition etc...","Matthew S","443155","I am legally forced to accept heterosexual marriages all the time.

He is wrong, martyrdom is a state more noble in someone like easyrider who believes that their own destruction is their salvation. I have always had one single objective in the voting booth, choose the candidate or policy which violates the least rights. My conscious is clean when it comes to my existence as a citizen, attempting to guilt me into submission is truly one of the most doomed strategies that could ever be tried for I will not accept responsibility for the actions of others admirable or despicable.

You're all for rights, unless someone Else's rights go against your own personal view. You say Gay people don't have a "" Right"" to be married, but you forget they do have a right to happiness.. which you are perfectly willing to take away from them because of a religious Moral issue. No one is trying to guilt you into submission, it's apparent by your posting that you have no guilt. Where has anyone asked you to take responsibility for the actions of others?.. lay off the drugs dude, that would maybe help with your delusions.... Didn't take too long actually, I have a dictionary on my desk. Hows paying taxes working out for you?.. Funny how the Right is now talking about revenues... just think, in 2013 our taxes will go back up...

According to the Constitution, which we are discussing here, People have the Right to liberty, and the right to choose a life partner whether it be male or female.. Religious Zealots are the ONLY reason gay people are denied this right. You're not doing a very convincing job of it.

From where I'm sitting and the things you post here the only conclusion I could come up with is that you Do. And yet you still pay taxes. Maybe one day you will decide you don't want to pay taxes anymore, or maybe you'll be willing to go to jail to stand up against the mean old Government who steals your money. Or better yet, maybe you'll wake up one day and realize that no one really likes paying taxes, but most of us realize the need for such a thing so rather than complain about it we worry about more important matters. Too bad when the Founders wrote the Constitution they specifically gave Congress the power to lay and collect taxes. Americans are funny creatures, they seem to want things like Police departments, Fire Departments etc. They like driving on paved roads instead of trudging through mud on their way to work. They like having bridges to save time from having to take a fairy to get to the other side. They like healthcare. And most of all they like the Military which defends them from enemies abroad. They also realize that without Taxes none of these things are possible. The Government is not a Charity, and can't rely on donors to fund all the things that Humans want and need. So we pay taxes. I say that's a fair trade for all the things we get for a few pennies on the dollar. Just be glad you don't have tax rates like they did after Korea, when the top tax rate was 90%... now that was just unfair.......","gay-marriage-opponents-win-california-high-court-victory","08:00 PM","gay-rights-debates","29"

Liberty is not violated with respect to marriage or choosing life partners. Maybe you can't be ""saved"" Strawman If I was going to do something stupid to make a statement of my principles it would not be that action which will be least effective while at the same time causing even further violation of my rights. If being thrown in prison for tax violation would help anything I would do it. If being thrown in prison for attacking IRS agents would help anything I would do it. As I see it what you're talking about is equivalent to walking up to the christian inquister and making a riling speech on the propriety of witchcraft, or preaching equality to nazis. These people are brave, but they are also stupid. John Brown or Frederick Douglas? There is a time for both, but now it is time for that later. You are easily fooled. I recognize the same rights in every person, a privilege is a function of the granter and I can only speak to the privileges I would grant. I would not grant any privileges to any marriage. Your conclusions are worthless, your logic is pathetic. I don't want to pay taxes now, I will not decide to get myself imprisoned for no reason.
