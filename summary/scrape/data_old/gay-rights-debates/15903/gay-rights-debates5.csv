Homosexuality is not mentioned in those laws. It never says 'homosexual person', it does not place any special limits or on specifically homosexual people.","Xcaliber","444121","You're just being dense as usual. Couples of the same sex implies Homosexual.. stupid. You should actually be upset at the Government for passing such Laws.. DOMA also doesn't recognize Polygamy .. and some states have barred you from marrying your sister... You should be trying to repeal DOMA....lmao...","gay-marriage-opponents-win-california-high-court-victory","12:07 AM","gay-rights-debates","61"

There were laws that specified law by race for racist laws, by gender for sexist laws, by nationality for xenophobic laws. Yet when we are all told that there are homophobic laws the laws don't mention homosexuals.... mmmm how could this be? Oh right a definition, like say marriage is not a statement of repression. I noticed you completely ignored my point about all the other 'discriminatory' government benefits. I'll bring them up again. Do not tax laws discriminate against rich people? Do not food stamps only go to that privileged class who don't have enough food? Anyone who supports anything but a flat tax has no ground to stand on for demanding equal benefits. Polygamist don't have the right to be recognized, only the right to be left alone.","gay-marriage-opponents-win-california-high-court-victory","01:31 AM","gay-rights-debates","62"

At least in the end part you got it right... One thing that cracks me up about the anti-gay side is that there are a LOT of people out there who will make feeble and menial arguments... But then when it comes to crunch time (like attempting to defend DOMA laws), these comments are nowhere to be seen because the lawyers KNOW this stupid stuff will only get shot down very quickly...","gay-marriage-opponents-win-california-high-court-victory","11:30 AM","gay-rights-debates","65"
