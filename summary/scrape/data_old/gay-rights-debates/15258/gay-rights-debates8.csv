They just had a sperm or a uterus donor/renter. Adoption and marriage would make child support mandatory. Were one to be in a real marriage, wouldn't it help encourage the non-biological parent to adopt the child? Maybe the solution is better laws to protect children. I don't see how throwing out one type of family, because the parents are the same sex, will accomplish this. Do you really think that divorce was a nod to gay rights(in general), hwyangel? I doubt it. Because two things happened in roughly the same time period doesn't necessarily mean one caused the other. That's a logical fallacy. Because a heterosexual married couple was forced to live under the same roof, does not mean it was a functional family.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","12:04 AM","gay-rights-debates","106"
"06-29-2011","15258",8,"hwyangel","433405","Here it is again. How is a same sex marriage going to be ""responsible""? Obviously child support will still be the responsibility of the biological parents. Until the gay movement, divorce was not something looked upon favorably. But for a same sex couple to be a family it requires a child be from a broken home. This is why, until the gay movement, single parents were not considered fit for adoption.","pappillion001","433419","And it makes as little sense as it did the first time The same way opposite sex parents would be. Same sex couples will have kids one of three ways. Adopt, one will already have a child from a prior relationship or artificially/donor/surragate. If their state allows marriage and they are married or if their state allows second parent adoption then the non bio parent adopts and both are legal parents no different than straight people. If their state does not allow these options then only the biological parent is responsible which is the same for straight couples. If the husband is not the father guess what it doesn't matter if they have been married 17 years or 7 months he isn't financially responsible. Unless adoption occurs then both are and that is for same sex and opposite sex couples. It still isn't. It just happens so often that people have become numb to it. The expectation is that a marriage will fail as most do and most people now are either an ex or child of an ex. It isn't gays that have caused greater acceptance of divorce it is straight people who divorce more than marry. After all gays have not been able to marry how can they be at fault for divorce? Talk radio steering you wrong again. Same sex couples can make brand new people same as kind and model as straight people. A child can come from a broken home as is the case for both couples but there is no requirement that the child come from a broken home. But let us say that is true or the majority will come from foster care. For someone who says they want to protect children your desire is to keep them in foster care where statistically they will grow up and fail to successfully integrate into society. Foster cares lengthy record on being just a step above being on the streets is far superior to the research showing gay couples for the most part make at least mediocre if not good parents. Why is that? I see it is gay people (the ones who can't have kids) who have flooded the foster care system necessitating the need to broaden its pool of potential parents to handle the increasing number of kids entering into the program. And foster care is preferred over single parent adoptions because one social worker for every 20 - 100 kids who is overworked and underpaid and has kids of their own to worry about is much better for than a single parent adopting 1 child. Does that about sum up your position or am I not understanding you correctly?","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","03:38 AM","gay-rights-debates","107"

You're highlighting a correlation, but my suspicion is that the causation has more to do with a lack of time from a single parent forced to work all hours to make enough money to support a family, rather than the lack of a particularly gendered parent.

Discrimination of all sorts, is indeed putting labels and stereotypical assumptions on people. However, it's more than that. It's also people being in a position of power to feel justified putting those negative attitudes into action. The power could be in terms of numbers or social position. Gays experienced this during Prop. 8 in California, and in other votes over rights issues. Matt was saying that perhaps one day the tables could turn, and perhaps right-wing Christians, or Mormons, could have their rights voted away by a simple fifty per cent plus one, majority. Matt said he would vote against their rights, as they had used their power against his. Now, we have several people on here, quickly showing their outrage against this potential prospect. Some of them don't bother to lend much, if any support to gay rights in this forum(shooter and proud is the exception). For gays it's not a theory, it's reality. I'd say what Matt has merely proposed when it comes to the rights of others, gives you or them a small inkling of what we feel, when the theory is put into practice, but that may be too generous. So yes, perhaps Matt was just getting you to think and react to show how unjust this notion is when it's your rights up for a vote.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","12:53 AM","gay-rights-debates","116"

If he has just said the first part, I would be cheering him on, but the last part proves that the first part was not an illustration of a morally unacceptable situation but his hope at getting revenge on an abstract collective. If he had left any avenue to interpret his statements as morally sound I would not have condemned them. He however explicitly expressed his desire to violate rights, not merely illustrate that the system allows such violation. As far as I express emotion on this forum, this is nothing new. I do not like the violation of rights and I object to their advocation in all circumstances and from all advocates. If homosexuals are human, I have defended their rights as strenuously as possible. It's reality for us all, except those who are deluded into thinking they chose choicelessness. Perhaps you feel outrage at the subjectivist fallacies that would claim that there is no truth, that the next best thing is the will of the majority. Perhaps you know that there is a moral truth even if you don't know exactly how to describe it, and you know that no matter how many people in the world ignore or deny it; it's there and it validates your actions not by social acceptance but by something more fundamental; something natural to humanity. If that is what you feel, then yes I have felt it; throughout the ages those who have had their rights violated have felt it. It is their value system which produces these emotions, it is recognition of this value system which demands men respect the rights of others. Too many homosexuals desperate for philosophical backing have been drawn to a most despicable current based on non-judgement. It advocates the immunization from the disapproval of others through the suspension of thought (for to think is to judge). This prompts them to ask 'who are you to judge me?' The answer I give is 'a person', but a counter-question cuts deeper into the fallacy. ""Who are you to judge yourself?"" Judgement is not the evil here. Remember that feeling I was just talking about, well there is a philosophy that claims you can know what it's about, where it comes from, claims that not only can you control it but once you understand where emotions come from they are not even forces you need to fight against in a struggle for peace, resolve, or self-control. It claims you can know moral truth not just feel it. That is the philosophical backing homosexuals (as a instance of the category human) need, their emotion is a poor argument, but their is reasoning which can be brought to bear. So do not pretend that the insignificant difference of sexual orientation has somehow magically made you so unique that you now face problems alien the human race that the 'rest of us' need to be made to understand. .... but my rights are up for a vote, and I have been crusading to expose it's injustice.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","01:43 AM","gay-rights-debates","117"

Which I would agree is important, but the information is presented not in a manner that attempts to identify various cause and effect relationships that result in the stats, but to place emphasis on one possible reason which they support. This was one of the more noticable instances of manipulating the facts. The place where your website got it's facts is here Fathers & Families | The Father Factor - Data on the Consequences of Father Absence Which goes under various version of The Fatherhood Initiative. This was part of their report Father Factor in Child Abuse An analysis of child abuse cases in a nationally representative sample of 42 counties found that children from single-parent families are more likely to be victims of physical and sexual abuse than children who live with both biological parents. Compared to their peers living with both parents, children in single parent homes had: a 77% greater risk of being physically abused an 87% greater risk of being harmed by physical neglect a 165% greater risk of experiencing notable physical neglect a 74% greater risk of suffering from emotional neglect an 80% greater risk of suffering serious injury as a result of abuse overall, a 120% greater risk of being endangered by some type of child abuse. Source: Sedlak, Andrea J. and Diane D. Broadhurst. The Third National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect: Final Report. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect. Washington, D.C., September 1996. Things I found most interesting as I read through the information is A) Women are not fit to raise children. From the information provided I don't see how we have achieved the level of civilization we have considering the considerable damage children suffer when left alone with mothers. B) The ability to raise wonder children by men seems to only be possible with their biological children. When rearing someone else's child they have little impact. The only rational conclusion is that the damage a mother causes is immediate and irreversible. C) I noticed two other odd things for the few dozen stats offered almost none came from a source more than once and there were stats with numbers like 165% and 220%. I felt perhaps women were not being fairly represented and maybe the site dedicated to fathers was just expressing themselves passionately, but not accurately. I went to the source they cited for the above stats and it stated the following Family Structure. Children of single parents were at higher risk of physical abuse and of all types of neglect and were overrepresented among seriously injured, moderately injured, and endangered children. Compared with their counterparts living with both parents, children in single-parent families had a 77-percent greater risk of being harmed by physical abuse (using the stringent Harm Standard) and a 63-percent greater risk of experiencing any countable physical abuse (using the Endangerment Standard); an 87-percent greater risk of being harmed by physical neglect and a 165-percent greater risk of experiencing any countable physical neglect; a 74-percent greater risk of being harmed by emotional neglect and a 64-percent greater risk of experiencing any countable emotional neglect; a 220-percent (or more than three times) greater risk of being educationally neglected; an approximately 80-percent greater risk of suffering serious injury or harm from abuse or neglect; an approximately 90-percent greater risk of receiving moderate injury or harm as a result of child maltreatment; and a 120-percent (or more than two times) greater risk of being endangered by some type of child abuse or neglect. Among children in single-parent households, those living with only their fathers were approximately one and two-thirds times more likely to be physically abused than those living with only their mothers. Although parents are not necessarily, nor even most frequently, the perpetrators of maltreatment, the relationship between parent structure and maltreatment incidence is understandable, considering the added responsibilities and stresses of single-parenting together with the likelihood that surrounding social and practical support may be inadequate. Family Size. The incidence of maltreatment was related to the number of dependent children in the family, especially in the categories of physical and educational neglect. For educational neglect, and for physical neglect according to the Harm Standard, the pattern was nonlinear: the incidence rates were highest for children in the largest families (those with four or more children), intermediate for ""only"" children, and lowest for children in families with two to three children. Children in the largest families were almost three times more likely to be educationally neglected, and nearly two and two-fifths times more likely to be physically neglected under the Harm Standard, compared to children in families with two or three children. Under the Endangerment Standard, the pattern was one of increasing incidence of physical neglect with greater numbers of children. Children in the largest families were physically neglected at nearly three times the rate of those who came from ""only"" child families. Additional children in a household mean additional tasks and responsibilities, so it is understandable why incidence rates of child abuse and neglect may be higher when there are more children. Accounting for why ""only"" children have higher rates of educational neglect and of physical neglect under the Harm Standard than children in families with two or three children requires a different explanation. One possibility is that there may be too many expectations focused on ""only"" children, whereas expectations (and disappointments) are diffused over multiple children in the larger families. Another possibility is that many ""only"" child households represent the early stages in their families' development, since a number of these families will have additional children, in time. Thus, many ""only"" children are in families with relatively young and inexperienced parents and caretakers. Executive Summary of the Third National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect As you can see they seemed to have left out some rather important details that were not consistent with their purpose. I would also point out that a lot of your stats include not just fatherless homes, but children of no parent homes as well. Foster care stats are horrible especially when they just turn 18 and are on their own. And lastly what does this have to do with same sex marriage? I mean your sort of putting the cart before the horse. Sure there will be children involved but let's not forget it won't be for a large part of them and for those that do these stats are for straight people.

I think anyone who goes out there on the street, speaking out against any group or political issue, runs the risk of bothering people going about their daily business. They have to be very careful, even for their own safety. For all we know, the ones who complained were not gay. Yes, ""criticizing"" gays as you call it, is anti-gay, when you don't have a logical argument. You're the one playing a false victim. As with the bar situation, and the government-funded adoption agency in Illinois, not being allowed to discriminate, does not make you a victim. The laws are supposed to protect, and apply to everyone equally, yes, including gay people. Laws are sometimes put to the test. In this case of the street preacher, perhaps the police were being too ""heavy handed"", in applying it. I hope they now will recognize everyone has this basic freedom of expression, to attack abstract others, anywhere.
