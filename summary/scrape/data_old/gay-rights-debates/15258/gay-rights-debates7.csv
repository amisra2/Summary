That's even worse, if there was a moral dilemma here the majority decision doesn't magically blanket lines on the map with a different form of human nature. Why?

That's insane, no government is right just because it's a government and that applies to state and federal governments. If you were correct that the rights of homosexuals were being violated a state would have no more right to do it than the federal government. Why is it a state issue? and don't just say 'this I know because the constitution told me so'. They can, and in fact have a duty to define any term that appears in the law. Oh that gave me a good laugh, not that I disbelieve you. If you had been paying attention there is nothing I complain about more than the moral foundation of taxation (or lack there of). You think you can surprise me by finding unjust tax laws? They are all unjust. I knew from the start that this issue really tracked back like most do to the money. Americans are pretty good with civil liberties, but economic ones have been under constant assault, and it's only foolish leftist who came up with two different names, for they are certainly as interconnected with each other as themselves.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","10:42 AM","gay-rights-debates","93"

The powers of Congress are limited to those enumerated in the Constitution; all other powers are reserved to the states and the people. The Federal Government was given it's powers by the States but only Powers to Govern on a National Level. The Federal Government was given the Power to raise Revenues , to pay for National defense, create post offices and roads, as well as to Create Courts . Everything else concerning the Citizens was kept under the States Powers and the Feds did not have the Power to override States. The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the Federal Government from exercising any power not delegated to it by the States in the Constitution. This includes but is not limited to deciding Marriage laws. Most States have their own Constitutions and their own Laws concerning Marriage, it's always been a State issue because each state is responsible only for the citizens within said State and each individual Citizen of the U.S. is protected by the Federal Constitution which is supposed to mean Equal rights for all on the Federal Level. That's not saying that the States who have made Gay Marriage Illegal by Legislation are right.. what I'm saying is that the Feds should not be sticking their 2 cents into State issues . Gay People already had it hard enough trying to fight for equality on a State level but now because of Government Abuse of power they have to fight on a Federal level too. Well this is not about just the taxes. To be honest , If I get you right, you are saying that we should have No taxes whatsoever?.. It's ridiculous to think we could even be a Nation without taxes of some kind. Forming a Society is not a free ride. Without taxes we would not have a Military, hell we wouldn't even have a Government.

How same-sex ""marriage"" affects Massachusetts","pappillion001","433380","Marriage itself does not protect the rights of children. There are separate laws that do that. Financial responsibility is not based on whether the parents were married. An unwed parent is just as liable as a wedded parent. A married parent can just as easily deny paternity as an unwed parent. Your belief that marriage grants children special protections that adopted children will not have is incorrect. What laws are you referring to that are afforded to natural children that are not given to adopted children or vice versa? or are granted to the children or wedded parents and not unwedded? Yes as compared to single parent homes, not same sex homes, either single or two parents. So your basing your statement on evidence that does not account for the circumstances that you say are inferior. Like I said you should visit credible sites to get your information I assume you did not bother to read the facts about this trusting the website would be honest in detailing the events it discusses. I only read two claims it made and found both to be biased and not completely truthful. The part were it said one school teacher would openly discuss the use of sex toys by lesbians failed to mention she was a sex ed teacher and doing so was in a question answer part of the curriculum concerning different types of intercourse. It was implied that this teacher was doing so in the course of teaching Math, English or some other subject where the topic would be out of place for the class. The second was the man who was arrested as the article wants you to believe for trying to discuss the school policy on teaching about same sex families. Mr. Parker had repeatedly been told that the school material in question was not subject to the MA opt-out laws and that the school would not make an exception for his children. Over several months Mr. Parker continued to insist the school comply with his requests finally meeting with school officials, he had drafted an agreement that the school refused to sign. After two hours the school ended the meeting at which time Mr. Parker refused to leave school grounds. At 5:20 police arrived and at 6:00 a lieutenant arrived and all 3 tried to get Mr. Parker to leave voluntarily. He refused stating he was performing an act of civil disobedience in protest of the school policy. He was arrested for trespassing shortly after. That is a bit different than what is implied by strongly insisted on being notified when teachers were discussing homosexuality or transgenderism with his son, the school had him arrested and put in jail overnight.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","03:45 PM","gay-rights-debates","100"

The Fed has passed laws that define its position on marriage, but it isn't saying states have to do so as well. If the Fed was doing that then those states could not pass laws allowing it, They are. I would agree but the states do not have the right to dictate what the Fed will do either. The fed was involved in marriage say for taxes. It was not an issue before because marriage was uniformly a man and woman in every state. When states added a different coupling the Fed had to define what it would recognize also. For the Fed I think it looks also at the economic impact recognition would have on revenue, not that that should be a consideration but somewhere someone said that would cost a lot of money. The primary reasons I would agree are political, conservatives vote more than liberals and that is what counts. Gays have done a good job recently shifting their focus and they are seeing the payoff. Conservatives are trying the same tactics and it is getting old. I think gay marriage will become law across the Union at some point and it is to bad it will be in the future but the when it does it will be a huge XXXX to religion and the country just isn't willing to engage in that just yet.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","05:32 PM","gay-rights-debates","102"
"06-28-2011","15258",7,"hwyangel","433343","Actually, the idea that children deserve to have their rights protected as opposed to the recognition and financial benefits of gay marriage is a personal opinion. Federal motor carrier safety regulations (Not everyone is permitted to drive a rig or carry a CDL) Passports (Not everyone qualifies) Blood donations. (Gay men, interrveinious drug users, and recent tattoos or piercing, are banned ) Hud housing, welfare, social security, unemployment, veterans benifites, student visas, college admissions. (All require special qualifications and benefits society as a whole) Never suggested that. But their in reason why gay men are not allowed to donate blood. As a single mom, having raised two sons(now men), after their fathers death, I can personaly testify that ""most"" women do not shave their face or urinate standing up. LOLLOL Single parent homes have never been promoted in our society. Divorce also was never recognized as a positive thing, and was in fact discouraged , and usually met with child support, alimony, and many other restrictions ment to protect the child. That is untill the gay movement. Yes you can. What other purpose would it have? Real? Marriage is not real without recognition from those who may not agree with you or ""automatic"" financial benefits from the government? Actually, the idea that children deserve to have their rights protected as opposed to the recognition and financial benefits of gay marriage is a personal opinion.","pappillion001","433399","And this has what to do with marriage? Still looking for the marriage connection Marriage connection, no And marriage doesn't happen to be one of those qualifications does it? Now marriage can be a factor on certain SS and VA benefits, but you need not be married to be eligible as a primary recipient for any of the above. My question and the topic concerned marriage. Unless they happen to feed it to the guests at thier wedding as a requirement to have it made official or are raising vampires I don't see why that makes a difference. There is a long list of people blood banks won't take blood from. Being at risk for disease is not a deal breaker for a marriage. As a single guy coming from a single mom who raised two sons none of the women I known did those things either. Having also been married I don't recall either of those questions on my marriage application. I really do not understand this. Gays don't effect any of these things. If a gay couple adopts a child or uses artificial methods to become pregnant and they then divorce guess what one will have primary custody and one will pay support for the child. The courts will decide which one same as with straight couples. Why would it be any different. If a straight couple adopts are you suggesting if they split then there is no custody or support options available? Granting marriage rights would most likely do the opposite of what you are stating. Currently same sex couple living together are not liable to each other for anything. If one was succesfull and the other stayed at home and raised a child either adopted or from another relationship and they split the stay at home one has no right to anything. if they had married and adopted or had their own or adopted the child from another relationship now there is recourse and responsibility. A will does not make someone a relative. The purpose is to direct the courts as to the terms of disolving the decedents estate. Courts generally comply with the wishes of the deceased, but do not have to. There are ways that same sex couple can protect their property and have their wishes executed, but they tend to be costly and have drawbacks that don't always make them desireable. Same sex couples generally can bypass a lot of these issues simply because they are married. Yes that is the point. Gay couples who accept the burdens of marriage would also like to receive the benefits and not suffer additional consequences for playing house. That you can have all day long. I only wish your opinion was based on fact and not other opinions.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","09:28 PM","gay-rights-debates","103"
