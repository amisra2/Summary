"04-16-2011","15258",2,"foundit66","427533","These comments are pointlessly subjective and thoroughly irrelevant. What you consider as ""American culture"" is your own opinion... But more importantly, the constitution does not guarantee a right to some people's stagnant ideals of ""American culture"". It guarantees rights. It guarantees equality. And that's what this is about. And this is part of the alienation I was talking about earlier. A pretense that MY marriage in MY life is somehow some of your business. It ain't. YOUR ""American culture"" can continue to be how you want to observe your life. You have NO right to demand my rights and life be restricted just cause I might impact your ideals on ""American culture""... Gay marriage doesn't harm anybody. There is no ""legitimate state interest"" (mandated by the 14th amendment) to prohibit recognition of our marital rights. Polygamy on the other hand has bona fide victims. Lost boys (Mormon fundamentalism) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","gansao","427535","Then so are your cut and pasted points about gays wanting to participate in American culture rather than destroy it are pointless and irrelevant You cant have it both ways. Rights and equality are not culture. So you have no right to demand the rights of polygamists and incest be restricted..once again you cant have it both ways. It wasnt the polygamy that caused the victims of the Mormons it was many other factors from the fundamentalists. I am sure there are many polygamous families that are quite happy. I also do not propose that only Mormons should be allowed to have polygamous relationships nor should they be only multi wife marriages either. People should be allowed to do what they want within any sexual relationship if we are to change marriage( which gay marriages will do ) not just add on a deviant facimile to hetero marriage and disregard other sexual lifestyles that are equally deserving . If you look for victims in any lifestyle you will find them and God knows homosexuals are good at finding victims","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","12:37 PM","gay-rights-debates","16"

"04-16-2011","15258",2,"foundit66","427543","I'm going to go out on a limb and point out the obvious. I AM NOT CLAIMING that polygamy should be denied based on ""American culture"". I am stating that polygamy has a LEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST prohibiting it (""lost boys"" victims), while gay marriage does not have such a legitimate state interest. Please make a point of understanding that before attempting to reply to me... Please elaborate on this claim...","gansao","427547","You are making a scurrilous claim. There is no legitimate state interest in prohibiting polygamy on the basis of the Mormon faith. As for homosexuals being good at finding victims..look at some of the gay victim posts on this site/gay websites and last but not least the thread I posted about homosexuals being asked to leave a pub because they were kissing and crying homophobia","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","01:44 PM","gay-rights-debates","19"
"06-24-2011","15258",2,"None","None","None","hwyangel","433042","I disagree with both sides. Government recognized marriage has very little resemblance to a Godly union. Especially common law. (Ya'll might want to be careful about same sex room mates. (lol). Though I also disagree that government recognized marriages have anything to do with gender, recreation, religion, status, recognition, or tax breaks. In fact, marriage is not a right at all. It is a responsibility and legally binding document ment to protect childrens rights to a legitimate name, paternity, custody, child support, and inheritance. Things that can not be protected through adoption or power of attorney, as with same sex couples or barren couples. How on earth can anyone think that the government cares who you love or want to spend your life with!? How is this not a religious point of view being forced on those who may believe differently?","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","02:00 PM","gay-rights-debates","21"

How is it fair, just, or ""right"" for the government to spend hundreds of thousands of more dollars of tax payers money for marriage documentation to recognize your personal feelings and views? Or perhaps I am misunderstanding something that you can explain?","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","04:55 AM","gay-rights-debates","22"

How people feel about polygamy has no relevance on same sex couples. Both exist independent of each other. By saying gay marriage is something a person believes in doesn't require that person to also support polygamy, incest or bestiality. How well does your position fare if you argue each one separably? Do you even have an argument without bringing in PIB?","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","09:00 PM","gay-rights-debates","23"
"06-25-2011","15258",2,"None","None","None","hwyangel","433192","Are you suggesting that someone who is bi or or born with both male and female sex organs should be limited to traditional two party marriages? And what is the difference between the argument of ""born homosexual"" that is deserving of special rights and born ""male and female"" that does not? Also, if you can, (no contention intend), can you answer previous question? Why would same sex couples require government documented marriage if not for religious or political reasons?","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","10:43 PM","gay-rights-debates","24"

Gay marriage, Polygamy, incest etc all have their own unique conditions that may be acceptable or not for different reasons. You have that backwards. Currently if you are a man and woman you are special because as a couple you can do something a gay couple can not. Gays want to be able under the same conditions with the same obligations take advantage of those same benefits. The only rational argument (and I use that phrase with a very broad understanding) is the religious which at the end of the day is very weak and the never talked about political one which is the cost to the government if it recognized gay marriage at the Federal level. What special rights do you think gay people want that nobody else has? Because marriage and everything that goes with it comes from the government. Religion is absolutely 100% unnecessary for marriage. Being married in the eyes of God may have value in Heaven (which it actually does not) but here on earth it has 0 value except emotionally. The religious argument is simply God prohibits gay marriage. Without going into the lengthy reasons of the defects in this argument I will leave it with religion has not the right to impose it's concept of permitted behavior onto anyone else. If a person chooses to follow religion then don't get into a gay relationship and then try and marry that person. Religion doesn't get to enjoy the freedom to practice as it sees fit when it includes taking away the freedoms of others Without government recognition there is no survivor rights, there are no property rights, there are no tax benefits, there is no spousal rights to name but a few and where these things can be attempted via contract some can not and others do not carry the same strength legally. Additionally, there can be a significant expenditure of time and money to end up in a weak legal position, things that an opposite sex couple do not generally have to deal with.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","01:28 AM","gay-rights-debates","25"
"06-26-2011","15258",2,"None","None","None","hwyangel","433201","As I said: I do not hold a religious view on government recognized marriage. Common law or living together before marriage is not at all biblical. If the problem then is that a power of attorney or adoption is ""weak"", how would that justify changing a system ment to protect childrens right by weakening it, as opposed to strengthening those rights protected through power of attorney or adoption to benefit everyone? Also, how will common law be effected? If two persons of the same sex for example share a residence, but do not adhere to same sex preferance, will they be considered ""married""? Or will children protected under common law no longer be protected?","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","01:46 AM","gay-rights-debates","26"
"06-26-2011","15258",2,"None","None","None","hwyangel","433203","I may be wrong, but my understanding is that homosexuals people are ""born that way"". What way? To be attracted to the same sex. So isn't safe then to say that someone who is born male and female is obviously born that way? Or someone who is bi? So based on the exact same concept wouldn't it then be unfair or discriminating to limit someone who is born male and female or bi from marrying another male and female? What is the difference?","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","02:10 AM","gay-rights-debates","27"

You are right about tax benefits as married couples who both work actualy pay more taxes than someone who is single. You are also right about spousal rights as unmarried couples are not subjected to allimony.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","02:27 AM","gay-rights-debates","28"
