"06-26-2011","15258",3,"hwyangel","433201","As I said: I do not hold a religious view on government recognized marriage. Common law or living together before marriage is not at all biblical. If the problem then is that a power of attorney or adoption is ""weak"", how would that justify changing a system ment to protect childrens right by weakening it, as opposed to strengthening those rights protected through power of attorney or adoption to benefit everyone? Also, how will common law be effected? If two persons of the same sex for example share a residence, but do not adhere to same sex preferance, will they be considered ""married""? Or will children protected under common law no longer be protected?","pappillion001","433209","The system is not intended for the sole benefit of children. There is no requirement to reproduce, the majority of benefits granted married people have nothing to do with having kids. By allowing gay couples to marry in no way weakens marriage. Laws don't get watered down by adding a group. Look at discrimination laws they retain the same force regardless of how many groups are added. A POA is a fairly useless document for many of the benefits granted to married people. Secondly would you want to carry one around to show people any time it became necessary? Why would people be granted these special privileges for doing nothing more than living together. Common law requires there be an intent to live together as a couple and acting as such. Roommates don't end up in divorce court unless one of them is psycho. What would change that would leave children unprotected? Nothing. Whatever protections are in place now would remain so.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","06:53 AM","gay-rights-debates","31"
"06-26-2011","15258",3,"hwyangel","433203","I may be wrong, but my understanding is that homosexuals people are ""born that way"". What way? To be attracted to the same sex. So isn't safe then to say that someone who is born male and female is obviously born that way? Or someone who is bi? So based on the exact same concept wouldn't it then be unfair or discriminating to limit someone who is born male and female or bi from marrying another male and female? What is the difference?","pappillion001","433212","If I understand you correctly that is the argument. People marry someone for reasons other than reproduction. They marry for all the fluffy feelings stuff that make for great chick flicks. But gays don't get warm and fuzzy with the opposite sex, so in effect current law punishes them if they choose to try and experience the relationship that opposite gender couples are free to have as many times as they want (as long as it is one at a time) Gays just want the same thing nothing more nothing less.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","07:11 AM","gay-rights-debates","32"
"06-26-2011","15258",3,"hwyangel","433204","survivor rights are easily established through a will, (a biological child without paternity established would be screwed).property rights can be established through a will or power of attorney ( a child without married parents would become homeless if daddy kicked him/her out along with mommy). You are right about tax benefits as married couples who both work actualy pay more taxes than someone who is single. You are also right about spousal rights as unmarried couples are not subjected to allimony.","pappillion001","433214","Family has a greater claim and courts have on many occasions disregarded a will that was challenged by a long lost or estranged family member and the surviving partner loses the person and half of their stuff. Those rights are easily established for family members which doesn't include your same sex partner. Again your making it all about kids and especially for gay couples that is not the primary concern. Even for straight couples it is a secondary concern until they actually have them and even then it sometimes remains so. As a recognized next of kin you don't need a will, the spouse or kids have rights and claims that are automatic Again a will is easily challenged potentially tying up assets for years which the surviving person may have paid for completely or in part. A POA allows someone to act on behalf of another when the person becomes incapacitated or dies I don't think the POA continues as the executor of that persons estate takes over whether it be someone named specifically or the courts. But mommy can turn around and seek immediate relief from and have recourse to attach daddy's wages and make daddy sell the house if he doesn't want her to live there. The courts and laws are already set up and ready to go, no such luck for same sex couples.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","07:26 AM","gay-rights-debates","33"
"06-26-2011","15258",3,"hwyangel","433205","Now a child through adoption already has a secure home and income established before the adoption can take place. A child birthed is cared for through child support should they be abandoned by a parent, after paternity is established.","pappillion001","433215","There are no guarantees that will remain so, but I don't follow how this is relevant.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","07:28 AM","gay-rights-debates","34"
"06-26-2011","15258",3,"hwyangel","433206","Marriage also protects children through marriage regarding custody. A biological relitive is able take cusody of a child should something happens to the parents, protecting them from the foster care system.","pappillion001","433217","Nothing would change, the same way custody is decided currently for adopted children would be the method used to determine for a same sex couple, but this doesn't have a lot of bearing on whether gays should be able to marry or not.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","07:30 AM","gay-rights-debates","35"

Gay marriage violates all of thease rights by redefining marriage for there own political/religious views.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","07:39 AM","gay-rights-debates","36"

"06-26-2011","15258",3,"gansao","427158","How long beore gays say it is their RIGHT to marry in church and that to prohibit this is homophobia? They will say that the church would not bar black people so why ban gays. They will say that any kind of discrimination towards gays in any way is wrong. Matthew S on this forum says so....... A preacher in the UK was arrested for telling a passing shopper that homosexuality was wrong..do you honestly think that gays will accepted being forbidden to marry in church. The man is a naive fool","Matthew S","433229","I have never taken that stance. If some christianist wants to not let gay people to attend their church then I support their right to exclude. What I am opposed to is the christianists bringing their religious beliefs out and putting them in the laws that I have to live under. If they what to exclude me from public accommodations because of their religious beliefs then I feel gay people should have an equal right to exclude them from gay owned public accommodations.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","09:09 AM","gay-rights-debates","38"

You have never argued that the the solution to homophobia is to allow gays to discriminate against gays. To have always stated that the law should make any discrimination against gays illegal. If you are saying that you believe that a church should be able to throw a gay man out of its congregation if a gay church can throw a straight man out..and this should be provided by law then I do not believe you.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","09:43 AM","gay-rights-debates","41"

Marriage is not necessary to establish financial responsibility of a parent Marriage is not necessary to to the establishment of a secure home Do you see a trend in my responses? Your premise are wrong and your conclusion is wrong. I am now very curious exactly what makes you think any of what you have stated is true and how allowing gays to marry would in fact achieve these things? I have no problem with you disagreeing with my opinion but along with the statement a reason would be nice. Marriage is not just to protect the rights of children, honestly it does very little in this area. By ignoring the primary reasons that marriage exists and is recognized by government you miss the point why gays want equality. Gay marriage does not violate anything you have stated Gay marriage is not about religious ideals. The effort to oppose it is about religious ideals. I don't feel my right to marry a woman is politically motivated and can't really understand what political agenda might be desired that includes the establishment of gay marriage. I think you listen to far to much talk radio because all I am hearing is the same BS that they spit out all day. There is no rational or logical way to arrive at your conclusions","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","11:18 AM","gay-rights-debates","42"

If a christian couple owns a public accommodation, such as a B&B or a restaurant etc that they operate to the general public. Then they can not use religion as an excuse to deny service to gay people, or fire employees because that person is gay. What I am saying is that if you give or allow that christian couple to deny service to gay people, or fire employees that are gay on religious grounds then I, as gay man, want an equal exemption to deny service to anti gay Christians and fire anti gay christian employees.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","12:45 PM","gay-rights-debates","44"

I believe that if gays admitted this openly the churches would go onto a war footing against them because that is what they fear the most..having to actually change their doctrine because it would be ruled homophobic, I can imagine you telling us in a the future that no church would be able to eject a black man so why should it be allowed to eject a gay man? Worse, I am pretty sure that gay rights zealots like you would like to see the day when the church can be prosecuted for spreading ' homophobic, propaganda .So if you dont mind I wouldnt trust you as far as I could throw you on this one Matthew","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","01:19 PM","gay-rights-debates","45"
