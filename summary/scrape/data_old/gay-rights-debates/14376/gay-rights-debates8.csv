Plenty of women have gotten pregnant during one-night stands, sometimes without ever knowing the name of the man involved. Do they qualify as a ""couple?"" You don't even need a man and a woman having sex for procreation to take place. You need only an egg and a sperm. You insist that there is a significant distinction between same-sex couple relationships, which are a social arrangement, and all opposite-sex relationships, whether the opposite-sex couples can or do reproduce biologically or not. Why is this? Why is this distinction, based on the sex of the partners, so fundamental and critical to you? Legal marriage does support the raising of children, and this is an important function of legal marriage .... Why it is then defensible to argue that a same-sex couple with adopted children should not be permitted to marry simply because they cannot reproduce biologically? You are using a double-standard that is unfair not only to couples, but to their children, who end up losing the protection of having two married parents simply because other people don't like the sex of the two parents.","jyoshu","408087","Now there's an example of 'word games.' These are all just work-arounds to get around normal procreation that takes place between a man and a woman. Sperm and eggs come from males and females. Your examples are still opposite -gender, they just try to engage in reproduction in a way that avoids intercourse. I think what you're pointing out is fundamental to the whole debate in society. For some of us--many of us--gender DOES matter, and I'd rather call things what they really are than present exceptions as if they are equal to the rule, or work-arounds as if they are the same as what is being worked around. Homosexual pairing is very much the exception in human culture, not the norm. It is a sexual practice that has to always attempt to elevate work-arounds--even in terms of anatomy and procreation. IMO, to argue as if they are the same is a fundamentally dishonest way of approaching things. Call things what they really are, and let the chips fall where they may. This is why I support spinning couples' benefits off from the concept of marriage, altogether. The concept of marriage benefits or legal marriage is fraught with problems because any group can come along and cry foul that their particular way of doing things doesn't qualify. There are always going to be exceptions out there and we should set up a form of civil unions that will give the benefits adoptive couples/groups/individuals/etc. need that would put them on par with married couples benefits-wise.","gay-marriage","12:25 PM","gay-rights-debates","106"

Of course biological reproduction involves a sperm and an egg, and most of the time, this involves a man and a woman engaging in sexual intercourse. But the creation of an ongoing couple relationship is a social arrangement, not a biological one. Not all cultures throughout time and around the world surround reproduction with monogamous heterosexual marital relationships. Polygamous relationships have been common in world history, whether we like them or not. To equate our current predominant form of social arrangement surrounding reproduction (monogamous heterosexual marriage) with nature or with biology is to confound biology with social arrangements. The biology of reproduction has stayed mostly the same over time and across cultures. The social arrangements surrounding reproduction have been diverse and have changed over time. You say that for you, ""gender does matter,"" and because it matters to you, you think same-sex marriages should be placed into a separate category from opposite-sex marriages, whether reproductive or not. I do not see this as a legitimate reason for creating a separate category of legal relationship just for same-sex couples. So what if gender matters to you? You are free to choose to marry someone of the opposite sex and not to marry someone of the same sex. This is true of everyone. No one is forcing anyone to marry someone of the same sex just because same-sex couples have the right to marry legally. There is no good reason for creating a separate legal institution specifically for same-sex couples, especially since the legal institution of marriage that we currently have would serve the needs of same-sex couples and their children just as effectively as it serves the needs of opposite-sex couples and their children. Creating a separate legal category that is identical to legal marriage in effect and differs from it in name only makes no rational sense, except perhaps as a step toward moving to include same-sex couples within marriage. Creating this separate legal category simply because you think ""gender does matter"" makes absolutely no sense. That's just separating people legally because of some people's beliefs or attitudes about other people.","gay-marriage","12:53 PM","gay-rights-debates","108"

"07-22-2010","14376",8,"jyoshu","408089","I am sorry to hear about your uncle passing away. I would say your uncle's position is pretty much like most conservative Christians'. Most who are publicly vocal about it are just trying to defend their position, IMO. I don't think one can really go on the fact that some fundamentalists like EZ debate this issue on discussion boards--we have to remember that some people simply enjoy debate. You say you do not care what people think about sin, but there are obviously issues you DO care about. One is the issue of homosexuality, clearly. So I think it is safe to say you do care about about what people think about that . You say your religious beliefs are your business, but you make it your business to debate people when they take a different position than you on homosexuality-related issues. I don't see why it's not the same thing. Could you really ever be convinced that gay marriage should not be legalized? I think you are just as un-convinceable on this issue as EZ is on whatever issues he himself has dug his heels in over.","Ohioprof","408093","I debate people on homosexuality-related issues for two reasons: because I want to support equal treatment under the law and because debate is interesting. I believe that gay people and bisexuals should have the same rights under the law as heterosexuals. I honestly do not care if EZRider thinks homosexuality is an ""abomination"" except to the extent that his view may prompt him to work against equal treatment under the law for gay people. If he does not organize to prevent equal marriage rights, then I don't care what his religious views are concerning gay people. I cannot possible convert everyone to agree with me, and I don't care to try. Sometimes I debate and discuss issues with people just because it's interesting, and I learn about different viewpoints from these debates. This has been especially true in the debates I have engaged in over constitutional issues like the meaning of the 14th amendment. I learn by debating others who understand the topic and who disagree with me. I don't actually think I will change anyone else's opinion, but I develop a better understanding of their views and a better understanding of my own views by debating them. I am not debating with you to try to change your views. I am debating with you to engage in an airing of different viewpoints, to hear the different arguments, because it's interesting and educational to do so. If I were to hear a good, reasoned argument for not including same-sex couples in legal marriage, I would think about it and I might agree with it. So far I have not heard a good, reasoned argument for not including same-sex couples in legal marriage. The arguments against legal same-sex marriage all seem to boil down to the fact that some people are uncomfortable with the idea, because it's not what they are used to or what they have grown up to believe in or because it's not what their church teaches or because it seems new. These are not legitimate reasons, in my view, for not including same-sex couples within the institution of legal marriage.","gay-marriage","01:10 PM","gay-rights-debates","110"

I think there are merits to saying that society should better value a type of relationship that expands society in numbers. That's part of the reason marriage has been given benefits to begin with. Obviously, a man with a man can't procreate and therefore expand society. You are correct that there are infertile couples as well, but the gender is a VERY obvious place to draw the line because NO same-sex couple can ever contribute to society by procreating as it's impossible. Obviously it matters to huge amounts of society, not just me. But taking the 'just-don't-do-it' as an alternative to wanting to see society changed in the way I think is best is an unrealistic thing to ask of anyone. One could tell someone that on any number of issues. I think society is better served by the positions I and many others take, so no, I don't think it's enough to just avoid marrying same-sex. That's like telling someone they shouldn't oppose stealing in society, and should instead just avoid stealing themselves. For the record, I am not saying we should create a separate legal institution just for same-sex couples. Rather I am saying we should spin benefits off for ANYONE and stop tying benefits to marriage altogether. Only because there is always the possibility for any group to come along and make an issue that they don't qualify. It's the only long-term solution to avoid these problems.

I have changed my thinking to some extent as a result of my discussions with Steeeve and Phyllis about the constitution and specifically the 9th and 14th amendments. These discussions have been very illuminating, and I have learned a lot from both of them. My changes in thinking have been incremental; I have not suddenly thrown out my understanding of the constitution or these amendments. I have expanded how I think about the various perspectives on constitutional interpretation and the 9th and 14th amendments.","gay-marriage","01:16 PM","gay-rights-debates","112"

Let me just make one point about the ""just don't do it"" argument. I personally do not like the 2nd amendment, and I wish this amendment were not in the constitution. I do not like the idea that people can carry guns around, and I would never own a gun or shoot one. However, the 2nd amendment is in the constitution, and given that, I think the Supreme Court did rule correctly to incorporate the 2nd amendment and apply it to the states. (This is a 14th amendment interpretation question.) Now that the Supreme Court has ruled, I accept that gun ownership is an individual right. I may not like it, but I accept it, and I am not going to work to try to pass laws to restrict gun ownership. I don't own a gun, and I won't shoot a gun. I am taking the ""just don't do it"" position on this. I am not owning a gun. I am also not trying to prevent anyone else from owning a gun, even though I personally don't like the idea of people carrying guns around. It is possible to take the ""just don't do it"" position, and this is an example of it. I can live with people disagreeing with me about guns, and I can live with people having a right to bear arms. I know that many people see this right as very important, and I accept that, even though I don't value this right or wish to exercise it. But I accept that the right matters to other people, and I therefore accept and will live with their right to own guns.","gay-marriage","01:24 PM","gay-rights-debates","113"

Do you not think it is absolute truth that the DoI ascribes freedom for people? Do you not think it is absolute truth that gay people should be viewed as equal to straight people? I think you are avoiding admitting that you DO hold to some things you consider absolute truth because you don't want to think of yourself as dogmatic or religious-like in terms of ideology. It's all in how we view issues. There are definitely matters of truth that we all hold to, and that's why we take positions. They tend to be areas we champion and emphasize. For example, the NAACP emphasizes racial equality. That we should have racial equality is something they consider as truth. That doesn't mean that people who don't emphasize that in particular would disagree, it just means they think there is a greater need in society to emphasize other things. When religious conservatives emphasize morality, that doesn't mean they oppose equality so much as they think morality is more important. For them it's not an equality-based issue so much, to begin with. But for the NAACP, the issue that blacks should be equal with white people is non-negotiable. They aren't going to be convinced otherwise. We accept that, because generally speaking society supports that view.

People argue their points because they believe they are right on a given issue. The gay pride movement has come out strongly opposing things like the ex-gay movement, for instance. If they were taking such a live-and-let-live approach, as you seem to be implying, they wouldn't care if people want to live an 'ex-gay' sort of way of living. I don't think the gay pride movement is just benignly asking for respect. Unless you're referring to my-way-or-the-highway kind of respect. From what I've seen, there's a terrible lack of tolerance out there on the part of the movement for any view of homosexuality other than complete and total moralistic acceptance.","Bennedict","408100","sorry for bringing up such an old post, i step out of the door for 5 minutes and there are 20 posts to read!!!! you see, gay people should be ticked off at the gay converters; they are exactly the people i was talking about, who say 'your lifestyle is not the same as my lifestyle - change now'. in exactly the same way you would be ticked off if someone were converting straight people to gay - even the live-and-let-live believers would be ticked off at that - i would be, and i am because people are converting gays to straight. and the gay pride movement IS asking for respect. thats what they are doing with their parades and all that. if they stay closeted and dont stand up for themselves, everyone would just look down on them. instead they get out there, argue their standpoint and let people know that 'gay is ok'.","gay-marriage","02:09 PM","gay-rights-debates","115"

That is simply what it says. What liberty as an unalienable right means is a matter of interpretation and some disagreement. The meaning of the assertions in the Declaration has long been debated and contested. Further, not all Americans have always agreed with the principles expressed in the Declaration of Independence. Pro-slavery advocates did not see liberty as an unalienable right that extended to their slaves. Even Thomas Jefferson himself, while opposing slavery as contrary to his Declaration, never freed most of his own slaves. It is true that most people probably have convictions that they hold very deeply. I certainly do. However, that does not mean that what I believe is the absolute truth. As you suggest in your post, people nowadays mostly accept the view that blacks should be treated as the equals of whites. I believe this passionately. But is this the absolute truth? Or is it a conviction that we hold? I think it is the latter. It is an important conviction, but that does not make it the absolute truth. I do not think there are absolute moral truths. Our moral beliefs are always our beliefs. That doesn't mean that our beliefs don't matter or that we don't hold our convictions dear to us. Our moral beliefs are of great importance to us. But I think we must always reconsider what we believe and why we believe it in the various life contexts we encounter. I think your point that religious conservatives (at least some of them) view morality as more important than equality is interesting and probably true. I suspect that those of us who are religious liberals (I am one) view equality as an essential part of morality. Inequality is among the worst forms of immorality, at least in my view.
