"06-25-2010","14376",1,"None","None","None","Dr Ovid","405512","Since we decided to allow men to legally screw, we should not discriminate against them. On the other hand, I am a bit libertarian, and I rarely think that we should punish people who discriminate. Thus, if a small business fires you over your sexual orientation, that could be tragic, but probably should not be a crime. One possible solution is to have government contracts have morality clauses. That is, you can bid on something only if you agree to hold yourself to a higher standard, such as not discriminating. As for marriage, I am personally uninterested in any gay marriage agendas. I do think that any two adults should be able to make inheritance arrangements (""If I die, Bill gets it all...""). I do think that people should be able to make power of attorney type arrangements. Arguably, a compromise might be for people to do contracts (call them ""marriage"" contracts if you wish, there will be a blank space on the form for you to title the contract) where they opt for one or more of these things. Such a change is already happening or being discussed with respect to ordinary heterosexual marriage. With every jurisdiction having different laws, why not let individuals choose the laws that will apply to their relationship, and why not let them call it what they will? So, I suppose, I really do favor gay marriage, for I favor the right to contract, and by contract is how it could be done, sensibly. And, as for all the benefits that heteros get, who knows if they should be getting them in the first place? If an employer wants to favor only heteros, as a libertarian type I would not be concerned. But if I was concerned, I would, perhaps, try to reason with them or create bad publicity for them. I have shared my opinion today due to the urging of a friend who writes on this board. Enjoy!","gay-marriage","07:22 PM","gay-rights-debates","1"

While we don't honor our elders or their words nearly as much as some other nations might, neither do we completely disregard history and the customs that we have made a part of our lives. While removing national holidays from the calendars may improve productivity, they are traditions that we are not really willing to give up (though the time off of work may be a big reason too). In short, I think your solution is unworkable in our society.","gay-marriage","07:52 PM","gay-rights-debates","2"

Most property related transactions these days are contractual already and from as low as @ 100.00 you can have just about any contract complete. The stigma associated with homosexuals is a different story that can be a large problem but can be worked around.","gay-marriage","08:45 PM","gay-rights-debates","12"
