Marriage can only be between a man and a woman, as a symbol of love and possibly a means for the creation of a family. Unfortunately for homosexuals, there cannot be love between them. Homosexuality, in the majority of the cases, is a psychological disorder that arises at an early age for a lot of kids, and if not dealt with during adolescence, can lead to being gay. A lot of male kids are more ""effeminate"" when they're young, but when adolescence starts, thanks to the society which is against homosexuals, learn to be more manly, and lose any doubts about their sexuality. Unfortunately, today's society is becoming more and more open to it, causing homosexuality to spread.

With women, it may be different. Because women are always a lot closer to each other than man.

Marriage is just a legal procedure which allows the authorities to keep track of relationships. It is not a religious thing (thought the church has tried to make it such). It also has little to do with procreation, as you don't need a licence to do the wild thing. See above. Do you have any evidence that homosexuality is just a disorder? Also, have you seen the number of hetrosexual men who appear effeminate (or butch lesbians), or homosexual men who appear 'normal'? You can't tell someone's sexual preference just by their mannerisms. So, now love is just a psychological disorder. Perhaps you are right. If you think you love someone, doesn't that mean you love someone? If I think I love chocolate, could I be wrong and actually hate the stuff? Now we are getting into the 'ick factor'. Just because men don't have the touchy-feely thing going for them, doesn't mean much at all. Again, you can't tell just from mannerisms - or what makes you go eeeeeerrrrrr . It sounds like you just get off on seeing two women together (nothing wrong with that), but two men together makes you go eeeeeerrrrrr . So there are real homosexuals out there. Nice to know. But you feel you can discriminate against the 'real' homosexuals, just to stop others from pretending to be homosexual. Isn't that a bit like locking up all those of Japanese descent because other Japs did something nasty. Hang on, already done that. Or bombing a muslim country because a few muslims crashed a plane. Er, still doing that. Perhaps we should lock up all Americans because of that business at Waco. Or all Brits because of he trouble they have a football matches. Or Canadians because of Ben Johnson. You see where I'm going? We can't make rules to discriminate against one bunch of people (innocent people) just because another bunch of people who maybe look a bit like them might be doing something wrong (and remember that the other bunch in question aren't actually doing anything wrong in this case). No it doesn't. No link there either. Male homosexuals like men, not boys and girls. Lesbians likewise. So what? So what? You'll be banning drag acts next. Lock up everyone who wears a turban. Or maybe a slightly off-white complexion might be enough. Yea, better off being unloved that being loved by someone who makes you go eeeeeerrrrrr . You can't treat it.

You don't even need a man and a woman having sex for procreation to take place. You need only an egg and a sperm.

Monogamous hetereosexual marriage is not and has never been the only social arrangement surrounding reproduction.

Why is this? Why is this distinction, based on the sex of the partners, so fundamental and critical to you? Legal marriage does support the raising of children, and this is an important function of legal marriage. Same-sex couples do raise children together, just as opposite-sex couples do. It makes sense that same-sex couples should be able to protect their children just as opposite-sex couples can. This is to the benefit of the children.

He was a deeply religious Christian, a man who embraced a pretty conservative faith. He told me years ago that he believed homosexuality is a sin, but he said that it was not for him to judge others. He said that was up to God, not him. He said that he always treated gay people with respect and without condemnation or judgment. Having known my uncle for many years, I can attest that this was true of him. I never experienced him treating gay people with anything but respect and care, just as he treated everyone else. Did my uncle try to convert me to believe that same-sex relationships are sin? No. Did I try to convert my uncle to believe that same-sex relationships are not sin? No. We accepted each other as we were. I tell this story to illustrate a point. I honestly do not care what other people think about sin. Their religious beliefs are their business, just as my religious beliefs are my business. I do care what other people do in society when it affects other people. I want to stop people from passing laws that discriminate against gay people. I want to ensure that gay people, and all people, are treated as equals under the law. That is my concern. I do not share many of the religious beliefs of my uncle, and it was never my concern or goal to get him to believe as I did.

Of course biological reproduction involves a sperm and an egg, and most of the time, this involves a man and a woman engaging in sexual intercourse. But the creation of an ongoing couple relationship is a social arrangement, not a biological one. Not all cultures throughout time and around the world surround reproduction with monogamous heterosexual marital relationships. Polygamous relationships have been common in world history, whether we like them or not. To equate our current predominant form of social arrangement surrounding reproduction (monogamous heterosexual marriage) with nature or with biology is to confound biology with social arrangements. The biology of reproduction has stayed mostly the same over time and across cultures. The social arrangements surrounding reproduction have been diverse and have changed over time. You say that for you, ""gender does matter,"" and because it matters to you, you think same-sex marriages should be placed into a separate category from opposite-sex marriages, whether reproductive or not. I do not see this as a legitimate reason for creating a separate category of legal relationship just for same-sex couples. So what if gender matters to you?

I do not like the idea that people can carry guns around, and I would never own a gun or shoot one. However, the 2nd amendment is in the constitution, and given that, I think the Supreme Court did rule correctly to incorporate the 2nd amendment and apply it to the states.

I am also not trying to prevent anyone else from owning a gun, even though I personally don't like the idea of people carrying guns around.

It's all in how we view issues. There are definitely matters of truth that we all hold to, and that's why we take positions. They tend to be areas we champion and emphasize. For example, the NAACP emphasizes racial equality. That we should have racial equality is something they consider as truth. That doesn't mean that people who don't emphasize that in particular would disagree, it just means they think there is a greater need in society to emphasize other things. When religious conservatives emphasize morality, that doesn't mean they oppose equality so much as they think morality is more important. For them it's not an equality-based issue so much, to begin with. But for the NAACP, the issue that blacks should be equal with white people is non-negotiable.

Do you not think it is absolute truth that gay people should be viewed as equal to straight people? I think you are avoiding admitting that you DO hold to some things you consider absolute truth because you don't want to think of yourself as dogmatic or religious-like in terms of ideology. It's all in how we view issues. There are definitely matters of truth that we all hold to, and that's why we take positions. They tend to be areas we champion and emphasize. For example, the NAACP emphasizes racial equality. That we should have racial equality is something they consider as truth. That doesn't mean that people who don't emphasize that in particular would disagree, it just means they think there is a greater need in society to emphasize other things. When religious conservatives emphasize morality, that doesn't mean they oppose equality so much as they think morality is more important. For them it's not an equality-based issue so much, to begin with. But for the NAACP, the issue that blacks should be equal with white people is non-negotiable. They aren't going to be convinced otherwise. We accept that, because generally speaking society supports that view. But it's still an example of someone holding to what they consider an absolute truth.","Ohioprof","408131","The Declaration of Independence does say that all men have unalienable rights, and one of them is ""liberty."" That is simply what it says. What liberty as an unalienable right means is a matter of interpretation and some disagreement. The meaning of the assertions in the Declaration has long been debated and contested. Further, not all Americans have always agreed with the principles expressed in the Declaration of Independence. Pro-slavery advocates did not see liberty as an unalienable right that extended to their slaves. Even Thomas Jefferson himself, while opposing slavery as contrary to his Declaration, never freed most of his own slaves. It is true that most people probably have convictions that they hold very deeply. I certainly do. However, that does not mean that what I believe is the absolute truth. As you suggest in your post, people nowadays mostly accept the view that blacks should be treated as the equals of whites. I believe this passionately. But is this the absolute truth? Or is it a conviction that we hold? I think it is the latter. It is an important conviction, but that does not make it the absolute truth. I do not think there are absolute moral truths. Our moral beliefs are always our beliefs. That doesn't mean that our beliefs don't matter or that we don't hold our convictions dear to us. Our moral beliefs are of great importance to us. But I think we must always reconsider what we believe and why we believe it in the various life contexts we encounter. I think your point that religious conservatives (at least some of them) view morality as more important than equality is interesting and probably true. I suspect that those of us who are religious liberals (I am one) view equality as an essential part of morality. Inequality is among the worst forms of immorality, at least in my view.

I don't know why this keeps happening. Jyoshu, I stand corrected on your argument about marriage as an institution. I misunderstood your argument to be that we should have a separate category of legal civil unions for gay people. I think it would be very difficult to eliminate all benefits associated with legal marriage at this point. Perhaps it would be possible; we could, for example, say that a person can leave Social Security survivors' benefits to one survivor, whether this is their legal spouse or not. Disassociating all benefits from marriage would mean revising many laws and policies, and I doubt most people would go along with this plan. It would be far easier simply to include same-sex couples within the institution of legal marriage. On the question of ""just don't do it,"" I have addressed this earlier by pointing out that I do not agree with gun ownership and think the second amendment is a bad thing, but I accept that people have the right to own guns and will own guns, and I simply choose not to own or shoot guns myself. This is an example of ""just don't do it."" Laws against stealing are different from marriage laws in that stealing directly harms other people and thus harms the society. Stealing therefore should be against the law, in my view. Marrying someone does not harm other people, even though some may disagree with a particular kind of marriage. There is no rational basis for making same-sex marriage against the law; the only reason people oppose legal same-sex marriage is because they don't like it or because their religion doesn't accept it. These are not rational bases, not justifications for making a particular kind of marriage against the law, especially since such laws discriminate against a class of people and deny them a fundamental right. Your argument that ""no"" same-sex couple can ever contribute to society by procreating ignores the fact that gay individuals can and do procreate, and same-sex couples do contribute to society by raising children together. If a purpose of marriage is to foster the rearing of children in stable families, and same-sex couples do create families with children, then it clearly harms children and the society to deny children with same-sex parents the protections and stability of having legally married parents. We do not prohibit opposite-sex couples who are raising adopted children or children from previous unions the right to marry. We encourage them to marry in part to provide stability to the children they are raising, no matter whether these children are their biological offspring. We should grant same-sex couples the legal right to marry in part for the same reasons: to provide stability to the children they are raising. Why should we deny this security to children who happen to have same-sex parents? To argue that we should give special encouragement to marriage relationships that ""expand society in numbers"" does not make sense today, as we have plenty of numbers already, and there is no need to promote an expansion of our human numbers. People don't need to marry to reproduce anyway. The purpose of legal marriage should not be to promote more biological reproduction, in my view. I think that we should encourage marriage in part to promote long-term stability in families for the benefit of children. Since same-sex couples have and raise children together, the children of same-sex couples should have the same right to the protections of legally married parents that the children of opposite-sex couples have. Long-term stable families help children to grow up with love and security, and this helps to produce better-adjusted adults. Promoting marriage for all families with children thus serves society not by encouraging the expansion of numbers, but by helping to produce healthier and better-adjusted children and eventually adults.","gay-marriage","09:16 PM","gay-rights-debates","121"

What does this do to all the children who have same-sex parents? It leaves them out because you think we might as well draw the line to exclude them. You sound so ho hum about this, like it's no big deal that children of same-sex couples are being disadvantaged in this way. To me it is a big deal, because these are real children who are losing out. The ""marriage-benefit gravy train"" as you phrase it exists for good reasons, not just to provide extra benefits to some people and not others. The benefits of legal marriage are aimed at supporting family stability and protecting children and spouses who may be home raising children. (Now I am sounding like more of a supporter of marriage than you are, though I am sure that is not actually true. I know you support marriage.) Of course, the ideal solution that you have envisioned and proposed would not leave out children of same-sex couples, because it would disconnect marriage from benefits entirely. And it's true that if we had universal health insurance not provided through employers, children and spouses would not depend on one spouse's family health insurance benefits. If people could leave Social Security survivors' benefits to one adult of their choice as well as to their children, rather than only married people being able to leave benefits to spouses, this would get around the problem of same-sex spouses not being eligible for survivors' benefits. However, the goal of disconnecting benefits from marriage entirely does not seem politically feasible to me, despite how attractive it sounds in theory. You write this: ""Raising children is not a good enough reason to open marriage up to any given group that comes along wanting those benefits because anyone of any relationship arrangement imaginable could conceivably be raising a child."" What ""relationship arrangement imaginable"" are you imagining here? Two people who are raising a child together already CAN get married to each other, unless they are already close biological family or unless they are of the same sex in most states or unless they are legally married to someone else. Otherwise, two people raising children together can marry each other. I don't know what ""given group"" you think will suddenly demand the right to marry that doesn't already have the right to marry, except for gay people. (I do see some first cousins seeking the right to marry, from which they are barred in some states but not others. I personally see no good reason why states should bar first cousins from marrying each other, but that is a debate for another thread.) You seem to be worried about a slippery slope that doesn't exist, about all kinds of weird groups of people wanting to marry each other because they are raising children together. But people raising children together already have the right to marry each other legally if they are not closely related biologically, if they are not already married to someone else, and if they are not of the same sex in most states. There is no slippery slope where all kinds of weird people will marry each other, because weird people already have the right to marry each other. Even criminals on death row can marry. The group of couples that is mostly excluded is same-sex couples, for no legitimate reason. I think that protecting and providing for children IS a major reason why people get married legally, and it is a good reason for doing so. Many senior citizens, who are not going to have more children, choose not to marry each other legally and simply live as unmarried couples. They have no good reason to marry legally once they do not plan to raise children together, and some of them already receive Social Security survivors' benefits from previous spouses. You write this: ""Again, you're splitting hairs here and playing word games--quite simply, a gay couple can never reproduce with each other. It's as simple as that."" My answer to this is, ""So what?"" An infertile couple can never reproduce with each other either, and you do not want to exclude them from the right to marry. You are the one splitting hairs, by trying to find a rationale for excluding from marriage only same-sex couples. You would exclude same-sex couples from marrying because of their infertility, but you would not exclude other infertile couples from legal marriage. Our current marriage laws do not require that people be able to reproduce biologically with each other in order to marry. This is as it should be. Marriage should not be denied to people simply because they cannot reproduce biologically with each other. Same-sex couples are no different from any other couple in their love, in their commitment, and in their ability and choice to raise children together. Same-sex couples should have the equal right to marry legally because it benefits society to support stable families, and it especially benefits children to live in stable families with two married parents. Since same-sex couples are raising children, the children in these families deserve the right to have two parents who are legally married to each other. Beyond this, marriage is a fundamental right, and states need to have a compelling state interest in denying couples the right to marry each other. States have demonstrated no compelling interest in preventing same-sex couples from marrying legally.","gay-marriage","01:30 PM","gay-rights-debates","123"

I do not get the benefits of marriage, because I do not have a spouse, not because the laws are discriminatory against single parents. I could marry if I chose to, except that I cannot marry someone of the same sex, for no legitimate reason. I would be forced to marry someone of the opposite sex in order to provide my daughter with the protections and benefits of having two married parents. Since marriage is a fundamental right, states should have to demonstrate that they have a compelling state interest in denying a particular type of couple the right to marry. It's not enough to draw arbitrary distinctions between people and say that these people do not have the right to marry simply because it is convenient for the state to say so or because the majority dislikes the marriage in question. The burden should be on the state to demonstrate that it has a compelling interest in prohibiting a particular type of marriage. I think this is true of laws barring first-cousin marriage, for example. I think it's clear that states do have a compelling interest in prohibiting marriages by people who are still children. Age requirements for marriage protect children. Age requirements for marriage do not represent a permanent prohibition against a particular kind of couple marrying, however. Since people get older, a child is not barred from marrying forever. The child must simply wait to come of age to marry. Prohibitions against same-sex marriage are a permanent bar to particular couples marrying, as prohibitions against child marriage are not. Someone who is 17 and wants to marry in a state with the legal age at 18 can either wait 1 year (a short time), or ask the permission of parents. In contrast, a gay person who wants to marry his or her partner legally can do so in only a few states, and the marriage will not be recognized at all ever in most other states. The case for including same-sex couples within marriage has nothing to do with ""redefining marriage."" Marriage was ""redefined"" by the federal and state DOMA laws passed in the 1990s that suddenly explicitly banned same-sex couples from marrying legally. The goal of those of us who advocate for including same-sex couples within marriage is to enable people who are already forming committed marital relationships to receive the same legal status and have the same legal rights and legal obligations as couples who are opposite-sex. Again, there is no compelling state interest in barring same-sex marriage. Barring same-sex couples from marrying harms children; it does not benefit them. Barring same-sex couples from marrying does nothing to promote stable families. It simply excludes some people from a fundamental right, with no purpose or rationale other than tradition, religious beliefs, and people's discomfort with the idea.

The Court has said previously that marriage is a fundamental right. In defending laws that bar same-sex marriage, a state, specifically California right now, must show that they have at the very least a rational basis for denying same-sex couples the right to marry, but they should probably be required to demonstrate a compelling interest in denying same-sex couples the right to marry. Marriage is a right. Therefore, the state must explain to the Court its reasons for denying a particular class the right to marry. It's incumbent on the state, not gay people, to demonstrate a compelling interest in denying the right to marry. Arguing that it's tradition to deny same-sex couples the right to marry is NOT a compelling interest, nor is it even a rational basis. These questions will probably come before the Supreme Court in the not-so-distant future. There is a lawsuit working its way forward, and the attorneys for gay couples in California are Ted Olson and David Boies, the lawyers who represented Bush and Gore respectively in the Bush v. Gore case. In that case they were opponents, and now they are on the same side, arguing for the right of same-sex couples to marry.

If minority rights are to mean anything and to be protected, they must be protected from the animus of majorities. In the case of Romer v. Evans, the Supreme Court struck down a state constitutional amendment voted in by the people, because the Court ruled that the amendment was based purely in animus against gay people. The Court ruled that the constitutional amendment did not even meet the rational basis standard. The fact that the people of Colorado voted for the amendment and thus wanted it was not sufficient to allow them to deny a right to a group of people, a minority.

Again, the reality is that we still restrict marriage in numerous ways, so clearly this is not the case. I am aware of your views concerning the constitution in this case. However, the change still involves a cultural change as well and for gays to compel society to change. Again, it's not states or society that is wanting change, but rather gay pride proponents. Broadening marriage, as you are wanting, is no small matter. This is understandable because, in a way, equality is pretty much a conservative position by default. It's why I prefer the idea of removing benefits from marriage altogether and giving them to all . I consider this egalitarian preference to be because of my conservative ideals. Ironically, it is because of equality I see no point in just broadening marriage to include merely one more group; if it's not opened up completely, it's not true marriage equality anyway.

It's not just my opinion; the Court has in the past declared this. The Court has never viewed fundamental rights as absolute, however. The Court has created balancing tests to weigh the interest of the states or the federal government in abridging a right against the right itself. For example, the Court after World War I declared that the first amendment right of free speech is not absolute, and it can be limited by the government if the speech presents a ""clear and present danger."" That came to be known as the ""clear and present danger test."" The Court thus upheld the Espionage Act as constitutional, allowing the government to arrest and imprison people for calling on men to resist the draft and for denouncing the government and the war. Over time, however, the Court backed away from the test, ruling in subsequent cases that the danger from speech had to be imminent for the government to restrict the speech. This is an example of how the Court has tried to balance the interests of the government or the states in protecting the people and the individual rights of the people. Steeeve will probably argue that this is the Court just making up balancing tests, which is true. But it's what they do. You are right that widespread acceptance of same-sex marriage will be a cultural change. I will argue that the culture has already been changing to accept gay people as free and equal citizens with the right to be themselves openly. The society has also been changing in acceptance of gay-headed families, even though most people still say they do not favor same-sex marriage. But the changes in attitudes over the past 30 years have been dramatic. I also think you are right that significant cultural and legal changes require time and thoughtful dialogue and consideration and debate. We are having that when it comes to same-sex marriage and equal rights under the law for gay people generally. That's partly why we have this debate topic in this forum. I think that each significant cultural or social change needs to be debated on its own merits. I do think this debate is important to our society, so that we continue to live together in a civil way, without resort to violence. While I like in theory your proposal to remove all concrete legal and financial benefits from marriage and granting all benefits to every individual, I think it is politically unrealistic to expect this to happen. I think most Americans can and will come to accept same-sex couples being included under the umbrella of existing marriage laws. We have seen this happen in states where same-sex marriage has been legal for a period of time. People have come to accept this because legalizing same-sex marriage does not take away anything from opposite-sex couples in their marriages. It has no direct impact on them at all. I do not think most Americans would accept stripping all marriages of the benefits that married couples receive. That would be a huge change that would directly affect not just same-sex couples but all married couples.","gay-marriage","07:36 AM","gay-rights-debates","135"

However, because we separate church and state, our laws must not advantage one religious viewpoint over others.

We are all free to believe and practice our own faiths by keeping religion separate from our government. Whether your or some others believe that same-sex marriage is ""institutionalized sin"" should be irrelevant in whether it is legal. The question should be whether same-sex marriage does harm to the society or its members, and whether a state has at least a rational basis but probably a compelling interest in banning same-sex marriage. People have the right to believe that Jews and Christians should not marry each other. People do not have the right to pass laws prohibiting Jews and Christians from marrying each other. On the K-12 level, in the public schools, it is not the job of teachers to impose religious doctrine on students. Indeed, they are prohibited from doing so.

The principle is clear - a lack of virtue engenders bondage. As one writer noted, ""Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their fetters (bindings)."" The more liberties a godless people achieve, the more enslaved they ultimately become in their worldly obsessions.

If minority rights are to mean anything and to be protected, they must be protected from the animus of majorities. In the case of Romer v. Evans, the Supreme Court struck down a state constitutional amendment voted in by the people, because the Court ruled that the amendment was based purely in animus against gay people. The Court ruled that the constitutional amendment did not even meet the rational basis standard. The fact that the people of Colorado voted for the amendment and thus wanted it was not sufficient to allow them to deny a right to a group of people, a minority.

Benjamin Rush became a Universalist, meaning he came to believe in universal salvation. This was considered heresy by most Christians at the time. My own faith is Unitarian Universalism, and my church was founded in the 1860s as a Universalist congregation. Thomas Jefferson was a Deist who did not believe that God intervenes in daily life and who did not believe in the miracles described in the Bible. He rewrote the Bible and stripped it of all miracles, including the resurrection of Jesus, which he excluded entirely from his Bible. James Madison was nominally Episcopalian, but some scholars regard him as a Deist. George Washington rarely spoke of his religious beliefs. He was Episcopalian in his church membership, and some scholars think he was also a Deist. John Adams was a Unitarian. Benjamin Franklin was a Deist who rejected the divinity of Jesus and a belief in salvation, but who retained a belief in religious practice and prayer. Many of the founders embraced the Enlightenment philosophy of their age and were not evangelical Christians in the traditional sense. The founders in the late 18th century were much concerned with fostering civic virtue, by which they generally meant a commitment to serve the common good. They drew their ideas about virtue from ancient Greek philosophers, notably Plato and Aristotle, and they modeled the new American republic partly on the republics of ancient Greece and Rome.","gay-marriage","03:07 PM","gay-rights-debates","161"

Anti-federalist writers like Agrippa and ""a Maryland farmer"" worried openly that majority rule would deny liberty to the minority, unless a Bill of Rights was included in the constitution to prohibit the majority from denying rights to the minority. James Madison also expressed great concern about the majority trampling on the rights of the minority. But Madison, as we have previously discussed, initially argued that a Bill of Rights was not necessary, because he thought the structure of the government itself, the separation of powers, would prevent the majority from trampling on minority rights. Madison had other reasons as well for initially opposing a Bill of Rights in the constitution. He later changed his mind, some say because of political pressure, and he was instrumental in writing the Bill of Rights that we now have. So while the Bill of Rights was inserted to prevent the government from trampling on the liberty of the people, if you read the antifederalist papers and also the writings of Madison on this topic, you see that their concern was that the majority would trample the rights of the minority through exertion of federal power. In the thinking of 18th century political theorists, in the struggle between power and liberty, the new constitution gave power to the majority of the people, but this left the problem of the majority of the people potentially using government power to deny liberty to the minority. The anti-federalist answer to this was a Bill of Rights, and Madison eventually agreed and participated in writing the Bill of Rights. Fast forward to the 20th century and Supreme Court interpretations of the 14th amendment. According to the Supreme Court, a state can have a compelling interest in a law that denies a right, but the bar is high for a state to demonstrate that it has a compelling interest in enacting the law. The Court, as we both know, has further developed this doctrine so that laws that deny rights on the basis of race or national origin or religion get strict scrutiny, meaning the state must show that it has a compelling interest in enacting the law. Laws that violate a fundamental right also apparently get strict scrutiny, although this doctrine is less clear, and it's hard to know whether the Court will apply strict scrutiny to a case challenging a restrictive marriage law. It is up to the Supreme Court to determine whether the state has a compelling interest in enacting a law in a case where the Court applies strict scrutiny. For cases in which a law denies rights on the basis of sex, the Court has applied a middle level of scrutiny, so that the bar is lower for the state to demonstrate its reasons for enacting the law. (I know you know all this, but I include it for background for other readers.) And for other kinds of discrimination, the Court typically applies the lowest level of scrutiny and demands only that states demonstrate a rational basis for enacting the law. Even with this low level of scrutiny, the Court ruled that the state of Colorado failed to show a rational basis for its state constitutional amendment that denied political rights on the basis of sexual orientation. The fact that the voters themselves voted in the constitutional amendment did not, in the view of the Court, give the state even a rational basis for enacting the law. I know you don't like any of this, but these balancing tests are what the Court does. I do not think the ruling in Romer v. Evans was based on ""pure emotion."" The Court majority considered what interest the state had in enacting the constitutional amendment, which denied people in the state the right to pass legislation barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The Court considered what the state's interest was in enacting this amendment, and the majority concluded that the only reason for the amendment was animus against gay people. This was not, in the view of the Court majority, even a rational basis for enacting the amendment, and they therefore ruled that the state could not abrogate an individual right with such an amendment.","gay-marriage","04:49 PM","gay-rights-debates","163"

His point was that, although the state may not show hostility to religion, religious exercises in the schools are in fact unconstitutional, and their prohibition does not represent hostility toward religion. See his statement in context: ""It is insisted that unless these religious exercises are permitted a 'religion of secularism' is established in the schools. We agree of course that the State may not establish a 'religion of secularism' in the sense of affirmatively opposing or showing hostility to religion, thus 'preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do believe.' Zorach v. Clauson, supra, at 314. We do not agree, however, that this decision in any sense has that effect. In addition, it might well be said that one's education is not complete without a study of comparative religion or the history of religion and its relationship to the advancement of civilization. It certainly may be said that the Bible is worthy of study for its literary and historic qualities. Nothing we have said here indicates that such study of the Bible or of religion, when presented objectively as part of a secular program of education, may not be effected consistently with the First Amendment. But the exercises here do not fall into those categories. They are religious exercises, required by the States in violation of the command of the First Amendment that the Government maintain strict neutrality, neither aiding nor opposing religion. ""Finally, we cannot accept that the concept of neutrality, which does not permit a State to require a religious exercise even with the consent of the majority of those [374 U.S. 203, 226] affected, collides with the majority's right to free exercise of religion.

So I'm going to break down the illogical nature of the ""compelling state interest"" test and why if one did exist it would have to include citizen votes as an interest. First off, I subject the role of government (federal and state combined) is basically to provide ""establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity"". You might notice this is from our Constitution. The relevant part here is ""blessings of liberty"". Now, who decides what a liberty is? Should it be the citizens of United States or should it be a select group of people or something else. I would say generally in the United States we have both rights agreed upon by the citizens and those we find inherent from God (see DOI for what I mean on the later). For the sake of argument let's just look at rights agreed upon by the citizens. Who's job is it to determine what the rights agreed upon by the citizens should be? There is really the main question. Well if I felt the speed limit should be 70mph instead of 65mph who do I go to? I go to the General Assembly in my state and lobby them to change the speed limit laws. Traditionally in our government we have set it up so we have one person running executive aspects or rather carrying out the laws; one GROUP making the laws that are to be carried out; and one group to ensure the government and others are acting in accordance with the laws. As such you have the executive branch, legislative branch, and judicial branch. So what branch would you go to in order to make an 'agreed upon right' for citizens? Well naturally the legislative branch. The judicial branch's ONLY job with that should be to look at that law and say does it conflict with a superior law (aka the constitution) . Now, in form, the judges are claiming the 14th amendment equal protection clause implies a ""compelling state interest test"". The substance of this ruling makes this not true in the way they apply it. Why? Well what is a compelling state interest? As I established above one state interest, for the legislature, is to bring about laws that the public agrees upon. The courts have said this is not good enough. So what is the threshold? It isn't implied in the amendment so you can't turn there. If you looked at public opinion than you'd just break what you said you can't do.

"07-25-2010","14376",12,"Steeeeve","408485","I'm familiar with what the court has said but they fail to realize the substantive meaning of this. So I'm going to break down the illogical nature of the ""compelling state interest"" test and why if one did exist it would have to include citizen votes as an interest. First off, I subject the role of government (federal and state combined) is basically to provide ""establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity"". You might notice this is from our Constitution. The relevant part here is ""blessings of liberty"". Now, who decides what a liberty is? Should it be the citizens of United States or should it be a select group of people or something else. I would say generally in the United States we have both rights agreed upon by the citizens and those we find inherent from God (see DOI for what I mean on the later). For the sake of argument let's just look at rights agreed upon by the citizens. Who's job is it to determine what the rights agreed upon by the citizens should be? There is really the main question. Well if I felt the speed limit should be 70mph instead of 65mph who do I go to? I go to the General Assembly in my state and lobby them to change the speed limit laws. Traditionally in our government we have set it up so we have one person running executive aspects or rather carrying out the laws; one GROUP making the laws that are to be carried out; and one group to ensure the government and others are acting in accordance with the laws. As such you have the executive branch, legislative branch, and judicial branch. So what branch would you go to in order to make an 'agreed upon right' for citizens? Well naturally the legislative branch. The judicial branch's ONLY job with that should be to look at that law and say does it conflict with a superior law (aka the constitution) . Now, in form, the judges are claiming the 14th amendment equal protection clause implies a ""compelling state interest test"". The substance of this ruling makes this not true in the way they apply it. Why? Well what is a compelling state interest? As I established above one state interest, for the legislature, is to bring about laws that the public agrees upon. The courts have said this is not good enough. So what is the threshold? It isn't implied in the amendment so you can't turn there. If you looked at public opinion than you'd just break what you said you can't do.

I think that on some issues, the constitution does prevent the majority from winning, specifically in cases in which the majority passes laws that deny rights to minorities. The segregation laws are an example. The majority of voters in the South clearly supported segregation laws, and the Court eventually interpreted the constitution as preventing the majority from enacting or retaining these laws. Ultimately, of course, the constitution exists because of the will of the majority, and it is the majority who sustain the constitution and provide for its enforcement, but it is more than a simple majority. Changing the constitution requires a decision by a super-majority, in effect. Only a super majority of 2/3 of both houses of Congress and 3/4 of the state legislatures can amend the constitution, as you know. So you are right that it is the will of the people, expressed in a super-majority, that has created and sustains the constitution, which through the Bill of Rights prevents majorities from denying rights to the minority. Madison himself wrote about his concerns that the majority would deny rights to minorities, as did several of the antifederalist writers. On the Romer v. Evans matter, I think the Court majority's ruling was based on more than their dislike for the public animus against gay people or their belief that you ""can't make a law because you don't like something."" I think their ruling was based on the fact that the Colorado constitutional amendment denied a right to a class of people, and in the judgment of the Court majority the voters had no rational basis for doing this beyond animus against gay people. Colorado, in defending the amendment, failed to demonstrate what the Court deemed to be a rational basis, in effect a good reason, for enacting the law. And they applied this judgment because the Colorado constitutional amendment in question denied a right to people. Voters can pass laws because they don't like something, and voters do this all the time. What the Court said voters cannot do is pass a law denying a right to people simply because they don't like those people; they have to demonstrate that the state has at least a rational basis for enacting a law that denies people rights.","gay-marriage","07:17 PM","gay-rights-debates","178"

This standard had to be set aside though because you couldn't rule unconstitutional things like abortion, homosexual conduct, death penalty for mentally handicapped, etc because many of those were forbidden for years or thought of in the negative. Haven't we had this conversation before? Barnett argues with another professor from Loyola I believe about the 9th amendment. Reading Barnett I think he extrapolates to much. At the end of the day the compelling state interest is still a total fraud as a constitutional test.

I think that's a shame. There is nothing unconstitutional in teaching about religion and its influence on the history of our nation. What is unconstitutional is teaching religion as doctrine in the public schools. On the college level, I teach a great deal about the influences of religion on American society and culture. I think it is important for our students to learn this.","mata","408600","Bravo Sir!

"08-22-2010","14376",14,"Winston Smith","410289","is that is your summary of ""1984"" obviously you didn't understand it at all. Language was used as thought control, by controlling which words existed and which not Big Brother could prevent rebellious thoughts. All languages are used not only for expressing thoughts but also for concealing thoughts. The big mistake is to believe that by supressing words you can prevent thoughts. You can excise the word freedom from the dictionary, but that won't prevent people from yearning for freedom. Maybe because Orwell was a writer he gave too much importance to the power of language. By the way, Big Brother only controlled and spied on the intellectual class, not the low class of illiterate people. Why? because words and ideas had no effect on the lower class, they just wanted food and entertainment.","mata","410415","Y'know Winston I happen to agree with many of the things you say, I just don't understand when you seem to get so overwrought when people dont immediately jump on your bandwagon?
