Why should I throw the Word of God in the trash for your political correctness? I discarded that decades ago when I found the truth. Why don't you guys read the Bible, pray for deliverance, and get yourselves saved so you will know right from wrong and so you can go to heaven when you die? I'm going to advise active gays to repent and receive Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior for the remission of their sins. They do that they can be happy for all eternity. You tell them their sin is ok and then they drop down into the Pit of Hell when they die and then they're miserable forever.

However, because we separate church and state, our laws must not advantage one religious viewpoint over others. Not all Christians or people of other faiths believe that ""gay sex is a sin,"" and nowhere does the Bible say anything at all about same-sex marriage. We should never allow one people of one religious faith to impose their religious beliefs on everyone else through the law. We are all free to believe and practice our own faiths by keeping religion separate from our government. Whether your or some others believe that same-sex marriage is ""institutionalized sin"" should be irrelevant in whether it is legal. The question should be whether same-sex marriage does harm to the society or its members, and whether a state has at least a rational basis but probably a compelling interest in banning same-sex marriage. People have the right to believe that Jews and Christians should not marry each other. People do not have the right to pass laws prohibiting Jews and Christians from marrying each other.

But the words of Madison himself demonstrate his intent. As for the Abingdon case, you need to place your quotation into context and show us the whole of what Justice Clark wrote. His point was that, although the state may not show hostility to religion, religious exercises in the schools are in fact unconstitutional, and their prohibition does not represent hostility toward religion. See his statement in context: ""It is insisted that unless these religious exercises are permitted a 'religion of secularism' is established in the schools. We agree of course that the State may not establish a 'religion of secularism' in the sense of affirmatively opposing or showing hostility to religion, thus 'preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do believe.' Zorach v. Clauson, supra, at 314. We do not agree, however, that this decision in any sense has that effect. In addition, it might well be said that one's education is not complete without a study of comparative religion or the history of religion and its relationship to the advancement of civilization. It certainly may be said that the Bible is worthy of study for its literary and historic qualities. Nothing we have said here indicates that such study of the Bible or of religion, when presented objectively as part of a secular program of education, may not be effected consistently with the First Amendment. But the exercises here do not fall into those categories. They are religious exercises, required by the States in violation of the command of the First Amendment that the Government maintain strict neutrality, neither aiding nor opposing religion. ""Finally, we cannot accept that the concept of neutrality, which does not permit a State to require a religious exercise even with the consent of the majority of those [374 U.S. 203, 226] affected, collides with the majority's right to free exercise of religion. While the Free Exercise Clause clearly prohibits the use of state action to deny the rights of free exercise to anyone, it has never meant that a majority could use the machinery of the State to practice its beliefs.""","gay-marriage","11:46 AM","gay-rights-debates","444"

He was a strong supporter of religious liberty. That is why he sought to keep government from interfering with religion and to prevent any church from claiming a hold on the government. He believed, like his friend Jefferson, that the people are free to practice their faith only when the government is kept out of religion. He did not seek to create a Christian nation. He sought to create a nation where the people would be free to practice their Christian faith and other faiths. He believed that protecting religious liberty would enable Christianity to thrive and to water the tree of republican liberty generally. You are also right that most of the founders of our nation were men of faith. They were also men of diverse faiths and diverse views about faith. As I have said, many of the men who had significant influences on the creation of the republic and on the constitution were not traditional evangelical Christians, but Deists and people whose faith was shaped by the Enlightenment ideas of the age. The framers were to a large degree believers in reason and science as well as men of faith, and many of them looked to the laws of nature to explain phenomena, not to a God who intervenes directly in people's lives. But they were certainly not hostile to religion. They opposed an established religion, meaning government-sponsored religion and government-sponsored worship. (Note that it was not until the 20th century, well after the ratification of the 14th amendment, that the first amendment ban on established churches was applied to the states. The first amendment originally applied only to the national government, not the state governments, and the old Puritan Church, which became the Congregational Church, remained the established church of Massachusetts well into the 19th century.) I do not know the extent to which most K-12 public school teachers address the religious influences on the shaping of our republic in their classes, but I suspect that most social studies and history teachers on the K-12 level shy away from teaching about this. I think that's a shame. There is nothing unconstitutional in teaching about religion and its influence on the history of our nation. What is unconstitutional is teaching religion as doctrine in the public schools. On the college level, I teach a great deal about the influences of religion on American society and culture. I think it is important for our students to learn this.","gay-marriage","07:25 AM","gay-rights-debates","477"

Of course biological reproduction involves a sperm and an egg, and most of the time, this involves a man and a woman engaging in sexual intercourse. But the creation of an ongoing couple relationship is a social arrangement, not a biological one. Not all cultures throughout time and around the world surround reproduction with monogamous heterosexual marital relationships. Polygamous relationships have been common in world history, whether we like them or not. To equate our current predominant form of social arrangement surrounding reproduction (monogamous heterosexual marriage) with nature or with biology is to confound biology with social arrangements.

I think there are merits to saying that society should better value a type of relationship that expands society in numbers. That's part of the reason marriage has been given benefits to begin with. Obviously, a man with a man can't procreate and therefore expand society. You are correct that there are infertile couples as well, but the gender is a VERY obvious place to draw the line because NO same-sex couple can ever contribute to society by procreating as it's impossible. Obviously it matters to huge amounts of society, not just me. But taking the 'just-don't-do-it' as an alternative to wanting to see society changed in the way I think is best is an unrealistic thing to ask of anyone. One could tell someone that on any number of issues. I think society is better served by the positions I and many others take, so no, I don't think it's enough to just avoid marrying same-sex. That's like telling someone they shouldn't oppose stealing in society, and should instead just avoid stealing themselves.

I think there are merits to saying that society should better value a type of relationship that expands society in numbers. That's part of the reason marriage has been given benefits to begin with. Obviously, a man with a man can't procreate and therefore expand society. You are correct that there are infertile couples as well, but the gender is a VERY obvious place to draw the line because NO same-sex couple can ever contribute to society by procreating as it's impossible. Obviously it matters to huge amounts of society, not just me. But taking the 'just-don't-do-it' as an alternative to wanting to see society changed in the way I think is best is an unrealistic thing to ask of anyone. One could tell someone that on any number of issues. I think society is better served by the positions I and many others take, so no, I don't think it's enough to just avoid marrying same-sex. That's like telling someone they shouldn't oppose stealing in society, and should instead just avoid stealing themselves.

Let me just make one point about the ""just don't do it"" argument. I personally do not like the 2nd amendment, and I wish this amendment were not in the constitution. I do not like the idea that people can carry guns around, and I would never own a gun or shoot one. However, the 2nd amendment is in the constitution, and given that, I think the Supreme Court did rule correctly to incorporate the 2nd amendment and apply it to the states. (This is a 14th amendment interpretation question.) Now that the Supreme Court has ruled, I accept that gun ownership is an individual right. I may not like it, but I accept it, and I am not going to work to try to pass laws to restrict gun ownership. I don't own a gun, and I won't shoot a gun. I am taking the ""just don't do it"" position on this. I am not owning a gun. I am also not trying to prevent anyone else from owning a gun, even though I personally don't like the idea of people carrying guns around. It is possible to take the ""just don't do it"" position, and this is an example of it. I can live with people disagreeing with me about guns, and I can live with people having a right to bear arms. I know that many people see this right as very important, and I accept that, even though I don't value this right or wish to exercise it. But I accept that the right matters to other people, and I therefore accept and will live with their right to own guns.","gay-marriage","01:24 PM","gay-rights-debates","339"

If we inform gay people that the ex-gay ministries are quackery, then it's up to them to choose whether to go to the quacks. As for tolerance, I certainly tolerate people believing that same-sex relationships are sinful. That's fine with me.

That is simply what it says. What liberty as an unalienable right means is a matter of interpretation and some disagreement. The meaning of the assertions in the Declaration has long been debated and contested. Further, not all Americans have always agreed with the principles expressed in the Declaration of Independence. Pro-slavery advocates did not see liberty as an unalienable right that extended to their slaves. Even Thomas Jefferson himself, while opposing slavery as contrary to his Declaration, never freed most of his own slaves. It is true that most people probably have convictions that they hold very deeply. I certainly do. However, that does not mean that what I believe is the absolute truth. As you suggest in your post, people nowadays mostly accept the view that blacks should be treated as the equals of whites. I believe this passionately. But is this the absolute truth? Or is it a conviction that we hold? I think it is the latter. It is an important conviction, but that does not make it the absolute truth. I do not think there are absolute moral truths. Our moral beliefs are always our beliefs. That doesn't mean that our beliefs don't matter or that we don't hold our convictions dear to us. Our moral beliefs are of great importance to us. But I think we must always reconsider what we believe and why we believe it in the various life contexts we encounter.

I don't know why this keeps happening I think it would be very difficult to eliminate all benefits associated with legal marriage at this point On the question of ""just don't do it,"" I have addressed this earlier by pointing out that I do not agree with gun ownership and think the second amendment is a bad thing, but I accept that people have the right to own guns and will own guns, and I simply choose not to own or shoot guns myself. This is an example of ""just don't do it. Laws against stealing are different from marriage laws in that stealing directly harms other people and thus harms the society. Stealing therefore should be against the law, in my view. Marrying someone does not harm other people, even though some may disagree with a particular kind of marriage. Your argument that ""no"" same-sex couple can ever contribute to society by procreating ignores the fact that gay individuals can and do procreate and same-sex couples do contribute to society by raising children together. If a purpose of marriage is to foster the rearing of children in stable families, and same-sex couples do create families with children, then it clearly harms children and the society to deny children with same-sex parents the protections and stability of having legally married parents. We do not prohibit opposite-sex couples who are raising adopted children or children from previous unions the right to marry. We encourage them to marry in part to provide stability to the children they are raising, no matter whether these children are their biological offspring. We should grant same-sex couples the legal right to marry in part for the same reasons: to provide stability to the children they are raising.

What does this do to all the children who have same-sex parents? It leaves them out because you think we might as well draw the line to exclude them. You sound so ho hum about this, like it's no big deal that children of same-sex couples are being disadvantaged in this way. To me it is a big deal, because these are real children who are losing out. The ""marriage-benefit gravy train"" as you phrase it exists for good reasons, not just to provide extra benefits to some people and not others. The benefits of legal marriage are aimed at supporting family stability and protecting children and spouses who may be home raising children. (Now I am sounding like more of a supporter of marriage than you are, though I am sure that is not actually true. I know you support marriage.) Of course, the ideal solution that you have envisioned and proposed would not leave out children of same-sex couples, because it would disconnect marriage from benefits entirely. And it's true that if we had universal health insurance not provided through employers, children and spouses would not depend on one spouse's family health insurance benefits. If people could leave Social Security survivors' benefits to one adult of their choice as well as to their children, rather than only married people being able to leave benefits to spouses, this would get around the problem of same-sex spouses not being eligible for survivors' benefits. However, the goal of disconnecting benefits from marriage entirely does not seem politically feasible to me, despite how attractive it sounds in theory. You write this: ""Raising children is not a good enough reason to open marriage up to any given group that comes along wanting those benefits because anyone of any relationship arrangement imaginable could conceivably be raising a child."" What ""relationship arrangement imaginable"" are you imagining here? Two people who are raising a child together already CAN get married to each other, unless they are already close biological family or unless they are of the same sex in most states or unless they are legally married to someone else. Otherwise, two people raising children together can marry each other. I don't know what ""given group"" you think will suddenly demand the right to marry that doesn't already have the right to marry, except for gay people. (I do see some first cousins seeking the right to marry, from which they are barred in some states but not others. I personally see no good reason why states should bar first cousins from marrying each other, but that is a debate for another thread.) You seem to be worried about a slippery slope that doesn't exist, about all kinds of weird groups of people wanting to marry each other because they are raising children together. But people raising children together already have the right to marry each other legally if they are not closely related biologically, if they are not already married to someone else, and if they are not of the same sex in most states. There is no slippery slope where all kinds of weird people will marry each other, because weird people already have the right to marry each other. Even criminals on death row can marry. The group of couples that is mostly excluded is same-sex couples, for no legitimate reason. I think that protecting and providing for children IS a major reason why people get married legally, and it is a good reason for doing so. Many senior citizens, who are not going to have more children, choose not to marry each other legally and simply live as unmarried couples. They have no good reason to marry legally once they do not plan to raise children together, and some of them already receive Social Security survivors' benefits from previous spouses. You write this: ""Again, you're splitting hairs here and playing word games--quite simply, a gay couple can never reproduce with each other. It's as simple as that."" My answer to this is, ""So what?"" An infertile couple can never reproduce with each other either, and you do not want to exclude them from the right to marry. You are the one splitting hairs, by trying to find a rationale for excluding from marriage only same-sex couples. You would exclude same-sex couples from marrying because of their infertility, but you would not exclude other infertile couples from legal marriage. Our current marriage laws do not require that people be able to reproduce biologically with each other in order to marry. This is as it should be. Marriage should not be denied to people simply because they cannot reproduce biologically with each other. Same-sex couples are no different from any other couple in their love, in their commitment, and in their ability and choice to raise children together. Same-sex couples should have the equal right to marry legally because it benefits society to support stable families, and it especially benefits children to live in stable families with two married parents. Since same-sex couples are raising children, the children in these families deserve the right to have two parents who are legally married to each other. Beyond this, marriage is a fundamental right, and states need to have a compelling state interest in denying couples the right to marry each other. States have demonstrated no compelling interest in preventing same-sex couples from marrying legally.","gay-marriage","01:30 PM","gay-rights-debates","1025"

I have to hire people or ask others to help me do child care for the next 4 years, until my daughter is 12. My child automatically qualifies to be on my health insurance plan because she is legally my daughter. I do not get the benefits of marriage, because I do not have a spouse, not because the laws are discriminatory against single parents. I could marry if I chose to, except that I cannot marry someone of the same sex, for no legitimate reason. I would be forced to marry someone of the opposite sex in order to provide my daughter with the protections and benefits of having two married parents. Since marriage is a fundamental right, states should have to demonstrate that they have a compelling state interest in denying a particular type of couple the right to marry. It's not enough to draw arbitrary distinctions between people and say that these people do not have the right to marry simply because it is convenient for the state to say so or because the majority dislikes the marriage in question. The burden should be on the state to demonstrate that it has a compelling interest in prohibiting a particular type of marriage. I think this is true of laws barring first-cousin marriage, for example. I think it's clear that states do have a compelling interest in prohibiting marriages by people who are still children. Age requirements for marriage protect children. Age requirements for marriage do not represent a permanent prohibition against a particular kind of couple marrying, however. Since people get older, a child is not barred from marrying forever. The child must simply wait to come of age to marry. Prohibitions against same-sex marriage are a permanent bar to particular couples marrying, as prohibitions against child marriage are not. Someone who is 17 and wants to marry in a state with the legal age at 18 can either wait 1 year (a short time), or ask the permission of parents. In contrast, a gay person who wants to marry his or her partner legally can do so in only a few states, and the marriage will not be recognized at all ever in most other states. The case for including same-sex couples within marriage has nothing to do with ""redefining marriage."" Marriage was ""redefined"" by the federal and state DOMA laws passed in the 1990s that suddenly explicitly banned same-sex couples from marrying legally. The goal of those of us who advocate for including same-sex couples within marriage is to enable people who are already forming committed marital relationships to receive the same legal status and have the same legal rights and legal obligations as couples who are opposite-sex. Again, there is no compelling state interest in barring same-sex marriage. Barring same-sex couples from marrying harms children; it does not benefit them. Barring same-sex couples from marrying does nothing to promote stable families. It simply excludes some people from a fundamental right, with no purpose or rationale other than tradition, religious beliefs, and people's discomfort with the idea. These are not adequate reasons to exclude a class of people from a fundamental right.","gay-marriage","03:08 PM","gay-rights-debates","624"

If minority rights are to mean anything and to be protected, they must be protected from the animus of majorities. In the case of Romer v. Evans, the Supreme Court struck down a state constitutional amendment voted in by the people, because the Court ruled that the amendment was based purely in animus against gay people. The Court ruled that the constitutional amendment did not even meet the rational basis standard. The fact that the people of Colorado voted for the amendment and thus wanted it was not sufficient to allow them to deny a right to a group of people, a minority.

Anti-federalist writers like Agrippa and ""a Maryland farmer"" worried openly that majority rule would deny liberty to the minority, unless a Bill of Rights was included in the constitution to prohibit the majority from denying rights to the minority. James Madison also expressed great concern about the majority trampling on the rights of the minority. But Madison, as we have previously discussed, initially argued that a Bill of Rights was not necessary, because he thought the structure of the government itself, the separation of powers, would prevent the majority from trampling on minority rights. Madison had other reasons as well for initially opposing a Bill of Rights in the constitution. He later changed his mind, some say because of political pressure, and he was instrumental in writing the Bill of Rights that we now have. So while the Bill of Rights was inserted to prevent the government from trampling on the liberty of the people, if you read the antifederalist papers and also the writings of Madison on this topic, you see that their concern was that the majority would trample the rights of the minority through exertion of federal power. In the thinking of 18th century political theorists, in the struggle between power and liberty, the new constitution gave power to the majority of the people, but this left the problem of the majority of the people potentially using government power to deny liberty to the minority. The anti-federalist answer to this was a Bill of Rights, and Madison eventually agreed and participated in writing the Bill of Rights. Fast forward to the 20th century and Supreme Court interpretations of the 14th amendment. According to the Supreme Court, a state can have a compelling interest in a law that denies a right, but the bar is high for a state to demonstrate that it has a compelling interest in enacting the law. The Court, as we both know, has further developed this doctrine so that laws that deny rights on the basis of race or national origin or religion get strict scrutiny, meaning the state must show that it has a compelling interest in enacting the law. Laws that violate a fundamental right also apparently get strict scrutiny, although this doctrine is less clear, and it's hard to know whether the Court will apply strict scrutiny to a case challenging a restrictive marriage law. It is up to the Supreme Court to determine whether the state has a compelling interest in enacting a law in a case where the Court applies strict scrutiny. For cases in which a law denies rights on the basis of sex, the Court has applied a middle level of scrutiny, so that the bar is lower for the state to demonstrate its reasons for enacting the law. (I know you know all this, but I include it for background for other readers.) And for other kinds of discrimination, the Court typically applies the lowest level of scrutiny and demands only that states demonstrate a rational basis for enacting the law. Even with this low level of scrutiny, the Court ruled that the state of Colorado failed to show a rational basis for its state constitutional amendment that denied political rights on the basis of sexual orientation. The fact that the voters themselves voted in the constitutional amendment did not, in the view of the Court, give the state even a rational basis for enacting the law. I know you don't like any of this, but these balancing tests are what the Court does. I do not think the ruling in Romer v. Evans was based on ""pure emotion."" The Court majority considered what interest the state had in enacting the constitutional amendment, which denied people in the state the right to pass legislation barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The Court considered what the state's interest was in enacting this amendment, and the majority concluded that the only reason for the amendment was animus against gay people. This was not, in the view of the Court majority, even a rational basis for enacting the amendment, and they therefore ruled that the state could not abrogate an individual right with such an amendment.","gay-marriage","04:49 PM","gay-rights-debates","809"

Well if I felt the speed limit should be 70mph instead of 65mph who do I go to? I go to the General Assembly in my state and lobby them to change the speed limit laws. Traditionally in our government we have set it up so we have one person running executive aspects or rather carrying out the laws; one GROUP making the laws that are to be carried out; and one group to ensure the government and others are acting in accordance with the laws. As such you have the executive branch, legislative branch, and judicial branch. So what branch would you go to in order to make an 'agreed upon right' for citizens? Well naturally the legislative branch. The judicial branch's ONLY job with that should be to look at that law and say does it conflict with a superior law (aka the constitution) .

The substance of this ruling makes this not true in the way they apply it. Why? Well what is a compelling state interest? As I established above one state interest, for the legislature, is to bring about laws that the public agrees upon. The courts have said this is not good enough. So what is the threshold?

I think that on some issues, the constitution does prevent the majority from winning, specifically in cases in which the majority passes laws that deny rights to minorities. The segregation laws are an example. The majority of voters in the South clearly supported segregation laws, and the Court eventually interpreted the constitution as preventing the majority from enacting or retaining these laws. Ultimately, of course, the constitution exists because of the will of the majority, and it is the majority who sustain the constitution and provide for its enforcement, but it is more than a simple majority. Changing the constitution requires a decision by a super-majority, in effect. Only a super majority of 2/3 of both houses of Congress and 3/4 of the state legislatures can amend the constitution, as you know. So you are right that it is the will of the people, expressed in a super-majority, that has created and sustains the constitution, which through the Bill of Rights prevents majorities from denying rights to the minority. Madison himself wrote about his concerns that the majority would deny rights to minorities, as did several of the antifederalist writers. On the Romer v. Evans matter, I think the Court majority's ruling was based on more than their dislike for the public animus against gay people or their belief that you ""can't make a law because you don't like something."" I think their ruling was based on the fact that the Colorado constitutional amendment denied a right to a class of people, and in the judgment of the Court majority the voters had no rational basis for doing this beyond animus against gay people. Colorado, in defending the amendment, failed to demonstrate what the Court deemed to be a rational basis, in effect a good reason, for enacting the law. And they applied this judgment because the Colorado constitutional amendment in question denied a right to people. Voters can pass laws because they don't like something, and voters do this all the time. What the Court said voters cannot do is pass a law denying a right to people simply because they don't like those people; they have to demonstrate that the state has at least a rational basis for enacting a law that denies people rights.","gay-marriage","07:17 PM","gay-rights-debates","426"

Scalia actually goes around and does a speech where he gives examples of rulings he has made that upset both sides basically saying he doesn't care who he offends. Reading some of his opinions makes me believe he really doesn't care about offending people haha.","gay-marriage","08:42 PM","gay-rights-debates","83"
