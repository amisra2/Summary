I don't know why this keeps happening. Jyoshu, I stand corrected on your argument about marriage as an institution. I misunderstood your argument to be that we should have a separate category of legal civil unions for gay people. I think it would be very difficult to eliminate all benefits associated with legal marriage at this point. Perhaps it would be possible; we could, for example, say that a person can leave Social Security survivors' benefits to one survivor, whether this is their legal spouse or not. Disassociating all benefits from marriage would mean revising many laws and policies, and I doubt most people would go along with this plan. It would be far easier simply to include same-sex couples within the institution of legal marriage. On the question of ""just don't do it,"" I have addressed this earlier by pointing out that I do not agree with gun ownership and think the second amendment is a bad thing, but I accept that people have the right to own guns and will own guns, and I simply choose not to own or shoot guns myself. This is an example of ""just don't do it."" Laws against stealing are different from marriage laws in that stealing directly harms other people and thus harms the society. Stealing therefore should be against the law, in my view. Marrying someone does not harm other people, even though some may disagree with a particular kind of marriage. There is no rational basis for making same-sex marriage against the law; the only reason people oppose legal same-sex marriage is because they don't like it or because their religion doesn't accept it. These are not rational bases, not justifications for making a particular kind of marriage against the law, especially since such laws discriminate against a class of people and deny them a fundamental right. Your argument that ""no"" same-sex couple can ever contribute to society by procreating ignores the fact that gay individuals can and do procreate, and same-sex couples do contribute to society by raising children together. If a purpose of marriage is to foster the rearing of children in stable families, and same-sex couples do create families with children, then it clearly harms children and the society to deny children with same-sex parents the protections and stability of having legally married parents. We do not prohibit opposite-sex couples who are raising adopted children or children from previous unions the right to marry. We encourage them to marry in part to provide stability to the children they are raising, no matter whether these children are their biological offspring. We should grant same-sex couples the legal right to marry in part for the same reasons: to provide stability to the children they are raising. Why should we deny this security to children who happen to have same-sex parents? To argue that we should give special encouragement to marriage relationships that ""expand society in numbers"" does not make sense today, as we have plenty of numbers already, and there is no need to promote an expansion of our human numbers. People don't need to marry to reproduce anyway. The purpose of legal marriage should not be to promote more biological reproduction, in my view. I think that we should encourage marriage in part to promote long-term stability in families for the benefit of children. Since same-sex couples have and raise children together, the children of same-sex couples should have the same right to the protections of legally married parents that the children of opposite-sex couples have. Long-term stable families help children to grow up with love and security, and this helps to produce better-adjusted adults. Promoting marriage for all families with children thus serves society not by encouraging the expansion of numbers, but by helping to produce healthier and better-adjusted children and eventually adults.","gay-marriage","09:16 PM","gay-rights-debates","121"

I'm not asserting that stealing matches up with gay marriage analagously in other ways.

In terms of gender, marriage is as it has been since this country began: a union between a man and a woman. It's not like that was set up in order to oppress gay people.

What does this do to all the children who have same-sex parents? It leaves them out because you think we might as well draw the line to exclude them. You sound so ho hum about this, like it's no big deal that children of same-sex couples are being disadvantaged in this way. To me it is a big deal, because these are real children who are losing out. The ""marriage-benefit gravy train"" as you phrase it exists for good reasons, not just to provide extra benefits to some people and not others. The benefits of legal marriage are aimed at supporting family stability and protecting children and spouses who may be home raising children. (Now I am sounding like more of a supporter of marriage than you are, though I am sure that is not actually true. I know you support marriage.) Of course, the ideal solution that you have envisioned and proposed would not leave out children of same-sex couples, because it would disconnect marriage from benefits entirely. And it's true that if we had universal health insurance not provided through employers, children and spouses would not depend on one spouse's family health insurance benefits. If people could leave Social Security survivors' benefits to one adult of their choice as well as to their children, rather than only married people being able to leave benefits to spouses, this would get around the problem of same-sex spouses not being eligible for survivors' benefits. However, the goal of disconnecting benefits from marriage entirely does not seem politically feasible to me, despite how attractive it sounds in theory. You write this: ""Raising children is not a good enough reason to open marriage up to any given group that comes along wanting those benefits because anyone of any relationship arrangement imaginable could conceivably be raising a child."" What ""relationship arrangement imaginable"" are you imagining here? Two people who are raising a child together already CAN get married to each other, unless they are already close biological family or unless they are of the same sex in most states or unless they are legally married to someone else. Otherwise, two people raising children together can marry each other. I don't know what ""given group"" you think will suddenly demand the right to marry that doesn't already have the right to marry, except for gay people. (I do see some first cousins seeking the right to marry, from which they are barred in some states but not others. I personally see no good reason why states should bar first cousins from marrying each other, but that is a debate for another thread.) You seem to be worried about a slippery slope that doesn't exist, about all kinds of weird groups of people wanting to marry each other because they are raising children together. But people raising children together already have the right to marry each other legally if they are not closely related biologically, if they are not already married to someone else, and if they are not of the same sex in most states. There is no slippery slope where all kinds of weird people will marry each other, because weird people already have the right to marry each other. Even criminals on death row can marry. The group of couples that is mostly excluded is same-sex couples, for no legitimate reason. I think that protecting and providing for children IS a major reason why people get married legally, and it is a good reason for doing so. Many senior citizens, who are not going to have more children, choose not to marry each other legally and simply live as unmarried couples. They have no good reason to marry legally once they do not plan to raise children together, and some of them already receive Social Security survivors' benefits from previous spouses. You write this: ""Again, you're splitting hairs here and playing word games--quite simply, a gay couple can never reproduce with each other. It's as simple as that."" My answer to this is, ""So what?"" An infertile couple can never reproduce with each other either, and you do not want to exclude them from the right to marry. You are the one splitting hairs, by trying to find a rationale for excluding from marriage only same-sex couples. You would exclude same-sex couples from marrying because of their infertility, but you would not exclude other infertile couples from legal marriage. Our current marriage laws do not require that people be able to reproduce biologically with each other in order to marry. This is as it should be. Marriage should not be denied to people simply because they cannot reproduce biologically with each other. Same-sex couples are no different from any other couple in their love, in their commitment, and in their ability and choice to raise children together. Same-sex couples should have the equal right to marry legally because it benefits society to support stable families, and it especially benefits children to live in stable families with two married parents. Since same-sex couples are raising children, the children in these families deserve the right to have two parents who are legally married to each other. Beyond this, marriage is a fundamental right, and states need to have a compelling state interest in denying couples the right to marry each other. States have demonstrated no compelling interest in preventing same-sex couples from marrying legally.","gay-marriage","01:30 PM","gay-rights-debates","123"

What about children being raised by two or three or more siblings? What about children being raised by polygamous families? The point here is that there are always exceptions of people out there who aren't going to fit into the marriage-benefit category. There are so many possibilities out there that I think we should keep the line drawn based on gender--it seems as good a standard as any. (Actually I'd prefer to open it to all people and remove that from marriage altogether, as I said earlier.) If you disagree, how would you redefine marriage to include as many possible situations as we can? how would you possibly make those determinations? Would you just broaden the line a little to include one more category (same-gender pairing)? You argue as if this is for the sake of children--but your solution as I see it doesn't address children being benefited in all these other situations. If I seem 'ho hum' about this, it's because this issue has been around for a long time and to be honest I'm seeing nothing new here in terms of arguments for redefining marriage. Most states just aren't interested, IMO because of the reasons I've brought up here. Unless marriage benefits were somehow given to all people everywhere of any age, number, etc., it's always going to provide for some and not others. The examples I mentioned at the top of this post, for instance. Or, for instance, any sort of relationship society currently deems illegal . Gay relationships are not the only sort of relationship that society doesn't allow as marriage sometimes. It's not a situation of everything else versus gay. There are other arrangements and sort of relationships that are much more forbidden in society than same-gender ones; for instance, underage relationships. It is easier for a person to marry a person of the same gender than it is for a 19 year old to marry a 17 year old in this country. I said nothing about 'weird people'; whether or not someone is weird or not is always a matter of opinion. As I said there are always exceptions. But I see no reason to argue exceptions as if they are rule. You're starting at square one again, as if we haven't already been over this. Again, these are exceptions--an 'infertile couple' that is opposite-sex is still engaging in a relationship that society realizes is the most ideal arrangement for procreation. No, but conversely child-raising should not be reason enough, IMO, to broaden marriage benefits to other arrangements that what currently qualifies.","gay-marriage","02:28 PM","gay-rights-debates","124"

I therefore must work to support my child, and there is no other spouse to stay home to take care of our child. I have to hire people or ask others to help me do child care for the next 4 years, until my daughter is 12. My child automatically qualifies to be on my health insurance plan because she is legally my daughter. I do not get the benefits of marriage, because I do not have a spouse, not because the laws are discriminatory against single parents. I could marry if I chose to, except that I cannot marry someone of the same sex, for no legitimate reason. I would be forced to marry someone of the opposite sex in order to provide my daughter with the protections and benefits of having two married parents. Since marriage is a fundamental right, states should have to demonstrate that they have a compelling state interest in denying a particular type of couple the right to marry. It's not enough to draw arbitrary distinctions between people and say that these people do not have the right to marry simply because it is convenient for the state to say so or because the majority dislikes the marriage in question. The burden should be on the state to demonstrate that it has a compelling interest in prohibiting a particular type of marriage. I think this is true of laws barring first-cousin marriage, for example. I think it's clear that states do have a compelling interest in prohibiting marriages by people who are still children. Age requirements for marriage protect children. Age requirements for marriage do not represent a permanent prohibition against a particular kind of couple marrying, however. Since people get older, a child is not barred from marrying forever. The child must simply wait to come of age to marry. Prohibitions against same-sex marriage are a permanent bar to particular couples marrying, as prohibitions against child marriage are not. Someone who is 17 and wants to marry in a state with the legal age at 18 can either wait 1 year (a short time), or ask the permission of parents. In contrast, a gay person who wants to marry his or her partner legally can do so in only a few states, and the marriage will not be recognized at all ever in most other states. The case for including same-sex couples within marriage has nothing to do with ""redefining marriage."" Marriage was ""redefined"" by the federal and state DOMA laws passed in the 1990s that suddenly explicitly banned same-sex couples from marrying legally. The goal of those of us who advocate for including same-sex couples within marriage is to enable people who are already forming committed marital relationships to receive the same legal status and have the same legal rights and legal obligations as couples who are opposite-sex. Again, there is no compelling state interest in barring same-sex marriage. Barring same-sex couples from marrying harms children; it does not benefit them. Barring same-sex couples from marrying does nothing to promote stable families. It simply excludes some people from a fundamental right, with no purpose or rationale other than tradition, religious beliefs, and people's discomfort with the idea. These are not adequate reasons to exclude a class of people from a fundamental right.","gay-marriage","03:08 PM","gay-rights-debates","125"

The Court has said previously that marriage is a fundamental right. In defending laws that bar same-sex marriage, a state, specifically California right now, must show that they have at the very least a rational basis for denying same-sex couples the right to marry, but they should probably be required to demonstrate a compelling interest in denying same-sex couples the right to marry. Marriage is a right. Therefore, the state must explain to the Court its reasons for denying a particular class the right to marry. It's incumbent on the state, not gay people, to demonstrate a compelling interest in denying the right to marry. Arguing that it's tradition to deny same-sex couples the right to marry is NOT a compelling interest, nor is it even a rational basis. These questions will probably come before the Supreme Court in the not-so-distant future. There is a lawsuit working its way forward, and the attorneys for gay couples in California are Ted Olson and David Boies, the lawyers who represented Bush and Gore respectively in the Bush v. Gore case. In that case they were opponents, and now they are on the same side, arguing for the right of same-sex couples to marry. Olson, a staunch conservative, is a strong advocate for equal marriage rights for same-sex couples, as is Boies.

"07-23-2010","14376",9,"None","None","None","Ohioprof","408259","The problem, Steeeve, with saying the compelling state interest is in enacting a law that the people want is that this is exactly what the Bill of Rights was intended to prevent: the majority denying rights to the minority through the use of government. If minority rights are to mean anything and to be protected, they must be protected from the animus of majorities. In the case of Romer v. Evans, the Supreme Court struck down a state constitutional amendment voted in by the people, because the Court ruled that the amendment was based purely in animus against gay people. The Court ruled that the constitutional amendment did not even meet the rational basis standard. The fact that the people of Colorado voted for the amendment and thus wanted it was not sufficient to allow them to deny a right to a group of people, a minority. I think the Court ruled correctly in Romer v. Evans. I am sure you will disagree with me about this.","gay-marriage","10:52 PM","gay-rights-debates","133"
"07-23-2010","14376",9,"Ohioprof","408252","To joshyu and gansao: The term ""compelling state interest"" is a standard applied by the Supreme Court to state laws that deny a class of people a fundamental right. The Court has said previously that marriage is a fundamental right. Olson, a staunch conservative, is a strong advocate for equal marriage rights for same-sex couples, as is Boies. It will be interesting to watch.","jyoshu","408262","Of course, this view is based upon your interpretation of the 14th amendment, in that you say broadly assert ""marriage"" (apparently in any form) is a fundamental right. Again, the reality is that we still restrict marriage in numerous ways, so clearly this is not the case. I am aware of your views concerning the constitution in this case. However, the change still involves a cultural change as well and for gays to compel society to change. Again, it's not states or society that is wanting change, but rather gay pride proponents. Broadening marriage, as you are wanting, is no small matter. This is understandable because, in a way, equality is pretty much a conservative position by default. It's why I prefer the idea of removing benefits from marriage altogether and giving them to all . I consider this egalitarian preference to be because of my conservative ideals. Ironically, it is because of equality I see no point in just broadening marriage to include merely one more group; if it's not opened up completely, it's not true marriage equality anyway. You are right in the likelihood of the current case getting to the Supreme Court. I think it's telling that many liberals don't really want this to happen, because liberals are in the minority on the court right now and if you lose it would be disastrous in terms of precedent.","gay-marriage","11:07 PM","gay-rights-debates","134"
"07-24-2010","14376",9,"None","None","None","Ohioprof","408279","Jyoshu: The Supreme Court has said in the past that marriage is a fundamental right, and we will see if they assert this now. It's not just my opinion; the Court has in the past declared this. The Court has never viewed fundamental rights as absolute, however. The Court has created balancing tests to weigh the interest of the states or the federal government in abridging a right against the right itself. For example, the Court after World War I declared that the first amendment right of free speech is not absolute, and it can be limited by the government if the speech presents a ""clear and present danger."" That came to be known as the ""clear and present danger test."" The Court thus upheld the Espionage Act as constitutional, allowing the government to arrest and imprison people for calling on men to resist the draft and for denouncing the government and the war. Over time, however, the Court backed away from the test, ruling in subsequent cases that the danger from speech had to be imminent for the government to restrict the speech. This is an example of how the Court has tried to balance the interests of the government or the states in protecting the people and the individual rights of the people. Steeeve will probably argue that this is the Court just making up balancing tests, which is true. But it's what they do. You are right that widespread acceptance of same-sex marriage will be a cultural change. I will argue that the culture has already been changing to accept gay people as free and equal citizens with the right to be themselves openly. The society has also been changing in acceptance of gay-headed families, even though most people still say they do not favor same-sex marriage. But the changes in attitudes over the past 30 years have been dramatic. I also think you are right that significant cultural and legal changes require time and thoughtful dialogue and consideration and debate. We are having that when it comes to same-sex marriage and equal rights under the law for gay people generally. That's partly why we have this debate topic in this forum. I think that each significant cultural or social change needs to be debated on its own merits. I do think this debate is important to our society, so that we continue to live together in a civil way, without resort to violence. While I like in theory your proposal to remove all concrete legal and financial benefits from marriage and granting all benefits to every individual, I think it is politically unrealistic to expect this to happen. I think most Americans can and will come to accept same-sex couples being included under the umbrella of existing marriage laws. We have seen this happen in states where same-sex marriage has been legal for a period of time. People have come to accept this because legalizing same-sex marriage does not take away anything from opposite-sex couples in their marriages. It has no direct impact on them at all. I do not think most Americans would accept stripping all marriages of the benefits that married couples receive. That would be a huge change that would directly affect not just same-sex couples but all married couples.","gay-marriage","07:36 AM","gay-rights-debates","135"
