Their minds are not open,","jyoshu","408058","That describes everyone who staunchly argues something. You would not be here yourself if you didn't think you have the ""truth"" regarding the issues you argue for. Your mind is not open either. In a sense, the gay pride movement is the gay-pride proponent's dogma. You argue for it religiously. I find it amusing that sometimes people who argue against religious people try to portray them as close-minded, when that very thing describes both sides.","gay-marriage","09:49 AM","gay-rights-debates","92"

"07-22-2010","14376",7,"None","None","None","Ohioprof","408064","I do not believe I have the ""truth."" I believe I have an argument, a position. My position is at best partially true, or simply one angle, one view of the truth. I know my views are not shared by everyone. I argue my position with that understanding, and I accept that not everyone agrees with me. I accept that I do not have the whole of truth, and that my views are simply my interpretation of truth, as yours are your interpretation. I could be wrong, and I know this. In my view, we each have different understandings of truth, like the blind person touching part of the elephant. We grasp parts of the truth, never the whole of it, and we see always ""through a glass darkly,"" to quote 1 Corinthians 13 of the King James Bible. I do not argue ""religiously"" for same-sex marriage. I argue with personal conviction, because I believe that our society as a whole will be better when same-sex couples have equal marriage rights. My arguments are not based in religious belief or in a conviction that I have the ""truth."" My arguments are based on my reasoned opinion that to be a truly free and equal society, acting according to our founding principles in the Declaration of Independence, we should grant equal marriage rights to same-sex couples. I do not believe that God or a deity has declared this. I think we as Americans have based on republic on these ideals of universal liberty and equality.","gay-marriage","10:41 AM","gay-rights-debates","94"
"07-22-2010","14376",7,"jyoshu","408056","I think it matters at least culturally (which does affect the legal issue) because it speaks to the nature of the type of relationship . Like it or not, one type of relationship is how the human race procreates (even though there are inabilities sometimes within that type of relationship). It's not biologically compatible to do because it's not between a male and female. They are not the same. That's just reality, and reality is what it is. There's no escaping that on your part. One type of relationship (men and women as a couple) is how the human race procreates, anything else is not. It's no 'word game', it's reality. That there are older people/disabled/what-ever-exception-you-can-think-of doesn't change this. Those are still examples that fall under the category of a normal relationship for the human race.","Ohioprof","408065","""One type of relationship"" is actually not the only way the human race procreates. There have been different forms of marriage, including polygamous marriage, throughout human history. The human race does not necessarily procreate in any one social arrangement. The human race does procreate through intercourse, through the merging of sperm and egg, but the social form in which this occurs has varied through time and across cultures. Contemporary monogamous marriage is a common social form, but it is not and has never been the only social form in which procreation occurs. I have never argued that heterosexual couples are not a normal kind of relationship. They are. But they are not the only normal kind of relationship.","gay-marriage","10:46 AM","gay-rights-debates","95"

Sorry, that's just reality.","Ohioprof","408081","A couple is a social arrangement. You don't in fact need to be in a couple to procreate, unless you think of a couple as just two people having sex. Plenty of women have gotten pregnant during one-night stands, sometimes without ever knowing the name of the man involved. Do they qualify as a ""couple?"" You don't even need a man and a woman having sex for procreation to take place. You need only an egg and a sperm. It's true that it is rare for reproduction to occur without two people being present, but it can and does take place. Being a couple is a social arrangement, and being a monogamous married couple certainly is a social arrangement. Monogamous hetereosexual marriage is not and has never been the only social arrangement surrounding reproduction. You insist that there is a significant distinction between same-sex couple relationships, which are a social arrangement, and all opposite-sex relationships, whether the opposite-sex couples can or do reproduce biologically or not. Why is this? Why is this distinction, based on the sex of the partners, so fundamental and critical to you? Legal marriage does support the raising of children, and this is an important function of legal marriage. Same-sex couples do raise children together, just as opposite-sex couples do. It makes sense that same-sex couples should be able to protect their children just as opposite-sex couples can. This is to the benefit of the children. You do not argue that an opposite-sex couple with adopted children should not be permitted to marry simply because they cannot reproduce biologically. Why it is then defensible to argue that a same-sex couple with adopted children should not be permitted to marry simply because they cannot reproduce biologically? You are using a double-standard that is unfair not only to couples, but to their children, who end up losing the protection of having two married parents simply because other people don't like the sex of the two parents.","gay-marriage","11:42 AM","gay-rights-debates","101"

I understand that others will interpret the Declaration differently from the way I interpret it. I listen to those arguments and consider them. I have learned a lot from listening to people who disagree with me in these forums. It's impossible to engage in real discussion with someone who insists that he or she has the absolute ""truth.""

He was a deeply religious Christian, a man who embraced a pretty conservative faith. He told me years ago that he believed homosexuality is a sin, but he said that it was not for him to judge others. He said that was up to God, not him. He said that he always treated gay people with respect and without condemnation or judgment. Having known my uncle for many years, I can attest that this was true of him. I never experienced him treating gay people with anything but respect and care, just as he treated everyone else. Did my uncle try to convert me to believe that same-sex relationships are sin? No. Did I try to convert my uncle to believe that same-sex relationships are not sin? No. We accepted each other as we were. I tell this story to illustrate a point. I honestly do not care what other people think about sin. Their religious beliefs are their business, just as my religious beliefs are my business. I do care what other people do in society when it affects other people. I want to stop people from passing laws that discriminate against gay people. I want to ensure that gay people, and all people, are treated as equals under the law. That is my concern. I do not share many of the religious beliefs of my uncle, and it was never my concern or goal to get him to believe as I did. I think people should have, and do have, the right to believe that same-sex relationships are sinful or immoral. They should not have the right to impose those views on everyone else through laws or to push through laws that discriminate against gay people.","gay-marriage","12:07 PM","gay-rights-debates","104"

That is not the same as insisting that they have the ""truth."" Sometimes people argue that they have the ""truth,"" and sometimes people argue that their position will bring the most social benefit and is simply better policy. My view is the latter. I do not argue that my position is the ""truth."" The arguments against the ""ex-gay ministries"" are that they do harm to people who are vulnerable and who pay money for these efforts that do not work. It's an argument against the equivalent of quack medicine. At the very least, people should be alerted to the evidence, should be informed that these treatments do not work before they throw their money away. If people don't believe this, then it's up to them to make the decision about whether to go to the quack. If we inform gay people that the ex-gay ministries are quackery, then it's up to them to choose whether to go to the quacks. As for tolerance, I certainly tolerate people believing that same-sex relationships are sinful. That's fine with me. Gay people are not running around trying to squash the religious freedom of people who dislike them. I personally support religious liberty, being a religious person myself. Gay people and those who support equal rights are trying to ensure that people will not use the laws to squash the personal liberties and equal rights of gay people.","gay-marriage","12:20 PM","gay-rights-debates","105"
