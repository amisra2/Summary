Any time you think you can document a New Testament person, place, or event as fiction, then hop out here.

However, you should understand that under our system of government, the power comes from the people. My fight is not against you specifically, but against bigots who feel that they can use their personal religious beliefs to dictate what others may or may not do. If you find yourself included in that category, then theres nothing I can do to help you. No, again Easy...you fail the reading comprehension test. I used the word ""believe"", not proof or evidence. Likewise, you believe in the NT, yet you cannot furnish any proof or evidence in support of it. I have no reason to justify my beliefs to you. You have no right to dictate your beliefs to me. Do you see the difference?","gay-marriage","02:25 PM","gay-rights-debates","32"

And do you know that if enough Christians, Jews, and others decide to embrace and pass a Constitutional Amendment against, say, gay unions and gay marriages, that it's perfectly legal under our Constitution to do so, and that there's not a darn thing you can do about it? If you don't like what's being sent your way in these forums you can call the liberal politically correct thought police and see if they can help you. p.s.

That's the whole point. Don't give me your feeble attempts to turn this around on me. I am not pretentious enough to dictate to others what they may or may not do, with one exception; I will make it clear in no uncertain terms that they have absolutely no right to dictate what I may or may not do. That's not bigotry, that is respecting individual rights and freedoms. I will wait patiently while you look up the word ""respecting"" since you obviously have no grasp of what it means. Then do it already...oh wait...you tried. It seems that the idea has already been tried...with a republican president and a republican congress behind him...and it still came up short in the house by 54 votes. Did you ever stop to think that maybe people like you are the reason we have a constitution in the first place? I seem to remember something about constitutional amendments requiring 2/3 support in both houses of congress, and 3/4 support from the states. Yes, requiring 2/3 and 3/4 or ~66.66% and 75%. Hmmm, yes perhaps the constitution was set up to protect minority populations against bigotry and tyranny. I've tried, but the thought police told me that they don't arrest mentally challenged people as a rule.","gay-marriage","11:34 AM","gay-rights-debates","39"
