On Gay Marriage, Media Gives Obama a Pass - Yahoo! News This administration under my direction, has consistently said, we cannot discriminate as a country against people on the basis of sexual orientation What Ive seen happen over the last several years and what happened in New York last week I think was a good thing because what you saw was the people of New York having a debate, talking through these issues. It was contentious, it was emotional but ultimately they made a decision to recognize civil marriages. And I think thats exactly how things should work. And so I think it is important for us to work through these issues because each community is going to be different and each state is going to be different to work through them. In the meantime, we filed briefs before the Supreme Court that say any discrimination against gays, lesbians, transgenders is subject to heightened scrutiny and we dont think DOMA is unconstitutional (sic they do think DOMA is unconstitutional). So the combination of what states are doing, what the courts are doing, the actions were taking administratively, all are how the process should work I think what youre seeing is a profound recognition on the part of the American people that gays, lesbians and transgender persons are our brothers, our sisters, our children, our cousins, our friends, our co-workers and that theyve got to be treated like every other American. And I think that principle will win out.","Matthew S","448165","Here is the difference Every Republican presidential candidate wants gay marriage banned and gay people thrown into prison through the reinstatement of sodomy laws. They are very loud and clear on this point. They would put their personal opinions in to law that subjugate gay people. President Obama has said that he believes that marriage is between a man and a woman but he is not willing to put his personal beliefs into law. He has done everything he can to support the marriage equality position. He has said that he favors a system of strong civil unions. Besides if Obama wins reelection then he will come out for full marriage equality. No other president in US history has done more for the gay community the president Obama. He has been our strong advocate in the white house. The problem for you is that you fall on the side of imposing your moral views upon others and can not understand why someone would not want to. They don't give him a pass here is a quote from a press conference. http://www.queerty.com/obama-of-cour...mies-20110629/","gay-marriage-media-gives-obama-pass","06:20 AM","gay-rights-debates","192"

I, _______, pledge to the American people that if elected President, I will: One, support sending a federal constitutional amendment defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman to the states for ratification. Two, nominate to the U.S. Supreme Court and federal bench judges who are committed to restraint and to applying the original meaning of the Constitution, appoint an attorney general similarly committed, and thus reject the idea our Founding Fathers inserted a right to gay marriage into our Constitution. Three, defend the federal Defense of Marriage Act vigorously in court. Four, establish a presidential commission on religious liberty to investigate and document reports of American who have been harassed or threatened for exercising key civil rights to organize, to speak, to donate or to vote for marriage and to propose new protections, if need. Five, advance legislation to return to the people of the District of Columbia their right to vote on marriage.","Matthew S","448215","I hear the sound of the marching of the boots of the brown shirts every time I here any of the Republican candidates speak, even your precious Ron Paul. The Republican candidates all support the re-institution of sodomy laws. Rick Perry even supports the proposed Uganda law, his religion is supporting, that would not only imprison gays but execute them. But once again to the OP Obama is not given a pass on marriage equality it is just that he will never do anything to stop it and will help marriage equality become a reality. The republican candidates all will do everything in their power to stop marriage equality. Here is the pledge they signed http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2011/1...dge/?mobile=nc http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2011/0...rriage-pledge/","gay-marriage-media-gives-obama-pass","05:47 AM","gay-rights-debates","125"

It has happened before and can happen again. Do I need to remind you of the hundreds of thousands of native Americans that are dead at the hands of the US military or that the Japanese Americans dragged from their homes and locked away in concentration camps. An don't get me started on institution of slavery that was written into the constitution and lasted for over 80 years under that constitution. Yes these things happened here in the US and if they can happen once who knows what will happen to us.","gay-marriage-media-gives-obama-pass","09:12 PM","gay-rights-debates","116"
