"05-17-2010","13537",29,"gansao","402174","No its nothing like it. I really dont know why you think this. A black hetero couple would be no different than a white hetero couple but a gay couple will always be different than a hetero couple. I want to maintain my identity as a straight man and I want to maintain my marriage identity as a straight marriage just as I want to maintain my male identity within the marriage. I am Mr and my wife is Mrs. This reminds me of the erroneous arguments of some early feminist...wanting to be called' wimmin' but in this case it was to to disassociate themselves from men. The gay argument that they want to have their partnerships called marriage because if they dont they are discriminated against is quite ridiculous.","Addison48","402188","It is just like it. The only difference is one single variable. Why is a gay couple different from a straight couple? Why would gay people getting married cause you to not be able to maintain your identity as a straight man and maintain your marriage identity as a straight marriage? But yes it is discrimination. The Supreme Court has already ruled that a long time ago.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","08:57 PM","gay-rights-debates","422"

"05-17-2010","13537",29,"gansao","402078","Enlighten me JJ.Explain further...","jazyjason","402194","Essentially there are certain rights that a full marriage has that a civil partnership does not. Here is a quote outlining the basic differences. Difference Between Civil Union and Marriage - Civil Unions vs. Gay Marriage The Difference between Gay Marriage and Civil Unions by Kathy Belge You hear the politicians saying it all the time. I support Civil Unions, but not gay marriage. What exactly does this mean? Some even say they support equal rights for gays and lesbians, but not gay marriage. Is this possible? And why do gays and lesbians want marriage so badly when they can have civil unions? First of all, What is Marriage? When people marry, they tend to do so for reasons of loveand commitment. But marriage is also a legal status, which comes with rights and responsibilities. Marriage establishes a legal kinship between you and your spouse. It is a relationship that is recognized across cultures, countries and religions. What is a Civil Union? Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships exist in only a handful of places like New Jersey and Washington and Oregon. Vermont was the first state to create civil unions in 2000 to provide legal protections to gays and lesbians in relationships in that state because gay marriage is not an option. The protections do not extend beyond the border of Vermont and no federal protections are included with a Civil Union. Civil Unions offer some of the same rights and responsibilities as marriage, but only on a state level. What about Domestic partnership? Some states and municipalities have domestic partnership registries, but no domestic partnership law is the same. Some, like Oregon's domestic partnership law comes with many rights and responsibilities. Others offer very few benefits to the couple. What are some of the differences between Civil Unions and Gay Marriage? Recognition in other states: Even though each state has its own laws around marriage, if someone is married in one state and moves to another, their marriage is legally recognized. For example, Oregon marriage law applies to people 17 and over. In Washington state, the couple must be 18 to wed. However, Washington will recognize the marriage of two 17 year olds from Oregon who move there. This is not the case with Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships. If someone has a Domestic Partnership, that union is not recognized by some states and not others. Some states have even ruled that they do not have to recognize civil unions performed in other states, because their states have no such legal category. As gay marriages become legal in other states, this status may change. Immigration: A United States citizen who is married can sponsor his or her non-American spouse for immigration into this country. Those with Civil Unions have no such privilege. Taxes: Civil Unions are not recognized by the federal government, so couples would not be able to file joint-tax returns or be eligible for tax breaks or protections the government affords to married couples. Benefits: The General Accounting Office in 1997 released a list of 1,049 benefits and protections available to heterosexual married couples. These benefits range from federal benefits, such as survivor benefits through Social Security, sick leave to care for ailing partner, tax breaks, veterans benefits and insurance breaks. They also include things like family discounts, obtaining family insurance through your employer, visiting your spouse in the hospital and making medical decisions if your partner is unable to. Civil Unions protect some of these rights, but not all of them. But cant a lawyer set all this up for gay and lesbian couples? No. A lawyer can set up some things like durable power of attorney, wills and medical power of attorney. There are several problems with this, however. 1. It costs thousands of dollars in legal fees. A simple marriage license, which usually costs under $100 would cover all the same rights and benefits. 2. Any of these can be challenged in court. As a matter of fact, more wills are challenged than not. In the case of wills, legal spouses always have more legal power than any other family member. 3. Marriage laws are universal. If someones husband or wife is injured in an accident, all you need to do is show up and say youre his or her spouse. You will not be questioned. If you show up at the hospital with your legal paperwork, the employees may not know what to do with you. If you simply say, ""He's my husband,"" you will immediately be taken to your spouse's side. Defense of Marriage Law Even with lesbian and gay marriages being performed and recognized in some states, the Federal Defense of Marriage Law prohibits the federal government from recognizing gay and lesbian relationships. This puts gay and lesbian couples who are married in a legal limbo. How do they file their tax returns? Do they have to pay the tax on their partners health insurance? How do they fill out legal and other forms, single or married? Creating Civil Unions creates a separate and unequal status for some of Americas citizens. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial court ruled that creating a separate class for gay and lesbian citizens is not permissible and that is why they have voted that only marriage equals marriage. The precedent was set with Brown v. The Board of Education regarding segregation in public education. Ironically, Massachusetts marriage law went into effect on the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education. The United States Constitution guarantees equality for all. As you can see, marriage and civil unions are not the same. Creating equal access to marriage is the only fair way to ensure equality for gay and straight couples alike.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","09:18 PM","gay-rights-debates","425"

And gay marriage is then just institutionalized sin.","jazyjason","402195","Glad the Constitution isn't based off your crazy rhetoric....

"05-17-2010","13537",29,"Addison48","402170","They are not just labels. Marriage is an institution. Hell even the anti-gay marriage people agree with that. But can you give me an example of acceptable different labels? There was gay marriage in ancient Rome and Greece. There was also forms of gay marriage in Africa and Native America. However the Supreme Court did not say that marriage is fundamental to our existence and survival as a species. They said it was fundamental to our existence and survival as a nation. In fact marriage didnt exist when man first walked the earth and is bad for our survival in that instance. And this has nothing to do with political correctness and everything to do with equality under the law. See above for the existence and survival thing. Investing in their offspring does not mean monogamy. It just means taking care of the kid they had. They can still sleep with other women and have kids with them and then invest in their offspring with the other woman as well. Basically its a cost benefit analysis. Females are more likely to be monogamous while males arnt. And in todays society monogamy is kind of going away. Homosexuals do raise children however and we dont live in the stone age anymore. Marriage has always changed and so have we. Marriage is a legal contract between two people to provide benefits to the couple that are relevant to monogamous couples. Nothing more. That is all marriage is legally. And homosexual couples can benefit from those benefits just like straight couples can. So yes homosexual attractions have the same amount of significance as heterosexual attractions and homosexual relationships should be legally equal to heterosexual relationships if we want to live in a country were all are equal under the law.","Sigma","402196","Well, the examples I've already given are ""black"" and ""white"" as labels for races. ""Gay"" and ""straight"" are labels. Legally speaking, the word ""marriage"" refers to a pooling of assets. Tbh, I'm not sure what is meant by calling it an ""institution"". As we've established, equality already exists. The fact that no one can wear goth shirts is equal treatment, even if it impacts those who want to wear goth shirts more than those who don't. If you would, what did the court mean by the ""survival of the nation""? Ancient Rome and Greek treatment of homosexuality does not really help your case. The Lex Scantinia is the first instance of recorded Roman law that regulated sexual behavior which including pederasty, adultery and passivity and potentially legislating the death penalty for homosexual behavior among free-borns (slaves could be used for any sexual activity, it seems, and frequently were used for homosexual sex). Even the Roman philosopher Gaius Musonius Rufu, who expressed progressive views on women becoming philosophers, described homosexuality as ""against nature"" even though he seemed to consider adultery as the most illicit of sexual activity. Of course, the Roman idea of masculinity was associated with penetrative sex. A free-born who was penetrated had been ""feminized"". In Craig Williams' book ""Roman Homosexuality"", he describes a court case of a Roman soldier from an author of the era: This soldier had been propositioned by his tribune, a relative of the commander Marius, during the war against the Cimbri in 104 B.C.; not only did he reject the tribune's advances, but he killed him in outrage, and despite the fact that the dead man was his relative, Marius ruled that it was a case of justifiable homicide. Defending the soldier's action, the speaker in Calpurnius' declamation first poses a rhetorical question to the slain tribune: ""Is he not yet a man to you, though he is already one of Marius' soldiers?"". That is, the speaker is arguing that, in trying to violate the soldier's sexual integrity, the tribune had disregarded his manhood. Among the free-born, being penetrated was disgraceful in a man. Homosexual relationships, then, could not enjoy equality with heterosexual relationships. It is a cost-benefit analysis. A male only has so much investment he can spread around. While both sexes have a genetic incentive to commit adultery, they also have a strong genetic incentive to ensure their partner is monogamous. A male would not wish to waste investment on another man's child and a woman would not want her mate to invest in another woman's child. Thus, monogamy would be selected for over evolutionary time while adultery would be an opportunistic strategy in a similar way rape is an opportunistic strategy. A woman who has a mate that has indescriminate sexual appetites gains less investment in her children and thus her and that male's reproductive fitness is reduced. A woman who is in a life-long monogamous relationship maximizes the survival of her own offspring and the offspring of that male. The ideal situation for the male is to commit adultery in secret and have another male raise his mistress's children while he raises his wife's. The ideal situation for a woman is to have a male that will invest in her children and no one else's even if the children are not his. The ideal situation for the couple is to be in a life-long monogamous relationship where their genetic interests are tied up in their common children. Marriage means more than that to most people, I daresay, though I agree that is all it is legally. Any two people can stand to gain from marriage benefits. Heck, when you strip any meaning from ""marriage"", why are there any restrictions at all? Why are there age limits? Why are there species limits? Why is it limited to couples only? The reason there are limits is that marriage is meaningful to us. When you change that meaning you will meet resistance. Heterosexual attraction is the basis of reproduction. That is significant. Homosexual attraction is not the basis of reproduction. It cannot have the same significance.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","09:22 PM","gay-rights-debates","427"

Just because you base your means on what is value due to reproduction does not make the attraction and love of a homosexual any less than that of a strait person.... NOT all strait people engage in sex to procreate. Would you then say that their relationships and unions are thus less significant than to those who only engage in intercourse for procreation? Or would you deem that because they ARE strait that they are then capable of procreation that then their unions are thus protected.... And of course then leave out the homosexuals because we cannot ""procreate."" In case you forgot we are all capable of procreating Sigma. Many older Gay men have sons, and daughters from previous marriages before they came out. I know one in particular that has a son.... I also know a Lesbian coworker that has 3 sons one whom is gay.... from a previous marriage...
