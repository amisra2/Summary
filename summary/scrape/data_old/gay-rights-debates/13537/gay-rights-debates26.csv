Try again. What did I actually contend was nothing like segregation not what you thought I did.

"05-09-2010","13537",26,"Easyrider","400900","Absolutely! Do you know who Jesus is, Matthew? Jesus is God (many scriptures). As God, then he is the one who gave Moses the commandments against gay sex (Lev. 18:22; 20:13, Romans 1:26-27, etc.), and against shacking up. He's also the one who inspires all scriptures, which includes I Corinthians 6:9-10 and Jude 7. Jesus is also the same God who helps create life in a mother's womb (Psalm 139:13) that the liberals love to refer to the abortionist for termination. Jesus (and not politically-correct pro-gay teachers) is the one who defines sin. Jesus is the one who grants salvation that others think they can earn by their own perceived goodness. Jesus is the one who said a man shall reap what he sows, as opposed to the liberal's redistribution of wealth scheme (a concept centered in greed for other people's money where people reap what others sow). And Jesus is the one who, in the end, will bring judgment (vs. the liberal's endless windjamming at the U.N.) on the ungodly in the Book of Revelation. And, of course, there's more, but that's for starters. Jesus is the Great God Almighty.","jazyjason","400932","Yawn..... Such a proclamation of love coming from such a hating venom spewing person.... Your hypocrisy knows no bounds...","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","03:03 PM","gay-rights-debates","379"

LOL! Then why did he destroy them? Let me give you a clue: Romans 1:26-27 - ""Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion."" 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - ""Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God."" But unless you repent, you too will all perish. - Luke 13:3","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","07:22 AM","gay-rights-debates","388"
