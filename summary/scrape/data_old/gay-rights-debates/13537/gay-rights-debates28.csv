Will you' garry' me? Sounds snappy","Addison48","402080","Well separate isnt equal. I wouldnt mind letting religion have the word marriage and the government have civil unions to where both straight and gay couples have civil unions and if you want to go to a church to get married then you can.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","04:52 AM","gay-rights-debates","407"

"05-17-2010","13537",28,"Addison48","402068","Those bubbles in applications are not institutions. They arnt anything except a way to gather information about a person. There has been gay marriage in the past in certain countries. I personally would have to say the freedom to express yourself would be about as equal to having your relationship legitimized. But im not saying we need to throw out what we traditionally consider marriage just because it is a tradition. We need to change marriage in America to include same sex couples because that is the right thing to do. And I would say marriage is a right and the Supreme Court agrees. They consider it part of the 14th amendment. It was in the quote I posted. Why is that an important variable? Marriage is not necessary to our survival. In fact I would argue that monogamy is bad for the survival of our species earlier on. And it doesnt really matter if gender is rooted in biology and race isnt. We dont exclude people from getting married to certain people based on biology.","Sigma","402125","They're labels. Different labels for different people. The fact that the labels are different does not imply that they are unequal. The ""separate but equal"" criticism is not compelling when there are examples of acceptable instances of different labels. Consideration of gay couples as equal to heterosexual couples has been a recent phenomenon. Marriage has historically been between heterosexual individuals. As you have said: marriage has been fundamental to our very existence and survival. To change marriage seems, with this context, like crafting pants to put on the statue of David to satisfy political correctness. Almost an offensive notion. Consider the reasoning given in the decision. Marriage is one of the ""basic civil rights of man,"" fundamental to our very existence and survival . Why is marriage fundamental to our existence and survival? When you changed that ""variable"", would marriage still serve that purpose? I daresay it would not. That is why that variable is important. The decision you are quoting lists marriage as fundamental to our survival. Monogamy is actually rooted in our biology as well. While it is true that the genetic economics of sex predict that both sexes have a genetic incentive to commit adultery, the male of our species differs from most other mammals in a crucial way: men invest in their offspring rather than leaving all the investing to the female. Certainly the investment is unequal, but the males investment is greater than zero, which means that women should compete over males most likely to invest in offspring , rather than those who are the most willing to mate. On the flip side, a male has emotions designed to prevent his wife from having another man's child since he would then be investing in genes that have usurped the place of his own. A woman's jealousy is tilted toward preventing the alienation of a man's affections, since that is a sign that the male would be investing in another woman's children at the expense of her own. Both, then, have an interest in keeping their mate monogamous. The ideal condition is for a couple to marry for life, be perfectly monogamous, and favor their nuclear family above each spouses extended family. Their genetic interests are then identical, tied up in the single basket containing their children. Under this idealization, the love between a man and a woman should be the strongest emotional bond in the living world and for some lucky couples it is. It is really no surprise that infidelity, stepchildren, and in-laws are among the main causes of marital strife. These emotions evolved to serve a purpose, and this is including love. While treating individuals as sinful and discriminating against them for something they cannot control is abhorrent in our society, heterosexual attraction has significance that homosexual attraction does not. The relationships are not equal, and I am not convinced they should be given equal legal weight.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","11:41 AM","gay-rights-debates","412"

Hell even the anti-gay marriage people agree with that. But can you give me an example of acceptable different labels? There was gay marriage in ancient Rome and Greece. There was also forms of gay marriage in Africa and Native America. However the Supreme Court did not say that marriage is fundamental to our existence and survival as a species. They said it was fundamental to our existence and survival as a nation. In fact marriage didnt exist when man first walked the earth and is bad for our survival in that instance. And this has nothing to do with political correctness and everything to do with equality under the law. See above for the existence and survival thing. Investing in their offspring does not mean monogamy. It just means taking care of the kid they had. They can still sleep with other women and have kids with them and then invest in their offspring with the other woman as well. Basically its a cost benefit analysis. Females are more likely to be monogamous while males arnt. And in todays society monogamy is kind of going away. Homosexuals do raise children however and we dont live in the stone age anymore. Marriage has always changed and so have we. Marriage is a legal contract between two people to provide benefits to the couple that are relevant to monogamous couples. Nothing more. That is all marriage is legally. And homosexual couples can benefit from those benefits just like straight couples can. So yes homosexual attractions have the same amount of significance as heterosexual attractions and homosexual relationships should be legally equal to heterosexual relationships if we want to live in a country were all are equal under the law.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","05:19 PM","gay-rights-debates","417"

A black hetero couple would be no different than a white hetero couple but a gay couple will always be different than a hetero couple. I want to maintain my identity as a straight man and I want to maintain my marriage identity as a straight marriage just as I want to maintain my male identity within the marriage. I am Mr and my wife is Mrs. This reminds me of the erroneous arguments of some early feminist...wanting to be called' wimmin' but in this case it was to to disassociate themselves from men. The gay argument that they want to have their partnerships called marriage because if they dont they are discriminated against is quite ridiculous.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","05:31 PM","gay-rights-debates","420"
