This country has a heritage based in Judeo-Christian principles. Traditional marriage was always ok with God and our founding fathers, and gay marriage never was with either. Sure we do, on occasion. America is 70-80% Christian, and when we vote on issues like gay marriage, we often take our religious beliefs to the ballot box. Which is why gay marriage loses. And if someday there's enough of us to make America into a Christian nation via a Constitutional Amendment, we can do that too (though no one I know is really thinking seriously about doing that). We certainly aren't a secular nation. And unless we want to lose America we need to keep God as our Lord and Protector.

It influences my vote and the votes of many others. To say it doesn't is totally naive. 'Separation of church and state' isn't in the Constitution. And a good number of our founding fathers believed that religious principles were a solid foundation for our laws. For instance, James Wilson, one of the original Supreme Court Justices, and a signer of the Constitution, explained, ""Human law must rest its authority ultimately upon the authority of that law which is divine.....Far from being rivals or enemies, religion and law are twin sisters, friends, and mutual assistants...."" Concerning the outcome of the American Revolution, John Quincy Adams noted, ""The highest glory won from the American Revolution was this: it connected, in one indissoluble bond, the principles of civil government with the principles of Christianity."" In a letter to Thomas Jefferson dated June 28, 1813, John Adams wrote: ""The general principles on which the (founding) fathers achieved independence were....the general principles of Christianity."" Founding father Noah Webster proclaimed much the same message when he said, ""The religion which has introduced civil liberty is the religion of Christ and His Apostles....This is genuine Christianity and to this we owe our free constitutions of government"" (History of the United States, 1832). Did you know many of the founding fathers (including Thomas Jefferson) attended church services in government buildings, and church services continued in government buildings up to and shortly after the Civil War? They didn't teach you that in SECULAR GOVERNMENT CLASSES, did they? Did anyone on the liberal left tell you about that? If not, why not? So, the founding fathers had a completely different view of religious freedom in the public square than many people do today. It works both ways, Addison. In the US Supreme Court decision Abington School District v. Schempp, 374, US 203, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 (1963) Justice Clark stated: "" The State may not establish a 'religion of secularism' in the sense of affirmatively opposing or showing hostility to religion, thus 'preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do believe.' We voted gay marriage down and many of us did it based on our personal religious beliefs. You need to acknowledge something, Addison: There's more of us Christians than there are of you secularists, and a great many of us vote based on our religious beliefs.

So no religion doesnt have a thing to do with laws in this country. You are correct separation of church and state isnt in the constitution. The phrase originated in Thomas Jefferson's 1802 letter to the Baptist Association of Danbury. Where did the phrase ""separation of church and state"" originate? But the 1st amendment does say this. Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. So Thomas Jefferson coined the term and even though the exact words separation of church and state doesnt appear however the same basic idea does exist in the constitution. I knew about them holding religious services in government buildings. However that doesnt mean its ok. Your right they cant prefer no religion over religion and I never claimed that. If you voted gay marriage down because of your religion then you are in the wrong. You are keeping us from gaining equality because of your religious beliefs and that is wrong. You do not have the right to deny me equality. Now having said all that I dont want to debate separation of church and state. I want to debate on if gay marriage should be legal or not.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","08:48 PM","gay-rights-debates","282"

I have the right to vote according to my beliefs all day long, and I've done it. We just did vote to outlaw gay marriage. So you can't say we can't do it.

Nor is pedophilia or polygamy. I'm sure they think they have their rights too. See above. People vote against gay marriage in election after election, and so far no one has said they can't do that. So you're contention that gay marriage is a right doesn't fly with the majority of Americans, or the Constitution. Here's what God says about gay sex: Leviticus 18:22 - ""Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable."" Leviticus 20:13 - ""If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads."" Romans 1:26-27 - ""Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion."" 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - ""Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God."" 1 Timothy 1:8-10 - But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine Jude 7 In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. There's no gay marriages in the Old Testament; No gay marriages in the New Testament; no gay sex approved anywhere in the Bible. Just the opposite - gay sex is condemned in both testaments. God is consistent on that. And to close: Whosoever shall be guilty of Rape, Polygamy, or Sodomy with man or woman shall be punished, if a man, by castration, if a woman, by cutting thro' the cartilage of her nose a hole of one half inch diameter at the least. - Thomas Jefferson, Amendment VIII: A Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","05:10 PM","gay-rights-debates","523"

If you would, what did the court mean by the ""survival of the nation""? Ancient Rome and Greek treatment of homosexuality does not really help your case. The Lex Scantinia is the first instance of recorded Roman law that regulated sexual behavior which including pederasty, adultery and passivity and potentially legislating the death penalty for homosexual behavior among free-borns (slaves could be used for any sexual activity, it seems, and frequently were used for homosexual sex). Even the Roman philosopher Gaius Musonius Rufu, who expressed progressive views on women becoming philosophers, described homosexuality as ""against nature"" even though he seemed to consider adultery as the most illicit of sexual activity. Of course, the Roman idea of masculinity was associated with penetrative sex. A free-born who was penetrated had been ""feminized"". In Craig Williams' book ""Roman Homosexuality"", he describes a court case of a Roman soldier from an author of the era: This soldier had been propositioned by his tribune, a relative of the commander Marius, during the war against the Cimbri in 104 B.C.; not only did he reject the tribune's advances, but he killed him in outrage, and despite the fact that the dead man was his relative, Marius ruled that it was a case of justifiable homicide. Defending the soldier's action, the speaker in Calpurnius' declamation first poses a rhetorical question to the slain tribune: ""Is he not yet a man to you, though he is already one of Marius' soldiers?"". That is, the speaker is arguing that, in trying to violate the soldier's sexual integrity, the tribune had disregarded his manhood. Among the free-born, being penetrated was disgraceful in a man. Homosexual relationships, then, could not enjoy equality with heterosexual relationships. It is a cost-benefit analysis. A male only has so much investment he can spread around. While both sexes have a genetic incentive to commit adultery, they also have a strong genetic incentive to ensure their partner is monogamous. A male would not wish to waste investment on another man's child and a woman would not want her mate to invest in another woman's child. Thus, monogamy would be selected for over evolutionary time while adultery would be an opportunistic strategy in a similar way rape is an opportunistic strategy. A woman who has a mate that has indescriminate sexual appetites gains less investment in her children and thus her and that male's reproductive fitness is reduced. A woman who is in a life-long monogamous relationship maximizes the survival of her own offspring and the offspring of that male. The ideal situation for the male is to commit adultery in secret and have another male raise his mistress's children while he raises his wife's. The ideal situation for a woman is to have a male that will invest in her children and no one else's even if the children are not his. The ideal situation for the couple is to be in a life-long monogamous relationship where their genetic interests are tied up in their common children. Marriage means more than that to most people, I daresay, though I agree that is all it is legally. Any two people can stand to gain from marriage benefits. Heck, when you strip any meaning from ""marriage"", why are there any restrictions at all? Why are there age limits? Why are there species limits? Why is it limited to couples only? The reason there are limits is that marriage is meaningful to us. When you change that meaning you will meet resistance. Heterosexual attraction is the basis of reproduction. That is significant.

The ideal situation for the male is to commit adultery in secret and have another male raise his mistress's children while he raises his wife's. The ideal situation for a woman is to have a male that will invest in her children and no one else's even if the children are not his. The ideal situation for the couple is to be in a life-long monogamous relationship where their genetic interests are tied up in their common children. Marriage means more than that to most people, I daresay, though I agree that is all it is legally. Any two people can stand to gain from marriage benefits. Heck, when you strip any meaning from ""marriage"", why are there any restrictions at all? Why are there age limits? Why are there species limits? Why is it limited to couples only? The reason there are limits is that marriage is meaningful to us. When you change that meaning you will meet resistance. Heterosexual attraction is the basis of reproduction. That is significant. Homosexual attraction is not the basis of reproduction. It cannot have the same significance.","Addison48","402214","Black and white or gay and straight are indeed labels.

Not really. Schools ban certain clothing all the time and can even restrict clothing to only one style. I find nothing wrong with that. On a national level it still would not be wrong, though this is a value judgement and would vary person to person. Clothing just isn't very important to me. However, it would be unconstitutional and therefore I would not accept such a restriction even if I did not care what the restriction was. There was only heterosexual marriage. Homosexual liasons were allowed with slaves because slaves were considered acceptable sexual objects (no matter the gender), but any free-born Roman besides his wife was off-limits. To further complicate matters, freed-men and -women (as opposed to free-born) occupied a third level of sexual allowance. Those who freed them were considered to be ""owed"" a duty (which may have included sexual services), but were off-limits to everyone else as a free-born would be. Also, if a free-born man was penetrated even by a slave that man was considered degenerate. A ""real man"" only penetrated others. True homosexual relationships did not openly exist. Time and effort, money and resources. When you raise a child you invest your time, effort and money into that child. Of course they would still apply. Who cares if those involved are in love or not? It's just a contract between any two people. If I want my best friend to inherit or to make medical decisions, I could marry them. I don't have to actually have any romantic feelings, since it's just a contract. Age of consent is a legal construct just as marriage is. We can change that As for animals, who cares if they can consent? They're animals, not people. The big deal is basically what you've said in this post. Marriage is meaningful. It has been a custom that has not included homosexual people (with rare if any exceptions). You want to change that meaning, this custom. When you change the meaning of something that is actually very meaningful to a great deal of people don't be surprised if you tick off a portion of that population. If your dad took you for walks through a certain park and then died, and you wanted to do the same with your children only someone wants to come in and turn it into a strip mall wouldn't you try to stop them? Your confusing two different points. I said heterosexual attraction is the basis for reproduction. This is true whether or not any particular couple reproduces. Though while we're on the point: Evolution requires reproduction. Any particular person who does not reproduce is an evolutionary dead end, regardless of sexual orientation.

If you will excuse using you as an example: Marriage is not denied to you, if you accept the restrictions on the choice of partner. Similarly, if I wished qualify for veteren benefits I would have to serve my country. Neither of us have a right to these benefits, we have to qualify for them. No, I'm saying that I think a majority of people view heterosexual attraction as somehow more valid, or at least different in a significant way, because that type of relationship has the capability to produce children. Imo, resistance to the idea of changing the custom of marriage is an expression of this belief that heterosexual relationships are different in some significant way. I think that is a valid belief to have, and I mourn that it is commonly disregarded as unimportant by gay-rights proponents. Heterosexual relationships are the only type of relationship that can produce children. This is true even if a percentage are unable to have children or are voluntarily childless. As I said, it doesn't matter whether any particular person or couple can have children, it is the type of relationship or sexual behavior that I'm concerned with. Couples don't have rights, individuals do. Unmarried people don't have marriage benefits because they are not married. Unmarried individuals do not qualify for marriage benefits in a similar way that I do not qualify for veteren benefits. I do not have a right to marriage benefits if unmarried. I do not have a right to veteren benefits if not a veteren. Unmarried people, gay or straight, are not denied any rights because they are not married (at least, they better not be denied any rights). Granted, homosexual people cannot marry whom they love. That is tragic, and I truly sympathize. But speaking about marriage in terms of rights is, imo, erroneous. Love is not a right (at least, not one the gov't can help with). Loving whom you are married to is not a right.

Heterosexuals can marry for love, they can marry for political reasons, they can marry for the benefits, they can marry for whatever reason under the sun. The legal requirements of marriage have nothing to do with the reasons to marry. The historic and cultural meaning of marriage can say which reason is more or less valid, but not the legal requirements. Seeing ""your unborn children in her eyes"", for example, is a culturally valid reason to get married, but it certainly is not one of the legal requirements. I realize that homosexuals are not attracted to members of the opposite sex and so they don't want to get married. However , that is not the same thing as being legally barred from marriage. Since we're talking about what rights heterosexual people have versus what rights homosexual people have, the only logical conclusion is that both groups have the same rights since marrying whomever you love is not a right. Yes. Marrying whomever you are romantically attracted to is not a right for either heterosexual people or homosexual people.
