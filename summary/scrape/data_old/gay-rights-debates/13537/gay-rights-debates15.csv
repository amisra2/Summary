"11-19-2009","13537",15,"gayhumanist","379245","You're being ridiculous. An equally good argument.. Because I wasn't making the argument that it wasn't natural. I don't think it's unnatural. I wasn't comaring homosexuality to anything. I was saying how can these people, often religious(believers in the supernatural), use ""unnaturalness"" as an attempted criticism. .. You have yet to show how homosexuals do what is different from what heterosexuals do. Yes, we know the couple are the same sex, physically. A noun is different from a verb.","gansao","379252","To say that we would not have computers without I individual is ridiculous. To say that I am being ridiculous is also ridiculous. So you have two ridiculouses to my nil ..gayhumanist..Is unnatural wrong? Isn't a virgin birth unnatural? How about a resurrection? Is the Kraft cheese that I am eating, unnatural? Hasn't got the same ring, has it? A man having sex with his daughter does exactly what he may do to his wife. Is he not perverted?","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","03:33 PM","gay-rights-debates","213"

"11-20-2009","13537",15,"gansao","379241","What seperates homosexuals and normal people is deviant sex...","jazyjason","379329","Always comparing gay people to what they do in the bedroom, not what deifines them in life or the dynamic of their relationships with their partners... Wonderful. Anything else you want to add to your prejudiced statement? Let me tell you something. Maybe it is of interest maybe not at least to you. MY partner called me today from Basic Training for about five minutes today. He informed me that he passed his final PFA and would be running the final test of Battlestations tonight. He is actually doing that right now as I type this. We spoke briefly but our words struck each other to the deepest part of our hearts. We love each other and you know what is really the crack in your argument? We have never had sex. Never. Not once. Funny is it not? That you claim that all of our relationships revolve around ""deviant sex"" and the like. our relationship is not set based upon the carnal, otherwise we would not be together. It is based upon a deeper mutual understanding. As a matter of fact, we are not rushing the physical part of our relationship at all! We would rather develop our hearts and connect to each other more in a spiritual sense than anything else. The physical expression of ones love is not the defining expression of ones love! It is rather a compliment to the spiritual to the deeper sense. It is a physical gesture if you will to the deeper kindred spirit of two people. SO I can personally say that your argument is flawed, and so flawed that not only do you base the love of others based upon only one element of a relationship, but you do so to the detrement of an entire group of people...","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","02:52 AM","gay-rights-debates","216"

Do you say this to heteors that tell you they are getting married?","Archangel","379471","Why is it that all of you homosexuals perceive our opposition to your defense of that which is unnatural and goes against what is universally known to be sexually healthy and normal activities, must translate to a personal hatred for individual homosexuals? We oppose what you represent as a sexual proclivity which since the beginning of time has been considered wrong and unnatural by almost every civilization which has ever existed on earth. But just to clarify how warped, irrational and distorted your rationale is here, let's look at what gansao actually said which prompted you to accuse him of hating gay people so much. Here it is for you Matthew: {gansao said} I think that you should be allowed to enjoy each other for as long as you wish, without fear or impediment. I do not think that you should be able to 'marry' So, from this opinion which states his agreement in your right to exist, your right to follow your hearts desire, and your right to have life long sexual relationships with members of your own gender, you interpret that sentiment as one of hatred for all gay people? And you wonder why we clarify so often that your thinking is disturbed, warped and reprobate in its rationality?

Society has never opposed a group's equality, with no rational reason, when that reason isn't hate, insecurity, fear. And it isn't long when debating with opponents that their hatred comes out very blantantly. Archangel's argument is laughable. He says they don't hate us as individuals, just everything we represent as being wrong, unnatural etc. That boils down to the same thing! Gansao condescends to us by calling us spoiled children because the majority group with power won't ""let us have"", what they have.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","02:37 PM","gay-rights-debates","225"
