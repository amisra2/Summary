You jumped in with your size twos with a little rant that had nothing to do with my post Shooter..It's everything like racial segregation and every kind of segregation throughout the course of history. Every time prejudice/racism/sexism/anti-semetism/homophobia/etc. is challenged the perpetrators always claim ""this is nothing like the last"". But it always is. This is no exception. When I told you that was not what I contended you proceeded to tell that I 'implied' this . I did not . You were wrong and you would not admit it. This is not the first time that you have done this.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","01:52 PM","gay-rights-debates","393"

In addition, gay marriage, according to the Word of God, is a perversion and an abomination, and should not be legalized. Most blacks don't buy your racial segregation argument either. They were the deciding factor in gay marriage failing in California. Being born black isn't a sin or an ungodly behavior. Dropping trou for illicit gay sex is.

In this issue, it would be a single water fountain that white people call one thing and black people call something else. So, no, the ""separate but equal"" argument does not apply well at all. If the rights you recieve are the same, it's the same thing. It doesn't matter what you call it.

Your right having separate institution would give the same privileges but then again the water from the water fountains for black people came from the same source as the water from the water fountains for white people. Or instead lets just change one variable here. Instead of having separate institutions for gay or straight couples why not have separate institutions for each race or interracial couples?","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","07:41 PM","gay-rights-debates","398"

I'm saying there is only one fountain. Currently, everyone is allowed to drink at the fountain (with a member of the opposite sex, limited to two people over the age of consent that are not closely related). Some people do not wish to accept these limitations and, therefore, do not drink at the fountain. To further the analogy, some have proposed that if you want to drink at the fountain without some of those limitations you have to call it something besides a ""fountain"" when you're drinking from it. The ""separate but equal"" argument has almost no application to this issue.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","07:55 PM","gay-rights-debates","400"

People are asking why civil unions arent ok with gay people because civil unions provide the equal benefits even if they are separate institutions. If we banned all gothic clothes so no one could wear gothic styled clothes it would only effect those who wanted to wear those clothes. Everyone would still technically have the right to wear the same clothes of other styles so everyone would be technically equal. Yet wouldnt banning a certain style of clothing that harms no one be wrong? Edit: It has been stated that since gay people can get married but to people of the opposite sex then they still have the same rights but then couldnt that be said of interracial couples too? Lets put it this way. Gay couples have the same rights as straight couples because they can get married to a member of the opposite sex but not the member of the same sex. Interracial couples have the same rights as non-interracial couples because they can get married to a member of the same race but not a member of the opposite race. See the similarities? Ever heard of Loving vs Virginia? Basically everything that was said there could apply to gay people as well. This is what the Supreme Court said about interracial marriage. Marriage is one of the ""basic civil rights of man,"" fundamental to our very existence and survival.... To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State's citizens of liberty without due process of law. The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discrimination. Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State. Now lets just change one variable. Marriage is one of the ""basic civil rights of man,"" fundamental to our very existence and survival....

To me, it would be similar to marking ""white"" or ""black"" in the race section on an application. Is it racist because there are separate-but-equal bubbles on an application for different races? I suppose it could be argued that is the case but, to me, it would be a silly argument. Certainly the label 'marriage' has historic and cultural significance but that has never included gay people (since, historically, they have not been married). By the same token, you cannot give white people the historic and cultural heritage of black people by calling white people ""black"". It just doesn't work that way. Putting aside whether that is ""right"" or ""wrong"" (since those are value judgements), we would have to reiterate some of what you've posted. It would be equal treatment . Certainly it would impact individuals who want to wear those clothes more than those who don't. The impact of losing the freedom to wear what you wish is a small one, while the impact of not having your relationship viewed as legitimate is large. This is why it's argued so passionately. Certainly I believe having more freedom rather than less is generally a good thing, but that is not to say that we should throw out all that is traditional merely because it is traditional. But is it right or wrong? Giving gay relationships the legitimacy they crave would be a good thing to do, and some way to accomplish this ought to be found. I don't think it is required of us under law, and certainly I think claiming it as a right created more anti-gay sentiment than would otherwise exist. Even putting aside the applicability of that decision beyond the intended scope, that's an important variable. Can you imagine why marriage is fundamental to our existence and survival, as a species? Race is something of an artificial construct where gender is rooted in biology. I think I do, and I absolutely sympathize. I don't think gay people are intrinsically evil or sinful, and there is nothing wrong with loving someone of the same gender. I know I probably seem bigotted and hateful when I say that there are valid differences between heterosexual and homosexual attraction, and I apologize if I offend you :-\","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","08:28 PM","gay-rights-debates","402"

They arnt anything except a way to gather information about a person. There has been gay marriage in the past in certain countries. I personally would have to say the freedom to express yourself would be about as equal to having your relationship legitimized. But im not saying we need to throw out what we traditionally consider marriage just because it is a tradition. We need to change marriage in America to include same sex couples because that is the right thing to do. And I would say marriage is a right and the Supreme Court agrees. They consider it part of the 14th amendment. It was in the quote I posted. Why is that an important variable? Marriage is not necessary to our survival. In fact I would argue that monogamy is bad for the survival of our species earlier on. And it doesnt really matter if gender is rooted in biology and race isnt. We dont exclude people from getting married to certain people based on biology. No you certainly dont seem bigoted or hateful at all. You just have a different opinion. And I do agree that homosexual relationships are slightly different from heterosexual relationships. The only people that really offend me are the ones who claim gay people are bad people or other things along that nature. But I must say again I am really bad with words so if I dont quite understand what you are saying or say something that doesn't quite make sense I apologize and ask you to be patient.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","02:12 AM","gay-rights-debates","403"
