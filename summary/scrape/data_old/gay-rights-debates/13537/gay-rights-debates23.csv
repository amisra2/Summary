Many people choose to have a religious ceremony to celebrate their marriage but that doesnt make it a religious institution. Need proof? You can get married without the permission of the church but you cant get married without the permission of the government. And because marriage is a government institution then they cannot discriminate against same sex couples and must provide the same benefits to them as is provided to straight couples. And it cannot be a separate institution either because separate is not equal. But as I have already said this shouldnt be up for a vote. Civil rights never should be.","Lurch907","400279","This isn't even remotely true. Two people can go to a church and marry without the permission of government, or not go to a church, they can go out in the woods and shout ""I'm married"". I don't know about you, but the government doesn't determine who I'm married too. What the government can do, subject to the will of the people, is decide which marriages it will recognize. And upon what grounds do you base this claim? Government chooses not to recognize different types of marriages all the time, not just same sex marriages ie. polygamist marriages, relatives, age limits, etc. These recognitions are not only federal but vary state to state, for instance some states recognize 1st cousin marriages while others don't, as I recall, the age of consent to marry also differs among states. While I agree that civil rights should not be up for vote, you have not given evidence that gov't recognition of marriage is a civil right.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","05:27 PM","gay-rights-debates","331"

It doesnt say man and goldfish but I would never be able to marry my pet carp. There are plenty of couples with an equal chance of producing a handicapped child as an incestuous couple..they are still allowed to stay married. Marriage in ancient Rome really has no bearing on modern day marriage. Addison, I am not against gay marriages...not because of gay rights or because Rome or ancient Greece allowed it. We in Britain have had gay marriages for a while and it has made no difference to anyone in Britain except gay people...the sky hasnt fallen on top of us...so why should I object?","Addison48","400281","How is there plenty of couples who have an equal chance of producing a handicapped child as an incestuous couple? I personally dont care too much if family members want to get married. I think it has a bearing on marriage today. Only in the sense that it shows that gay marriage has existed in history and hasnt always been between a man and a women as is falsely claimed. If you are not against gay marriages then what is this argument about exactly? Do you have an objection to gay marriage?","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","05:37 PM","gay-rights-debates","332"

My point was that you have no more right to marriage as these people.","Addison48","400282","Technically marriage isnt a right that is correct but that also goes for heterosexual marriage. And due to the fact that all people must be treated equally under the law because heterosexuals can get married then so must homosexuals be allowed to get married.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","05:39 PM","gay-rights-debates","333"

As I have said many times before I would be alright with marriage being limited to breeding age heteros because it would then exclude heteros also. However as long as non breeding heteros, and heteros past breeding age can get married then gay people must have that option also.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","05:48 PM","gay-rights-debates","334"

You cannot get the benefits of marriage without your marriage being legally recognized by the government. That is what I meant by not being married. Polygamists fine. Incestuous marriages...well I dont like that a kid has a higher chance of being handicapped in some way. But if there was some proof to prove otherwise I would change my tune. And for the age limit thing. We dont let children sign contracts for a reason. They arnt mature enough to sign a contract. To me letting a kid get married is like letting a kid sign for a loan. Plus age will change. If you are 16 you will eventually be 18 and able to marry. Doesnt work that way for gay couples. I should have said it was a civil liberty technically. Gay couples dont have access to the same benefits that straight couples have. Therefor gay couples have been treated unfairly under the law. According to the Illustrated World Encyclopedia, Civil liberties and civil rights are almost the same thing, but in the United States they have come to have different meanings, especially since 1954. Civil Liberties cover the right every citizen has to receive fair treatment from his government. Civil rights (some of which used to be called social rights) cover the right of a citizen to receive fair treatment from other citizens and from local governments.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","06:10 PM","gay-rights-debates","337"

This country has a heritage based in Judeo-Christian principles. Traditional marriage was always ok with God and our founding fathers, and gay marriage never was with either. Sure we do, on occasion. America is 70-80% Christian, and when we vote on issues like gay marriage, we often take our religious beliefs to the ballot box. Which is why gay marriage loses. And if someday there's enough of us to make America into a Christian nation via a Constitutional Amendment, we can do that too (though no one I know is really thinking seriously about doing that). We certainly aren't a secular nation. And unless we want to lose America we need to keep God as our Lord and Protector. Otherwise we'll go down the tubes like so many godless nations before us.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","07:03 PM","gay-rights-debates","345"
