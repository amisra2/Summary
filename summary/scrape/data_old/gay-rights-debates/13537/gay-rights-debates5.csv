I have documented this for you before, and it has absolutely nothing to do with ""pro gays"". But for some reason Archie, you have absolutely no problem quoting racists (prior history example) and renowned liars. A rational person would wonder about the company they keep. Archie just recognizes they are anti-gay, and quotes them without concern...","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","11:42 PM","gay-rights-debates","61"
"11-10-2009","13537",5,"None","None","None","jazyjason","377687","It seems that no one here mentioned the slim margin by which the repeal was passed. Point being, is we are gaining ground and changing peoples hearts everyday. This is an issue not of rights or privilege, but of love and compassion. Sadly the same stigmas and stereotypes plagued this campaign as it did the one in California by the same tired old messages of gays ""threatening"" family or attempting to destabilize the very fabric of society. Whether or not you are for or against gays marrying one cannot deny that putting a couples love up to vote is a detriment and in my opinion sad and brutal. One has no right to judge a couples love whether they be gay, strait, black, inter racial, or otherwise. I do not see heterosexuals having their love and commitment to one another out up to a popular vote. Many claim biblical or religious reasoning against two men or two women of legal age marrying. Many voted out of ignorance and prejudice. Many will continue to do so. However one cannot deny that now, gays and lesbians have shown time and again that we are not promiscuous sex crazed villains out to destroy anything. We are in fact, fathers, mothers, someones son or daughter. A teacher, a lawyer, a cop, a next door neighbor. We are people. We are citizens of this great country. We are human just like anyone else. And we feel. We feel joy we feel pain, we feel regret, we are part of the human experience. We are no different than anyone else. And our love for those whom we cherish, and who our thoughts and prayers are with daily are no different than those of our strait neighbors. There is compassion, and dedication to those whom we deeply love. Some here would say that we do not love. That our love for one another is out of an unbridled lust, or some other negative foreign entity. It is false. They fail to acknowledge whether out of pride, prejudice, or ignorance that we are capable of loving only one person till death do us part. We are. And we will continue to keep fighting for our love. We will continue to change hearts and minds. And no cynical critic or biased person, or negative remark or action can ever put out the flame in every single persons heart when it burns bright for another person.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","05:56 PM","gay-rights-debates","62"

Regarding your off the wall commenting yet again, The majority of Americans actually side FOR gay marriage. The margin is very very slim Easy. And also considering the word of god, it has many interpretations, not everyone believes it, and American laws regarding basic human rights should NOT be dictated by it or any other belief. Period. And furthermore, some would argue that the word of god speaks FOR gays and lesbian, not against. Your fundamentalist literalism holds little sway especially when it is cold and calculated attacks upon the hearts and lives of thousands seeking to love those whom they cherish.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","02:39 AM","gay-rights-debates","66"

There was no logic to his view, but it was merely socially accepted. Indeed there is no logic to the anit-gay view or the heterosexual-superiority view. That too is based on tradition, and socially accepted views which are in the process of changing, particularly with the younger generation. Lincoln was against slavery, but that doesn't mean he wanted full equality for African Americans, based on those traditional views he held, and maybe would have to hold to be elected.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","11:40 AM","gay-rights-debates","71"

Because if what you say is true, I doubt he would have plunged the country into such a self destructive exercise as the civil war to free them for something he didn't believe in firmly. I mean, politically speaking, there was absolutely no upside to the civil war for him personally, (as his assassination proves) so why go there unless he believed it was the right thing to do in the long run for the country at large?","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","12:12 PM","gay-rights-debates","73"
