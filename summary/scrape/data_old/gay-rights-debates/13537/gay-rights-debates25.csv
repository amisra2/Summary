"05-04-2010","13537",25,"Matthew S","400369","Because the civil contract should be titled the same for heteros as well as gays. Everyone should have a piece of paper with the same title. Anything different that is offered to gays is second class. I don't care what they call it as long as they call it the same for heteros as well as gay people. If they call it civil partnerships that would be fine as long as that is what hetero marriages are called. Separate but equal is never equal. The only thing having a different name does is preserve heterosexual privilege.","Addison48","400412","Exactly. Dont care what it is called as long as it is the exact same institution as heterosexuals have.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","04:39 PM","gay-rights-debates","362"

"05-04-2010","13537",25,"Lurch907","400386","Ok, this I'll agree with. So were not talking about ""being married"" were talking about bovernment regognition of marriage. So, I think we can agree that government can and sometimes should put restrictions on which marriages it will recognize. What benefit is a homosexual person denied? A homosexual person does not have a seperate set of rules to follow, they have to follow the same rules as everyone else if they want government recognition of there marriage. There are two flaws in your claim: 1. You have not shown that a person is discriminated against, in regards to marriage recognition, because of their sexual orientation. You will have to show how the rules differ for a homosexual individual. 2. You have not demonstrated that government recognition of same sex marriage is something you are entitled to, aka a civil liberty. PS. I have enjoyed this discussion with you. you appear to use logic vs. emotion when debating, I admire that.","Addison48","400414","Yup. Sorry if I didnt make that clear. Only if someone is hurt by the marriage somehow or one of the parties is not giving consent. Simple. Gay people cannot marry someone who they want to spend the rest of their life with like straight people can. Most of the benefits that are offered in marriage only benefit couples. Like being able to make decisions for their spouse if they are in a coma or other something similar to that. If marriage is something you arnt entitled to then would you be ok banning straight marriages? Of course not. And then there is this. Loving v. Virginia - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Marriage is one of the ""basic civil rights of man,"" fundamental to our very existence and survival.... To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State's citizens of liberty without due process of law. The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discrimination. Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State. That is what was said by the Supreme Court. So yes marriage is a civil right. P.S. Why thank you very much. I am also enjoying this debate.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","04:52 PM","gay-rights-debates","364"

Are women only equal to men if you call women men? Your argument has no merit. There is nothing wrong in defining 'marriage' as a union between a man and a woman and all other unions as a civil partnership. Gays themselves are responsible for falsely defining themselves...they are not 'gay', gay means happy and carefree..they are homosexual..men who have sex with men and women who have sex with women...address this false definition before you cry over the definition of marriage Actually, Ive just noticed that you wrote 'exactly'...then disagreed with Matthew lol!","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","04:54 PM","gay-rights-debates","365"
"05-04-2010","13537",25,"Addison48","400341","According to the constitution you cannot deny me equality under the law. What you did by voting against gay marriage is ignore the constitution. That is wrong no matter how you slice it. Do you deny that you denied us equality under the law by voting against gay marriage? Again with religion. I dont care what your religion says about my orientation. You cannot deny me equal treatment under the law.","Easyrider","400417","Gay marriage is not a right under the Constitution. Nor is pedophilia or polygamy. I'm sure they think they have their rights too. See above. People vote against gay marriage in election after election, and so far no one has said they can't do that. So you're contention that gay marriage is a right doesn't fly with the majority of Americans, or the Constitution. Here's what God says about gay sex: Leviticus 18:22 - ""Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable."" Leviticus 20:13 - ""If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads."" Romans 1:26-27 - ""Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion."" 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - ""Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God."" 1 Timothy 1:8-10 - But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine Jude 7 In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. There's no gay marriages in the Old Testament; No gay marriages in the New Testament; no gay sex approved anywhere in the Bible. Just the opposite - gay sex is condemned in both testaments. God is consistent on that. And to close: Whosoever shall be guilty of Rape, Polygamy, or Sodomy with man or woman shall be punished, if a man, by castration, if a woman, by cutting thro' the cartilage of her nose a hole of one half inch diameter at the least. - Thomas Jefferson, Amendment VIII: A Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","05:10 PM","gay-rights-debates","366"

No legitimate government or social purpose is served in rewarding marrieds at the expense of those in civil unions. Either do away with the legal protections exclusive to marrieds, or offer them to every couple.

The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discrimination. Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State. But the traditional definition of marriage is not merely a by-product of historical injustice. Its history is of a different kind. The idea that same-sex marriage is even possible is a relatively new one. Until a few decades ago, it was an accepted truth for almost everyone who ever lived, in any society in which marriage existed, that there could be marriages only between participants of different sex. A court should not lightly conclude that everyone who held this belief was irrational, ignorant or bigoted. We do not so conclude.","Lurch907","400450","No problem. Yet, government does not recognize marriages between close relatives, even though adult relatives are perfectly capable of giving consent. The argument, as you stated, is problems with children. However, a marriage does not mean there will be children nor does denying government recognition stop them from having children. The government also doesn't recognize polygamist marriages. Point being, government can choose which marriages to recognize, subject to the will of the people. Polygamists and siblings are in the same boat with regards to marriage, because the marriage rules apply to each ""individual"" equally. Nobody can have a government recognized marriage with whomever they want, the marriage has to comply with the rules, same rules for everybody. What your looking for is civil rights for couples, but it doesn't work that way, each individual has civil rights. As for making decisions, no marriage is required. In most cases a living will or other such documents do just as well. Loving v. Virginia was written at a time when a marriage between people of the same sex wasn't even a consideration, it wasn't even thought of as a possibility. LvV was written within the strict bounds of racial discrimination and cannot be used as an argument for same sex marriage because the judges issuing the ruling were not taking that into account. Below is part of a ruling by the New York Court of Appeals illustrating this point:","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","08:29 PM","gay-rights-debates","368"

"05-09-2010","13537",25,"Matthew S","400771","Do you love Jesus Easy?","Easyrider","400900","Absolutely! Do you know who Jesus is, Matthew? Jesus is God (many scriptures). As God, then he is the one who gave Moses the commandments against gay sex (Lev. 18:22; 20:13, Romans 1:26-27, etc.), and against shacking up. He's also the one who inspires all scriptures, which includes I Corinthians 6:9-10 and Jude 7. Jesus is also the same God who helps create life in a mother's womb (Psalm 139:13) that the liberals love to refer to the abortionist for termination. Jesus (and not politically-correct pro-gay teachers) is the one who defines sin. Jesus is the one who grants salvation that others think they can earn by their own perceived goodness. Jesus is the one who said a man shall reap what he sows, as opposed to the liberal's redistribution of wealth scheme (a concept centered in greed for other people's money where people reap what others sow). And Jesus is the one who, in the end, will bring judgment (vs. the liberal's endless windjamming at the U.N.) on the ungodly in the Book of Revelation. And, of course, there's more, but that's for starters. Jesus is the Great God Almighty.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","10:28 AM","gay-rights-debates","375"
