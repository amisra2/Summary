I'm also on the record of stating that the best case a homosexual can make towards getting 'gay marriage' recognized is to make the cases for how doing so would benefit the 'general welfare' and subsequently satisfy the governments charge under article 8, section 1..... Am I prejudiced or biased or discrimating when all I do is recognize the fact that the government has the right and the responsibilities to do what the Constitution requires and nothing more than what it requires?

Their life expectancy is far shorter than heteros just as their actual numbers are far less than declared. Here is some evidence of that. An excerpt: Federal Distortion Of Homosexual Footprint (Ignoring Early Gay Death?) Non-reporting, Exaggeration of Homosexual Prevalence. By ignoring the paucity of older homosexuals, Federal bureaucracies in three countries exaggerated the size of the homosexual footprint. In 2003, Statistics Canada reported on a random sample of 121,300 adults, reporting 1.7% were bi/homosexual. Because of a decline in incidence from about 2% of adults aged in their 20s and 30s to a third of one percent among the old, inclusion of respondents aged 60+ yields a revised estimate of 1.4%. In 2005, the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics interviewed a random sample of 11,571 younger adults, but misreported findings to indicate more frequent same-sex sexual experience. In 2005, the British Department of Trade and Industry said a wide range of research indicated lesbian, gay and bisexual people constitute 5- 7% of the total adult population. Yet surveys which included adults of all ages put the prevalence closer to 1-2%. Curious mistakes and omissions for well-funded bureaucracies charged with reporting the truth. Link to Early Death. Exclusion of older adults increases the reported size of the homosexual footprint, and also tends to obscure the apparent early death of those engaging in homosexuality. Median ages of death in gay marriage for 561 gays and 91 lesbians in Denmark (19902002) and 31 gays and 6 lesbians in Norway (19972002) were similar to U.S. gay obituaries during the same period: 52 yr. for 710 gays who ostensibly did not die of AIDS, 42 yr. for those 1,476 who supposedly did; and 55 yr. for 143 lesbians. On average, ever-married men outlived the ever-homosexually-partnered by 23 years in Denmark (74 yr. v. 51 yr.), and 25 years in Norway (77 yr. v. 52 yr.); ever-married women outlived the ever-homosexually-partnered in Denmark by 22 years (78 yr. v. 56 yr.), and in Norway by almost 25 years (81 yr. v. 56 yr.). Implications. By not sampling (U.S., Britain) or reporting on (Canada) those aged 60+, the objectivity of central bureaucracies is called into question. That the ~2% of adults who engage in homosexuality have life spans at least 20 years shorter than the general adult population in countries contributing relevant data has implications for social policy: e.g., gay rights (the decrement in the gay lifespan appears similar in societies that legally protect homosexuals or dont, suggesting discrimination does not cause their earlier death); gay marriage (which unlike man-woman marriage appears not to increase longevity); adoption (children of homosexuals are more frequently orphaned); favorable depiction of the homosexual lifestyle in schools (which is inconsistent with condemning the lesser harm of smoking); special protections for those who engage in homosexuality (why not also protect others whose sexual choices such as polygamy or adultery cause disruption and extra costs?); and equitable allocation of social resources (why spend excessively on HIV when cancer, heart disease, etc. afflict many more citizens?). Eastern Psychological Assn Convention, City Center Sheraton, Philadelphia: 3/23/07 Federal Distortion Of Homosexual Footprint (Ignoring Early Gay Death?) Under political pressure rather than the weight of empirical findings,1 the soft disciplines (e.g., psychiatry, social work) did an about-face on homosexuality. Seventy years ago they attempted to treat those who engaged in same-sex sex, directing them toward conventional married, child-bearing productivity. Today these disciplines seek the social acceptance of gays and lesbians, even though homosexuals contribute less (e.g., less frequent child-bearing, less economically productive) and cost more (e.g., AIDS, STDs, substance abuse, smoking) than non- homosexuals.2 Federal or central government agencies are supposed to be different. In theory, aloof from politics and social fads, their sole function is to gather and tell facts. It is therefore of concern when they depart from their fact-telling mission to indulge in politics. Kinseys 1948 claim3 that 37% of all men had had a homosexual orgasm began a series of extravagant claims by gay activists about the prevalence of homosexuality. Three recent reports suggest national bureaucracies may have joined with activists in exaggerating the size of the homosexual footprint: Great Britains Department of Trade and Industry4 declared in 2005 that lesbian, gay and bisexual people constitute 5-7% of the total adult population. This announcement made Britain the first country to officially estimate its homosexual footprint and was most certainly news. But the uncertainties the department expressed about this estimate e.g. [t]here is very little reliable data about the size of the LGB population; [w]hilst no specific data is available, a wide range of research suggests (p. 13) is cause for concern. Why 5-7% when so many surveys have reported significantly smaller fractions of homosexuals?6,7,15,18 The research the department cited did not involve a new random sampling of all adults from Britain, but instead utilized studies with sampling frames from different countries that excluded anyone above the age of 44 or the age of 59. A sampling frame that stops at age 59 ignores about a quarter of adults. If homosexuals are less frequently represented among the older,8 the best estimate might be significantly lower than what was reported. In September, 2005, the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS] reported5 [a]bout 6.5 percent of men 25-44 years of age have had oral or anal sex with another man... 11 percent of women 25-44 years of age reported having had a sexual experience with another woman. These statements were inaccurate, since the questions that generated these statistics were about lifetime same-sex sexual activity, not merely sex with adults (e.g., for men ever done any of the following with another male [6% ever, but 2.9% in last 12 months; 1.6% reported such behavior only with men], and for women ever had any sexual experience of any kind with another female (p. 9) [11.2%; 4.4% in last 12 months; 1.3% only with female(s)]). In June 2004, Statistics Canada announced9 that for its random sample of 121,300 adults, 1.0% of Canadians aged 18 to 59 consider themselves to be homosexual, and 0.7% considered themselves bisexual. The 1.7% figure was employed both by Statistics Canada and the press. Yet, with older respondents (aged 60+) included, the figure drops 16% from 1.7% to 1.4%. http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2007_doc...lFootprint.pdf And here: http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1805593/posts","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","06:36 PM","gay-rights-debates","24"

He's been kicked out of many major psychological and sociological organizations and censured by a federal judge for his garbage research methods. He has a track record. On Cameron's research methods: ""What do vital-statistics buffs think of this technique? Nick Eberstadt at the American Enterprise Institute sums up the reactions of several of his fellow demographers: ""The method as you describe it is just ridiculous."" But you don't have to be a trained statistician to spot the fallacy at its heart, which is, to quote Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistician John Karon, that ""you're only getting the ages of those who die."" Gay men of the same generation destined to live to old age, even if more numerous, won't turn up in the sample. Other critics rattle off further objections. The deaths reported in these papers, mostly AIDS deaths, will tend to represent the community defined by such papers or directly known to their editors. It will include relatively more subjects who live in town and are overtly gay and relatively few who blend into the suburbs and seldom set foot in bars. It will overrepresent those whose passing strikes others as newsworthy and underrepresent those who end their days in retired obscurity in some sunny clime. Bennett is a busy man, but even he has access to the back of an envelope. A moment's thought might have suggested a few simple test calculations. Suppose he assumes--wildly pessimistically, given current incidence data--that half the gay male population is destined to catch the AIDS virus and die of it. The actual average age of AIDS patients at death has been about 40. (Presumably protease inhibitors will extend average longevity, but that will only increase Bennett's difficulty.) For the number 43 to be the true average death age for the entire population of gay males, HIV-negative gay men would, on average, have to keel into their graves at 46. Looked at another way, if even half the gay male population stays HIV-negative and lives to an average age of 75, an average overall life span of 43 implies that gay males with AIDS die at an implausibly early average age (11, actually). Against this, Cameron and his supporters argue that, according to their survey of obits, even if they don't have AIDS, homosexual males tend to die by their mid-40s (and lesbians by their late 40s). Some downright peculiar results followed from this inference. One is that--contrary to the opinion of virtually everyone else in the world--AIDS in fact hasn't reduced gay males' life expectancy by that much--a few years, at most. Moreover, the obits also recorded lots of violent and accidental deaths. From this Cameron and company concluded not that newsworthy deaths tend to get into newspapers, but that gays must experience shockingly high rates of violent death. With a perfectly straight face they report, for example, that lesbians are at least 300 times more likely to die in car crashes than females of similar ages in general.""
