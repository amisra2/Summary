In fact, we believe in a separation of church and state, and being subject to the law. The ""Articles of Faith"" are 13 major points of our religious beliefs. This is number 12 ""We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law."" According to the Constitution, I don't see how we can deny gays the right to marry. It doesn't seem Constitutional to refuse. Having said this, very many people are saying, ""Why are you against gay marriage, then? It's not like it hurts YOU at all if some gay people get married!"" Oh, but it does. The reason that we ""Mormons"" opposed gay marriage so vocally is that giving gays the right to marry is that it endangers the traditional family. It means that the government recognizes gays as a family, and must protect them legally. Why is that a problem? Here's an example: A Mormon family in New Hampshire, where gay marriages are legal, almost got their kids taken away. Their kids were assigned to read in school a book about how gay marriage isn't wrong. According to our religion, gay marriage is wrong. The kids read it, and then when the teacher asked opinions on the book, the kid said, ""I don't believe it's right."" When they found that the parents taught their kids as many of us do, ""We don't believe it's right, but they are free to choose as they like,"" (we also say this about smoking, pre-marital sex and many other things,) they had social services investigate the family for teaching them such insidious things. IT'S MY RELIGION. I believe gays should have the freedom to marry, as long as it doesn't inhibit my FREEDOM OF RELIGION. Here's another example: religious adoption agencies loose state licensing. Right now, both our church and the Catholic Church have adoption agencies for Mormons/Catholics respectively who want their child to be raised in their religion. Neither considers gay couples, because both churches believe homosexuality to be a sin. (i.e., they will not be members of that church.) With the recognition of gay marriage, they would be forced to change that policy or close. (happened twice to Catholic institutions in New England.) Also, there's the point about our clergy being forced to perform marriages that they believe are wrong, in our churches. That's as good as asking an animal rights activist to stomp a puppy to death. Also, because of policies regarding gays, several churches have lost tax exempt status, costing them millions every year. I come from Atlanta. It's a big gay city. I have many very close and dear friends who are gay, including one of my three best friends from growing up. I have my beliefs, but I also believe that we are all children of God, and are all sinners, so we are in no position to judge. I treat all the gays I know just like anybody else. They do not deserve to be hated, ostracized, discriminated against, or PROHIBITED TO MARRY! However, I can't see a way of allowing gay marriage without giving up a large part of my religious freedom and my right to raise my children as I believe is right. I am for gay marriage, but can't see a way for it to happen until safeguards are put in place protecting traditional families and any religions that feel that gender is an eternal and spiritual thing.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","07:50 PM","gay-rights-debates","304"

What does this have to do with Gay marriage? Traditional.... Let me explain something to you. Gay marriage in NO WAY endangers your children in any way.... Two people committing themselves in a monogamous private relationship does not harm your kids... What you envision as a traditional family is just another extension of what family may or may not be. You have single mothers, single father, various homes that are different where kids are raised just fine... Many gay couples raise children in a loving caring home, and frankly your view of traditional is just sadly another fabricated image painted to you... That's an issue with social services not gay marriage.... Your blaming gays getting married for something taught by the state.... Personally I don't think such books are necessary, and I think it's fabricated.... A child being taken away because they have a difference of opinion? I highly doubt that... And even if it is true, Once again it is a matter of the state, not the gay couples wanting to get married. I don't want their kids taken away, and I feel parenting and teaching should be left up to the family. And if you so worried about what your kids learn, perhaps you should learn to teach them better as parents, not force the state to teach only to your views.... Oh please.... Equating a puppy being stomped because churches can't discriminate against others..... What a sad excuse.... In my opinion these couples shouldn't even bother with your church I'd tell them to go somewhere else.... And if they lost their tax exempt status so be it.... I don;t know the statute on New England's tax status but once again, a matter of the state.... Protect what? Marriage should be a matter of the state not the church in my opinion. If we did away with the church's involvement we wouldn't even be in this position to begin with... I just think that this whole notion of ""protect"" traditional families is just more pork to feed people who are ignorant and fearful of gays, or even have prejudiced views toward it....","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","09:09 PM","gay-rights-debates","306"

"02-24-2010","13537",21,"romebigred","392205","JazyJason: I'm not blaming gays for it, I am TOTALLY blaming legal. I couldn't agree with you more, it's not the gay's fault. BUT! It is still a problem that results when Gay marriage is legalized. When something like legal gay marriage is introduced, if there are anti-gays who are violent about it, it causes issues (once again, NOT the gays' fault). To try to prevent such issues in future, the state teaches children about all different types. ""Diversity Week,"" or something like that, and they teach about different types of families. Here is the ""traditional family,"" (legal term, not my term,) with a mother, father, children. Here is a single-parent family. Here is a gay family. Once again, I have no problems so far. But when they try to force a child to their views that contradict religious ones, the second amendment is violated, not to mention the first amendment. Imagine if you will, somebody trying to force your child to stand up and condemn gay marriage as a wrong and sinful practice. (not terms I use when teaching my kids to respect their gay peers,) It's terrible, isn't it? It's the exact same for me when a teacher threatens to call social services when my kid won't say that his personal view is complete and total acceptance. You don't believe that it's really become school curriculum? Check for yourself: Gay Curriculum Proposal Riles Elementary School Parents - Local News | News Articles | National News | US News - FOXNews.com Don't believe that it's widespread? Google ""Gay curriculum"" and check out stories of cases in Massachusetts, California, and New Hampshire. I think there were more, but that was the first page I got. Once again, I have NO PROBLEM with my kids being required to read them. I just have a problem with them being forced to agree. They are allowed to hold their own beliefs about the theory of relativity, but not sexual preference. Okay, even I'm not that close-minded. I'm not saying, ""If they can't legally get married, so be it."" What is the difference, really? None that I can see, except that you like yours. (That seems to me to be the definition of a double-standard) If expect others to care about YOUR issues, you should really try to care about theirs. Equality is a two-way street. If the majority overruns minority, it's terrible, and you get discrimination. If the minority overruns the majority, it's the same, except that there is usually a lot more violence. Not saying it's right. That's just how it is. Martin Luther King didn't have your attitude. His way was ""United we stand."" Unite with us, don't try to push under to get what you want. Equal is equal, friend. Disliking the metaphor doesn't answer the question, but you are right that it was extreme. How's this for a better one: It's like forcing a Jew to slaughter the animal and cook up the bacon. It's forcing somebody to change their religious beliefs because of a law. What's next, a law saying that my religion can't preach against alcohol or chastity before marriage? LAW SHOULD NOT DICTATE RELIGION. Religion is about God, not the Senate, or the Supreme court, and the first and second amendments support that. If separation of church and state actually exists, then state shouldn't rule church just like church shouldn't rule over state. The rest of my post went on to explain how it endangers my family. Having my kids being taken away is a danger. Not gays' fault, but it can happen anyway. You don't believe it. Google it. I'll see if I can find the report I was looking at yesterday, and post it before the end of the week. It seems to me that you hate us. I know that there are many many many very judgmental believers out there that hate gays on principle. There are also anti-gay nutjobs who are all for violence. You are understandably defensive. You probably figure that I'm one of them, but I'm not. I'm a true Christian, trying not to be one of them. Ghandi once said, ""I like your Christ, but I do not like your Christians. They are so unlike Christ."" I think that for the most part, he's right. Christ taught love and acceptance of all people as incredibly valuable children of God, all equal in His sight. So many Christians seem to think that that applies to everybody except gays. They are wrong. Very wrong. HOWEVER, those nutjobs still exist, and as long as they do, the hyper-defensive, don't-care-what-happens-to-you attitude is getting you no closer to winning them over. Why do you think that every time gay marriage is put to public vote, the majority votes against? It's because those nutjobs stand in the way. Until you try to understand them, they will make no effort to understand you. They aren't going away. They are going to stand in the way every time until you prove to them that you care just as much about their problems as you want them to care about yours. SUMMARY: I am not blaming gays. I'm saying we have some legal issues to clear up, but I think that gays are in the right. The gays are not the problem. The state is the problem; but until we clear up the problem, we will have big-time unrest. That is what I tried to say with the first post. Also, try to recognize an ally when you see one. I am not trying to stop gay marriage. I'm trying to clear the path so that nobody will be able to hold it back. Right now the legal system has too many potholes.","jazyjason","392319","Like I said it is ridiculous if social services got involved over a matter of opinion. And my personal take is you should teach diversity, tolerance etc. But I don't understand how you can teach someone to be gay, or to teach justification for gay marriage.... I think that should be where teaching stops on both sides personally... Everyone should be able to hold their own opinion and if that is being denied then it's wrong. However I don't trust fixed news anymore than I could throw their CEO.... Like I said it is the state..... I wasn't saying so be it let the kids get taken away.... And like I was saying earlier, Opinion shouldn't be restricted. I don't hate anyone I am just very critical when this could be spun in any certain direction. And it is refreshing to see someone with their head on their shoulders... Well they'll also spin that I'm a threat to children, that I'm a threat to the traditional family, that I want to tear away at your family and rob babies out of cradles and molest your young boys..... There is no understanding in my book. Either ignorant people who are scared of the unknown and eat it up like candy, or those who perpetrate such lies and deceit in the name of family and morality.. It is those ignorant people who have been sucked into the lies and spin of those who do truly hate that we can reach.... Well personally I think the State is the problem on alot of issues not just Gay marriage.... And if the opinions of these kids is being threatened then I'll be the first to protest against the state's handling.... Everyone is entitled to their beliefs. I have no right shoving my beliefs and ideals anymore than you do. I think the state needs to take a good hard look at this from both sides...","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","05:08 PM","gay-rights-debates","313"
