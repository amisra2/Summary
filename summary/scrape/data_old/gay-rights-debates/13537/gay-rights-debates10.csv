So apparently more americans think like gansao than do you. The only states that have approved gay marriage have had to bypass the will of the people in order to serve this perverted and unnatural agenda.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","07:20 AM","gay-rights-debates","141"

You don't want us to discuss what it is you condemn, unless it is discussed on your terms exactly.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","10:21 AM","gay-rights-debates","143"
"11-15-2009","13537",10,"jitobear","378268","This straight gal is here to tell you most people really don't care about the sex lives of other adults and current stats show that with the exception of gay marriage that most people support equal rights for gays and believe homosexuality is perfectly acceptable. My son's (adoptive) father is gay, is a marvelous father and one the greatest blessings in our life. My old man is one these big macho, traditional, conservative types and my son's father a hundred times the man and father my father is. Frankly, he is one of the best fathers I have ever known.","Easyrider","378405","I suppose you need to be reminded that the last time I looked, the vote count against gay marriage was 31- 0. It seems pretty clear to me and anyone with a non-biased mind that the majority of Americans don't want it. Uh huh. When the adoptive father starts giving the child the straight truth about gay sex being a sin and an abomination, then we'll start thinking of him as a good man. Until then he's deluded and is probably brainwashing the kid into a non-biblical, pro gay mentality. The kid needs the STRAIGHT TRUTH so he or she can go to heaven.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","10:44 AM","gay-rights-debates","144"

It is just plain nasty.","JPSartre12","378408","And rimming some dude's hairy bung is soooo appealing by comparison?","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","11:33 AM","gay-rights-debates","145"

He talks about sex acts, even graphically, but only in condemning terms. Then, when others also discuss it, he accuses them of ""getting off"" on that dirty, dirty stuff. He's really worried that he's the one who may get off on it.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","11:35 AM","gay-rights-debates","146"

You also know where all the gloryholes are-- http://www.4forums.com/political/196594-post146.html Oh wait. I'm sure those gay people you know open right up and discuss all these details with you. Naturally they would, given your accepting, extremely liberal attitudes.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","12:31 PM","gay-rights-debates","147"
