Anyone can be gay but only homosexuals are sexually attracted to their own sex. Homosexuals have fought against words that describe them that have developed over the years such as XXXXX and poof . Then you dont mind calling ' gay marriage' homosexual civil partnership ( which would be a more accurate definition ) and let the definition change over time.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","03:59 AM","gay-rights-debates","633"
"06-01-2010","13537",43,"Shooterandproud","403493","And yet in no way will it affect them. You provided no refutation of my argument, just a claim that it was utilitarian. So? Basing your argument on tradition is fallacious. Drinking at the same drinking fountain and waiting in the same waiting room aren't rights either. All men are created equal. Right. So because homosexual men can marry women, they technically have the same rights. But surely you recognize ridiculousness of gay men marrying straight women.","Sigma","403648","I was not attempting to refute your utilitarian argument, though you managed to refute your argument on your own. I am saying that I do not agree with viewing most, if any, situations using the Utilitarian ethical system. I feel that ethical system is fundamentally flawed since it treats atrocities as 'moral' as long as the majority of people are benefited by that action. I don't believe you understand the fallacy you're quoting. If I state ""X custom is a tradition"" or ""X tradition contains Y customs"", I am not presenting a fallacy. I am stating a fact about a tradition. Simply mentioning a tradition inside an argument does not automatically create the fallacy. Marriage is a custom that has meaning to many people because it is a tradition. Traditions are meaningful to many people. When you try to radically change anything that is meaningful to people you will likely encounter resistance. Actually, it is. You and I have a right to have access to the same public drinking fountains. That is equal. You and I have a right to have access to the same valid marriage partners. As you've mentioned, that is equal. Of course homosexual men don't want to marry women. And maybe we should change laws to allow homosexual men to marry other men. But you don't have a right to it . It is not about equality between heterosexual and homosexual people, it's about changing the law to get something you want. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be included in marriage, but it is not a right.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","03:14 PM","gay-rights-debates","634"

Are you saying that just because the state issues a contract to two men heterosexuals will stop getting married?","Sigma","403649","Most people view marriage as more meaningful than just a contract between two people and the State.

Yes, and the only way this would be relevant is if the fact that it is tradition is used to justify it. It is fallacious because it is distracting from the actual argument. Yes, all traditions are meaningful, both good and bad, but that doesn't mean we should hesitate to change them if they are for the better. No, its not. Homosexuals cannot marry heterosexuals, no matter what the law says, while heterosexuals CAN marry heterosexuals. Homosexuals do not have the right to marry the person they want (assuming the other is consenting) while heterosexuals do. The laws accommodate the sexual preferences of heterosexuals and fail to accommodate the sexual preferences of homosexuals. Regardless of how you deem proper marriage a ""right"" or not, heterosexuals can do it and homosexuals can't. It would be like telling a person in a wheelchair to take the stairs and calling it ""equality"", because everyone is allowed to take the stairs. I beg to differ. The ""all men are created equal"" clause is violated when a vital set rights/privileges are afforded to one group and denied to the other.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","04:02 PM","gay-rights-debates","636"
"06-01-2010","13537",43,"gansao","403556","How about you giving back the word gay? Gay means happy and carefree and you lot seem anything but. No at this point in time marriage means a union of man and woman and I would like it to stay that way. Why dont homosexuals call themselves heterosexual and women call themselves men? Because it would be the wrong definition. two men insisting that the definition of marriage change to suit them would be as ridiculous as homosexuals insisting on being called heterosexual.","Shooterandproud","403658","This is quite funny considering many heterosexuals now use the word ""gay"" for ""stupid"".","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","04:40 PM","gay-rights-debates","637"

I am not arguing whether changing the tradition is good or bad, only that it would be changing the tradition. Given how meaningful that tradition is to many people, it is no wonder there is considerable resistance to that idea. There is no fallacy. lol... what? What prevents homosexual people from marrying heterosexual people? If there are no legal or implementation barriers, then there is equality. I'm not sure how you can possibly support the contention that there is not equality in rights between heterosexual and homosexual people. Adding ramps is to allow equal access to the same building that others have access to via the stairs, since we have a right to have equal access to the same public buildings. Do you see what I did? I listed a specific right, that of access to the building. What right do you believe is denied to homosexual people that heterosexual people possess? Marrying whom they love? That is demonstratably not a right . Since marriage, itself, is something homosexual people are not legally barred from there is no support for your contention that homosexual people are denied rights for being homosexual. I dispute this. Benefits are not rights afforded to everyone, you must qualify for them. For example, veteren benefits are only available to those who qualify as veterens.

It is, because instead of bringing up valid points as to why the tradition should be kept, you use the fact that its tradition as argument to keep it. The same thing that's preventing you from marrying another dude. Marriage in general. The person in the wheelchair still has access to the building, its just made nearly impossible by a barrier. Homosexuals still have the right to marry, but its nearly impossible because of the sexual barriers they face. Is the person in the wheelchair denied the right to use the stairs? Veterans have worked hard for their benefits, but heterosexuals were simply born heterosexual.

Let me educate you. Heterosexuals as a group do not use the word gay to describe a person as stupid. but all homosexuals seem to call themselves gay..English speaking ones anyway. Most young people do not associate the word gay with the meaning that it had ..that is happy and carefree Look at the lyrics of 'I feel pretty' a song from west side story. Whatever gay people might say the word gay meaning homosexual only started permeating the English language in the late sixties. Before then Homosexuals were called homos, XXXXXX or poofs( in the UK). The term gay meaning stupid or insipid came from the camp or insipid character that gays are believed to have. Gaylord! Thats just gay ! Meaning something is insipid or girly is usually only said by schoolboys or young people. They have not stolen the word. They have chosen it because being ineffective or insipid is link with being gay in popular culture. This is JJs idea of words changing their meaning in action. Gays choosing a word that has nothing to do with being homosexual because they do not like being called homos is not.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","06:21 PM","gay-rights-debates","644"

I get what your saying, but benefits shouldn't be given or denied to someone based on the way they are.","Sigma","403687","By no means. If, for example, I listed dire, but not illegal, consequences if you are allowed to speak your mind you should reply ""it doesn't matter what the consequences are because I have the right to do it "". It is the same situation here, only in reverse. It doesn't matter what the consequences are because we are discussing whether it is a right or not. Evaluating whether or not we should ""be able to speak your mind"" based upon the happiness or unhappiness it causes is a Utilitarian argument. That is the argument you are attempting to use to justify changing laws. You might want to slow down a bit. I have not said we should keep the tradition. I have not said we should change the tradition. I have said that the traditional view of marriage necessarily does not include homosexual people. I have not said that is a good or a bad thing. I have said that the traditional view of marriage is meaningful to a great deal of people. I have said that trying to change something that is meaningful to a great deal of people will likely meet a great deal of resistance. I have not suggested that traditions are intrinsically good, or this custom should be kept because it is traditional. There is no fallacy. I asked: What prevents homosexual people from marrying heterosexual people? I assume you think I'm male. The only thing that would prevent a male marrying another male is the fact that the marriage would not be recognized by the government, so I can only assume you are saying: Marriages between heterosexual people and homosexual people would not be recognized by the government . That is FLATLY , TOTALLY false. You contend that there are ""sexual barriers"" that prevent marriage. Now show me how ""sexual barriers"" are the government's responsibility to remedy. Reasonable equal access to public buildings is the responsibility of government to provide. Since wheelchair-bound people would find it a large physical burden to access these buildings with only stairs, reasonable steps are needed to ensure equal access. However, in our situation, homosexual people are physically capable of using stairs but they don't want to. To demand escalators under ""equal access"" would not be reasonable. You have equal access, even if you hate stairs with a passion and refuse to use buildings with stairs, because how much you like using the stairs is not the responsibility of the government. It isn't automatically ganted for being heterosexual, otherwise you would be right that homosexual people are denied rights. It is not heterosexual versus homosexual, then, it is married versus unmarried. Unmarried people include hetersexual people and homosexual people both, and they have equal rights as well. Yes, of course I recognize that for heterosexual people they can marry the object of their attraction and homosexual people cannot. However, to whom you are attracted is not within the purview of the government. The government does not care to whom you are attracted.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","06:37 PM","gay-rights-debates","645"
