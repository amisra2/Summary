It defies logic to believe such a thing given your attitude about believers. You consider us philosophical enemies in every area of your social outlook.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","05:45 PM","gay-rights-debates","151"

Not wanting your religion meddling with my life does not mean I hold your practicing it against you. Nor have I ever come close to calling Christians things like ""immoral"", ""lacking a moral compas"", ""deviant"", ""perverted"". etc. that I have seen you, Easy and Gansao throw around about homosexuals. Hell in this thread alone, the character of my son's father was directly insulted TWICE (albeit not by you) and yet I am the one who is hateful? When is the last time you saw me insult somebody's family member?","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","06:39 PM","gay-rights-debates","152"
"11-16-2009","13537",11,"gansao","378166","Oh please spare me this BS. Gay men have gay sex with other gay men. If you take the gay sex out of the equation then you are just being friends.","jazyjason","378524","Spare you? Spare you what? Truth? Fact? The realization that it is about people and their lives that matter? And also, beyond the once again sexual equation that you must put into everything about gays, how about straits? Strait people have sex with other strait people. If you take strait sex out of the equation then you are just being friends... Do you see the sheer stupidity in this or is it just me? I love how you refuse to read or even acknowledge my points and posts, yet you group it all into the category of BS. Wonderful Gas, shows how much you are inclined to actually avoid any factual or educated discussion and instead once again play off of stigma and narrow minded ludicrous ideals about a group of people...","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","03:09 AM","gay-rights-debates","153"
"11-16-2009","13537",11,"jitobear","378387","Talk about pervy - am I to assume you have been peeping on my life? And just who the hell are ""they""? I don't know every gay person on the planet. I have a lesbian friend - we have giggled and enjoyed eachother's company since I was 17. I also have a doting lesbian aunt. My son's father has been a loving parent and good friend. If this is being used they can have at it.. I already acknowledged that there not have majority support for gay marriage (not that being in a majority automatically makes you right ). I was responding to gansao's comment that most people don't trust gays. Do pay attention to what you are reading.","gansao","378541","So because you have a lesbian friend and know a nice gay man we should all agree that gays should be allowed to 'marry' and we also should all approve of perverted sex? I had a bisexual girlfriend who became a prostitute..she was nice too....so what? You are right..most people do not trust gays..and this has usually nothing to do with religion either.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","08:03 AM","gay-rights-debates","154"

You want me believe that perverted sex should be condoned by allowing perverts to 'marry'. You want me to believe that if I dont I am hateful and homophobic..BS","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","08:07 AM","gay-rights-debates","155"
"11-16-2009","13537",11,"gayhumanist","378397","Right. You don't want us to discuss what it is you condemn, unless it is discussed on your terms exactly.","gansao","378543","We discussed it. Your terms started to make me feel ill.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","08:11 AM","gay-rights-debates","156"
"11-16-2009","13537",11,"gayhumanist","378415","What DVDs have you been watching, JP? You also know where all the gloryholes are-- http://www.4forums.com/political/196594-post146.html Oh wait. I'm sure those gay people you know open right up and discuss all these details with you. Naturally they would, given your accepting, extremely liberal attitudes.","JPSartre12","378549","I do a lot of traveling and I am observant. How about you? And since you like to search out 3 year old posts, do you want to take me up on my old challenge related to the spread of HIV in the US?","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","09:39 AM","gay-rights-debates","157"
"11-16-2009","13537",11,"foundit66","378564","You say some of the most absurd things. Most people DO trust gays. They want equality for gays with ONLY one exception (gay marriage). Most people think homosexuality is an ""acceptable alternative lifestyle"". For those who do not trust gays, it's most likely due to ignorant prejudice like those who don't trust blacks WITHOUT EVER HAVING KNOWN ONE. ""perverted"" is immaterial. Most people use that word as a synonym to express their moral distaste for something. Your ""moral"" opinion has no place being the sole justification used to deny people rights. Allowing people to marry has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with ""condoning"". Do you think that all Americans ""condone"" the drunken Elvis weddings that happen in Vegas? Gay marriage is legal in Massachusetts. Do you think all people in Massachusetts ""condone"" homosexuality there?","gansao","378566","You make me laugh. Foundit...Most people DO trust gays. They want equality for gays with ONLY one exception (gay marriage). You dont see the irony in that post? People do not object to 'Elvis' ceremonies..do you think that the ceremony affects the legality..you are breathtakingly obtuse. Yes, the people of Massachusetts are condoning perverted sex by allowing it the veneer of respectability of 'gay marriage' .","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","11:28 AM","gay-rights-debates","159"

They were told that it was OK. Let's see it put on a ballot there.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","11:47 AM","gay-rights-debates","160"

We do have our gansaos and easyriders and JPs, but it's ignorance and age. If we encourage the next generations to be open minded, then in 50 years we can have an even better state. Hell, a better country. In 50 years, the bigots will be dead.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","04:21 PM","gay-rights-debates","161"

Was that real life I wonder? Was that why you seemed so desperate for an answer on whether or not one gay experience makes you gay?","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","04:30 PM","gay-rights-debates","163"

You folks are so brainwashed by liberalism that you continued to re-elect a drunken murderer to the senate for 3 decades just because his last name was Kennedy.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","04:31 PM","gay-rights-debates","164"
"11-16-2009","13537",11,"gayhumanist","378611","Naturally. It doesn't take a genius to figure out how one would be privy to such information. One would have to be an insider with the group which uses gloryholes. No, I don't know where the gloryholes are. If I ever want to know I guess I'll just ask you or one of your close friends. Maybe Pastor Ted Haggard?? Changing the subject. Saw that one coming a mile away.","JPSartre12","378614","No, just ask one of your gay buddies....Or open up your eyes the next time you're at a rest area on a major highway. I see that you don't have the nads to take me up on my challenge, huh?","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","04:34 PM","gay-rights-debates","165"
