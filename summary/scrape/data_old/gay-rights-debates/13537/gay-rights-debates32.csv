For instance do you think that the religious freedom of say that mormon, for instance, should go on the ballot for people to vote away? The privlege they are trying to defend by keeping gay people from marriage.","Sigma","402346","Since they are Constitutional rights, it would be slightly impossible to do :P What privelige is that? We don't have a right to love (at least, not one the gov't can help with). We don't have a right to marry whomever we love, or to love whomever we marry. What do you lack that every single unmarried person in America does not also lack, gay or straight?","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","01:00 PM","gay-rights-debates","466"
"05-20-2010","13537",32,"gansao","402230","The single variable completely changes the definition . How about husband and wife?Here is an example of a different but equal definition. A gay partnership is not the same as a straight one. It can be equal but it it not the same. Gay partnerships are same sex partnerships and should be defined as such. I think the problem is the inferiority complex that gays seem to revel in. Homosexuals call themselves 'gay' when gay really means happy and carefree . How ironic. Why should marriage be redifined to suit gays when they are perfectly happy to reject the true definition of their sexuality and hijack another(gay) that is completely irrelevant to it?","Addison48","402410","Gay relationships are basically the same as straight ones. Legally they should be recognized as equal which it currently is not. Gay people have an inferiority complex? Well when you have an entire group of people claiming they are going to hell and they are horrible people you do tend to start to not feel great about yourself. You should hear the list of things I have been called. However that is certainly not the issue here. Because marriage is a government institution and the government cannot discriminate against someone based on their sexual orientation. So yes marriage should be redefined to include same sex couples.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","01:48 AM","gay-rights-debates","467"
"05-20-2010","13537",32,"jyoshu","402238","That's sort of like saying the difference between a train and a ship is some minimal single difference, otherwise they are the same just because they both represent transportation. In reality, they are VERY different in that most all relationships are between men and women, but there are a few that are not.","Addison48","402411","Your example does not fit because there are more then one differences between ships and trains.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","01:51 AM","gay-rights-debates","468"
"05-20-2010","13537",32,"Sigma","402286","I would not claim anyone is harmed. But we all have to live in this society, so the official policies are our business. Your threat here is empty since heterosexual marriage is the status quo . You have to justify changes you wish to make to the status quo, but what currently is in place doesn't need justification.","Addison48","402412","Quote: Originally Posted by Matthew S View Post How are they harmed if two men they do not know sign a contract with the state. Are they going to be offended If I form a corporation? It is none of their business, just as their marriages are none of my business. Yes they are forced to have to accept same sex marriages big f'n deal I am forced to accept their hetero marriages. They didn't ask my permission if they could get married so why should I have to ask their permission? I think he makes a valid point. If something is popular or the norm that doesnt meant it should be accepted automatically. You still need a good reason to accept it. So why should we accept heterosexual marriages?","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","01:56 AM","gay-rights-debates","469"

The ""should"" or ""ought-ness"" doesn't change what ""is"". Heterosexual relationships can be discussed purely on philosophical grounds, but in the context of gay marriage it's the wrong question. The question is not: why should we accept the status quo . The question is: why should we change it . To me, it is akin to asking: Why should we accept having separate bathrooms for men and women. The obvious answer is: Is there a good reason to change it? I don't really have to justify having separate bathrooms, but I would have to justify changing the arrangement.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","10:40 AM","gay-rights-debates","471"

There have been many popular actions that were considered normal at the time but we now know they arnt ok. What makes heterosexual marriage ok?
