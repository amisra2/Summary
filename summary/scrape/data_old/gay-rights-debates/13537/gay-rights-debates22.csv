"02-26-2010","13537",22,"jazyjason","392334","Yet if you look specifically the level of LGBT teen suicides and how it is escalating tolerance does need to be taught. Not just for gays but for all people... And how does an NFL player coming in have to do with this? In my high school we had Christian Club, Gay Strait Alliance, and alot of other various clubs that kept the campus basically balanced.","Steeeeve","392556","It wouldn't work even if you did try to teach tolerance. Time and time again schools attempt to ""teach"" something related to morals and they fail and have the opposite effect. Just look at the DARE program. An example of ineffective use of time and how the only benefit of trying to teach ""don't do drugs"" or ""tolerance"" or ""stay in school"" is to get kids out of 1-2hrs of class time. Oh, and the money given to the speaker...it benefits him or her as well. I don't care about clubs at school. Not all of them should get funding though..in fact, most shouldn't.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","11:17 AM","gay-rights-debates","317"
"05-02-2010","13537",22,"JPSartre12","376816","When placed on the ballot instead of being rammed down the public's throats by activist courts and out-of-touch legislators, gay marriage has a ZERO - 31 record. The fact is that the public, when it exercises its Constitutional Right to decide via the ballot box, has decided against gay marriage EVERY TIME. Gays can't blame the Christian Right and the Mormons for spending $Millions on this one. In fact, gays spent a ton on this one....and it didn't matter.","Addison48","400186","And if the majority supported banning Christianity would that be ok just because the majority supports it? Civil rights should not be up for a vote ever no matter what.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","09:30 PM","gay-rights-debates","318"

If the majority got together and voted on hanging mr jpsartre12 he would gladly put his head in the noose when they came for him. To them the right of the people to vote is more important then what people are voting on. In their world the tyranny of the majority is a hallowed value.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","04:31 AM","gay-rights-debates","319"

Marriage is defined as an official union between one man and one woman. If that defintion is changed then why should we only have two definitions.. Why not polygamy and incestial marriage?","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","06:08 AM","gay-rights-debates","320"

Government recognition of marriage is not. As I have told Mathew S on numerous occasions, you are free to put forth an initative, in your state, to ban government recognition of opposite sex marriages or all marriages. You are also free to vote your opinion on such initatives, but so is everyone else.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","02:45 PM","gay-rights-debates","321"

The majority is not stopping me from having sex with my partner or living life with my partner (assuming I had one). But here is the definition of marriage. Definitions of marriage on the Web: * the state of being a married couple voluntarily joined for life (or until divorce); ""a long and happy marriage""; ""God bless this union"" * two people who are married to each other; ""his second marriage was happier than the first""; ""a married couple without love"" * the act of marrying; the nuptial ceremony; ""their marriage was conducted in the chapel"" * a close and intimate union; ""the marriage of music and dance""; ""a marriage of ideas"" Nowhere in there does it say man and woman only. What would be the reason for not allowing same sex marriage? There was same sex marriage in ancient Rome (until the Christians came into power and put to death all of the gay couples who were married), parts of Africa, Asia, and I believe the native americans had some form of gay marriage. And if you can figure out some of the issues with polygamy such as inheritance and who gets to make decisions for one of the spouses should they become unable to make those decisions for themselves then I dont really care. But insest can produce a child with severe medical problems.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","03:42 PM","gay-rights-debates","322"

Many people choose to have a religious ceremony to celebrate their marriage but that doesnt make it a religious institution. Need proof? You can get married without the permission of the church but you cant get married without the permission of the government. And because marriage is a government institution then they cannot discriminate against same sex couples and must provide the same benefits to them as is provided to straight couples. And it cannot be a separate institution either because separate is not equal. But as I have already said this shouldnt be up for a vote. Civil rights never should be.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","03:46 PM","gay-rights-debates","323"

It doesnt say man and goldfish but I would never be able to marry my pet carp. There are plenty of couples with an equal chance of producing a handicapped child as an incestuous couple..they are still allowed to stay married. Marriage in ancient Rome really has no bearing on modern day marriage. Addison, I am not against gay marriages...not because of gay rights or because Rome or ancient Greece allowed it. We in Britain have had gay marriages for a while and it has made no difference to anyone in Britain except gay people...the sky hasnt fallen on top of us...so why should I object?","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","03:59 PM","gay-rights-debates","324"

We should not argue that gays should have the 'right' to marry we should argue that the definition of ' marriage' should be changed.

The fundamental issue isn't how marriage should be defined, but whether or not the government ought to single out a particular special interest group -- straights -- for special treatment, notwithstanding promises to all citizens that all deserve equal protection under the United States Constitution. The way to rectify the incongruity is to take away the special preference. Do away with all the tax breaks and special legal advantages that accrue only to straights or let those advantages accrue to everyone, regardless of sexual orientation.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","04:53 PM","gay-rights-debates","329"

They have no more claim for 'equal' rights than a man wanting to'marry' his father. Once you abandon the man and wife definition of marriage then any other definition has equal claim.
