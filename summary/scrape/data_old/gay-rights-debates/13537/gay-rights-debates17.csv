"11-21-2009","13537",17,"gayhumanist","379536","I don't know what else you are afraid of, other than more social acceptance would make it look more appealing. Nothing else makes sense.","gansao","379538","Gay positive discrimination and promotion of gay sex to minors are a concern. I do not want gay deviant sex to be considered anything other than that, deviant..either","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","03:18 PM","gay-rights-debates","243"
"11-21-2009","13537",17,"gansao","379538","Gay positive discrimination and promotion of gay sex to minors are a concern.","gayhumanist","379542","Yes, ending marriage discrimination for gay couples, would end that discrimination. Gay marriage doesn't say anything about gay sex to minors. You've already said that sex should be tolerated. Thus, minors will learn to be tolerant of it. No sex education is about ""promoting"" sex. It's something people are likely to do, if they are gay or straight, and they need accurate, unbiased, age-appropriate information.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","03:24 PM","gay-rights-debates","244"

Teaching gay sex in school sex education lessons. To you this may be a mouth watering prospect but for most people it would be a kind of public grooming to accept gay deviant sex. The pedophiles and incestuous will follow using the same lies as you.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","04:19 PM","gay-rights-debates","245"
"11-21-2009","13537",17,"gayhumanist","379566","You need to explain this term ""positive discrimination"". I haven't heard it before. Are you claiming, gays will discriminate against straights for positions? I don't see how gay marriage would facilitate this.. Again, it's this level of acceptance nonsense you are worried about. That's your own insecurity talking. Social acceptance is happening, some of it may lead to marriage, more may come as a result of marriage. So what? It's not going to make straight people gay. Secure straight people who support gay rights, recognize that... I haven't posted one lie here. There are other arguments for not accepting peds and incestuous, that are not simply the circular variety that acceptance will lead to further acceptance, which you use against gays.","gansao","379568","Google it. Gay marriage is a step towards it My own security? What are you talking about? The less perverted sex is accepted as the norm the better. There are many arguments against all types of sexual perversions","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","04:39 PM","gay-rights-debates","247"
"11-21-2009","13537",17,"gayhumanist","379570","Well that settles it. It can be found online, so it must be true. Heterosexuals discriminate against gays. It proves nothing about the right to marriage.. You've failed to show why it should be an issue for anyone except the parties involved, or for gay people. You haven't shown how marriage specifically leads to more acceptance of gay sex. You haven't shown how the latter is a bad thing, except by using bigoted rhetoric(it IS bad, it's perverted, it's deviant, it's wrong), not supported by logic.. Show how gay sex in marriage is a perversion. Outside of marriage, you say it should be ""tolerated"". Does that go for pedophilia and incest as well? You're taking us on the diversion fallacy merry-go-round.","gansao","379573","You can find the DEFINITION if you Google it A future comment of an apologist of father /daughter sex..a lie is a lie You've failed to show why it should be an issue for anyone except the parties involved, or for incestuous people. You haven't shown how marriage specifically leads to more acceptance of incestuous sex. You haven't shown how the latter is a bad thing, except by using bigoted rhetoric(it IS bad, it's perverted, it's deviant, it's wrong), not supported by logic Perhaps you are right. Maybe it should never had been tolerated at all. Then we would not be here today arguing for and against the marriage of perverts.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","05:04 PM","gay-rights-debates","249"

"11-22-2009","13537",17,"foundit66","379576","The way anti-gay people look at a situation where gays are discriminated against, and then turn around and create a pretense that ELIMINATING that discrimination somehow means it is ""discrimination"", in any form, against the people who were either ACTIVELY PERPETRATING the discrimination or passively enjoying the benefits of such discrimination is amazing. The same logic could have been applied towards freeing the slaves. Proclaiming that freeing the slaves was ""the next step to positive discrimination for blacks"". THAT is how messed up these approaches are... If I were to put the word ""straight"" in there in place of ""gay"", is that somehow a better thing? It's like you're trying to make an argument without actually going the extra step of saying the thing you don't want to say, cause you know it would reveal prejudice... The attempt to compare gays to pedophilia or incest only demonstrates the absence of a point on your part. You can't explain why the ""gay"" aspect is inherently negative, without invoking irrational prejudicial judgments, so instead you try to resort to invoking other issues which have rational justifications for condemnation. Sweeping generalizations with no justification for the assessment. Not surprised... HOW is it better? Beyond your own personal prejudices are catered to and you feel better about that... There are arguments against pedophilia and incest that involve documentable harm. Can you substantiate the same regarding homosexuality?","gansao","379665","Around and around Sexual perversion should not be encouraged. Allowing sexual perverts to marry will encourage it","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","12:27 PM","gay-rights-debates","254"
"11-22-2009","13537",17,"gayhumanist","379575","Yeah, I'll get right on investigating that alleged gay conspiracy theory, after I look into the Jewish one. . Nope. I haven't apologized for anything, nor have I lied. I'm asking you to explain your logic with respect to the subject at hand, which you avoid, except to repeat the same unsupported circular fallacies(it's bad because you say it's bad), and diversions which you cannot show are linked to the issue at all. Sorting through the static of logical diversions is sometimes a chore, but it's not an apology, nor a lie. . There move the goalposts. Society had come to this point, and will progress further on this issue, by using our intelligence as we always have. We will continue to move beyond ignorance and bigotry and fear.","gansao","379669","Its not a theory the very argument you put could be equally be put forward for other forms of perversion Given only two choices..allow gays to marry or make homosexuality illegal We should make homosexuality illegal","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","12:33 PM","gay-rights-debates","255"
