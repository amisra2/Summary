"05-24-2010","13537",38,"Addison48","402972","Fine. Same sex marriage should be legal because without it the genders are unequal. Now do you agree same sex marriage should be legalized? Although since the Supreme court has decided that marriage is indeed a basic civil right and they also decided that the 14th amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by racial discrimination and since I showed that not allowing gay people to marry a member of the same sex is indeed the same thing as not allowing interracial couples to marry then I would still have to say gay people do not have the equal right to marry. Ok then. Why are you using that as a counter argument that homosexuals are denied rights? Choosing who you marry is however a right. Now about the fourth line on the variable being race. Lets pretend that interracial couples still arnt allowed to get married. Who exactly would you say is being denied their rights? Non interracial couples or interracial couples or both?","Sigma","402977","You concede, then, that homosexuals have the same rights heterosexuals do? And I have shown that the situation of race is dissimilar to the situation of sexual orientation. That court case does not help you. Because homosexuals are not denied rights. If someone came here and said that the Earth is flat I would counter that argument as well. It simply is not true. Though the view that heterosexual attraction is more valid or has a ""purpose"" that homosexual attraction lacks has merit as well. Not really. You cannot marry someone who is already married, an animal, a minor or a sibling. Or someone of the same gender. Or a video game character. Or an inanimate object. Even if you love them. You have to follow the rules to get the benefits. Even if homosexuals can marry it will never be ""you can marry whomever you want"". I'm honestly not sure how standing works in the court system. I could only say that white people could not marry the same people that black people could marry. If the variable is sexual orientation , then homosexual people can marry the same people that heterosexuals can. The situations are then dissimilar.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","01:33 PM","gay-rights-debates","556"
"05-24-2010","13537",38,"Addison48","402974","However a gay man wouldnt want to get married to a woman. He wants to get married to a man. Which means he is essentially barred from getting married. You still get a choice however. Plus there is an actual reason to only allow someone to vote for one party in the primaries.","Sigma","402978","No, it means he is barred from marrying the person he wants to marry. That isn't the same thing. It's not about only getting one vote. I don't have a choice who I vote for. I have to vote for the party I'm registered for or I don't vote at all. That doesn't mean I'm barred from voting, just barred from voting for the person I want to vote for (possibly, at least).","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","01:35 PM","gay-rights-debates","557"

Now can you answer my question? How have you shown it is different? I would still have to say we are still treated unequally. It depends on what you mean by purpose. And then the idea that since gay people cant reproduce they shouldnt be allowed to marry has already been disproven due to the fact that sterile couples still are allowed to marry. Let me change my statement then. It is a right to choose who you marry unless the person you want to marry cant give consent. Im sorry but that doesnt answer my question. Which group was being denied their rights. Interracial couples, non interracial couples, or both. Edit: About the you have to follow the rules to get the benefits thing. Back in the day the rule was you couldnt marry someone outside your race. However that is obviously unfair.

I'm merely here comparing heterosexual rights versus homosexual rights. Heterosexuals and homosexuals are treated equally. As I've said to you before: when the variable was race, white people could not marry the same people that black people could marry. If the variable is sexual orientation, then there is no difference between who heterosexuals can marry and who homosexuals can marry. The situations are then dissimilar. At this point, your denial seems to result more from stubborness than any actual argument. Purpose being evolutionary purpose, if 'purpose' is the right word. Our understanding of life, including human life, is based upon evolution. Evolution depends on a creature's ability to find a mate and reproduce. You keep changing the goal posts. I'm not talking about who can legally marry. Not so. Close family and those already married are invalid choices. Besides, the legal status of who you love does not mean you can stop loving them. Their love is the same as yours, is it not? And I said that I don't know how standing works in our court system. I can, and have, explained the situation, though. That should be enough information unless you're looking for something more specific. No, it still has merit. Even if the rule is 'unfair', it still needs to be followed to receive benefits. You have to change the rule if you think it's unfair.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","04:10 PM","gay-rights-debates","560"

Well, heck, you could always get a sex change to marry that person you had your eye on so you can choose too! Please.

We do if we value the historical, cultural and, heck, evolutionary meaning of marriage, since part of the theme has been people who are in love having children. That meaning is not legally enforcable, of course, but I think it is part of why most people view marriage as ""meaningful"". Perhaps they should be. To be honest, I don't have much issue with polygamy, incest or bestiality. Pedophilia is a very unfortunate orientation to have since they can never (and should never) be with the object of their desire. However, I also have no problem with the rules that don't legally recognize those relationships. If you're putting a line somewhere the place it currently is makes a lot of sense.

The government, as formulated by the Constitution at least, fits our nature pretty well. A government that goes against our nature would constantly run the risk of revolution. That is not easier. More to the point: Forming pair-bonds for mating is part of our nature. As your court case points out, marriage is fundamental. Going against that nature would be more trouble than going with it. Would it bother you if ultimately I am a selfish person? I don't intend to trivialize anything. However, why should I support homosexual marriage? If there is no reason, then it is change for the sake of change. Actually, JWilliam brought it up here .
