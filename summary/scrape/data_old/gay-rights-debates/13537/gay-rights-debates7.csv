Law professor John Spencer will argue that the current age of consent, fixed at 16, criminalises half the population.

In a preview of the live program, BBC programme makers said that the Cambridge University academic will argue that it should be legal for young teenagers to have sex.

I and a lot of other people do not believe that the age of consent should be lowered . I also am realistic and know that young people will have sex before 16 years old. I would be very very upset if my daughter had sex with a boy before 16 but would be even more upset if the boy had buggered her. What our friend Peter Tatchell did was PROMOTE sex at 14 years old ..that meant he WANTED boys of 14 years old to be buggered. What Spencer said was that by keeping the age of consent at 16 was wrong because it incriminated young people ...not to promote sodomising youngsters See the difference?","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","01:53 PM","gay-rights-debates","95"

"11-12-2009","13537",7,"gayhumanist","377973","Yawn. What exactly is the gay agenda? That's a meaningless expression.. Yes, gay and straight people... Oh my goodness. You're obsessed over one type of sex, especially if a male is in the ""submissive"" position. You also see females as weak, submissive and perpetual victims. What if your daughter had ""buggered"" a boy? This seems to be an issue of your own hangups. Where did Thatchell specifically say he wanted boys, girls, or anyone else to be ""buggered"" or anyone specifically to do the ""buggering""? ... If you change the age of consent a young person could have consentual sex with an older person. This change can't happen without the support of the Parliament, the majority of which are heterosexual. I'd hardly call those advancing this in parliament part of a heterosexual agenda. Nor other heterosexuals who support it. I've also shown you that gay marriage can be a reality without later lowering the age of consent, but in fact raising it, as in the Canadian example. Britain doesn't even have same-sex marriage.","gansao","377981","The gay agenda seems to be promote gay sex as normal. Bogusly align themselves with the struggle of the black people to achieve equality. Portray themselves as victims and cry homophobe to anyone that objects to this. The difference is that Tatchell was a gay activist someone like you that proclaimedthe rights of gays. At the same time he was stupid enough to promote the lowering of the age of consent to 14. So we have a popular gay activist suggesting that young boys should start to learn the joys of sodomy ay 14 years old . My daughter buggering a boy..are you really that stupid? You really dont know much about girls do you? I never suggested girls are weak, submissive victims, where did that pop up in your head? What do you think that the age of consent means? Tatchell knows full well what buggering means even if you dont Gay marriage is just another step in the promotion of gay sex by gays..you admitted it. What started as showing compassion and tolerance to men who indulged in homosexual sex has turned into a veracious gay pressure group intent on normalising the far from normal.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","04:26 PM","gay-rights-debates","98"

"11-12-2009","13537",7,"Archangel","377899","Can you show any evidence of Lincoln's extreme racist views, even for his time Symbiote? Because if what you say is true, I doubt he would have plunged the country into such a self destructive exercise as the civil war to free them for something he didn't believe in firmly. I mean, politically speaking, there was absolutely no upside to the civil war for him personally, (as his assassination proves) so why go there unless he believed it was the right thing to do in the long run for the country at large?","Symbiote","378008","It is a myth that Lincoln went to war to end slavery. In his own words: ""If there be those who would not save the Union, unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause. I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors; and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views. "" As I said, I have no interest in debating in great detail whether Lincoln was a racist or not. Racism is impossible to prove, since it relies on an occurence in someone else's mind, and is not in itself an evil. Whether Lincoln is a racist or not, even exceptionally racist or not, is simply a bit of historical trivia. What is true is that both his actions and words are consistent with going to war to ""preserve the union"", with slavery ending not ranking, at all, as a priority. I'm sure he believed what he was doing, that is, preserving the union, was right for the country at large. He fought against secession, as nationalists tend to do, just as China today seeks to fight the secession of Taiwan, Tibet and the Muslim northwestern provinces, just as Indonesia sought to prevent the secession of East Timor and Russia seeks to prevent the secession of Chechnya.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","07:45 PM","gay-rights-debates","100"

"11-13-2009","13537",7,"gayhumanist","378042","Do you have a problem with that? Again, what is ""gay sex""? Foundit asked you several times if you are under the impression that straight people don't have anal and oral sex. You do not answer. I would like to know why you care what gay people do in bed, when heterosexuals are doing the same thing. Nah. We don't say the history is the same. We say discrimination is discrimination. Gays wouldn't get anywhere playing victim. Someone who deals with discrimination and bias will often have a legitimate argument. There's a difference between recognizing reality and speaking up and taking action and being a victim. Yeah, got that. I support him in advancing gay rights. However, as I've looked more into this man, he sees himself as more of an extreme libertine, not necessarily always in line with mainstream gays. He criticizes such as being too conservative and suburbanite. Um....you think the Cambridge law professor wouldn't be smart enough to figure out that was a possibility, when he supported lowering the age of consent? Do you really not get out that much? Do you think you need a penis to do these things? One has fingers and toys. Um, where did I do this? Why would we need marriage to promote us having sex? You know what they say, all marriages have the same sex. Just another tired argument made by people overly concerned about sex that doesn't affect them. I don't need your compassion, your tolerance. It's no more an ""indulgance"" than it is for straight people. Sorry, Peter isn't doing this all on his own, nor with only the help of some gay people. This is a separate debate happening broadly in British society.","gansao","378063","Gay sex is not normal. it is deviant..saying that anal sex is common among straights does not make anal sex right. You cannot compare a XXXX job with anal sex. You think that a girl sticking her finger in a boys bottom is sodomy? The likelyhood of a boy persuading a girl to do it let alone a butt plug is zero. So maybe you should be getting out more ..or doing less daydreaming Discrimination against another coloured person is wrong, discrimination against sexual perverts is fair and correct. Allowing gays to marry would be an acceptance of gay sex..it should not be accepted. Tatchell spilled the beans, you are just backpeddling on Tatchells behalf","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","05:57 AM","gay-rights-debates","105"
