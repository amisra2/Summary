"05-17-2010","13537",30,"Sigma","402207","So they weren't second class citizens before, but are now even though nothing changed? That seems a bit contrived, tbh. This sort of rant reminds me of a news story some years back about a self-proclaimed pedophile demanding that he not be treated different for his sexual orientation. I can't remember what happened to him though. In any case, you aren't a second class citizen. Even if you can't marry whomever you want to. No one can marry whomever they want to. It really sucks that you can't marry the person you love, but that doesn't make you a second class citizen.","jazyjason","402211","They were before Sigma.... Gee how nice Sigma.

We have a population explosion on our hands.... Nearly 7 BILLION people.... The flawed logic you try to steer toward basing that somehow homosexual is unequal to heterosexual is a fallacy in today's modern world.... Your comparing apples to oranges and also you purposefully overlook that homosexuals can STILL reproduce!","Sigma","402212","So? This is a false conclusion. Heterosexual attraction was the basis for the evolution of our species. This will always be true, because we can't change the past (YET!!). This is significant. Homosexual attraction can never, ever, ever achieve the same significance for the same reason that two will not equal three. They simply are not the same thing. Homosexual relationships cannot naturally produce offspring. Heterosexual relationships can naturally produce offspring. This is also significant.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","09:49 PM","gay-rights-debates","438"

"05-17-2010","13537",30,"Sigma","402196","Well, the examples I've already given are ""black"" and ""white"" as labels for races. ""Gay"" and ""straight"" are labels. Legally speaking, the word ""marriage"" refers to a pooling of assets. Tbh, I'm not sure what is meant by calling it an ""institution"". As we've established, equality already exists. The fact that no one can wear goth shirts is equal treatment, even if it impacts those who want to wear goth shirts more than those who don't. If you would, what did the court mean by the ""survival of the nation""? Ancient Rome and Greek treatment of homosexuality does not really help your case. The Lex Scantinia is the first instance of recorded Roman law that regulated sexual behavior which including pederasty, adultery and passivity and potentially legislating the death penalty for homosexual behavior among free-borns (slaves could be used for any sexual activity, it seems, and frequently were used for homosexual sex). Even the Roman philosopher Gaius Musonius Rufu, who expressed progressive views on women becoming philosophers, described homosexuality as ""against nature"" even though he seemed to consider adultery as the most illicit of sexual activity. Of course, the Roman idea of masculinity was associated with penetrative sex. A free-born who was penetrated had been ""feminized"". In Craig Williams' book ""Roman Homosexuality"", he describes a court case of a Roman soldier from an author of the era: This soldier had been propositioned by his tribune, a relative of the commander Marius, during the war against the Cimbri in 104 B.C.; not only did he reject the tribune's advances, but he killed him in outrage, and despite the fact that the dead man was his relative, Marius ruled that it was a case of justifiable homicide. Defending the soldier's action, the speaker in Calpurnius' declamation first poses a rhetorical question to the slain tribune: ""Is he not yet a man to you, though he is already one of Marius' soldiers?"". That is, the speaker is arguing that, in trying to violate the soldier's sexual integrity, the tribune had disregarded his manhood. Among the free-born, being penetrated was disgraceful in a man. Homosexual relationships, then, could not enjoy equality with heterosexual relationships. It is a cost-benefit analysis. A male only has so much investment he can spread around. While both sexes have a genetic incentive to commit adultery, they also have a strong genetic incentive to ensure their partner is monogamous. A male would not wish to waste investment on another man's child and a woman would not want her mate to invest in another woman's child. Thus, monogamy would be selected for over evolutionary time while adultery would be an opportunistic strategy in a similar way rape is an opportunistic strategy. A woman who has a mate that has indescriminate sexual appetites gains less investment in her children and thus her and that male's reproductive fitness is reduced. A woman who is in a life-long monogamous relationship maximizes the survival of her own offspring and the offspring of that male. The ideal situation for the male is to commit adultery in secret and have another male raise his mistress's children while he raises his wife's. The ideal situation for a woman is to have a male that will invest in her children and no one else's even if the children are not his. The ideal situation for the couple is to be in a life-long monogamous relationship where their genetic interests are tied up in their common children. Marriage means more than that to most people, I daresay, though I agree that is all it is legally. Any two people can stand to gain from marriage benefits. Heck, when you strip any meaning from ""marriage"", why are there any restrictions at all? Why are there age limits? Why are there species limits? Why is it limited to couples only? The reason there are limits is that marriage is meaningful to us. When you change that meaning you will meet resistance. Heterosexual attraction is the basis of reproduction. That is significant. Homosexual attraction is not the basis of reproduction. It cannot have the same significance.","Addison48","402214","Black and white or gay and straight are indeed labels. However they are not institutions. Basically here is the closest definition I could find of institution that relates to marriage. You can find this definition if you type in institution define into google. Institution - a custom that for a long time has been an important feature of some group or society; ""the institution of marriage""; ""the institution of slavery""; ""he had become an institution in the theater"" Equal benefits does not mean the institution is equal. Separate is not equal. But the point I was making with the gothic clothing example is that even if give people the exact same laws they arnt exactly equal. Dont you think it would be wrong to ban a style of clothing? Well kind of. Here is what that law really did. The earliest Roman law regarding homosexuality appears to have been the Lex Scantinia that was passed by the Roman assembly at some point in the Roman Republic (perhaps in the second century BC). Although the text of this law itself has not survived, later Roman jurists of the second and third century AD describe how it outlawed the homosexual rape of young male Roman citizens. Consensual male or female homosexual unions apparently were not legislated against. Although there is scholarly debate, Roman literature of the republic and early empire suggests that men who engaged in consensual liaisons were often mocked as unmanly, but consensual homosexual sex itself was not illegal. Why the Romans Are Important in the Debate About Gay Marriage I wont argue that homosexuality wasnt looked down on in Rome because it certainly was. But there was gay marriage in Rome. What exactly do you mean by investment? I agree marriage means more to people. But legally that is all it is. Those benefits dont always apply to those who arnt in a romantic relationship. Benefits such as inheriting all of your spouses property when your spouse dies or making medical decisions for your spouse when they are unable too. Benefits that would protect against things like this. Alvin McEwen: Elderly gay couple robbed of companionship, possessions, and dignity But there are age limits to many things such as signing for a loan, driving, owning a weapon, ect. The reason is because they are not old enough to give consent yet. And there is species restrictions because animals cannot give consent. Marriage is meaningful to me and other gay people too. Thats why we want to get married. Changing the current state of marriage to allow same sex marriage will not effect straight marriages at all. So whats the big deal with not allowing gay people to be married to someone they love? I dont base the significance of ones relationship based on their ability to procreate. So what do you think about couples that are sterile? Does their relationship have the same significance as non sterile couples? And what about gay couples that do end up raising children through adoption, surrogate mothers, or artificial insemination?","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","10:17 PM","gay-rights-debates","440"

Not really. Schools ban certain clothing all the time and can even restrict clothing to only one style. I find nothing wrong with that. On a national level it still would not be wrong, though this is a value judgement and would vary person to person. Clothing just isn't very important to me. However, it would be unconstitutional and therefore I would not accept such a restriction even if I did not care what the restriction was. There was only heterosexual marriage. Homosexual liasons were allowed with slaves because slaves were considered acceptable sexual objects (no matter the gender), but any free-born Roman besides his wife was off-limits. To further complicate matters, freed-men and -women (as opposed to free-born) occupied a third level of sexual allowance. Those who freed them were considered to be ""owed"" a duty (which may have included sexual services), but were off-limits to everyone else as a free-born would be. Also, if a free-born man was penetrated even by a slave that man was considered degenerate. A ""real man"" only penetrated others. True homosexual relationships did not openly exist. Time and effort, money and resources. When you raise a child you invest your time, effort and money into that child. Of course they would still apply. Who cares if those involved are in love or not? It's just a contract between any two people. If I want my best friend to inherit or to make medical decisions, I could marry them. I don't have to actually have any romantic feelings, since it's just a contract. Age of consent is a legal construct just as marriage is. We can change that As for animals, who cares if they can consent? They're animals, not people. The big deal is basically what you've said in this post. Marriage is meaningful. It has been a custom that has not included homosexual people (with rare if any exceptions). You want to change that meaning, this custom. When you change the meaning of something that is actually very meaningful to a great deal of people don't be surprised if you tick off a portion of that population. If your dad took you for walks through a certain park and then died, and you wanted to do the same with your children only someone wants to come in and turn it into a strip mall wouldn't you try to stop them? Your confusing two different points. I said heterosexual attraction is the basis for reproduction. This is true whether or not any particular couple reproduces. Though while we're on the point: Evolution requires reproduction. Any particular person who does not reproduce is an evolutionary dead end, regardless of sexual orientation. Those who are offended by that statement don't really understand that statement.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","10:59 PM","gay-rights-debates","441"
"05-18-2010","13537",30,"Addison48","402206","Originally Posted by Easyrider Evidently you aren't familiar with the Founding Father's (or God's) concept of freedom, so I'll try to help you out: The Reverend John Witherspoon, declared that, ""...Civil liberty cannot long be preserved without virtue...."" Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence who was also known as the ""Father of Public Schools,"" had this to offer: ""The only foundation for a republic is...religion. Without it there can be no virtue, and without virtue there can be no liberty."" Don't miss the force of that last statement, ""....without virtue there can be no liberty."" The principle is clear - a lack of virtue engenders bondage. As one writer noted, ""Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their fetters (bindings)."" The more liberties a godless people achieve, the more enslaved they ultimately become in their carnal obsessions. Not only that, Addison, but when you consider the carnal gay sex madness that permeated Sodom and Gomorrah, and the devastation that followed, one would have to be completed steeped in denial to risk our American cities with another one of those immoral ventures. There is a God, and he doesn't approve of gay sex (or fornication, adultery, etc.). Keep it up and Judgment will eventually follow. Then you won't have any freedom at all. Of course the godless hedonists are in denial on all this, which is why they are clueless and dangerous.

It is simply a contract. A contract that homosexuals are unable to sign for no reason other than the fact that they are homosexual. Women's suffrage and civil rights were also unpopular at the time. We then determined that it was inappropriate for the government to not extend rights and priveleges to all citizens. What's so different about this issue? Why can these specific rights be denied? Because two men or two women will have sex? Well, I hate to break it to you but homosexuals will be having sex regardless of marriage. So will straight people. And the fact that heterosexual couples can produce offspring is not a valid argument for a few reasons. First, the rights that homosexuals are trying to obtain have nothing to do with children. In fact the parental rights and parental tax breaks do not apply to heterosexual couples without children. Second, to disallow someone to get married based on the fact that they are unable to produce children sets the legal precedent that married couples have to produce offspring. Thus anyone who is sterile or doesn't want children could not be allowed to get married. Allowing them to get married would only reflect hypocritcal legislation. As for God denouncing homosexuality as sin, if you believe this, fine. But this is something that homosexuals will have square aware with their creator. Religion cannot dictate legislation. When did it become the government's responsibility to ensure that it's citizens make it into heaven?

To the vast majority of people the custom of marriage is much more meaningful than simply a contract. Since that custom has historically not included homosexuals, it would have to be changed... and when you change something that is so meaningful, you will meet resistance. If it is just a contract, though, then you don't need to enter into it with someone you love. Just find one person you trust that is of the opposite sex, unmarried, over the age of consent and marry them. If you can't find someone that meets that criteria you are certainly not alone. You don't have the right to have love in your marriage, though I don't think sex is illegal for homosexuals. Also, not being qualified for certain benefits is not denying your rights. I do not qualify for veteren benefits because I am not a veteren, for example. You are in the same boat as every unmarried American, gay or straight. It's not an argument. It's a fact. Heterosexual sex can naturally produce offspring. Homosexual sex cannot. It is a significant fact, but that's all it is. The fact that heterosexual couples can naturally produce children is a significant fact. I daresay that the majority of people would agree with me on that score. It does not automatically have policy implications, but it does support the view that heterosexual attraction and the formalization of that attraction (read: marriage) is different or should be different from homosexual attraction. It is not that any particular person is unable to have children, it is more that a homosexual relationship cannot naturally produce children. This fact has nothing to do with legal rights, but it influences how that relationship is viewed in relation to heterosexual relationships.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","04:50 PM","gay-rights-debates","449"
