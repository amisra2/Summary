The law does not care whether you or the person you want to marry is homosexual or heterosexual. Equality under the law only cares whether everyone can marry the same people. Because that's equal. Truth be told, I have a better chance arguing equality to allow siblings to marry than homosexuality has in arguing its case, imo. You may want to change marriage so you can marry a member of the same gender, and that may or may not be the morally correct thing to do. But you don't have a right to it.","thelmoose","402806","This is common and non-sensical argument. I am suprised anyone actually states this with a ""straight"" face (nyuk). Because the law does not not distinguish between heterosexual and homosexual is precisely the reason equality does not occur. Equal treatment under the law is intended to promote equity and fairness. This does not. If the law only allowed same-sex marriages, then would that be considered equality? Maybe in some silly rigid sense this is equal, but it is not equitable. When anti-miscegenation laws were on the books, there was equality - everyone was allowed to marry within one's own race. Do you consider that equality? I am not arguing that marriage is a right - separate issue. But to suggest that the current situation, barring marriage for gays, is an example of equality is absurd. It is only true in the strictest sense of the word, and not in any sense of the spirit of equality. You may argue other reasons to be against gay marriage, but to suggest that the status quo represents equality is silly.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","11:06 AM","gay-rights-debates","511"

How can it rationally be equal if group A can marry someone that group B is not allowed to marry? I think you're confusing what marriage is. It is a legal contract between two people.

I've already shown pretty clearly that they are not :P White men could marry women that black men could not. White men were barred from marriage to those that black men were not barred from. Heterosexual men cannot marry anyone that homosexual men cannot. That is a pretty clear difference. Yes, but those are social barriers, not legal ones. The government is not in the business of telling us why we marry someone, whether it is out of love or for some other reason. Generally speaking, ""love"" is no more a valid a reason than ""for the benefits"". I'm not sure how you can pull ""equity is irrelevent"" out of my posts. Perhaps if you clarified. I'm saying that the limit to opposite sexes is one limit among others. If you don't follow the rules you don't qualify for the benefits.

"05-23-2010","13537",35,"Winston Smith","402744","This is the definition of marriage, the legal definition of marriage in most parts of the world, according to : Dictionary, Encyclopedia and Thesaurus - The Free Dictionary marriage [mrd] n 1. the state or relationship of being husband and wife 2. (Law) a. the legal union or contract made by a man and woman to live as husband and wife This is the definition of wife: wife [waf] n pl wives [wavz] 1. (Law) a man's partner in marriage; a married woman Related adj uxorial 2. an archaic or dialect word for woman Nowhere does it say that because one of two male homosexuals calls the other ""wife"" it means the so called one has become a woman. A transvestite is not a woman. He may dress and make himself up as a woman but a man he remains. A duck is a duck. If legally the definition of ""marriage"" is changed to accomodate homosexual unions so be it. I couldn't care less. words are important, therefore to call two same sex homosexuals living together ""marriage"" is extremely important to them. It legitimizes their union as a normal, community sanctioned union. That is why they don't want a different term for their union. They want to be mainstream, they want to be accepted as normal. They are not, the norm is always by definition the majority not the minority. Unfortunately, or should I say fortunately rather, they are as we all know a minority, otherwise the human race would be a fraction of what it is, which looking at it from the enviromental perspective it would be a good thing. call a duck a duck and a chicken a chicken is the bottom line. two men engaging in sodomy is a sexual practice but a deviant one. Not normal by any definition of the world, unless we are talking of ancient Sodom","JWilliam","402840","But you can call both chicken and ducks birds. And that's the point. The gay rights movement is not about calling a man a woman of a woman a man. Nor is it about calling two men living together married. It's about allow two men to get married.

A homosexual couple cannot. Your objection is a semantic one. Admittedly, no one has the right to marriage. But again I will reiterate. That is not the issue. The issue is homosexual couples cannot get married while heterosexual couples can. In so doing the government recognizes the heterosexual couple as significant members of the same family and award that couple benefits which include the ability to visit one another in a hospital, the ability to make impotortant life decisions if one of the members should become incompasitated, the ability to cover one another under their insurance, the ability to file taxes jointly, the ability to purchase property together and survivorship rights of said property, inheritance rights, and many others.
