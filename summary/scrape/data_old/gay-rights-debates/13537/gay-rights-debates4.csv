"11-08-2009","13537",4,"foundit66","377438","Such arguments are like saying granting blacks equality affects the rest of us... In Loving v Virginia, was there any demand that interracial marriage not be allowed to affect non-interracial couples? Gays pay taxes just like straights do. The true ""disingenuity"" lies in demanding that gays pay taxes which go to fund straight marriage benefits, while straights should be unburdened by the flip scenario... 1) The first problem in that scenario is the assumption that it is ""indisputable"" or ""linked directly to their lifestyle""... But I recognize these are claims you cannot defend, therefore you cowardly claim they are ""indisputable"" in a hope that others will assume that to be the case. 2) Rights are not ""rewards"". It amazes me how some people perpetually try to pretend that marriage is somehow a ""reward"" instead of a right. 4) Your analogy attempt could just as legitimately be applied TOWARDS BLACKS . Blacks have a higher rate of HIV in their community as well as compared to whites. So, could you conceivably take your analogy and pretend that it somehow justifies discrimination against blacks?","JPSartre12","377448","Gays are just as free to marry a member of the opposite sex as straights are. You want the bennies of marriage, meet the criteria. What part of the term HYPOTHETICAL isn't passing through your starch-filled cranium? Tax breaks aren't rights. [quote] 3) Your scenario is woefully incomplete to justify a legitimate answer. Suppose a group of people were purposely running around infecting other people with a lethal disease. That obviously has legal consequences. [quote] It's only woefully incomplete if your attempting to weasel out of the obvious answer. I could have added all sorts of cavaets but it wasn't necessary. Apples to oranges again. Gays aren't a protected class. Nice try, though. Your attempts at slight of hand misdirection are becoming tedious. Now, back to my analogy. I never mentioned what that group was, nor what the disease they were spreading was. Neither were part of MY scenario, so stop trying to rewrite my analogy to fit YOUR purpose.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","06:38 PM","gay-rights-debates","53"

Notice how none of the results were actually provided by Cameron's group but were simply compiled by them from the governments who did the studies. How you can condemn them shows how you will reject any results which conflict with your agenda. By ignoring the paucity of older homosexuals, Federal bureaucracies in three countries exaggerated the size of the homosexual footprint. In 2003, Statistics Canada reported on a random sample of 121,300 adults, reporting 1.7% were bi/homosexual. Because of a decline in incidence from about 2% of adults aged in their 20s and 30s to a third of one percent among the old, inclusion of respondents aged 60+ yields a revised estimate of 1.4%. In 2005, the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics interviewed a random sample of 11,571 younger adults, but misreported findings to indicate more frequent same-sex sexual experience. In 2005, the British Department of Trade and Industry said a wide range of research indicated lesbian, gay and bisexual people constitute 5- 7% of the total adult population. Yet surveys which included adults of all ages put the prevalence closer to 1-2%. Curious mistakes and omissions for well-funded bureaucracies charged with reporting the truth. Link to Early Death. Exclusion of older adults increases the reported size of the homosexual footprint, and also tends to obscure the apparent early death of those engaging in homosexuality. Median ages of death in gay marriage for 561 gays and 91 lesbians in Denmark (19902002) and 31 gays and 6 lesbians in Norway (19972002) were similar to U.S. gay obituaries during the same period: 52 yr. for 710 gays who ostensibly did not die of AIDS, 42 yr. for those 1,476 who supposedly did; and 55 yr. for 143 lesbians. On average, ever-married men outlived the ever-homosexually-partnered by 23 years in Denmark (74 yr. v. 51 yr.), and 25 years in Norway (77 yr. v. 52 yr.); ever-married women outlived the ever-homosexually-partnered in Denmark by 22 years (78 yr. v. 56 yr.), and in Norway by almost 25 years (81 yr. v. 56 yr.). http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2007_doc...lFootprint.pdf","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","05:03 AM","gay-rights-debates","57"

I am posting it in full, followed by my original email of April 4th to the EPA. I followed up with another email on the 7th, to which Dr. Hineline kindly responds. Dear Jim Burroway, Following up on your message of 7 April, the following is a statement suitable for public distribution, provided that quotations from it are not lifted out of context. Thank you for bringing the matter to our attention. Phil Hineline Paul Cameron and Kirk Cameron have posted for circulation a controversial and lengthy manuscript that purports, via the tagline at the bottom each page, to be the account of a presentation at the March 2007 meeting of the Eastern Psychological Assocition. The title of that manuscript, as well as its main emphasis, focuses upon an issue that was not present in the title nor was it in the supporting materials that were submitted by the Camerons for a poster presentation at EPA. The submitted title, which appears in the EPA printed program, is: Federal distortion of homosexual footprint. The accompanying Abstract asserts that the proportion of the Canadian population identified as lesbian, gay and bisexual is substantially lowered if adults over age 60 are included than if they are excluded from the sample. The asserted implication is that federal agencies are exaggerating the size of the homosexual proportion of the population by excluding adults over 60 from the assessments. In contrast, the manuscript at issue carries the title: Federal Distortion Of Homosexual Footprint (Ignoring early Gay Death?). Two of the three paragraphs in its accompanying Abstract focus upon the topic of the added parenthetical phrase, which is an inference indeed a topic that was not present in the materials submitted to EPA. Irrespective of its potential for controversy, it is highly unlikely that the augmented/altered version would have been accepted for presentation, for there clearly are many reasons other than differential longevity that could result in the under-reporting of homosexuals over 60. Whatever its content, even the format of the manuscript to which the EPA identification has been affixed a manuscript of more than 7000 words plus three tables and six graphs, would have been completely inappropriate as a poster presentation, which was the venue in which Dr. Cameron proposed to participate in the meeting. To clarify the relevant history and circumstances: After putting out the call for submissions to be proposed for the EPA meeting, we typically receive over 700 submissions as was the case this year. These submissions are divided into categories (e.g. Animal Learning, Social psychology, etc ..) and each section is reviewed by a volunteer on the program committee. As each submission typically has at least two authors, vetting authors against other organizations lists of people with problematic ethical records is simply an impossibility, especially given the time-frame of preparations for an annual convention. For acceptance, a work had to be complete, be methodologically sound using proper data collection techniques and/or experimental methods, the conclusions had to be derivable from the presented results, and the topic deemed to be one that could stimulate interest and discussion among those attending the meeting. The submission by Dr. Cameron indicated that there was a possibility that the prevalence of homosexuals in the population had been overestimated by previous techniques. Data were presented, reportedly using a broader defined sample than that used by government agencies, which indicated that the prevalence of homosexuality in the population was smaller than had been previously suggested. The submission by Dr. Cameron was for a poster presentation, and it was accepted as a poster, not as a paper or address. Whatever the Camerons ultimately presented, occurred in an hour-long poster session among approximately 70 posters. There was nothing in the materials submitted by the author for review by EPA that indicated that the work could, or would, be informative with respect to the longevity of homosexuals.

Nothing I have posted is from a gay advocacy source. It was posted at such a site, but it is a letter from the Eastern Psychological Association which is not a gay advocacy site. What do you think lifesite is??? It has an anti-gay agenda, and an agenda of propping up liars like Cameron. Birds of a feather. You would know all about that too, as I've already said. Cameron's claims were merely part of a poster session, and did not recieve proper vetting. As well, the EPA in its own letter casts doubts as to his methodology and logic. The boxturtle's arguments are sound: Regarding the Canadian Sample: ""But regardless of the explanation, when the total number of unknowns outnumber the number of self-acknowledged gays, lesbians and bisexuals by a factor of six, this high level of uncertainty calls into serious question the accuracy of the much lower number."" Regarding the Danish sample: ""Why is this important? The heterosexual sample has been accumulating under-forties for an entire century. (In 2005, the average age of the groom was 37.4 years; for the bride, 34.7 years.15) But registered same-sex partnerships have only been available in Denmark since 1989, which means the gay sample got a late start. And if the typical age of someone entering into a same-sex partnership is around forty, then it stands to reason that the typical age at death of someone who has died so far would be similarly young. ............... In other words, Camerons sample only captured those who died so far, out of a sample that continues to live and grow older without dying.""
