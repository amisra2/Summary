"05-27-2010","13537",41,"Sigma","403281","Whether herosexual people have the same rights as homosexual people is not a gender rights issue, it's a gay-rights issue. Remember our variable? If the variable is sexual orientation ( not gender) then the two groups have equal rights. Marriage itself will be less meaningful when you take away the historic and cultural meaning. Yes, it is a bit funny that way. Homosexual people are fighting so hard to be included in the meaning of marriage but forget that, by including themselves in marriage, marriage will lose that meaning. It's a catch-22. When you have strip marriage down to just it's legal meaning in order to include homosexual relationships, homosexual relationships won't get the historic and cultural meaning they crave.","Addison48","403283","Just answer the question.

Answer the question please.","Sigma","403290","Well, no, pretty clearly you've argued that different sexual orientations, like different races, were being denied rights. Unless you're changing your argument, I am on point by disputing that homosexual people have fewer rights than heterosexual people. Whether gender equality requires identical treatment is outside the purview of my argument in this thread. My argument in this thread addresses whether homosexual people and heterosexual people have equal rights. If you no longer wish to discuss this issue then that is your choice.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","12:34 PM","gay-rights-debates","604"

The rights argument was an argument for legalizing same sex marriage. Just like the gender one. Now Im only going to ask this one more time. All I want is an answer. Given the information that you have on same sex marriage do you think that it should be legal or not. I cannot for the life of me why you go through such great strides to not answer the question. Edit: BTW gay people are being kept from their rights because same sex marriage isnt legal. So are straight people. Because really all you have shown me is that it isnt just gay people that are being denied the right to marry someone of the same sex but also straight people are being denied the ability to marry someone of the same sex. So how about that?","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","12:47 PM","gay-rights-debates","605"
"05-27-2010","13537",41,"Sigma","403254","The burden of proof is on those who want to change the status quo :P However, marriage has traditionally been a formalization of heterosexual relationships. Since heterosexual relationships are the sole type that can reproduce, it would seem they have a purpose of value that homosexual relationships do not. That is a valid reason, imo, to resist changing marriage. Or did you mean legally?","JWilliam","403301","Of course I mean legally.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","01:48 PM","gay-rights-debates","606"
"05-27-2010","13537",41,"Sigma","403256","Yes, and the rationale you initially presented to me was that homosexual people somehow lacked rights that heterosexual people have. That is the sole point I am disputing. Gender rights are outside the purview of my discussion in this thread. Gay-rights proponents need to trivialize marriage. The historical and cultural meaning has not included homosexuals, therefore this meaning has to be disregarded in order to advance the argument that there is no reason to bar homosexual marriage.","JWilliam","403304","We have already agreed that gender rights are what the gay marriage debate is really about. How about we debate the issue and not the semantics of the issue? Historical meanings are not a valid defense. People have believed a lot of things throughout history. You cannot say that because something wasn't historically relevant that it must be applied the same way today. Cultural significance has been known to change. Again not a valid defense. Furthermore, marriage does not need to be trivialized in order to allow sam sex marriage. Marriage is composed of two sides emtion (religion,culture and love) and law (legal benefits). Only one of which is being denied to same sex couples. Homosexuals are not trying to reduce the meaning of marriage to purely a legal one. It's the legal significance that they are unable to obtain. Homosexual people are not being denied the ability to love one another. They are being denied the ability to be married legally. This is why all they are fighting for is the legal side of marriage. You can't really have it both ways. The reason marriage is meaningful is related to heterosexual relationships. That meaning is necessarily removed if homosexual marriage is allowed. Whether this is a ""good"" or ""bad"" thing is not something I'm arguing, but it will change the meaning of marriage.[/QUOTE]","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","02:05 PM","gay-rights-debates","607"

Since you still seem to think that homosexual people are denied rights that heterosexual people have, I'm still trying to convince you. The fact that you want to start arguing something else does not mean I must do the same. Yes, the 'rights' argument was an argument that homosexual people were denied rights because they cannot marry other homosexual people. I dispute that this is a right. Gender equality is its own animal that has far-reaching consequences outside the purview of my argument. Then you agree that homosexual people have the same rights as heterosexual people? That homosexual people are not denied any rights because they are homosexual? That's quite a reversal of the typical gay-rights position.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","02:41 PM","gay-rights-debates","608"

I am asserting that homosexual people and heterosexual people have the same rights. This exemplifies what I'm talking about. ""Marriage is changable it has no set meaning"", ""marriage is just a legal agreement"", etc etc. This trivializes the importance of marriage (which SCOTUS termed fundamental to our survival) and, through marriage, the importance of heterosexual relationships since the concept of marriage has traditionally been entwined with heterosexual relationships (ie, being in love and having children). To deny that marriage has traditionally been a formalized heterosexual relationship is ridiculous. They cannot be so easily separated. I'll try to explain what I mean. Homosexuals have not been a part of what gives marriage meaning, so to change marriage to include them renders the cultural and historical meaning irrelevent in today's society. As a society we would be essentially saying ""marriage has no more importance than a legal agreement between two people"". To resist this idea is a valid position to take.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","02:56 PM","gay-rights-debates","609"

"05-29-2010","13537",41,"Sigma","403204","It's not difficult. Heterosexuals can marry for love, they can marry for political reasons, they can marry for the benefits, they can marry for whatever reason under the sun. The legal requirements of marriage have nothing to do with the reasons to marry. The historic and cultural meaning of marriage can say which reason is more or less valid, but not the legal requirements. Seeing ""your unborn children in her eyes"", for example, is a culturally valid reason to get married, but it certainly is not one of the legal requirements. I realize that homosexuals are not attracted to members of the opposite sex and so they don't want to get married. However , that is not the same thing as being legally barred from marriage. Since we're talking about what rights heterosexual people have versus what rights homosexual people have, the only logical conclusion is that both groups have the same rights since marrying whomever you love is not a right.","Shooterandproud","403413","And I understand that. But of those reasons, homosexuals cannot marry for love, and love is one of the most important reasons for marriage. Gay marriage is illegal. The fact that homosexuals cannot marry is more de facto than it is legal, but it is de facto because of the laws on the books. The end result is the same: fellow Americans are being denied essential freedoms to the pursuit of happiness, and that is just sad.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","03:37 PM","gay-rights-debates","611"

(Heterosexuals included.) So the point about 'marrying for love' is sorta, well, irrelevant.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","07:42 PM","gay-rights-debates","612"

However, traditionally, having children (meaning: heterosexual relationships) is also the reason for marriage, in addition to love. The two are entwined in the ""societal view"", if you will, of marriage. Keep in mind that you're trying to justify a change to a custom using a traditional meaning of that custom (love), when the traditional meaning (having biological children) specifically excludes homosexuals. It is a contradictory argument. It is hard to argue that homosexual people are denied any rights when they have the very same rights that heterosexual people have. You want to change the laws to marry whom you love, but marrying whom you love is not a right for anyone . That is not to say the laws shouldn't change, only that you haven't a right to those changes.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","05:22 AM","gay-rights-debates","613"
