"11-13-2009","13537",8,"gansao","378063","Gay sex is not normal. it is deviant..saying that anal sex is common among straights does not make anal sex right. You cannot compare a XXXX job with anal sex. You think that a girl sticking her finger in a boys bottom is sodomy? The likelyhood of a boy persuading a girl to do it let alone a butt plug is zero. So maybe you should be getting out more ..or doing less daydreaming Discrimination against another coloured person is wrong, discrimination against sexual perverts is fair and correct. Allowing gays to marry would be an acceptance of gay sex..it should not be accepted. Tatchell spilled the beans, you are just backpeddling on Tatchells behalf","jazyjason","378151","So now of course your true motives and prejudice is unmasked. You think of once again like Easyrider, or Archie, that being gay is only about the sexual intercourse between those people and constitutes nothing more. Because of your ideals and misconceptions that gravitate towards sex only, you refuse to see any other evidence or elements that make up a gay person. You just said that gay sex is deviant, and you also connect two monogamous people to nothing more than the carnal action between them. And you go further as to say that accepting gays marrying means you MUST accept what they do in the bedroom. Nothing could be further from the truth, and once again I find you blatant inclinations of pedophilia and their sick promoters to be compared or aligned with those of the gay community You do not have to accept anything of gay people. You do not have to attend our weddings, you can voice your opinion otherwise, and no one is forcing you to partake of a gay wedding either! And as far as what people do in the bedroom that is their business period. I know of some strait people that do things WAY out of the realm of vanilla sexual intercourse. What I find most disturbing is you generalize all gay people as promoting pedophilia or worse, secretly doing so. I for one think pedophilia is a horrible crime and should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. Also what about those gay couples that raise children? Or those that are fathers and mothers from a previous relationship? Do you think that with all the fights to even have the right to adopt that these people would support pedophilia? Do you actually think that these couples that have done everything just to obtain the right to adopt which by the way was revoked last year in Arkansas, would have any desire toward pedophilia or supporting them with them being loving caring parents? NO! These couples would be marching in anger if any such laws or bogus claims you made came to fruition! JUST because you revile and can only contemplate in your minuscule mind that which people do in the bedroom, you cannot comprehend the broader spectrum of peoples lives. Your shallow claims of what is no doubt YOUR personal opinion and your generalization based upon stigma, stereotype, and prejudice can only be said to be narrow minded at the slightest. So before you rant and fire of a few more nut filled posts why don't you step back and realize that being gay for one is not all about sex. Two, is about love and cherishing each other including our families. And that what people do in the bedroom strait or gay is private, and is ludicrous to judge a group of people just upon those actions.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","03:41 PM","gay-rights-debates","107"
"11-13-2009","13537",8,"foundit66","378099","Typically, the reasons condemning ""anal sex"" would also apply to the XXXX job. Does anal sex procreate? Is there any indication that the penise was ""made for"" (as some people would put it) the mouth? If you look up the definition of sodomy, you'll see that anal sex (heterosexual as well) IS sodomy. Maybe you should get out more. I've had plenty of guys tell me how them about doing that with their girl-friend. They thought it was hot and made the sex more exciting. One researcher, who surveyed one group of people in the 1970s then another in the late 1980s, offers a good point of comparison. In the first survey, 25 percent of women had anal sex and 8 percent reported engaging in it regularly. In the second, 72 percent had anal sex, and 23 percent reported engaging in it regularly. Anal Sex Statistics - Data on the Prevalence of Heterosexual Anal Sex That is your opinion based on your own personal prejudices. Unless your prejudice comes with a legitimate state interest for legal enactment, it has no place in the law. Gays can legally marry in Massachusetts. Do you think everybody there ""accepts"" gays? Allowing people the right of marriage is not a sign of ""acceptance"". I could give you DOZENS of examples of old men / young women, students marrying their teachers after they hit 18, drunken quicky marriages in Las Vegas with a Elvis priest, etc, etc, etc... Marriage is NOT about ""acceptance""...","gansao","378165","Reasons for condemning anal sex do not apply to a XXXX job..if you think ramming a penis into a rectum is like a XXXX job your anual cavity must be shot. I never said that heterosexual anal sex was not sodomy..you just didnt read my posts. Gayhumanist said that girls could bugger boys..once again you either could not read or did not understand what you were reading. Anal sex or XXXX jobs or any other sex...between a man and a woman is not comparable to two men having sex..two men having sex is deviant sex. My 'prejudice' is shared by the majority of the people ..hard luck. Allowing gays to 'marry' is the road to men 'marrying, their daughters,women' marrying' their sons and shepherds 'marrying' their flocks . They are sexual deviants and so are you.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","05:52 PM","gay-rights-debates","108"

Gay men have gay sex with other gay men.

"11-13-2009","13537",8,"gayhumanist","378187","The point was, gays do the same things as straights, sexually. Yes, when done with gusto... Maybe the girl persuaded the boy. I don't have to daydream. I didn't come up with this myself. Heterosexuals are quite open about what they do sexually. ... Who is to say what's a pervert? This is just rhetoric like racism. There's no reason to support it.... It's very simple. Don't accept two men having sex? Don't have sex with a man if you're a man, or sex with a woman if you're a woman. Why do you care if it's generally accepted?.... That is ridiculous. Just like saying that law professor spilled the beans on a conspiracy by all law professors.","gansao","378191","No they dont. they do things with people of the same sex as themselves No amount of putting your pinkie in someones bottom is sodomy just as no amount of putting your finger in a vagina is sexual intercourse..get over it I think you did come up with it all by yourself people who have gay sex are perverts Because it is perverted sex no it isnt","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","08:49 PM","gay-rights-debates","112"
"11-13-2009","13537",8,"gayhumanist","378189","He didn't say they were the same thing. A penis needn't be rammed in to a rectum either, and haven't you heard of deep-throating? I guess you haven't been that lucky? . Deviant how? Statistically? A lot of sex can fall into that category. Saying it's morally deviant without a reason, is as subjective as it gets. Again, don't do it, if it's not for you.. I doubt it. Get hard, get lucky, whether you're gay or straight.. That's what you claim. However, it hasn't happened in any of the countries where gay marriage is legal. Again you can call a lot of things deviant by the fact that the majority don't do it, or the fact that you simply look down your nose at it or secretely want it. That's too broad and subjective a comparison.","gansao","378194","OOH bitchy ay? Its worse than I thought you actually dont know your a*se from your mouth Any sexual activity between two men is deviant sex Two men getting hard and lucky on each other is not approved by most people, believe me. This is the bit that amuses me! When the gay starts losing an argument they start implying that the objector is a closet homosexual.. 50 years ago it would be ridiculous to contemplate two Homosexuals 'marrying'.nowdays it may well become reality. The pedophiles are rubbing their hands no doubt","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","08:58 PM","gay-rights-debates","113"
"11-13-2009","13537",8,"gayhumanist","378196","It doesn't matter how they relate to one another in terms of being a man or a woman, they are doing the same things. Main Entry: sexual intercourse Function: noun Date: 1799 1 : heterosexual intercourse involving penetration of the vagina by the penis : coitus 2 : intercourse (as anal or oral intercourse) that does not involve penetration of the vagina by the penis No, I don't have that great an imagination, and you have too poor of one. Great circular fallacies there.

"11-14-2009","13537",8,"gayhumanist","378219","I find that hard to believe, as you kept replying.. Your ilk always gets the balls rolling on these conversations. No one is asking you to butt in on other's sex lives, nor to give it a single thought. As usual, some doth protest too much.","gansao","378228","You kept denying what was patently true As I have inadvently fed your fantasy of small girls inserting their fingers into boys bottoms( retch!) I will conclude what is perfectly obvious to anyone but the indulgers of perverted sex. Gay sex, incest, pedophilia and sex between animals and people are all sexual perversions. therefore the people that indulge in those practices are sexual perverts. To allow sexual perverts to 'marry' is a travesty. To allow them to bring up children is a crime in itself.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","05:14 AM","gay-rights-debates","120"
