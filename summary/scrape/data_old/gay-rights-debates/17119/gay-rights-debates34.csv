"08-25-2013","17119",34,"daewoo","476949","Originally Posted by Easyrider The Islamic faith does not believe that Jesus is divine. And if they thought he was a prophet why didnt they believe him when he said no one comes to the Father except through him? They did believe him. Thar is why he is the second most quoted prophet in the Qur'an (the first being Moses). They also believed him when he repeatedly said he was NOT divine....and when he said that the old laws (laws from the old testament such as dietary laws) STILL APPLY. You are the one who apparently did not believe Jesus.","Easyrider","476952","LOL! What a screwball set of statements. Islamists don't believe Jesus is divine and the only way to the Father. Here's what they (and you) have ignored regarding the deity of Jesus: The Deity of Jesus Christ in Scripture The Righter Report He (Jesus) existed in the form of God before His incarnation and was equal with God the Father (Philippians 2:5-7) Do they believe Jesus is their Lord and Savior for the remission of their sins? Heck no. Instead they're burning churches in Egypt and elsewhere. So save your screwball theology for somebody who believes your swill.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","11:18 AM","gay-rights-debates","496"

Do they believe Jesus is their Lord and Savior for the remission of their sins? Heck no. Instead they're burning churches in Egypt and elsewhere.","daewoo","476967","Not according to Jesus. We have been over this, sleazy. I have provided multiple quotes from the bible from Jesus and God, every single one of them stating unequivocally that Jesus is not god. In every single one of the gospels Jesus states without reservation that he is not god. Can you explain why Paul is likely to be a more accurate source than Jesus or God himself? Was Jesus a liar, easy? That is what you are saying here...that Jesus just flat out LIED and Paul, who never even met Jesus, knew the REAL truth. Also, are you aware that Philippians 2:5-7 properly reads: The passage was used heavily by the Cathars who believed that Jesus was not divine, but was the human form of an angel. They came to that conclusion because...welll....that is what the bible says in this instance. In the 1600s the church put the matter to rest....by changing the bible. When the king james translation was done, they changed the passage, despite the fact they knew it was wrong, to reflect official church dogma, even though it was in direct opposition to what the passage actually said. So much for ""infallible bible"". Oh, and so much for your silly argument. No. They sure dont. They believe that Jesus was the Christ. They believe that because that is what he claimed to be.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","06:06 PM","gay-rights-debates","498"

You're full of cr*p. Jesus even calls himself Lord of the Sabbath and ""I AM."" Virtually every Christian denomination in America recognizes Jesus as God. Here's some more evidences you can try to ignore. Is Jesus God? What do the Scriptures say? John 1:23 quotes Isaiah 40:3 as saying John the Baptist was to prepare the way for the LORD (Jehovah). John prepared the way before Jesus so Jesus must be LORD (Jehovah). In Isaiah 44:8 God is the only Rock. Psalm 18:31 says, Who is the Rock except our God? I Corinthians 10:4, identifies Jesus as the Rock. Jesus must also then be God the Rock. Isaiah 44:24 says that God (Jehovah) is the one who has made all things. Colossians 1:16, speaking of Christ, says that all things were created by Him and for him. Jesus must therefore be Jehovah God. In Jeremiah 10:10 it says the LORD (Jehovah) is the true God. I John 5:20 states that Jesus is the true God. Jesus must be the true God. Isaiah 43:10,11 says that I, even I, am the LORD; and there is no savior besides Me. Jesus is the Savior (Matthew 1:21, Titus 2:13; 2 Peter 1:1, etc., etc.). Jesus must be God the Savior. Jehovah knows all things (Psalm 147:5). Jesus knows all things. (John 16:30). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah alone is the only one who knows the hearts of all men. (1 Kings 8:39; Jeremiah 17:9-10). Jesus knows the hearts of all men. (John 2:24-25; Rev. 2:18, 23). Jesus must be God. Jehovah is our sanctifier. (Exodus 31:13). Jesus sanctifies us (Hebrews 10:10). Only God is the sanctifier of men. Jesus must be God. Jehovah is our peace (Judges 6:23). Jesus is our peace (Ephesians 2:14). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah is our righteousness (Jeremiah 23:6). Jesus is our righteousness. (Romans 3:21-22; 1 Corinthians 1:30). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah is the giver of life who will not allow His people to be delivered / snatched out of His hand (Deuteronomy 32:39). Jesus is the giver of life who will not allow His people to be snatched out of His hand. (John 10:28). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovahs voice is like the roar of rushing waters (Ezekiel 43:2). Jesus voice was like the sound of rushing waters (Revelation 1:15). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah is present everywhere.(Proverbs 15:3; Jeremiah 23:24; I Kings 8:27); Jesus is omnipresent (John 1:48; Matthew 18:20; 28:20). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovahs nature does not change (Malachi 3:6). Jesus nature does not change. (Hebrews 13:8). Jehovah is the only God we are to serve(2 Kings 17:35); Jesus (identified as the Creator in Colossians 1:16-17) is to be served (Colossians 3:24). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah the Lord is to be set apart as holy (Isaiah 8:12b-13). Jesus, as Lord, is to be set apart as holy (1 Peter 3:14b-15a). Jehovahs glory is not to be given to another (Isaiah 42:8). Jesus shares Jehovahs glory (John 17:5). Jesus must be Jehovah. Gods name is Jehovah (or YahwehYHWH Isaiah 42:8). Jesus has Jehovahs name (John 17:11; John 16:14-15). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah is the mighty God (Jeremiah 32:17-18; Isaiah 10:20-21). Jesus is the mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) who is Almighty (Revelation 1:7-8). Jehovah is the first and the last (Isaiah 44:6; 48:12). Jesus is the first and the last (Revelation 1:17-18; 22:12-13, 20). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah is the Alpha and the Omega (Revelation 1:8; Revelation 21:6-7). Jesus is the Alpha and the Omega (Revelation 22:12-13, 20). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovahs title is the Holy One (Isaiah 47:4). Jesus is the Holy One (Acts 3:14; John 6:69). Jesus must be Jehovah, the Holy One. Jehovah is the stumbling stone of Israel (Isaiah 8:13-15). Jesus is the stumbling stone of Israel (1 Peter 2:6-8). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah is the great Judge who gives life to whom he wishes and who renders to each man according to his deeds (Psalm 98:9; Deuteronomy 32:39; Jeremiah 17:9-10). Jesus is the only judge who gives life to whom he wishes and renders to each man according to his deeds (John 5:21-22; Revelation 2:18, 23). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah is the great shepherd who leads his people to the spring of the water of life (Psalm 23:1-2; Revelation 21:6-7). Jesus as the shepherd of His people, leads them to springs of the water of life (John 10:11-18; Revelation 7:17). THERE IS ONLY ONE SHEPHERD John 10:16. Jehovah is Lord of Lords (Deuteronomy 10:17). Jesus is Lord of Lords. (Revelation 17:14; 19:16). The Father is Lord of all (Matthew 11:25; Acts 17:24). Jesus is Lord of all. (Acts 10:36). THERE IS ONLY ONE LORD (Jude 4) . Jehovah created the universe (Psalm 102:25-27). Jesus created the universe (John 1:3; Colossians 1:15-19; Hebrews 1:10-12). THERE IS ONLY ONE CREATOR. (Isaiah 44:24). Jesus must be Jehovah.
