One of the reasons Obama cited for his support of gay marriage was that we ought to ""...you know, treat others the way you would want to be treated"" (the Golden Rule). That's pathetic. Under that standard we ought to respect people who practice pedophilia, because that's how they would want to be treated. Same with adulterers, people who practice incest, etc. Obama is the most Biblically-challenged President I think we've ever had. Any Christian or Bible-believing Jew who supports this man is a spiritually bankrupt reprobate.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:14 PM","gay-rights-debates","1"

They're whooping it up like it's the coming of the Messiah. Oh! Obama has now completed his EVOLUTION on the subject. Actually the air head flip-flopped. Evidently liberal butt heads evolve, but conservatives flip flop. Liberal numbskulls.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","09:23 PM","gay-rights-debates","2"

The Washington Post reports that Thirty-eight states prohibit gay marriage in some fashion. Even in blue states like California, Oregon and Delaware, gay marriage bans stand. How do you like them apples? I'm quite sure the majority of the neanderthals in Sodom and Gomorrah supported gay unions also. Here's another one for you: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Thursday she supports same-sex marriage because her Catholic faith compels her to be against discrimination of any kind. Too bad for Pelosi that the Catholic Catechism says homosexuality should not be approved. The Catholic Church thus teaches: ""Basing itself on sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered. They are contrary to the natural law. They close the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved"" (Catechism of the Catholic Church 2357). Not only that, but if that ding bat Pelosi is against discrimination of any kind, then she has to embrace pedophiles, adulterers, people who practice incest, etc., etc. And that's the top of the party liberal mentality. Imbeciles.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:30 PM","gay-rights-debates","4"

Imbeciles. PRINCETON, NJ -- For the first time in Gallup's tracking of the issue, a majority of Americans (53%) believe same-sex marriage should be recognized by the law as valid, with the same rights as traditional marriages. Support for legal gay marriage decreases markedly with age, ranging from 70% support among those aged 18 to 34 Republicans in particular seem fixed in their opinions; there was no change at all in their support level this year, while independents' and Democrats' support jumped by double-digit margins.","daewoo","454801","For First Time, Majority of Americans Favor Legal Gay Marriage Retard.

You left wing radicals always were fond of people taking it in the shorts, which is why you support big government, which does it 300 million people at a time. The fact is gay sex is an abomination according to the Word of God, and gay marriage is simply institutionalized sin. So go back to your bath house and ponder that for a while.

Oral arguments lasted less than 90 minutes, and the supreme court made the unusual choice of issuing a ruling the same day as the oral arguments which repealed ALL of those laws and provisions in state constitutions. Even Thom Tillis, who spearheaded the effort to amend the North Carolina constitution to ban gay marriage said: The fact is that the ignorant religious fanatics have lost this one. You guys did a great job of getting in there and getting laws against it passed before the public really had time to solidify their opinion enough to bother to go to the polls, but you have lost the PR war.

And thus sayeth the Word of God: Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error. Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done. Although they know Gods righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them. - Romans chapter 1","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:01 PM","gay-rights-debates","8"
"05-11-2012","17119",1,"None","None","None","Easyrider","454865","In an interview with ABC News on Wednesday, Obama said that his daughters have friends whose parents are same-sex couples. There have been times where Michelle and I have been sitting around the dinner table and were talking about their friends and their parents and Malia and Sasha, it wouldnt dawn on them that somehow their friends parents would be treated differently, Obama said. It doesnt make sense to them and, frankly, thats the kind of thing that prompts a change in perspective. Real nice Obama. You trade in the Word of God and thousands of years of tradition for what a couple of Biblically-constipated teenagers think? You're a friggin mess. And those who think like you.

How you continue to cry such hypocrisy as "" Big Government"", ""Keep Government out of our Lives"", Liberals always want to tell people how to Live, etc... Yet you don't blink twice as you XXXX away the Constitution by forcing your religious views of Marriage onto others. You don't care if you trample on someone elses rights or if the Government passes Laws to limit something that YOU feel goes against your own personal Religion. Your definition of Marriage being that of a Marriage between 1 man and 1 woman is blown away by your own book of fairy tales, but you don't complain when the Government outlaws Polygamy. You people need to wake up and realize that the world does not revolve around Your religion nor your God. Secularism is spreading, and maybe not in my lifetime nor yours will it happen but one day religion will be the minority , then you right wing fanatics can cry foul as a secular society forces their will on you.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","11:55 PM","gay-rights-debates","10"
