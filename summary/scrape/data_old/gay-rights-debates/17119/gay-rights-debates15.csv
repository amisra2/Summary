He might even be an alien, and not a smart one.","Accipiter","474260","I am beginning to think that your whole story about having a son is just more of your lies. Obviously you feel cheated by life or you would have a brighter outlook. The first step is admitting your pain publicly but you will not do that because you are a cowered and that is why Jesus hates your guts.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","04:49 AM","gay-rights-debates","211"

What kind of message do you think that sends out? Never mind you dont think so an answer would be pointless and I bet it is.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","11:43 AM","gay-rights-debates","213"

"06-26-2013","17119",15,"Easyrider","454800","Nice try. 32 states have had ballot initiatives on gay marriage and the pro gay marriage side has lost every time. The Washington Post reports that Thirty-eight states prohibit gay marriage in some fashion. Even in blue states like California, Oregon and Delaware, gay marriage bans stand. How do you like them apples?","Xcaliber","474755","Looks like your apples turned into Lemons there Ezridden.... How do you feel now that the Republican Majority Supreme Court has stricken down DOMA as unconstitutional?....","obama-supports-gay-marriage","12:04 PM","gay-rights-debates","216"

With the matter concerning Proposition Eight the defendants were found not to have standing to challenge. That is not the same as determining it is constitutional. It is merely a setback and able to be challenged again at a later date.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","01:17 PM","gay-rights-debates","217"

Today's rulings do nothing to state that homosexual marriage is constitutional in nature.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","06:10 PM","gay-rights-debates","219"

It's just a matter of time before they get around to striking down all such Laws including the ones on the State level.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","09:21 AM","gay-rights-debates","221"
