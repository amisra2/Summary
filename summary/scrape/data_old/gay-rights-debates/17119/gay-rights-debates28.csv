"07-05-2013","17119",28,"Easyrider","475403","Listen, the government does their budgets all the time (except for when Obama is remiss in submitting one) and there's always lots of things I don't like in them. If you have a more specific question just lay it out for us. It depends on if you want a Biblically-based response or not. I don't believe you ever answered my previous question: Have you ever read the entire Bible?","Hdreams","475410","I asked your opinion and view EZ... You made a strong statement about the need for defense and funding the war oversea's... I simply asked if you value that above schooling/education and healthcare... And the answer i want is yours... Correct me if im wrong but the Bible is meant to be a lifestyle, a guide to how to live a fruitful, virtuous and good life (In the service of God/Jesus etc). If this is the case then your viewpoint should be shaped by the bible not dictated by it. The bible as you said doesn't talk about many things such as economics etc, and is vague to say the least about most aspects of life. Presumably then it aims to equip people to have a viewpoint which they can then apply. So i am asking you, not the bible, not the Evangelical guide... but you... And in answer to your response yes, i have read the bible, only once though. But then there are many books i have read only once. Can you answer my question, have you read V for Vendetta?","obama-supports-gay-marriage","01:46 PM","gay-rights-debates","407"

The less threat the more we can probably spend on education, etc. And vice versa. No. Was there a point from it you wished to make that is at least a little bit spellbinding?","obama-supports-gay-marriage","02:09 PM","gay-rights-debates","408"
"07-05-2013","17119",28,"Hdreams","475413","If you go back and re-read what i asked. would you disagree with swapping the ratio's of spending between defense and schools/healthcare. This would mean receiving completely free schooling for all from kindergarten to college and postgraduate, the best healthcare system in the world which would also be completely free for all citizens and still you would have the largest defense budget on the planet. The same point that a secularist would get from the bible.","Easyrider","475416","No, and the reason is we can't afford to keep America secure and give everybody everything you mentioned above. What you want sounds nice but is impractical. What point is that?","obama-supports-gay-marriage","02:47 PM","gay-rights-debates","410"

If you are justifying Israeli actions on the land belonging to them, why aren't you fighting for America to be given back to the Native peoples?","obama-supports-gay-marriage","05:46 PM","gay-rights-debates","411"

As i said, if you swapped the ratios you could do all the things i mentioned and still have the largest and most technologically advanced military force on the planet. My question is why you dont agree with doing this? and place a higher emphasis on the military than education and health when the U.S military is already larger in terms of budget spending than the entire rest of the G20 combined.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","07:43 PM","gay-rights-debates","412"

And I'd be willing to take a lot of the money we give out to illegal aliens and promoting/defending gay sex sin, etc., and instead use it on defense and securing our border. As for education, the it's not so much the amount of money we spend, because we spend plenty; it's the bevy of lazy and incompetent school administrators and their curricula that screw up the kid's educations. You can't even fire some of these incompetent educators because of the unions and seniority issues.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","11:34 PM","gay-rights-debates","413"

You are a big Darwin fan, aren't you? On the other hand, there are no native Americans to speak of. The so-called American Indians that were here when the Europeans came, previously arrived here over the Bering Strait. By the way, who was in Spain first so you can give Spain back to them?","obama-supports-gay-marriage","11:40 PM","gay-rights-debates","414"

Let me put you right on it so that you don't appear to everyone as a complete mo ron. It says that those species that are greater able to adapt to a changing environment are more likely to survive. That, by no means, is saying that the 'strongest will survive'. If a mouse is able to adapt to changes in it's environment and an elephant can't, the mouse will survive and the elephant will not; yet the elephant is far stronger than the mouse. Got it now dumbo? Do try some reading on it instead of making an utter idiot of yourself every time you open your mouth about it. In civilised societies (as opposed to the 'animal kingdom'), 'might' does not mean 'right'. There are laws in place to govern and Israel is breaking them with the support of America. Israel has it's own land, 'given' to them by the UN. Since the late 1940's they have persistently invaded Palestine, stolen land in order to build settlements and ousted the legal owners of that land. They have acted despicably and maggots like you should hang their head in shame for supporting them. Not particularly. Darwin got the basics right but we have progressed considerably since his day...well, some of us have. Even if there were only a handful, they have a greater right to the land than you. If they were to start taking your home, you would have no problem with it then? Iberians...that's why it's called Spain/Iberia.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","03:18 AM","gay-rights-debates","415"

As far as I recall, the only lands Israel annexed are those where enemies of Israel attacked them and lost. And when they've invaded areas like Lebanon it's because they were attacking Israel first. That's the penalty the attacking imbeciles pay. So stick that in your uneducated rump. Anybody who screws with Israel is going to get screwed worse in return. Why don't you fly your portly-a*s over to your pro-Palestinian friends and explain that to them. They're obviously too ignorant to figure it out. Sorry, sport, but the law says you're full of it. Go see that left-wing, pro-Sodomite porker Kagan in the Supreme Court and see if you can work that out.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","07:24 AM","gay-rights-debates","417"

Perhaps they were extending the friendly hand of the church to the gay community? perhaps educating gently about the sins and salvation's of the Christian god or were they doing what most of these guys do at LGBT events. By that i mean screaming sin and shame, pointing at the defilers and screaming that they are going to burn forever and expand the list of punishments for effect, quoting random hateful and outdated passages from their little book, perhaps organising locals into a counter mob to shout, point, scream, sneer and laugh at the apparent vulgarity. If i walk into a room of marines and take the XXXX, id expect to get a few barrels of xxxx knocked out of me. Why should it be any different for a preacher, if he is stupid enough to do that then he deserves hat he gets. I dont agree with the violence but that's the way it is, also it is gay violence so in reality he probly just got a serious slapping... This cracked me up Its not the first time Christians have been attacked by pro-gay activists. You turn up to a gay pride march and then are suprised when people take offense to you calling them peverse, sinful and wicked.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","07:33 AM","gay-rights-debates","418"
