"07-01-2013","17119",21,"Easyrider","475086","Where does he tell us not to influence politics, etc.? I think you need to read the following article - The Biblical basis for Christians in politics: America's Christian Heritage Did you know that in Romans chapter 13, government authorities are called ""God's servants"" (v. 3-4)? Have you ever heard the old saying, ""The only thing required for evil to triumph is for good men to say and do nothing""? Have you ever read what Martin Luther wrote - ""Every institution in which men are not increasingly occupied with the Word of God must become corrupt."" Have you never read what the Founding Fathers wrote? The Moral Foundations of America The Righter Report If you really want to do gays a favor, go convert them to Christ.","ANorveyanFellow","475130","Not saying we're not supposed to be involved in politics, I just said I'd thought about it. I am firmly of the belief you are taking the issue of homosexuality far too extremely. Personally I'm far more troubled by the mass social idolization of sexuality in general that pervades our society. Just from the way you talk, it sounds like you honestly hate gays, which disturbs me. Or if you don't hate them, that you seem to hold them on some level far beneath you. Tell me, what do you think of gay people? Do you hate them, or hold them in some contempt?","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:20 PM","gay-rights-debates","301"
"07-01-2013","17119",21,"ANorveyanFellow","475129","Just like to comment on this one, you are absolutely right saying it is not fair at all. That's the point though, the whole salvation thing is about grace and grace alone.","smiley","475135","Then any claim that this god is 'just' is complete rubbish. It's a shame that bible doesn't make this clear. One part says it's works that matter, another claims belief is the only thing that matters, but now you claim that it's just the whim of a petty-minded, jealous, psychotic being, one that must not be questioned in any way. Not the kind of beast anyone should worship or hold in esteem in any way (yea, I know you didn't say all of that).","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:33 PM","gay-rights-debates","302"

It satisfied Gods demand for justice, and allowed him to exhibit mercy, since there is a way provided for people to accept forgiveness. Theologically, Jesus took the blame and he could because he was completely perfect, totally innocent. He took the blame for everyone's sin, so we may be forgiven if we so choose. EDIT: Keep up these sort of questions, good learning for me!","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:41 PM","gay-rights-debates","303"

If I do someone wrong, the correct way me to obtain forgiveness is to admit it to that person, make amends to that person and hope that that person forgives me. It is not someone else's place to forgive me for that wrong. That is injustice. Secondly, if god has the power to forgive, why would he not just say, ""I forgive you"", rather than requiring the torture and death of his son? Don't forget that he is supposed to have created all the evil in the world to start with. Why would he need to set up the sacrifice of himself to himself in order to sort out a mess that he made himself?","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:49 PM","gay-rights-debates","304"

If I forgive someone who breaks my window, that means I will not sue them, force them to pay for it, and will consider the matter closed. We are offered forgiveness for our sins. If we accept it, he will not hold our history against us. Because then there is no justice. Going that God is perfect, he required punishment for ones crimes.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:55 PM","gay-rights-debates","305"

If you stole someone's car, and I told you that you were forgiven, that would not be justice. The forgiver, as you put it, must be the victim, not some scapegoat. 2 - Why would someone who is all-powerful require the torture and death of his son in order to forgive sins. Why can he not just say, ""I forgive you""? Is he really that much of a sadist?","obama-supports-gay-marriage","11:11 PM","gay-rights-debates","306"

It is his laws that have been broken, so it is his forgiveness that we need. 2: Because there would be no justice otherwise. Crimes have been committed. Therefore, justice must be executed. Only someone innocent can take the blame for others, someone who has done no crime and is blameless. The only person who fit the bill was Jesus, or Gods son.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","11:16 PM","gay-rights-debates","307"

He created the crime, he created the criminal, he created the whole situation, he effectively IS the criminal. The victim of the crime is the one who has been wronged, and that is not god. 2 - So now you are claiming that god does not have the power to forgive, he requires a blood sacrifice in order to somehow obtain this power. Why do we need someone innocent to take the blame for others? Why cannot the guilty party take the blame? What you describe is not justice, it is scapegoating.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","11:43 PM","gay-rights-debates","308"

He created a person who rebelled against him, becoming the criminal on their own will. This trails back to our other exchange. 2. He requires justice most certainly. Why can't the guilty party just take the blame? Well, we can. That is called hell. He can't just forgive because that violates his justice, crime demands retribution. Crime must be punished.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","11:53 PM","gay-rights-debates","309"

He had the power to create it in such a way that the crime would not happen, he chose to create the crime. 2 - He has a very strange idea of justice. Hell is not for the guilty, it is for those who do not believe. If he is all-powerful, then how can his ability to forgive have such restrictions? Is not being convinced of something that has no hard evidence a crime? And can you name me one finite crime that deserves an infinite punishment? Can you now see why this is simply not justice?","obama-supports-gay-marriage","12:03 AM","gay-rights-debates","310"

Hell is the only other option for someone who does not receive the forgiveness offered. If you don't accept forgiveness, then you pay the price. As for how a finite crime can earn infinite punishment, it is my belief that God is a superior judge than we in these matters. As I believe him to be perfect, anything he decrees is by default flawless. I believe that when final judgement is passed by God, there will be no question that his judgement will be fair and just. This goes back to the matter that the reasoning behind his actions is far beyond our understanding. We can call it unfair, to send someone to eternal punishment for a finite sin, but we don't understand everything he does or see everything he does, therefore we can't call something unfair when we can't understand it.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","12:18 AM","gay-rights-debates","311"

You've been put on notice that your rebellion against God, and your rejection of Jesus Christ will no doubt result in a very bad day for you at the Judgment. So wise up and quit whining. You don't deserve the gift of eternal life either, because you've sinned like everyone else.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","01:13 AM","gay-rights-debates","315"
