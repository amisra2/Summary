There's numerous historical testimonies it happened. You have some compelling evidence they're not telling the truth, let's see it. If you can't then your self-serving bias charge is just a lot of hot air. They weren't testifying about the world around them; they were testifying about Jesus whom they obviously knew very well, having walked with him for over 3 years. I was just saying science has yet to prove or disprove the existence of God and the supernatural.","Dani","475590","Yet you keep demanding that we give you an explanation for how life started MILLIONS of years ago. You clearly are an idiot Coco. The Bible strongly implies many thing that have been proven to be untrue. No there are not. There is the Bible and that's all you have and we know that the Bible is mostly fable, fiction and fraud. You have some compelling evidence they are telling the truth, let's see it. If you can't then your self-serving bias charge is just a lot of hot air. LOL! They knew him so well that with each miracle Jesus performed, they were amazed - only to forget by the beginning of the next miracle so they might be amazed anew. Classic case of this was Matthew chapter 14 where Jesus feeds 5000 with five loaves and two fish. Then in chapter 15, Jesus feeds 4000 families with seven loaves and some fish. Before the chapter 15 feeding, the disciples asked ""Where are we to get the food?"" They'd witnessed Jesus feed more with less only a chapter previously!! Science is not in the business of disproving mythology. It has far more important things to do. ...and we are still waiting on this... Explain to us the general idea of DNA genome mapping and how it is used to track the genotypic background of a modern species and then explain three types of tRNA or DNA transcription errors in mitosis. Do you know the answers or not Coco?","obama-supports-gay-marriage","05:16 PM","gay-rights-debates","467"
"07-09-2013","17119",32,"Hdreams","475588","So your answer is they helped science... Or in another way, we haven't done much of anything but since everyone was ignorant hundreds of years ago and religion was enforced on pain of death and torture the people who started science were religious and therefore contributed.... What has religion, outside of science done for human development? Jesus was a clever and probably compassionate man who sought to help others by organizing a group that could help and change the populace. After his death he was evangelized and martyred until a figure of him arose that would serve as the figurehead of a religion, less brutal than the polytheistic predecessors and more encompassing of the trends at the time. Through dogmatic and theocratic teaching he was driven like a nail into an uneducated and largely ignorant society.. Which one of our explanations is more likely?","Easyrider","475606","You've got to be kidding. Are you that dense? Well then educate yourself.

The gay marriage act will pass EZ, it will take time to be sure but the rights of the gay subset are no less important than the rights of the christian subset. I would have though someone who values the constitution and the rights held within could reconcile their christian bias with the rights Christians exercise everyday and which others lack due to bigotry.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","01:28 PM","gay-rights-debates","479"
