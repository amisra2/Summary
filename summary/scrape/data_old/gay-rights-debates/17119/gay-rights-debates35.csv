"09-02-2013","17119",35,"Easyrider","477101","<Flush> Did Jesus Claim to Be God? Even if He did Make the Claim, Why Should I Believe it? Eat it, you theological midget. 8 Philip *said to Him, Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us. 9 Jesus *said to him, Have I been so long with you, and yet you have not come to know Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how can you say, Show us the Father? 10 Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me ? The words that I say to you I do not speak on My own initiative, but the Father abiding in Me does His works . 11 Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me ; otherwise believe because of the works themselves. 12 Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do, he will do also; and greater works than these he will do; because I go to the Father. 13 Whatever you ask in My name, that will I do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 14 If you ask Me anything in My name, I will do it.","daewoo","477107","That is cute and all, but also WRONG. Lets look at the first verse he uses to make his claim...John 14 Of course he limits it to verse 9, but we will look at it in context: Whoops...he is saying god is in him...he is filled with the spirit of the lord...not that he is literally a physical manifestation of God. Even in John, which was heavily redacted and is the only gospel that claims that Jesus claimed to be anything but a man, Jesus never claims to actually be god. In john he certainly claims to be of supernatural origin, but never actually claims that he is the incarnation of god himself. Sorry, Sleazy. Try again. The funny part is that if you were actually to succeed and find somewhere that Jesus claims absolutely to be god, then you still have to explain why there are literally dozens of places in the bible where he says directly and unequivocally that he is NOT god. Fortunately you will not succeed...nobody has in 1500 years.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","03:04 PM","gay-rights-debates","512"

And you're a spiritual imbecile. 53 Surely You are not greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets died too; whom do You make Yourself out to be? 54 Jesus answered, If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; it is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say, He is our God ; 55 and you have not come to know Him, but I know Him ; and if I say that I do not know Him, I will be a liar like you, but I do know Him and keep His word . 56 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad. 57 So the Jews said to Him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham? 58 Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am. 59 Therefore they picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple.","daewoo","477126","Lets put that into context: Sorry, sleazy, once again you are full of schit. Jesus expressly refers to god as his father and says that god glorifies him, that he knows god and keeps the word of god. He is VERY clearly not talking about himself here. Before you make yourself look even more foolish and ignorant I am going to point out that the gospel of John was written within a Johannine community and in its present form was completed about 90AD. The cathars, who we briefly covered earlier and who believed that Jesus was an angel, trace their roots directly back to that community (via Paulicianism....named for Paul of Samosata). In other words, you are not going to find anything in the gospel of John that establishes that Jesus was god, because the guys who wrote the gospel of John believed that Jesus was an angel who was sent here in human form. The gospel of john is pretty much the dumbest place imaginable to start looking for evidence that Jesus was God. Do you know anything at all about the religion you claim to follow, or do you just make up silly BS as you go?","obama-supports-gay-marriage","06:20 PM","gay-rights-debates","515"

You have been repeatedly presented with verifiable FACTS from a source that you claim not only to believe, but that you claim are INFALLIBLE (the bible) repeatedly and yet refuse to change your moronic thinking. It is not I who has shown himself incapable of leaning, and if the bible is your primary reference then clearly YOU are the spiritual imbecile. Your knowledge of the bible is absolutely pathetic. Your grasp on biblical concepts is laughably ignorant. You are a pathetic, bitter human being who compensates for his failure in life by concocting his own ridiculous religion that is completely unsupportable.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","11:07 AM","gay-rights-debates","517"
