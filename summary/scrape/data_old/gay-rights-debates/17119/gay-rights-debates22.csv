Because it's the liberals who love to pardon criminals early; who say they believe in the redemption of man, whether he is a murderer or just a thief. They'll do a sob story about how the murderer had a tough childhood, or that he had a disability that caused him to do wrong, so we need to have mercy on him. No capital punishment they demand. Nope, it's mercy, mercy, and more mercy. Until the criminals are finally pardoned and then go out and murder more people. Then they're left with nothing to say. Friggin' brain-dead liberals.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","01:18 AM","gay-rights-debates","316"

"07-02-2013","17119",22,"Apostle","475164","As we are all flawed human beings without a full grasp of the big picture, wouldn't it be just as folly to judge God as flawless and perfect as it would be to consider him the opposite? Isn't your belief that this God is perfect as short-sighted and incomplete as Smiley's belief that this God would be a psychopath?","ANorveyanFellow","475173","I only base my view of God from what he says of himself in the Bible.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","01:35 AM","gay-rights-debates","318"
"07-02-2013","17119",22,"Dani","475176","You see what I was saying earlier? Here you tell us what your god did and why he did it yet when you are asked simple questions about your chosen deity, it suddenly becomes an unfathomable enigma that we mere mortals could never understand, yet in other aspects, you know absolutely everything about it. 2rel4eo.jpg ...but that's the way he set it up. He set us up to break the law and then punishes us when we do just what he wanted us to do. ...and he knew that was going to happen before he created that person so the person was doing what it was designed to do and what your god wanted it to do. Why does that deserve punishment? The more I see of Christians, the more I doubt their sanity. Your god requires 'justice' so he gets it by the most UNJUST of methods; he punishes the innocent for the crimes of the guilty...brilliant! Another thing that you might like to consider is the ever recurring theme of 'FORGIVENESS' that runs through the Bible, yet forgiving is clearly something that is not very high on your god's list of priorities. His main preoccupation is very clearly REVENGE. He demands that we forgive those that trespass against us but him - well he needs blood sacrifices and punishment. He demands that we do something that he isn't prepared to do himself and that makes him a hypocrite.","ANorveyanFellow","475177","I'm sorry, but I have come to decide that going over all this with you is a waste of time. You have decided what you want to believe about the Bible and Christianity, and you're not going to budge one iota more than EZ is going to hedge on his beliefs. So I am concluding matters of debate over this subject with you, I'm sorry to say.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","04:27 AM","gay-rights-debates","320"

Why do you ignore me and not Smiley? I'm asking the same questions as he is. Do you think he's going to change his views? Well you can ignore me as you wish but it won't stop the questions. There are hundreds that read these threads and never post and you ignoring my questions will reflect on you.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","09:13 AM","gay-rights-debates","321"
"07-02-2013","17119",22,"ANorveyanFellow","475160","No, it is not a matter of disbelief. The book of James says that even the demons believe, and they shudder. Hell is the only other option for someone who does not receive the forgiveness offered. If you don't accept forgiveness, then you pay the price. As for how a finite crime can earn infinite punishment, it is my belief that God is a superior judge than we in these matters. As I believe him to be perfect, anything he decrees is by default flawless. I believe that when final judgement is passed by God, there will be no question that his judgement will be fair and just. This goes back to the matter that the reasoning behind his actions is far beyond our understanding. We can call it unfair, to send someone to eternal punishment for a finite sin, but we don't understand everything he does or see everything he does, therefore we can't call something unfair when we can't understand it.","smiley","475184","So, you either receive forgiveness, regardless of your actions, whether you were a mass murder/rapist or someone who once had a nasty thought about someone else, and you are rewarded with eternity in paradise, or you don't receive forgiveness, possibly because the people around you never managed to convince you that this magical being either exists or is worthy of worship and you roast in hell for eternity regardless of your character. And why is hell the only other option? Was that part of god's plan too? Now we have to work out why you believe this god's judgement to be flawless, his judgement to be fair and just. Do you make this judgement because he claims to be perfect in every way? Maybe you do not question his judgement because he told you not to. Perhaps you should start by examining the evidence of his judgement (ie questioning his judgement). Look at his actions rather than just believing his words. Don't start from the assumption that he is perfect and therefore must have good reasons for his actions. Is this the same god who struck a man down for collecting firewood on the Sabbath? Was that fair and just? Is this the same god who sent she bears to rip forty-two children to pieces because they taunted Elisha? Is that the action of a just god? Is this the same god who allowed Satan to kill Job's sons as part of a bet (presumably, he had the power to stop him)? Fair, just? Need I go on? If you look at the evidence (if you count the bible as evidence) of your god's actions, without the assumption that all he does must have some greater meaning (you only have his word for that) you cannot come to the conclusion that he is just and fair and perfect. And just to push the point, if I were a perfect being with perfect judgement, I would have done a far better job of advertising the fact than to produce a book listing all the atrocities I had committed, but ordering that no-one question the fairness of these actions on pain of eternal torture.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","09:23 AM","gay-rights-debates","322"

Gods Judgment Saves Lives Let's do this: How many people would 100 evil men kill in their lifetimes? Let's say a thousand, and the 100 evil men wind up in hell when they die. Now, let's let those 100 evil men have 100 offspring that over time grow up to kill the original 1,000 other people, plus 1,000 more. Now, you have 200 evil men in hell and 2,000 murdered others. Let's take it to the 10th or so generation. Now you've had 10,000 evil men giving birth to 10,000 offspring and together those 20,000 evil men and or women offspring kill 200,000 people total. So, you now have 20,000 evil men and women in hell (vs. 100 if you had nailed them earlier), plus 200,000 other dead people. So God, being smarter than his critics, and able to see consequences further out in time than the stiff-necked ""God is evil"" crowd, saves 19,900 people from going to hell plus he saves 199,000 others from getting murdered.
