The fact is, this is one of those things that ISSUE polling just doesn't tell an accurate story. Political correctness is a funny thing.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","08:04 PM","gay-rights-debates","17"

What an absolute joke. http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journal...first-gay-prez As for Obama's ""evolution"" on gay marriage, Satan had an evolution too - into deceit and spiritual darkness.

Every 4 years the candidate comes out saying he is going to do everything he can for gay rights or to outlaw abortion and during those 4 years nothing really happens. The candidate just wants you mad so you'll vote for him. If I were in the gay rights movement I'd be very skeptical about Obama's new found support.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","07:35 AM","gay-rights-debates","25"
"05-14-2012","17119",2,"Freedom","454882","What time would that be, and source? What about you're definition that it's between two people, the government, and all those the government extorts to help those two? That any better?","Xcaliber","455016","There you go again assuming something for which you have no basis for. I'm not arrogant enough to apply a specific definition to the word Marriage. Marriage was not a religious issue until the catholic church found a benefit to it and took it . I never said marriage was between just two people, you XXXXXX who define marriage by religion are the ones who did that. I personally don't care who someone else chooses to marry, nor how many they choose to marry. My only concern on the matter is that the Laws concerning marriage and the benefits awarded to married people be awarded equally among all Americans under our Constitution. As daewoo eluded to there was a time in this country when it was illegal to marry someone from another race. At one time Women were not allowed to vote. At one time People were enslaved . Just like Slavery was abolished, Womens rights were awarded( to some degree) and interracial couples were allowed to Marry, Gay people will gain their rights.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","09:19 AM","gay-rights-debates","26"
"05-14-2012","17119",2,"Freedom","455017","You're still not smart enough to realize how incredibly idiotic it is to proudly denounce the need for a definition of a word used in law. You know who else isn't 'arrogant'? All the people who committed genocide because they felt no need to apply a specific definition to the word 'human'. Why should an insurance company cover a homosexual couple, when that couple can't define marriage; and thus can't claim to be married? My concern is that no benefits are awarded at the cost of stealing those benefits from the unwilling. This is the part of the show where you have nothing to retort and just go away, thank you. There is no right to violate rights, and homosexual marriage would not be an issue if it weren't for their erroneous claim to societal support; because then it would truly be between two (or more) people and they would need neither permission nor validation from the government.","Xcaliber","455044","Smarter than you will ever be, that is a fact. The Only reason there is a definition now as far as Law is concerned is because a bunch of religious XXXXXX decided to apply one. Before Bigotry became the norm the LAW didn't have a definition. The Government / State Governments applied said definition for the sole purpose of discrimination. So it's ok for a straight married couple to be awarded benefits ""stolen "" from others but when a Gay Couple wants the same it's wrong.. What a hypocrite . You won't drag me into another stupid debate about why taxes are necessary. You have been beaten down on this subject since I've been on this forum so either you're crazy or you're just too stupid to get it. Gay rights has nothing to do with your idiotic utopian dream world... and taxing is not stealing. no Homosexual Marriage would not be an issue if there were no stupid religions in the world telling XXXXXX that Homosexual marriage is wrong. If you truly were for upholding the constitution then you would understand . The fact that by denying Gay people the right to marry you not only discriminate against them but you force your religious definition of marriage on them, which is also against the Constitution. But I don't concern myself arguing with fools such as you, because I have no doubt that eventually enough people in this country will wake up and set things right. Just like African Americans and Women eventually gained Equal protection under our Constitution Gay people will also see their Rights restored.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","02:24 PM","gay-rights-debates","28"
