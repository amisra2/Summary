Polygamy and marriage was not a special class. It was considered a multi-marriage i.e. wives were not married to each other only the same husband. It's not in the constitution now, DOMA was an act of congress not an amendment. If you're wondering why they singled that out for legal definition, it's because a group of people are trying to redefine it. If you did that to any other word, say make citizen mean of European descent they would do the same thing. That does not mean there was no definition of citizen or that it has changed. It has been prevented from change. They have a right to do this because laws were written with their current set of definitions. To seek to undermine the law by redefining the words used is no better then ignoring it completely. Every time you say this I ask you the same question. What right am I trampling on? I am an advocate of different government. I talk big about liberty and freedom because they are important to me, not the shallow bromides which constitute your entire understanding of the terms. I am against the invasion of liberty of the general populace at the hands of the homosexual lobby. You cannot limit what was never there, a right to social support that places a liberty violating duty on every member of society to that support.

"05-27-2012","17119",5,"Freedom","455956","Do you realize how ironic is to say that when you are asking for discrimination based on a social relationship? You think two people should get special protection because they signed a contract. This is the problem with calling social programs laws, you don't need to sign a law in order for it to protect you. This is not a law it's a contract , and you are trying to force the public to sign.","daewoo","455974","A contract is by definition an agreement entered into with the intent of creating a legal obligation. If you separate the law from a contract you have no contract. From a legal perspective, marriage is a predefined legal relationship, not a social relationship. Do you, or do you not believe that 2 private individuals of sound mind and legal age, and working in their own best interests, have the right to contract with each other? That is the only question. It has nothing to do with religion, morals, ethics, or anything else. It is about whether or not Americans have the right to form contracts with each other and whether the government has the power to decide who may and may not contract based on their sex. Your whole ""social program"" argument above is not just foolish, it is pathetic and ridiculous.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","01:15 AM","gay-rights-debates","63"

To say that a contract is not a law, and to say contracts and laws are separate is not the same thing. A law applies to everyone (equal protection), it is a statute defining a prohibited activity. You can have a law stating that to violate contracts is prohibited, but you can't have a law that only applies to just joe and sally even though you can have a contract that applies to joe and sally. You do not need to sign laws to give them power over you, you do need to sign a contract to give it legal power over you. Predefined? Xcaliber claims there was no definition before DOMA. It is because it is a legal relationship that from a legal perspective it must have a concrete definition. The governments not going to chase down some couple for saying they are married, but they aren't going to give them tax breaks either because they don't meet the criteria. Of course they do. Speaking from a 'moral perspective' (as always) a contract is valid only if the list of signers on the bottom have sufficient authority to promise the constraints and conditions of the contract. If a contract describes the duties of bob and jill, and bob and jill sign it; it's valid because jill has the right to make promises on her behavior and bob has the right to make promises about his behavior. If they include rob in the contract and attempt to constrain him to some duty, and he does not sign; that contract is not valid. The contract is formalized promises and works on the volition principle. If it was only two private individuals who had to sign off on a marriage contract, homosexuals would not need government help. Existing contract law would guarantee it's legal and enforced. They want more than a contract between two people, they want a contract that because of government law is providing privileges and protections which they do not have the authority to provide for themselves. i.e. the government is a co-signer and the government does not have a duty to sign because it represents the people and the people do not have a duty to sign. Everything involving government involves morals until government is moral. No contract has been nullified, there are no laws against making any contract.

I guess that is a by product of living in a Utopian Dream World .....","Easyrider","455998","<chuckle> It's you flaming, bath-house liberals who are living in La La Land. Your gay-sex pipe dream was demolished at Sodom and Gomorrah. You didn't learn your lessons then and it's obvious you have no moral foundation now. Not only that, but unless you repent, you will in no way enter into heaven. Let's once again look at the Scriptures and see what you're trying to sweep under the rug in order to try to justify your illicit gay sex sin: Leviticus 18:2 2 - ""Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable."" Leviticus 20:13 - ""If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads."" Romans 1:26-27 - ""Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion."" 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - ""Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God."" 1 Timothy 1:8-10 - But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine Jude 7 In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. There's no gay marriages in the Old Testament; No gay marriages in the New Testament; no gay sex approved anywhere in the Bible. Just the opposite - gay sex is condemned in both testaments. God is consistent on that. Repent, you heathens!","obama-supports-gay-marriage","08:31 AM","gay-rights-debates","65"

"05-27-2012","17119",5,"Provocateaur","456013","Yet one husband was married to more than one wife. We're just defining the law again to include same-sex couples. Everything's about definitions. Isn't that an argument that no group should have government support, including heterosexuals in marriage? Otherwise, you are excluding gays from Constitutionally guaranteed equal treatment and protection based on immutable characteristics, indeed based on gender and sexual orientation. There is no protection in the Constitution for that kind of discrimination on the part of the government. The government must abide by the Constitution in defining laws, including DOMA which is being challenged in court. You know, Freedom, others here make a good point. You seem to support government power when it suits your purpose, which is to exclude and discriminate against gays. That's a little too convenient.","Freedom","456020","Yes but he had more than one marriage. That can only be done in congress, i.e. changing the law. To redefine the word and allow courts to declare the redefinition valid undermines the nature of law. The current government is immoral, and it's true that no group has a right to government support including heterosexual marriages. I am arguing under the presumption of a moral government, i.e. one that does not violate rights and whose actions reflect the will of the people (and not just the majority). Even under a proper moral government people could decide to support heterosexual marriage and not homosexual marriage. They would have every right to do that, just as they have the right to support PETA over Rush Limbaugh. Where does the constitution guarantee equal treatment? People who think the constitution guarantees something the government isn't doing, in my experience have not read the thing in a while. You find this so important, but it isn't. I have given you every opportunity to make a case that other sexual orientations were not of the same nature as homosexuality i.e. immutable arising at young ages (before sexual experience) and you have backed down every time. Laws against zoophilia are targeted against one group of people, people with the immutable characteristics of zoophilic attractions. Where is their equal protection? I am waiting for you to leap of your high horse like lightning now and suddenly start talking about how if enough people don't like the immutable sexual orientation, or more specifically the acts it motivates discrimination and indeed imprisonment is justified. Thus implying there is nothing sacred or inviolate about an inclination being immutable, but when you forget this conversation; next time you will be throwing this out there for homosexuals again as if it were some kind of race. There is no protection in the constitution against discrimination based on definition because it would be absurd. Every word discriminates against all that which it does not mean by your use of the word discrimination. The word citizen discriminates against non-citizens. The word person discriminates against not persons. The word State discriminates against non-state. I could go on forever. There is nothing in the constitution which says they cannot recognize a certain social relationship and not others. I guarantee you that my opinions on government power are perfectly consistent as opposed to either the stereotypical left or right. I am extremely interested in any attempt you are willing to make to show my positions as contradictory.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","02:50 PM","gay-rights-debates","68"
"05-27-2012","17119",5,"Provocateaur","456024","They are all involved in the same marriage. It can be ordered by the court. Lol. The will of the people but not necessarily the will of the majority? How would this and the morality of this government be decided? The government has a right to support things, but you don't believe anyone has the right to that government support, right? What the heck??? 14th Amendment. Lol. You haven't shown zoophilia is immutable. Homosexuality doesn't change and very rarely do we experience attraction to the other sex. Very rarely do heterosexuals experience attraction to the same sex. Where is the evidence that the animal is immutably attracted to the human by the way? Oh right, there is none. However, under your confusing logic the government, which shouldn't support any group at all, would have the right to support or not support any group, including the zoophiles. No kidding. Each has a rational basis, or it's subject to scrutiny by the court. How do we decide which will be recognized and which will not in a way which is fair and just. You offer no solution, only contradiction, cunundrum and a misunderstanding of sexual orientation.","Freedom","456030","So the women are married to each other? When courts have the authority to redefine language we may as well refer to them as big brother. A government is moral when it violates no rights, rights can be defined in the constitution of a government. Thus a constitution could exist such that so long as it is not contradicted the government is moral, that is the ideal; it's what people assume we have but we don't. The government, if properly structured; can represent multiple groups of people at the same time for each issue a new instance of representation. The idea that the majority speaks for the unanimity and representatives speak for the majority has created authority of representatives over people whom they do not in fact represent. This is a violation of the volition or liberty principle. Correct. A right to the support of others is a contradiction, it means a right to their duty; and their liberty demands they have the right to choose their own obligations and duties. You have the right to offer your neighbor help, but your neighbor does not have a right to your help. If you give it, it is a privilege because it was dependent on your consent. Equal protection of laws does not mean equal public support. It means if someone breaks the law the victim doesn't matter to whether it was a crime. Do food stamps protect people in need of hunger? I've shown it to the same standard as homosexuality has been shown to be immutable, namely there are no known ex-zoophiles and there is no reason for someone to choose to be a zoophile. Relevance? Don't make a false show of being willing to argue, we both know you aren't. I never said the government shouldn't support any group at all, provided it's moral. It of course has no right to compel private entities to support a group or to use stolen money (taxes) to support that group. You don't even know what I said do you? The rational basis for a word is the concept it represents, which is not subject to scrutiny by the court. By seeing if anyone is willing to recognize it. Solution to what? What contradiction? I really don't think I misunderstand sexual orientation.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","04:47 PM","gay-rights-debates","70"
