Putting up some contrived map saying they did is horse manure.","Dani","475275","...and like I said, you are as much of an ignoramus regarding Palestine as you are regarding evolution.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","09:38 AM","gay-rights-debates","361"
"07-03-2013","17119",25,"Dani","475274","Why don't you tell us what you would do if Canada started illegally occupying parts of the USA. Tell us what you would do if the Canadian army confiscated YOUR land, destroyed YOUR home, killed YOUR family and left you to starve. What would you do knob? The irony in your idiocy is that YOU are the one beating your chest about you will fight anyone that tries to take what belongs to you. YOU are the one boasting about laying traps to kill hundreds should any try to take from you, yet here you are castigating the Palestinians for doing exactly what you claim is your 'right' to do to others. What an obnoxious, sickening bigot you are. I couldn't give a feck about 9/11","Easyrider","475278","Well, we care about 9/11 over here. God, and the U.N., gave that land to Israel. And if you and the Palestinians don't like it you can go climb on a parking meter and rotate.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:30 AM","gay-rights-debates","362"

One terrorist attack (the biggest part of which could have been avoided if you hadn't been so incompetent) and you think the world has to feel sorry for you for ever more. Some of us in other countries had to live with terrorism on a DAILY basis for decades and we just got on with it. You need to put away the self-pity and do the same. I'm sure that the Palestinians would be happy to have the land that the UN allocated to them. It's the amount of that UN allocated land that is being illegally occupied by the Israeli aggressors that they are complaining about.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","12:23 PM","gay-rights-debates","363"

And sorry to burst your bubble but we don't wallow in pity. We go and kick their as*es, and we've been kicking them for quite some time now. I really don't give a rat's fanny what those people want.
