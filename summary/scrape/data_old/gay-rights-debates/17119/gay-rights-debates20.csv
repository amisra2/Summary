"07-01-2013","17119",20,"Hdreams","475091","I suppose its easy to be contemptuous of freedoms when its not your rights that are being debated and your sinful ways that are grouped in the same way as murderers and illegal immigrants, when the individuals in question want nothing more than to celebrate their love for each other... Im proud that Great Britain sanctioned gay marriage as an right and irrepealable in law. Makes me proud to be a part of humanity and the Commonwealth.","Easyrider","475094","I think that's one of the reasons your commonwealth has been in spiritual decline for the last century or so. Your country used to be a great empire, but along with spiritual decline came moral decay to coincide with your empire's free fall into the likes of a third-world country. I'd revel in pointing that out to you except the same kind of godless idiocy that caused England to disintegrate is now also causing America's decline.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","12:36 PM","gay-rights-debates","287"

Secondly that giving the colonies freedom of government was the responsible actions of a forward thinking nation (As opposed to attempting to cling to them like France in Indo-China, which eventually lead to the Vietnam war and the Khmer Rouge). Also the idea that GB is a third world nation? Seriously??? I lived in London for some time and traveled most of the UK. The people are too civilized if anything... Most of them in the country wouldnt say boo to a goose. In the cities such as Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool and London their is crime but no more than similar European cities and iv never felt more multicultural in London. It has the highest rates of native ethnicity of any major city on the planet. And just to nail the point have you checked the standing for education, unemployment, mortality, happiness or any major UN index??? The UK isn't Norway ill give you, but its way ahead of the U.S and a leading nation of Europe (Seemingly soon to be the U.S.E unfortunately), in almost every factor... Not in gun crime though or murder involving firearms, Burglary and a host of other crime. I think ill take one of the best education systems in the world, safety from crime, freedom from religion and higher employment opportunity over spiritual ecstasy.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","01:08 PM","gay-rights-debates","288"

"07-01-2013","17119",20,"Easyrider","475092","Yeah, well Christ paid for the sin. So there is justice. Except in your world where the Hitler's kill tens of millions of people and then check out without a trial. So much for your loser world view.","smiley","475103","So you feel it is more just that a mass murderer and rapist can get off scott-free by repenting on his death bed, yet a righteous, charitable, loving individual gets tortured for eternity simply because they do not share an arbitrary believe? You are one sick, twisted, unbalanced wretch. And by the way, Hilter was part of your world. I wonder if he repented before dying.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","02:07 PM","gay-rights-debates","290"

You have no place in civilized society. The only truth in your response is that I deny your christ.

Show me in the Bible where I was wrong about Susan Atkins and Matthew Sheppard? That those who repent of their sins and receive Christ can't be saved, but where unrepentant sinners without Christ are given a free ride into heaven?","obama-supports-gay-marriage","05:34 PM","gay-rights-debates","299"
