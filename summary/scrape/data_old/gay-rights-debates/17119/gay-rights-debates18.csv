The separation of church and state is fundamental, it entails the FREEDOM FROM RELIGION for all, secularist, Buddhist, Muslim, Christian... The state cannot discriminate against any denomination on any religious grounds. What Jefferson and the rest of the founding fathers personally believed has no bearing...","Easyrider","475036","We're not talking about establishing a national religious denomination (which was what the founding fathers were addressing). We're talking illicit gay unions. And I'm not saying the US is a ""Christian nation,"" though some 70% of Americans claim to be Christians.

You have already read the statement about HIV and i hope you would see the falseness of that claim... Can give me a genuine reason that gay marriage should be banned outside of the sphere of religion?","obama-supports-gay-marriage","03:25 PM","gay-rights-debates","259"
"06-30-2013","17119",18,"Hdreams","475031","Firstly that is not the reason that EZ wishes for homosexual marriage to be banned, secondly the rise of HIV is almost as high and in some countries higher in heterosexuals than Homosexuals. Should we therefore ban all marriage due to this? The rise of HIV is higher in drug users than homosexuals, if HIV was truly the reason you were piping up you would be railing for stricter drug laws and not banning homosexual marriage.","Xenamnes","475040","To what countries do you refer? Third world nations where contraceptives and adequate medical care are largely unavailable and anti-HIV drugs are regarded as poisonous? The type of drug use you reference is already outlawed under all circumstances. It is quite impossible to enact laws that are any stricter than currently.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","03:35 PM","gay-rights-debates","260"

Just for reference they are not largely regarded as poisonous, they are unavailible due to the price the pharmaceutical companies set them at meaning 95% of AID's sufferers have no access. The countries i am referring to are all nations for the most part. Western nations are seeing Heterosexual HIV rise rapidly. The U.S, U.K, most of Europe for example of just a few. Again though i ask for a reason outside of religion, That is not HIV.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","03:43 PM","gay-rights-debates","261"

In addition to having at least one male sex partner, 14% of participants had at least one female sex partner during the past 12 months. Unprotected anal intercourse with a male partner was reported by 54% of the participants; 37% reported having unprotected anal sex with a main male partner (someone with whom the participant had sex and to whom he felt most committed, such as a boyfriend, spouse, significant other, or life partner), and 25% reported having unprotected anal sex with a casual male partner (someone with whom the participant had sex but with whom he did not feel committed, did not know very well, or had sex with in exchange for something such as money or drugs). Noninjection drug use during the past 12 months was reported by 46% of participants. Specifically, 38% used marijuana, 18% cocaine, 13% poppers (amyl nitrate), and 11% ecstasy. Two percent of the participants reported injecting drugs for nonmedical purposes in the past 12 months. Of the participants surveyed, 90% had been tested for HIV during their lifetime, 62% had been tested during the past 12 months, 51% had received a hepatitis vaccination, 35% had been tested for syphilis during the past 12 months, and 18% had participated in an individual- or group-level HIV behavioral intervention. Interpretation: MSM in the United States continue to engage in sexual and drug-use behaviors that increase the risk for HIV infection. Although many MSM had been tested for HIV infection, many had not received hepatitis vaccinations or syphilis testing, and only a small proportion had recently participated in a behavioral intervention. Excellent!","obama-supports-gay-marriage","07:27 PM","gay-rights-debates","263"

He studied 199 cases. Of those, 122 male teachers had molested girls, while 14 female teachers had molested boys. He also discovered that 59 homosexual male teachers had molested boys and four female homosexual teachers had molested girls. In other words, 32 percent of those child molestation cases involved homosexuals. Nearly a third of these cases come from only 1-2% of the population. Dr. Judith Reisman, in her book, Kinsey, Crimes & Consequences, describes the research done by Dr. Gene Abel. This researcher compared the molestation rates of self-confessed homosexual and heterosexual child molesters. In a sample of 153 homosexual molesters, they confessed to a total of 22,981 molestations. This is equivalent to 150 children per molester. Self-admitted heterosexual molesters admitted to 4,435 molestations. This comes to 19.8 victims per molester. Dr. Abel concluded that homosexuals sexually molest young boys at an incidence that is occurring from five times greater than the molestation of girls. This high rate of molestations by homosexuals is consistent with other studies conducted during the past several decades. Here are just a few studies that show homosexuals molesting children at epidemic rates: In 1984, a Vermont survey of 161 adolescents who were sex offenders found that 35 of them were homosexuals (22%). (Wasserman, J., Adolescent Sex OffendersVermont, 1984 Journal American Medical Association, 1986; 255:181-2) In 1991, of the 100 child molesters at the Massachusetts Treatment Center for Sexually Dangerous Persons, a third were heterosexual, a third were bisexual, and a third were homosexual. (Dr. Raymond Knight, Differential Prevalence of Personality Disorders in Rapists and Child Molesters, Eastern Psychological Association Conference, New York, April 12, 1991) Drs. Freund and Heasman of the Clark Institute of Psychiatry in Toronto reviewed two studies on child molesters and calculated that 34% and 32% of the sex offenders were homosexual. In cases these doctors had handled, 36% of the molesters were homosexuals. (Freund, K.

Haven't had a chance to look at the links yet but before i do let me say a couple of things then ill get back and post after iv looked at Xanamnes links. 1. Homosexual Marriage has nothing to do with HIV/AIDS. A monogamous Male/Male or Female/Female relationship has the same percentage risk of spreading HIV as heterosexual relationship. This is why is asked you to provide a reason other than HIV, it doesnt have a bearing on Gay marriage. And as yet you have provided none. 2. From the way you presented that info you make it look as if you prefer Heterosexual child molesters to Homosexual molesters. Just what are you trying to say??? Child molestation is bad, horrendous, all molestation... Their is no shades of grey. I will look at Xanamnes links and reply but i am still awaiting a reason as to why Gay marriage shouldnt be legal. Outside of a religious sphere and not HIV as it has no bearing on Gay marriage. And your percentage representation of gay people is laughable... 3.5% are LGBT, Doesnt seem like a big difference but that is the population of Sweden or New Jersey, 9 Million people... And it is reckoned this is only 2/5 of the actual percentage as many do not come out for fear of bullying, discrimination and intimidation.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","07:43 PM","gay-rights-debates","265"

First with womens rights, then racial rights and now it will be sexual rights. If they are an end unto themselves that should make you happy right? Not passing on their sinful genes...
