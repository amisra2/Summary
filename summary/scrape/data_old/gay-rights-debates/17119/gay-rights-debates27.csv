"07-04-2013","17119",27,"Easyrider","475336","There's no shortage of examples of Arab / Muslim attacks against Israel, so don't even bother trying to go there. If you like those maggots so much move on over there.","Dani","475349","Have you ever bothered to find out why that might be...no, of course you haven't. Jesus would be proud of you. Why are you avoiding this you slimy bigot? 'What you would do if Canada started illegally occupying parts of the USA. Tell us what you would do if the Canadian army confiscated YOUR land, destroyed YOUR home, killed YOUR family and left you to starve. What would you do knob? The irony in your idiocy is that YOU are the one beating your chest about you will fight anyone that tries to take what belongs to you. YOU are the one boasting about laying traps to kill hundreds should any try to take from you, yet here you are castigating the Palestinians for doing exactly what you claim is your 'right' to do to others.'","obama-supports-gay-marriage","09:57 AM","gay-rights-debates","392"

And Israel is now in violation of the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of 2004, condemning the separation wall throughout the occupied West Bank.

"07-04-2013","17119",27,"Hdreams","475346","There should be defense, but if you swapped the ratio's of spending between defense and schools/healthcare you could receive completely free schooling for all from kindergarten to college and postgraduate, the best healthcare system in the world which would also be completely free for all citizens and still you would have the largest defense budget on the planet. Thats what your coming back with.... seriously??? I havent just slipped into an episode lesson from ""The Wonder Years"".... Quoting a centuries old passage out of context which has no bearing on the point raised.... Perhaps if we had spent that defense money on schooling and healthcare instead of the largest and most inappropriate military arsenal that has ever existed more people might have a better founding to make educated decisions about the individuals they choose to lead a nation of 300 million people, and therefore wouldn't have to defer to people who claim to know the answers such as career politicians/Religious leaders and local government representatives. That is the answer of a child mistaking the moving curtain for the boogeyman, instead of the breeze through the window. Have you read ""The Failed State... Noam Chomsky""","Easyrider","475353","Think whatever you want. I've already provided my positions.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:39 AM","gay-rights-debates","394"

Do you think it is acceptable that Israel should be a member of the UN, sign to abide by the rules of the UN and then break the rules of the UN for it's own ends.. with the support of the USA? It's a simple enough question maggot - as is this one.... ""What you would do if Canada started illegally occupying parts of the USA.
