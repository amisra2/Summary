And when they've invaded areas like Lebanon it's because they were attacking Israel first. That's the penalty the attacking imbeciles pay. So stick that in your uneducated rump. They're obviously too ignorant to figure it out. Sorry, sport, but the law says you're full of it.","Dani","475441","That doesn't surprise me one bit. You always do stick with what you say, regardless of you being proven wrong. That's because you are an obnoxious bigot that does not have the intellectual integrity to admit that you are wrong. Proving once again that you know absolutely nothing about the situation. Well for someone that 'claims' to have been in the military you clearly know nothing about the rules of warfare do you. Let me educate you. Under international law(Hague Convention and the Geneva Convention) it is ILLEGAL to hold on to territories gained during an invasion or act of war and that is what Israel is doing. That is why there are so many UN Resolutions against Israel. ""The International Court of Justice, the UN General Assembly and the United Nations Security Council regards Israel as the ""Occupying Power"". The term ""Occupying Power"" has taken on a precise legal meaning following the International Court of Justice advisory opinion in July 2004 that Israel is occupying this territory in violation of international law . The Israeli High Court of Justice concurs with this language , and has ruled that Israel holds the West Bank under ""belligerent occupation"" As you didn't know that holding onto land gained in war is illegal, it is clearly YOU that is ignorant. No, actually the law says that Israel is wrong and is acting illegally so stuff that up your fat bigoted arse you maggot. Here...try education for a change... Israeli-occupied territories - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ""All of the Israeli settlements outside of Israel's internationally recognized borders are illegal. Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention -- to which both Israel and the United States are signatories -- prohibits any occupying power from transferring ""parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies."" The United Nations, with such measures as Security Council Resolutions 446, 452, 465 and 471, has repeatedly recognized that Israel is in violation of this critical international treaty. In addition, a landmark 2004 decision by the International Court of Justice also confirmed the illegality of the settlements.""

"07-06-2013","17119",29,"Hdreams","475436","And pray tell EZ what were these preachers doing among so many hell dwellers... Perhaps they were extending the friendly hand of the church to the gay community? perhaps educating gently about the sins and salvation's of the Christian god or were they doing what most of these guys do at LGBT events. By that i mean screaming sin and shame, pointing at the defilers and screaming that they are going to burn forever and expand the list of punishments for effect, quoting random hateful and outdated passages from their little book, perhaps organising locals into a counter mob to shout, point, scream, sneer and laugh at the apparent vulgarity.","Easyrider","475455","Way to go, HD.

Its mostly just bright colours, hot pants, hairbands and butch women.... If these preachers tried to do this at a gay pride march in England they would be thrown into the sea. Not by the marchers but by the locals for the biggotry and racism... the last 400 years in the U.K have gone pretty well after they shipped off the Puritans and Christian fundamentalists.
