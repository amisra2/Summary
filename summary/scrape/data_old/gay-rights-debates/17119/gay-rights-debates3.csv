And the fact that you go to Fox for your news reinforces this. You claim that you have already passed over to the other side simply because you believe (you have no evidence, but that has never stopped you). Then you provide several quotes from the bible that suggest that you need to do more than just believe, and actually have to do good deeds. When this is pointed out to you, you do a quick presto chango, avoid the debate, the insults start flying, and threats of eternal damnation abound. All this does is show that you have nothing other than a pathetic fairy tale based dillusion. You have no evidence, but haven't the guts to admit it. Unfortunately for you, you also don't have the brains to make a good debate of it. You just repeat the same old drivel, and revert to insults and threats - and your 'flush' - when you have nothing intelligent to say (which is just about every post).","obama-supports-gay-marriage","09:48 PM","gay-rights-debates","31"

When you grow a pair of cojones and back it up with some credible arguments and credible scholarship that busts the resurrection of Christ, then you will have gained some credibility around here.

The only one on this forum who thinks you won said argument is You. You were proven wrong by more than one member here, over and over, just like you have been beaten down concerning your Utopian dream world.

It's apparent that you are frustrated and that might be throwing you off a little.... 1: There were no Eye witness accounts of any resurrection recorded, everything written in the Gospels is hearsay. 2: there is zero, nada, no evidence left behind of any resurrection... taking a mythical story for it's literal word and convincing a few billion M o r o n s that it is real does not make it true. 3: we know from scientific evidence and just from basic human intelligence that once a man dies and is dead for 3 days he does not get up and walk away.. sorry.. I know it hurts. 4: add in the inconsistencies, the so called "" facts"" that in no way match with history, the lack of any evidence other than what you have been taught in your cult, and I would assume that the burden of proof for any resurrection would fall on YOU... but we all know that won't happen so commence with the insults...

How do you know that what you post is worth responding to? Face it daewoo, you quit; you have done it several times; you may be in a club, but it's not a very prestigious club to be in. I would really like to know what you expect me to say to this? Oh, yes of course now that so many people have given up arguing with me I must be some deluded idiot trapped in my own little world? You're the ones who have trapped yourselves because you are the ones who cut off meaningful communication rather then face the big bad world of opinions other than your own, and logic you cannot assail . Oh well, if I were sane like you I would see my logic has already been defeated; and the way to determine who's sane is to see who gives up first? Let's say for the sake of argument that I am just believing what I want? Why in the world would I want to live in a world where logic is only as good as the perceived credibility of the person who presents it... ignoring for now the FACT (as you like to say) that history and reality has proved logic superior to credibility (authority) in all cases because the only ultimate measure of authority is logic and reality. If I were in such a world, I would not even be on these forums; because after all even when a couple posters agree that's only three or four people; and there is a whole world of people out there who could think their crazy regardless of the logic they put forward. If my arguments and my analysis were so ultimately meaningless I would just sit and look at polls and perhaps discuss half-heatedly policy without ever asserting that anything at all is true (like so many do). You tell me I am wrong, and that if I was not so wrong I would be able to see why I was wrong. That's not good enough for me, and I bet it's not good enough for you or pretty much anyone else. I believe that if I am wrong , logic can show me to be wrong ; I cannot proceed on the premise that I am magically blind to such proof anymore then I could sit around and die of starvation because of the possibility of being a brain in a vat. Yet you say it to me as if it should be the final word, as if you could do anymore than laugh and ridicule the exact same proposition applied to yourself. Give up; I can't stop you, but don't expect that to undermine my confidence in my arguments; if you were half as rational as you claim to be you should see why that would reinforce my confidence. Mental masturbation? Maybe it is, feigning disinterest to cover your performance problems you would rather sit on the couch than make it a group affair leaving me to produce what little satisfaction there is to be had for myself. You couldn't even best the arguments of potheads yet you feel confident to tell me I am wrong on nothing but your authority?","obama-supports-gay-marriage","12:54 AM","gay-rights-debates","38"
