"11-16-2012","17119",9,"daewoo","466518","I would disagree with the bolded part to a degree. If you are talking purely religious reasons....a law that said ""The Lord Almighty and Jesus Christ and Joseph Smith say marriage is between a man and a woman"", I think there would be a religious issue there. I wish people could get it through their heads that when we are talking about the legality of Gay marriage...or any marriage...it has nothing to do with religion. Legal marriage has nothing to do with religion. It is all a matter of contract law. If you beat your wife for being disobedient, or kill her for committing adultery, no court is going to set you free because the bible says that is part of marriage. If you wife files for divorce and you walk in to court with a bible and say it is not possible because the bible says so, you are going to end up divorced anyway. If you marry a woman against her will because her father says it is OK, it does not matter if the bible says it is OK, you are going to do 30 to life for kidnapping, most likely with another 15 tacked on for rape. Ironically enough, that is the same argument I used to use when I was opposed to legalizing gay marriage...mostly because I just didn't think it was worth the trouble and mess. I argued that the legal part of marriage was not the important part...it was the ""spiritual"" part that mattered....even if all the paperwork vanished tomorrow, nothing would change between me and my wife...it is not the paperwork that makes the marriage, it is the commitment. For all intents and purposes, that is the ""religious"" side of marriage. Sorry to say, the religious folks have already lost that battle...I know several gay couples who consider themselves married despite the lack of paperwork. As I thought about it more, when it comes to the legality of gay marriage, it is actually the spiritual or religious side of things that is irrelevant. The legal side of things actually is a big deal when I started thinking about it a little more. I have said before that marriage is, from a legal standpoint, basically a prepackaged civil contract that recognizes certain rights between 2 parties. For some people that might not matter....personally, though, I use my wife as my proxy all the time. It would cost a fortune in legal fees to draft all the power of attorney forms and joint ownership agreements, and health care proxys and liability contracts that are all automatic now because they are part of that pre packaged contract. That changed my opinion completely. I don't care if we call it ""marriage"" or not, but I see no reason that you should not be able to assign another individual, regardless of their sex or even their relationship to you, the same legal status as a spouse. If you want to assign somebody as your proxy, and commingle your financial and business interests with theirs without a hassle, you should be able to.","Steeeeve","466520","And none of the laws say that. They all say marriage is between and man and a woman. The reasoning behind someone voting for that law is irrelevant. 100% of the people who voted for the law could have done so because while they were sleeping they got a vision which told them to vote a certain way and there is absolutely nothing unconstitutional about that. When the Supreme Court gets around to finally allowing gay marriage (and they will) it will be done based upon an incorrect interpretation of the 14th amendment as opposed to a 1st amendment violation. The spiritual side of marriage is by far the more important side, in my opinion. Yeah the ""proxy package"" is helpful in dealings with the government but it's not nearly as important to me. I think both sides of the argument fail here. Both think if they win that the spiritual side of marriage will come back and be in their lives. Little do they know, the government doesn't solve your marriage problems.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","12:12 PM","gay-rights-debates","121"
"11-16-2012","17119",9,"Steeeeve","466501","Not even slightly. And I haven't seen any state make a law saying gay marriage is banned because Christianity says so. I'm sure religion is a driving force behind someone voting a certain way on the issue but we can't go around being the thought police now can we?","Matthew S","466552","No law put on the ballot by a religious organization, or any organization that has a religious statement or mission should be allowed to stand.

Once you strip away the emotional baggage and religious significance, what is left is a civil contract, not entirely dissimilar to the formation of a corporation. I have trouble imaging a court upholding a law that 2 women cannot start a corporation. I think that is maybe the biggest problem on both sides of the argument. The antis want to argue that allowing gays to marry would cheapen their own marriage somehow. You see an awful lot of gay people arguing that somehow their marriage is only ""real"" if the government sanctions it. Frankly, those people are in crappy marriages. If the government stopped recognizing my marriage tomorrow it would not change the relationship between myself and my wife at all. I think that any good marriage is like that on a spiritual level. It is a personal commitment or bond between 2 people. They don't need some third party to put a stamp of approval on it. Once the spiritual side of marriage is off the table, all that is left is the legal. I can understand why that would be a big deal to somebody. In some states (mine included) your spouse is your medical proxy. I could name another medical proxy, but my wife could still over-rule them if she wanted. You hear stories about gay people not being allowed to be there when their ""spouse"" of multiple decades lays dying in the hospital because they are not actually relatives. Put yourself in that situation. If my wife was laying in a hospital bed dying and somebody told me I could not be with her, they had better have a swat team standing behind them. I would kill anybody who stood in my way and damn the consequences. Whatever you may feel about the morality of 2 men getting married, they feel the same way about each other that you feel about your wife, and I feel about my wife. Putting them in that situation is just plain evil. You say that the proxy package is not that important to you, but then you have it. You don't have to worry that if you died on the way to work tomorrow that your family would come in and wipe your spouse out because some of them didn't approve of your lifestyle. That happens to gay couples all the time. There is no automatic inheritance for them and in most states your next of kin are the only party that have legal standing to challenge a will...and they do...and often they win because the fact that you were with your partner for 50 years is meaningless in the eyes of the law. I have a friend who is gay. He has been with the same partner for 10 years. They have a better ""marriage"" than most straight people I know. 2 years ago they were in a car wreck. My friend broke his pelvis, his partner broke several ribs, an arm, and got a nasty concussion. He was unconscious when they reached the hospital. Under Kansas law, the hospital could only stabilize the guy, not actually treat him, without his next of kin giving consent. My friend was his partners medical proxy, but apparently it had not occurred to him to carry that paperwork around with him all the time. His partner lay there for almost 6 hours before he could get somebody to go to their house, dig out the paperwork, and get it to the hospital.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","08:06 PM","gay-rights-debates","123"
