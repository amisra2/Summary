And if you and the Palestinians don't like it you can go climb on a parking meter and rotate.","daewoo","475332","Wow. Once again you show your complete and utter lack of biblical knowledge. GOD IS THE ONE WHO EXILED THE JEWS FROM ISRAEL, RETARD. They are prohibited from restoring israel as a nation until GOD PERSONALLY COMES AND DOES IT. Do some reading, genius. In fact, take a stroll over to Home | True Torah Jews where a bunch of Jewish Rabbis explain that it is a SIN to support the state of Israel as a Jewish state. I guess that is one of those parts of the bible that you didn't bother to read. Oh...and the UN has issued 6 declarations requiring that Israel return to its original borders. They have not done it yet.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","05:37 AM","gay-rights-debates","376"
"07-04-2013","17119",26,"Dani","475320","ANSWER! ""Tell us what you would do if Canada started illegally occupying parts of the USA. Tell us what you would do if the Canadian army confiscated YOUR land, destroyed YOUR home, killed YOUR family and left you to starve. What would you do knob? The irony in your idiocy is that YOU are the one beating your chest about how you will fight anyone that tries to take what belongs to you. YOU are the one boasting about laying traps to kill hundreds should anyone try to take from you, yet here you are castigating the Palestinians for doing exactly what you claim is your 'right' to do to others. What an obnoxious, sickening bigot you are.""","daewoo","475333","Going with native Americans rather than Canadians would make for a better example. Realistically native Americans have a MUCH, MUCH stronger claim on the US than the Jews do on Israel. Prior to the creation of Israel there had not been a self ruled Jewish state in the middle east for nearly 8000 years. Also, the Jews were not forcibly evicted from the region...they left on their own. The native Americans, on the other hand, owned the entire continent less than 300 years ago. White settlers murdered millions of them and broke literally dozens of treaties that gave the native americans LEGAL TITLE to wide swaths of what is currently the US. The US government violated multiple supreme court rulings that found that the indians legally owned their land and the government did not have the right to remove them. So, easy, if a native American showed up at your house tomorrow, murdered everybody in your family, and seized the house as their own, you would be OK with that? The Israelis had no legitimate claim to the land they seized. That Indian that just chopped your wife's head off WOULD have a legitimate claim, so it is a little different.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","05:51 AM","gay-rights-debates","377"
"07-04-2013","17119",26,"Hdreams","475331","Ahh Daewoo... You seem to be forgetting the one type of welfare all of the right-wing agree's we cant have too much of, whether they be Evangelical/Neo-con/Conservative/Tea Party... The welfare of defense...","daewoo","475334","You have to keep in mind that we share our northern border with the dreaded Canadians. Those mounties are some pretty shifty characters. I have been trying to figure out for years why in the world certain parts of the American public seem to think we need to drive ourselves bankrupt in the name of ""defense"". The only answer I have managed to come up with is ""mild mental retardation"". You cannot make a logical argument for spending as much as we do on ""defense"". It simply cannot be done.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","06:01 AM","gay-rights-debates","378"

"07-04-2013","17119",26,"daewoo","475329","Yea...remember 9/11 when America got attacked and thousands of Americans died for our ""right"" to support genocidal war criminals (yep...talking about Israel there). You are always whining about how much we spend on social programs...in the last 2 decades we have spent MORE on welfare for Israel than we have on welfare programs here in the US.","Easyrider","475336","There's not that many sane people around who bow down to Muslim thuggery, but apparently you're one of the dead heads who do. There's no shortage of examples of Arab / Muslim attacks against Israel, so don't even bother trying to go there. Anyone we can pay to kill Muslim thugs / terrorists is money well spent. And don't forget all the Arab countries that support terrorism against Israel, like Iran and Syria. If you like those maggots so much move on over there.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","07:52 AM","gay-rights-debates","380"

Nonsense. God and the UN gave them that land. In the Old Testament the original inhabitants of the ""promised land"" were forcibly evicted due to their many atrocities against Israel and others.

The Rebirth of Israel http://brittgillette.com/WordPress/?p=28 In addition, you and those Biblically-challenged rabbis need to read Ezekiel chapters 37-39 to see why you're the ones who are Biblically challenged. Screw the UN. They used to be half way lucid in the beginning but now they've turned into a politically-correct, anti-semitic gang of id*ots.

Also the government was not appointed by god.... im not sure what drug or religious induced delirium you are in as regards to this but they are appointed by the senate/congress/white house through elected individuals. You seriously think god elects Congressmen/Senators & Presidents? If this were true then why are you so against the divinely elected current President? please read V for Vendetta.. all chapters.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","08:44 AM","gay-rights-debates","388"

I guess you're ok spending all our money on failed school systems so we can leave our country unprotected. You're apparently blind to the providence of God. As Thomas Jefferson noted, I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who lead our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessities and comforts of life. (Monday, March 4, 1805, in his 2nd Inaugural Address) You haven't read the Bible, have you? Sometimes God gives people the screwed up government they deserve. He raised up King Nebuchadnezzar to come against Israel when they became corrupt.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","08:58 AM","gay-rights-debates","389"
