And unless you repent you and your fellow pro-gay infidels will be right there with them.","Accipiter","472241","ez and Jesus BF friends forever. Jesus is a pedophile!","obama-supports-gay-marriage","09:41 AM","gay-rights-debates","166"
"04-14-2013","17119",12,"3rik","472281","Are you supporting the bullying of youth? Are you supporting acts that become so ridiculing and defamatory that kids commit suicide to escape it? And also the bible is contradictory, in one place saying that god loves all his children, but then saying some aren't going to heaven. Another question... Being gay isn't something you can change by command, is it? Or do you believe we should promote some sketch medical procedure?","Easyrider","472287","Nope, and where do you get that from my comment, ""Telling people the truth that gay sex is a sin is bullying people? That's bizarre""? This is an example of failing to study the Bible in depth. The one's going to Hell aren't God's children (John 8:44, etc.) Hey - heterosexuals are wired for fornication and adultery, but are warned not to do it. Gay sex is a premeditated behavior also, so I don't buy the argument there's no control. Have you studied the entire Bible in depth? I seriously doubt it. So if you're going to be a critic of the Bible you should have studied it to know what you're talking about.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","04:35 AM","gay-rights-debates","168"
"04-14-2013","17119",12,"3rik","472281","Which sports, exactly, require an assault weapon that fires 850 rounds per minute?''","Easyrider","472288","Who says guns are for sport only? When a criminal or criminals come at you with that same kind of weapon (which they obtained illegally, ignoring laws such as felons not allowed to possess guns), what are you going to do, swat them with your fly swatter? Or call a Hollywood liberal? LOL! Let me know how that works out for you. Also, as various founding fathers have argued, the right to bear arms is there to guard against a tyrannical government.

"04-14-2013","17119",12,"None","None","None","3rik","472297","To use a book of morals as evidence isn't my thing. I find that religious beliefs shouldn't be your fallback to say gays aren't as good as you. And to use the bible as evidence to anything outside of religious studies is like using to as ""evidence"" against the theory of evolution. And saying that it isn't controllable is equivalent to me saying that your attraction to women is comtrollable. However mo matter what you'll always be attracted to women.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:08 AM","gay-rights-debates","171"

And unless you're facing an army of grizzley bears or a whole drug cartel, I would hope you wouldn't need a 850 bullets/minute fire rate.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:13 AM","gay-rights-debates","173"

You have your own 'book' of politically correct humanism which lays those arguments out for you. As for gays not being ""as good as I am"" I've already said that ALL HAVE SINNED AND FALLEN SHORT OF THE GLORY OF GOD. Are you without sin? If not then you need a savior to get to heaven. But you've never studied the Bible so how would you know? There's plenty of celibate Christian gays, and plenty of celibate Christian heterosexuals. So it is controllable.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:54 AM","gay-rights-debates","174"
