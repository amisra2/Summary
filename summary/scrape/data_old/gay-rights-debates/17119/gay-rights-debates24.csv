"07-02-2013","17119",24,"daewoo","475247","It is not a theoretical illustration. It is an ignorant, ridiculous, farce. We are all dumber for having read it. After israel declared itself its own nation...a Jewish nation...and started killing Arabs in the area (Palestinians) Middle eastern Muslims started hating the jews and zionists. Since Israel became a nation they have killed 90,785 Palestinians. The Palestinians have killed 3,722 Israelis. The Israelis literally seized Palestinian homes, herded them into refugee camps, then shelled the camps. That does not even include the casualties of wars of aggression that the Israelis have fought against their neighbors. If you include those the Israelis have outkilled the arabs/palestenians by over 600:1.","Easyrider","475254","That's impossible. You're an ignorant jacka*s. Israel was only hours old when the Muslims attacked THEM. Then the Muslims are especially stupid for continuing to launch rockets, etc., at Israel. And you're a loser for defending the Muslims. Let me tell you something else. Israel is going to kick Iran's a*s soon for threatening Israel with destruction, and for building the bomb which they're too immature to have. And I'm going to laugh at you when Israel kicks their butts.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:50 PM","gay-rights-debates","349"

"07-03-2013","17119",24,"Dani","475257","Bravo! Well said. Sickos like EZ only hear about what is happening in Palestine from American pro-Israeli news programmes. It's you that is the ignorant jackass. You need to educate yourself on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and perhaps then you wouldn't come across as such a clown. No doubt they would if the Israelis stopped stealing Palestinian land, destroying Palestinian homes and killing Palestinians. A good start would be for Israel to give back the Palestinian land that they stole from Palestine. He's not defending Muslims. He pointing out to you the injustice that Palestinians have suffered under the Israelis.","Easyrider","475264","Love the way you antichrist jackas*es stick up for the homophobic Muslims. I would think you'd be consistent and take the Muslims to task for hating and killing gays. But no, your anti-semitism wins the day. The Palestinians never had their own country, you imbecile. And you want to talk about me sucking up media lies? You want a long list of Muslim atrocities against the Jews just Google it. And don't forget the Olympic massacre of Jewish athletes at Munich.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","08:52 AM","gay-rights-debates","355"

Go learn the difference between anti-Semite and anti-Zionist. The Palestinians never had their own country, you imbecile. And you want to talk about me sucking up media lies? You're an imbecile. Your ignorance of the Israeli-Palistinian problem is almost as great as your ignorance of evolution and other aspects of science.

Tell us what you would do if the Canadian army confiscated YOUR land, destroyed YOUR home, killed YOUR family and left you to starve. What would you do knob? The irony in your idiocy is that YOU are the one beating your chest about you will fight anyone that tries to take what belongs to you. YOU are the one boasting about laying traps to kill hundreds should any try to take from you, yet here you are castigating the Palestinians for doing exactly what you claim is your 'right ' to do to others. What an obnoxious, sickening bigot you are. I couldn't give a feck about 9/11","obama-supports-gay-marriage","09:33 AM","gay-rights-debates","360"
