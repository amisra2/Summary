On Gay Marriage, Media Gives Obama a Pass - Yahoo! News This administration under my direction, has consistently said, we cannot discriminate as a country against people on the basis of sexual orientation What Ive seen happen over the last several years and what happened in New York last week I think was a good thing because what you saw was the people of New York having a debate, talking through these issues. It was contentious, it was emotional but ultimately they made a decision to recognize civil marriages. And I think thats exactly how things should work. And so I think it is important for us to work through these issues because each community is going to be different and each state is going to be different to work through them. In the meantime, we filed briefs before the Supreme Court that say any discrimination against gays, lesbians, transgenders is subject to heightened scrutiny and we dont think DOMA is unconstitutional (sic they do think DOMA is unconstitutional). So the combination of what states are doing, what the courts are doing, the actions were taking administratively, all are how the process should work I think what youre seeing is a profound recognition on the part of the American people that gays, lesbians and transgender persons are our brothers, our sisters, our children, our cousins, our friends, our co-workers and that theyve got to be treated like every other American. And I think that principle will win out.","Matthew S","448165","Here is the difference Every Republican presidential candidate wants gay marriage banned and gay people thrown into prison through the reinstatement of sodomy laws.

You haven't made a case yet. In fact, you've failed to answer my challenge. What's more, you have no objective foundation that your beliefs are correct. Your beliefs are subjective and change across cultures and times. They're about as enduring as a fat kid in a dodge ball match. Once again, have you ever read the entire Bible?","Bennedict","407980","refer to above edit on whether ive read the bible and so what if it comes from the old testament? tons of homophobic quotes come from the old testament. once again, picking and choosing the good ones. and i know that i havent made a case yet. i said that already, that the statements thus far have been for discrediting the religious argument against homosexuality. and yes, my beliefs are subject to change across cultures and times, and i think thats a magnificent way of going about belief - by learning. its quite pretentious to say 'my beliefs are the best, theyve always been the best, they will always be the best and they will never change at any time because they are already the best.' sorry to harp on your beliefs, i dont mean to, honestly.","gay-marriage","07:20 PM","gay-rights-debates",155

Why isn't your Scripturephobic agenda worse, since it ignores the truth and misleads the populace? But that's what you believe, isn't it? Why is it pretentious for me to claim my beliefs are better but it isn't pretentious for you to argue that yours are better? That's ok. Everything's cool. I've always had one challenge if someone wants to try to change my beliefs. And that is to show me that the resurrection of Jesus Christ is a lie. Can you do it? After all, Christianity rises or falls on the resurrection. Should be simple to falsify if it's such a big (supposed) myth, n'est pas?","gay-marriage","07:27 PM","gay-rights-debates",140
