"02-27-2011","15071",3,"smiley","424941","Aaaah, so that's why you used the phrase 'mating pair'. It was so that only your prefered version of marriage could apply. You started out by saying that it was to do with producing children. When examples of 'mating pairs' who couldn't actually produce children, and other alternatives that produce children more efficiently, were brought to your attention you had to come up with some trick that would exclude the alternatives. The 'mating pair'! Very clever.","Sigma","424943","I'm not sure why 'efficiency' or even the number of children suddenly became an issue. A 'mating pair' is more than a phrase, that's how you sexually produce children. With only two genders, how could it be otherwise? My 'preferred version' is the only method to naturally produce children and I daresay that is a significant fact to most rational people. If you want to increase the sheer size of a family, then yes take multiple wives.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","07:25 PM","gay-rights-debates","31"
"02-27-2011","15071",3,"Xcaliber","424939","Can you show Evidence that it is Culturally assumed? There are married couples who are not Able to reproduce, so why are they any different that a Gay Couple?","Sigma","424944","The history of the country has been dominated by this view. That seems to be evidence that our culture has viewed marriage in this light. As I told smiley , the definition of a species is, simplistically, a population that can reproduce among themselves. If an individual member is unable to reproduce, it is still a member of that species. Individual idiosyncrasies are hypothetical exceptions.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","07:29 PM","gay-rights-debates","32"

Love and reproduction are implied. So, does love not matter? Do children not matter? Then, why the chosen phrase 'mating pair', when mating is only implied? Why not just 'concenting pair'? Concenting is a must, unless we include arranged marriage (then it's just implied, I guess). If they must be a mating pair, why allow those who are infertile, or old people? Oh yes, they are just an anomaly. They don't matter. Why a ' mating pair'? Why the choice of the word mating when it clearly doesn't apply in all cases? Why not a 'fertile pair'? Or a 'compatible pair'? Or for that matter, a fertile or compatible group. Maybe we should screen all potential couples to make sure they can reproduce, and then ensure that they mate successfully (preferable with video evidence and a paternal test upon delivery). If not, why not? Why insist that marriage should be between people who can reproduce, especially when this is clearly not enforced. And if we are obviously not bothered about the mating part, why insist that marriage be set aside purely for 'mating pairs'?","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","08:05 PM","gay-rights-debates","33"

Why is a mating pair needed for reproduction? That's a child's question, smiley . Even if a virgin at married, it's assumed (but not legally required) that you are not so after you're married. At least, not for long. I don't think I really need to justify how marriage is viewed, even if I endeavor to explain it. As I've explained: groups do not mate. It simply does not occur, outside certain exceptions. There are only two genders, therefore only two contribute to the offspring (in the normal way of things, at least). As to the rest, there really is no reason why not. It would be governmental overreach and contrary to the ideals of freedom, but other than that ... Marriage is a meaningful custom. Part of that meaning is derived from the significant fact that only a heterosexual pairing can naturally produce children. People, in general, enjoy being a part of ancient and meaningful customs. I don't believe that it is unjustified to resist efforts to change this custom.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","09:27 PM","gay-rights-debates","35"

Exceptions to the rule of reproduction does not disqualify an individual from the species, even if being part of a species is defined by the ability to reproduce among the population. Except, to continue our analogy, different species aren't an exception to the reproduction of the species as a non-reproducing member is. They're not part of the population we're examining at all.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","09:36 PM","gay-rights-debates","36"

If you were trying to make me look stupid by implying that I was not aware that a mating couple is necessary for reproduction, you failed. Perhaps it made you look stupid by not understanding that the question was why is a mating pair necessary for marriage. Marriage is the topic of conversation here. Try to keep up. You seem to be trying to interweave the words mate and reproduce. You say that part of the meaning of marriage is that the couple can reproduce, and then claim that groups don't mate.

This notion is quite a modern phenominon. And as reproduction seems to give a marriage meaning, then we've already covered that one. Infertile people and old people cannot provide that meaning, whereas groups of people can. Either repoduction is key or it is not.

The question was ill-formed to get the answer you were trying for. Necessity has little to do with it. Why are people necessary for marriage? Because that's what it was created to accomodate. No, they don't. With two genders, there are only two members that contribute to offspring. A group does not reproduce: only a heterosexual coupling can naturally do that. In one form or another it certainly is ancient. It's current form predates the union, which brings us full circle with the cultural meaning. And one common thread is the heterosexual component, almost without exception. That supports the notion that the core idea behind marriage is a mating couple. Groups provide no meaning that a heterosexual couple would not do on it's own. And, yes, if marriage were composed solely of non-reproductive couples then it would not have the meaning it does have. But as it is, they do not detract from the meaning either, in the same way non-reproductive members don't detract from a species.

"02-28-2011","15071",3,"gansao","424905","So it follows that gay couples who are not a mating pair( because they cannot) must be equated to a childless couple...this is dishonest. Gay couples are adopting children as well as using surrogate mothers. This puts the child at a distinct disadvantage...there is no mother( or father) A gay' marriage' is a shadow of a heterosexual one..","pappillion001","424967","Ah yes of course so many children grow up with mom and dad who spend quality time teaching them all they will need to one day enter the world on their own. Other than the gender of one what then is the difference between a gay couple who are not a mating pair because they can't and a childless couple who aren't a mating pair because they can't. So the raising children part is not the problem it's the mating part or where they get the kid from? OK so how is this applicable to gay couples who are not a mating pair and remain childless? So if kids aren't involved then everything is OK right? Of course not you will come around with some different asinine excuse why it's your business to to tell someone else who they can play house with. Let's be honest straight people have pixxed all over the ideal concepts of marriage. That is all the different versions, not just our western Judeo-Christian incarnation. Marriage is like a pet that is mistreated by it's owner until someone else wants to take it away and then it has value, but only because it belongs to them not for any change in attitude.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","12:23 AM","gay-rights-debates","44"

What complete and utter rubbish. Note the phrase 'In one form or another'. This tends to suggests that there are other forms of marriage. Why prohibit all but one? This suggests that groups also provide meaning. Why prohibit them? If non-productive couples do not detract from the meaning of marriage, why balk against gay non-productive couples being allowed to share in that meaning? Then let me enlighten you, oh unsure one. Customs such as the marriage of 1 man to many women (examples of which occur throughout history both within and without the bible), the marriage of 1 woman to many men (this tends to occur in cultures with a short supply of females), the marriage of two men (from roman and greek history), the marriage of 1 man, 1 woman and an additional homosexual shaman (a sign of good fortune in some native american cultures). These customs and more are ancient and have provided meaning to marriage for many throughout the years, yet you ignore them all in favour of your narrow and discriminatory view of marriage.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","08:08 AM","gay-rights-debates","45"
