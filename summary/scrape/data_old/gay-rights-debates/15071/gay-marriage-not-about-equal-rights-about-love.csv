They want to be together in a bond that makes them one with each other forever. It is a wonderful thing to have such a bond. It is special. It is love. When a man and a woman get married, no one blinks an eye. If two men or two women do the same, then many people do not approve. They claim that it is not right or that it soils the real meaning of marriage. What is the real meaning of marriage? The answer to that question is in line one of this article. It is because they love each other. Does it matter if the couple is gay or straight? Should it matter? No! After all, why should it. Gays want their equal rights and among those equal rights is the right to be married. I agree with wanting equal rights. We are all people which means we are all the same. It does not matter if someone is gay, white, black, a man, a woman, tall, short, young, old or whatever. We all want our equal rights. That is our right. However, we need to go beyond equal rights when it comes to gay marriage. Society needs to understand that any marriage is not about the right to be married. It is about wanting to be married as a loving couple. Love is not something that should be decided on by voters. It is not a court issue either. It should not be an issue at all. Marriage is between two people in love. It is not between two people, the voters, the courts and anyone else who has an opinion. Gay marriage does not bring down the meaning of marriage. It makes the true meaning of marriage even better. That is what love does. It makes things better. Society has come a long way in the last fifty years in terms of equality, but we still have a long way to go. It is a shame that love is something that needs to be fought for. I am not gay, but I am the same as you as you are to me. May love conquer all. George Vreeland Hill","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","07:35 PM","gay-rights-debates","1"

Based on results Love is not the best foundation for marriage or maybe people should either get a better understanding of what love is or look for other reasons in addition to love. Let me just say I do not oppose same sex marriage. Gay couples could not do anything to hurt the idea of marriage that straight couples have not already been doing for centuries. You say that it is about love, but you actually hold onto it's about a piece of paper and recognition of others.

The only connection between a mating couple and marriage is the connection made on a cultural level. So, logically, the cultural meaning of marriage would be the purpose of a mating couple. While 'purpose' can mean different things, in this context I daresay most would refer to the evolutionary purpose of a mating couple: reproduction. Love is implied because love brings the couple together for that purpose. While legally a 27yr old marrying a 70yr old sugar daddy is not a problem, culturally speaking this marriage is not as meaningful as one that is in-line with the evolutionary purpose I outlined above.

I certainly am not proposing a penalty for homosexuals either. Well, yes, and this is through the technological and economic progress that made it possible for couples to have sex and raise children without a pitiless division of labor in which a mother had to devote every waking moment to keeping the children alive. Clean water, sanitation, and modern medicine has lowered infant mortality and reduced the need for large numbers of children. Contraception, amniocentesis, ultrasound, and other reproductive technologies have made it possible for women to defer childbearing to the optimal point in their lives. But our instincts do not change with technology much if at all. The difference in the sexes is not arbitrary, and our instincts evolved along those lines. The desire for a mate and for children still exists, and marriage formalizes that bond. No question. I'm not talking in terms of 'good' or 'bad' because those are value judgements. However, whether or not a definition can change does not mean that the desire to keep the meaning is unjustified or invalid.

Look at it this way: if marriage has never been about family, would marriage be viewed as what you do when you want to start a family? I don't think it would have that association without the history it has. People will still view it as what you do when you want to start a family, but it will be out of remembered meaning which will probably fade over time. After that, it will be about the legal benefits you can garner from it, if these have any point after the change. Any meaning it has will be a cultural artifact without anything underlying it. Some people already look at it that way. I'm not sure how long restrictions against incest or plural marriage would last, since those restrictions are based on biology as well.

"03-03-2011","15071",5,"pappillion001","425089","I am a undecided on this statement. Considering more of our lives are spent without the desire to reproduce than the window in which we can is open. The is the biological desire to go thruough the motions, but more often then not it isn't with procreation in mind. Obviously one is necessary for the other and the biological desire is for the survival of the species, but in associating marrigae with only procreation fails to explain circumstances were that is not the intent or the regard it is given by society. Children can be an important factor but not a deal killer. Suggesting that children are not the primary purpose of marriage. That the relationship has equal if not greater value. Our instincts may remain somewhat consistant, but instinct lags behind experience. The desire for children will never go away, but how we react to those instincts will shape future generations. When that desire inteferes with the principals on which the society maintains itself then it does become invalid or there must be a revision to the ideals that are used by the populous. Those opposed to gay marriage can express their view they can choose not to participate in such a marriage, but when we talk about equal rights and equal opportunities that doesn'r mean for just the majority. That has been the culrual norm longer than not and in a number of places remains so. How often have women been the dominant gender in a society? I could count the number on one hand even if I didn't have any hands because there doesn't exist one known civilization in which that was the case.","Sigma","425102","You might be confusing proximate and ultimate causation. Absolutely people go through the motions to satisfy the proximate need (the desire for sex). However, the amoral process of natural selection created the desire for sex as a method to ensure reproduction. That is the ultimate causation. Marriage and reproduction are not one and the same, and I don't mean to suggest it is. Marriage is the cultural way to formalize the heterosexual bond which, itself, facilitates reproduction. Marriage gains meaning from that association (a great deal of meaning, imo), but can also gain meaning beyond it. Since heterosexual attraction is used (by natural selection) to facilitate reproduction, the relationship itself is associated with reproduction even if reproduction does not occur. Of course, but our history is not changable. The importance of reproduction will not diminish even if modern technology changes how and when we reproduce. That can be true, but human nature should not be irrelevent to our choices even if they do not dictate our choices. The facts must be combined with a statement of values and method of resolving conflicts among them. Rape, for example, is a facet of human nature and avoiding rape is also a facet of human nature. Since it is inherent in our value system that the interests of women are not subordinate to the interests of men, rape is not tolerated. With that being said, biological differences can justify differences in society. Men and women are not identical to one another and differences in how they're treated in similar situations is justifiable. With that being said: marriage, in our culture, has been a formalization of a bond that is related to reproduction. Homosexuals simply do not fit into that meaning. The meaning would have to change to accomodate them. My argument is not whether the meaning should change. My argument that including homosexuals will change what marriage means. It is a trade-off, and without acknowledgement of human nature we would choose one trade-off over another without even realizing it . Yes, all cultures divide their labor by sex, with more responsibility for childrearing by women and more control of the public and political realms by men. These differences are exactly what an evolutionary biologist would predict, in fact. However, our culture has not bought and sold women. So, no, it has not been the cultural norm. It would be an arbitrary custom to buy and sell women, anyway.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","11:23 AM","gay-rights-debates","74"
