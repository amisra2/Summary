"03-02-2011","15071",5,"snakespit","425054","I just don't get it. How exactly is the inclusion of gay marriage a threat to the institution of marriage? In a country where ~50% of all first time marriages end in divorce, celebrities change spouses faster than the seasons, television ""reality shows"" make a mockery of the process, and you can get married in a drunken stupor at a drivethru chapel in Las Vegas...what is the threat? What you should have said is that SCOTUS has not yet legally decided if it is a civil right or not. If it was determined by SCOTUS to be a civil right tomorrow, I doubt that many of the people who are against gay marriage today would change their opinions. I won't speak for Matthew, but I took his comment as to mean that we should not have to debate about gay rights.","jyoshu","425055","But religious people DO oppose those things. And more importantly no one is trying to enshrine divorced couples to get benefits. That's the difference. So you agree with me it has not been determined yet. I don't see how guaranteed govt. benefits for any limited part of the population can possibly EVER be a constitutionally given civil right . If it is, then any group for ANY reason they claim--however outlandish--would have to be given the benefits as well. That's one of the points I think Sigma is trying to get you to realize with the whole 'groups' thing. Well, if that's the case, then no one is making him respond. He indeed doesn't HAVE to debate it. That's up to him whether or not he wants to chime in. The reason it's still a debate in 2011 isn't because of anything 'sad', but rather because the jury is still out on issues related to marriage and morality when it comes to gay sexual relationships; that you and Matthew may be WRONG in the cavalier way you view gay sex and making marriage an 'anything-goes' institution. It's the height of arrogance to pretend that's not a possibility.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","01:27 PM","gay-rights-debates","61"

How exactly is the inclusion of gay marriage a threat to the institution of marriage? I was gonna try to respond to Sigma with something like this...but he does indeed seem to be ""impervious to logic"".","Sigma","425056","Then why are homosexuals so wild about it? I doubt it's purely philosophical. I think people care about marriage quite a lot. I also think it would take some mental gymnastics to say marriage benefits are civil rights. Heterosexual attraction is the basis of sexual reproduction. There really is no way to rationally deny this. I believe this fact has a certain amount of meaning to most people. It's important. Ancient forms and customs, even arbitrary ones, acquire meaning to different cultures. They might be unique to that culture, but they are meaningful within that culture. Now take the custom of marriage. The only thing that saves it from being an arbitrary cultural custom is the fact that it is based upon heterosexual attraction. Therefore it has meaning even beyond a cultural phenomenon because it acquires meaning from both the biological function and the cultural function. In a sense, it is an acknowledgement of the importance of heterosexual attraction to humans as a species (since sexual reproduction is one of the basis of evolution itself). De-coupling marriage from the biological base turns marriage into an arbitrary cultural custom. The history of our biology is time-less, but our cultural ideas are not. That can be regarded as a threat, I think. ""He""?","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","01:31 PM","gay-rights-debates","62"

Like I said...you don't hear a whole lot about the other things I listed, which in my opinion are far more damaging to the ""institution"" of marriage than allowing 2 men or 2 women to marry. You know what marriage I care about?...my own, and that's it. If Bob and Steve down the road get married...I am not impacted in any way. My marriage is not cheapened in any way by who someone else decides to marry. So what gives heterosexual couples the ""right"" to marry? Yeah, I get it. Bob + Steve = No Baby --- Bob + Wendy = Baby If you wouldn't mind coming around to a salient point on this issue...? Even ancient forms and customs were once new. So your saying that if gay people are allowed to marry...then marriage becomes pointless and heterosexual couples will stop having sex and our species will parish? I know this probably boils your point down to the absurd, but I really don't get what you are driving at. Could you explain it in simple terms? Excuse me. Is ""he"" a ""she""?

"03-02-2011","15071",5,"Sigma","425051","Your self-worth shouldn't be dependant on what others think about you. I know this is a lofty goal and most people are keenly aware of how others judge them, but regardless it isn't justifiable to abandon reason. Look at the riots and the cities that went up in flames in the 1960's In fact, getting angry is counterproductive. You're easier to dismiss when you're angry. You're nearly as irrational as Easyrider (it's hard to top him in idiocy, though). If you show yourself to be reasonable, then people will try to reason with you. I support laws the same laws for you as there are for me. If you want more than that, then you must convince the majority of people to agree with you. Having you suffer is certainly not my desire.","Matthew S","425078","Oh please the television, movies, newspapers, books, and magazines are full of heteros making wedding plans, wedding announcements, or weddings. ever see the program Bridezilla?

In fact I would be happy and my sense of justice satisfied if no one could get married, then we would all be equal. Anger is and can be productive, let a few anti gay churches go up in flames maybe some respect will be had. It is hardly the same when you get to marry the person you love and have that marriage recognized by the state you live in.

Not everyone can marry whom they love. Not everyone finds someone who they love or who loves them. We are all equal regardless, Matthew S . You won't garner respect by burning churches. Passion can get you respect, but not irrational anger. You're tending toward the latter, and from watching Easyrider you can see what happens when you go off the deep end. Nobody on either side of the issue respects him. You don't know if I can marry whom I love. Even heterosexuals cannot marry whomever they love. It's a lie. I know you're angry enough to spit nails because you want to be able to get married anywhere, but to a great many people marriage is for a purpose. Not every heterosexual fits into it, even, and certainly deviants like pedophiles don't fit into it. You have got to realize that maybe you need to accept you don't get everything that everyone else gets. I know for a fact I don't get everything that everyone else gets and I have to live with that. Not everyone finds love, not everyone gets married. It happens, man. To be honest I can't even see how not getting married is 'suffering'. There are plenty of single people out there who are not suffering. At least, no more than anyone else without a partner.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","08:49 PM","gay-rights-debates","66"

We all agree upon them as we agree upon any legal mandate. It's sort of central to my point about the meaning we give to marriage. Since heterosexual attraction has importance to most people, I daresay, marriage then gains meaning even beyond an arbitrary cultural custom. Damaged? It will lose the meaning it gains from being associated with heterosexuality, certainly. There's no getting around that from what I can see. I think it's justifiable to want to keep what gives custom meaning. Look at it this way: if marriage has never been about family, would marriage be viewed as what you do when you want to start a family? I don't think it would have that association without the history it has. People will still view it as what you do when you want to start a family, but it will be out of remembered meaning which will probably fade over time. After that, it will be about the legal benefits you can garner from it, if these have any point after the change. Any meaning it has will be a cultural artifact without anything underlying it. Some people already look at it that way. I'm not sure how long restrictions against incest or plural marriage would last, since those restrictions are based on biology as well. And that raises a question: Why are there legal benefits? The Federal government has a legitimate interest in discouraging reproduction outside of marriage, but when marriage is no longer about family is there really a justifiable purpose?","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","10:41 PM","gay-rights-debates","68"

"03-03-2011","15071",5,"Sigma","424988","The desire for children is instinctual. It is present in greater or lesser quantities, certainly, but is no less 'natural' for that. Given that the desire for children is the reason our species exists, that fact is understandable. I certainly am not proposing a penalty for homosexuals either. Well, yes, and this is through the technological and economic progress that made it possible for couples to have sex and raise children without a pitiless division of labor in which a mother had to devote every waking moment to keeping the children alive. Clean water, sanitation, and modern medicine has lowered infant mortality and reduced the need for large numbers of children. Contraception, amniocentesis, ultrasound, and other reproductive technologies have made it possible for women to defer childbearing to the optimal point in their lives. But our instincts do not change with technology much if at all. The difference in the sexes is not arbitrary, and our instincts evolved along those lines. The desire for a mate and for children still exists, and marriage formalizes that bond. No question. I'm not talking in terms of 'good' or 'bad' because those are value judgements. However, whether or not a definition can change does not mean that the desire to keep the meaning is unjustified or invalid.","pappillion001","425089","I am a undecided on this statement. Considering more of our lives are spent without the desire to reproduce than the window in which we can is open.

Absolutely people go through the motions to satisfy the proximate need (the desire for sex). However, the amoral process of natural selection created the desire for sex as a method to ensure reproduction. That is the ultimate causation. Marriage and reproduction are not one and the same, and I don't mean to suggest it is. Marriage is the cultural way to formalize the heterosexual bond which, itself, facilitates reproduction. Marriage gains meaning from that association (a great deal of meaning, imo), but can also gain meaning beyond it. Since heterosexual attraction is used (by natural selection) to facilitate reproduction, the relationship itself is associated with reproduction even if reproduction does not occur. Of course, but our history is not changable. The importance of reproduction will not diminish even if modern technology changes how and when we reproduce. That can be true, but human nature should not be irrelevent to our choices even if they do not dictate our choices. The facts must be combined with a statement of values and method of resolving conflicts among them. Rape, for example, is a facet of human nature and avoiding rape is also a facet of human nature. Since it is inherent in our value system that the interests of women are not subordinate to the interests of men, rape is not tolerated. With that being said, biological differences can justify differences in society. Men and women are not identical to one another and differences in how they're treated in similar situations is justifiable. With that being said: marriage, in our culture, has been a formalization of a bond that is related to reproduction. Homosexuals simply do not fit into that meaning. The meaning would have to change to accomodate them. My argument is not whether the meaning should change. My argument that including homosexuals will change what marriage means. It is a trade-off, and without acknowledgement of human nature we would choose one trade-off over another without even realizing it . Yes, all cultures divide their labor by sex, with more responsibility for childrearing by women and more control of the public and political realms by men. These differences are exactly what an evolutionary biologist would predict, in fact. However, our culture has not bought and sold women. So, no, it has not been the cultural norm. It would be an arbitrary custom to buy and sell women, anyway.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","11:23 AM","gay-rights-debates","74"
