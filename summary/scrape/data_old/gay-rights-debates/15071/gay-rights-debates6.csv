Pointing out a particular couple who does not reproduce would not change that fact :P Marriage is a formalization of that bond.","snakespit","425106","But you continuously point to homosexuals for that very reason...their marriages will not lead to reproduction. Why are they different then? And yet again, I must ask the obvious question. How would the inclusion of homosexuals in marriage harm or weaken the heterosexual bond? Do you think that heterosexuals will stop getting married and stop reproducing?

If a member (or couple) does not reproduce, it does not endanger it's membership in the species or in the generalization of heterosexuality. Homosexuality would not fit in that generalization, and would be outside the population in the analogy. I answered that question already, however. Was there an aspect of it you did not understand? Including homosexual couples would change the meaning of marriage, since marriage is a formalization of the heterosexual bond which, itself, evolved to facilitate reproduction.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","12:49 PM","gay-rights-debates","77"

What harm will it bring about? Simply changing the meaning of something does not in and of itself imply harm.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","01:24 PM","gay-rights-debates","78"

Simply changing the meaning of something does not in and of itself imply harm.","Sigma","425114","I don't think I've argued any harm, snakespit , except where it relates to changing the meaning of marriage. That, in a sense, could be construed as a 'threat' or 'harming' the meaning but the negative connotations might constitute value judgements that I am trying not to make.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","01:45 PM","gay-rights-debates","79"

Laws come and go, with one change wiping out the previous layer of change like footprints in the sand. I'm pretty fatalistic about the whole thing, tbh. Edited to add: Like the title says I don't think it's about the rights, though. Homosexual couples, understandably, want to be included in marriage for the very same reason that others want to exclude homosexual couples. Marriage is meaningful . It is simply unfortunate for homosexual people that the meaning is incompatible with homosexuality.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","02:22 PM","gay-rights-debates","81"

Pointing out a particular couple who does not reproduce would not change that fact :P Marriage is a formalization of that bond. Rofl, you would still have a problem with that, don't lie. After all, OMG THEY HAVE BENEFITS YOU DON'T GET OMG. And that's unconstitutional isn't it, Matthew S . At least according to your flawed reasoning.","Matthew S","425171","I want equality.

So it's a lie that you'd 'be ok with that' since you've been pretty loudly outspoken about that very point. That if anyone has benefits you don't get then it must be unconstitutional.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","09:14 PM","gay-rights-debates","83"

You've also been braying about how if some people have benefits that you don't have access to (and in your scenario it would be much less possible for you to get those benefits) then it must be unconstitutional.

Why are those the only two options? I want equality and I don't care how it comes about.

What part of that do you not understand? The other states and the federal government must recognize all or none. If marriage is to be about breeders and breeding children, and my rules are adopted by the state then yes I am alright. If my rules were adopted then almost no one would get married, and those who get married have to breed if they don't they are no longer married. They have to have 3 witnesses to their act of breeding, along with a video of the event stored in the public records of the county were they live.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","06:39 AM","gay-rights-debates","90"
