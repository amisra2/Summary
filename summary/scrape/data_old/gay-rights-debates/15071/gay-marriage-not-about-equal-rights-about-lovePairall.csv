A 'breeding' couple would most likely have a bond that no homosexual couple could imagine... the same as all heterosexual couples that produce children between themselves. The very best that a homosexual couple can offer a child is an equivalent of a dysfunctional heterosexual family. I agree that couples should be forced to make a binding commitment and be vetted before they are allowed to produce children. In the past marriage was considered a lifelong commitment and the ability to provide for the children relied on the parents health and wealth. Children from poor unhealthy parents were more likely to die than rich healthy ones and a couple that did not stay together became social pariahs. Homosexuals had no place in their understanding of marriage, no more than the ' breeder' style of marriage that you have dreamed up. Also in the past marriages were arranged by wealthy families with the couple carefully picked and the females were relied upon to produce heirs for the husbands..they also had a custom of looking at the the sheets after the couple consumated the marriage to see if they had intercourse and that the newlywed wife was a virgin.

"02-27-2011",2,"15071","14","Sigma","424874","The cultural meaning of marriage is a formalization of a mating pair, who, in turn, create and support a family unit. Love and reproduction are implied. The legal meaning of marriage is, in most States, a contract between two people who are not under the age of consent, of different genders, of the same species, not closely related and who are not already married. Homosexuals are not a part of the traditional or cultural meaning of marriage. In order to be included, the meaning of marriage would have to change. The catch-22 is that homosexual couples want to be included in the current meaning of marriage, but what gives marriage meaning specifically excludes homosexual couples.","Matthew S","424903","Nonsense Two 70 year old heteros on their 3 or 4th marriages are hardly going to have children.

I know you're angry enough to spit nails because you want to be able to get married anywhere, but to a great many people marriage is for a purpose. Not every heterosexual fits into it, even, and certainly deviants like pedophiles don't fit into it.

It's culturally assumed that people will eventually want children (especially women) even if in actuality it does not always happen. The stereotype is true often enough that the anomalies are just that, anomalies. The driving force behind marriage is not changed by the existence of individual idiosyncrasies any more than the definition of a species changes simply because some members are unable to reproduce (a species is defined by a population able to reproduce amongst themselves). Well, yes, homosexuals have to take away the traditional view of marriage. Homosexuals have to change the definition of marriage in order to be included. Both the cultural and legal meaning of marriage specifically excludes homosexuals. Yes, the meaning of marriage can change. Homosexuals are trying to do that right now. I'm not saying it's necessarily good or bad to change the meaning of marriage, but it absolutely must happen in order for homosexuals to be included. As a consequence of this, homosexuals will not enjoy the cultural and traditional meaning of marriage, because marriage will no longer have the cultural and traditional meaning that it once did.","smiley","424915","If it is 'culturally assumed' that the purpose of marriage is to produce children (at least to a large part), why 1 man-1 woman.

I am saying heterosexual couples do provide the cultural meaning of marriage. I am not suggesting this cannot or should not change. But if it does change than the meaning that marriage has thus far had is pretty much dead; without biology to base meaning on then marriage will solely gain cultural meaning with nothing underlying it (as much meaning as pederasty did to the Romans, for example). This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it certainly is a trade-off that is worth worrying about. It's an analogy. Inattention connotes indifference. Or disrespect. Not a marriage as we understand it. Since the cultural meaning would obviously be based on our understanding of the custom, I think the complex interaction between slave-born (who were used freely for sex regardless of gender), freed (who were beholden to those who freed them, but no one else) and free-born (where homosexual relationships carried a social stigma, if not outright disallowed) have little bearing on what we're talking about here.

So your base objection is that marriage will be damaged because it will no longer be defined as 1 man and one woman, but rather as 2 people? If gays were allowed to marry tomorrow, would you still wish to be married? Not that I remembered, but I certainly meant no offense. Again, I do appologize. I am often far more concerned with debating the subject at hand than debating the person (unless it is Easy, then I take pleasure in debating the ""person"".)","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","10:23 PM","gay-rights-debates","129"

We all agree upon them as we agree upon any legal mandate. It's sort of central to my point about the meaning we give to marriage. Since heterosexual attraction has importance to most people, I daresay, marriage then gains meaning even beyond an arbitrary cultural custom. Damaged? It will lose the meaning it gains from being associated with heterosexuality, certainly. There's no getting around that from what I can see. I think it's justifiable to want to keep what gives custom meaning. Look at it this way: if marriage has never been about family, would marriage be viewed as what you do when you want to start a family? I don't think it would have that association without the history it has. People will still view it as what you do when you want to start a family, but it will be out of remembered meaning which will probably fade over time. After that, it will be about the legal benefits you can garner from it, if these have any point after the change. Any meaning it has will be a cultural artifact without anything underlying it. Some people already look at it that way. I'm not sure how long restrictions against incest or plural marriage would last, since those restrictions are based on biology as well. And that raises a question: Why are there legal benefits? The Federal government has a legitimate interest in discouraging reproduction outside of marriage, but when marriage is no longer about family is there really a justifiable purpose?","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","10:41 PM","gay-rights-debates","316"

Marriage is considered a formalization of that bond, but it does not create that bond. While a man can have sex with many women, it is always an iteration of the male-female couple.","Xcaliber","424939","Can you show Evidence that it is Culturally assumed?.. Maybe in a Religious Culture, but Religion doesn't define all of us. With Adoption available there is no longer a Need to re-produce. There are married couples who are not Able to reproduce, so why are they any different that a Gay Couple?. Should be not recognize an older couple who got married but are not able to produce children? Suppose a woman has Ovarian Cancer when young and is unable to have children should we then tell her she can't marry the one she loves because they won't produce a child?. We all know that Gay Couples can't reproduce in the old fashioned way but they can and have adopt children and raise them as well as a straight couple.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","06:53 PM","gay-rights-debates","142"
