Normalisation didn't seem to make the Greek homosexual population decline either.","end-gays-gay-marriage-decline-homosexual-population","02:29 PM","gay-rights-debates","2"

I don't know what point you were trying to raise, though that has never stopped you from posting. The author's argument is interesting at first blush. Something you might muse about briefly, but it is flawed. 1. There are lots of reasons that genes hang around in the gene pool and not all are related to the survival of one individual's offspring. 2. Gay men and women have offspring from their own loins without the use of a heterosexual relationship. 3. Epigenetic phenomena are not considered. The comments following the article talk about these, but you would have to get through that loooong bunch of science-y words to get waaaay down to the bottom of the page. And that would be hard on your brain.","end-gays-gay-marriage-decline-homosexual-population","09:41 AM","gay-rights-debates","13"
