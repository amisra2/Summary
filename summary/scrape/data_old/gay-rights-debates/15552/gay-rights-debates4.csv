This one will do..its a bit obvious anyway seeing as the ' man' who was pregnant was a trangender woman who had to stop its male hormone treatment As for the 'scientist' that seemed to think a fetus could be placed away from vulnerable organs...where did this ' scientist' actually say where it would be? I would imagine that this ' scientist' would have a reasonable knowledge anatomy and physiology being a 'scientist' and all so I am surprised he didnt give you a clue. I believe it was a 'scientist' that persuaded some people to give him money so that they could be frozen after death and be revived ' in the future'. He was full of xxxx too. What I find comical is that some gays on this forum can actually support this cobblers then howl in derision at a thread that purports that homosexuals can be cured","end-gays-gay-marriage-decline-homosexual-population","11:30 AM","gay-rights-debates","49"

Men don't have uteruses or the female control systems to run them. You are talking about genetic engineering of a novel human tissue and nothing less. The simple absurdity of assuming the uterus is around just for the hec of it... Every birth would be a surgery, how would the proper fluid form in the open body? This is a thousand times more dangerous, especially to the child, than doing it the proper (not normal) way. Whats the difference between proper and normal? proper - adapted or appropriate to the purpose or circumstances ; fit; suitable normal - conforming to the standard or the common type; usual; not abnormal; regular; natural.

Personally I would have the same reaction if a straight guy wanted to do this. Its like having your brain put into another body. Sure there is an upside, but a lot of downside also. By arguing this you pretty much concede that gays being unable to reproduce should be a factor in any discussion. By giving value to this as a way to overcome that objection you validate it as an objection needing to be overcome. It isn't, any other time that comes up it gets shot down with the simple example of straights who marry who cannot have children. Now this Sci Fi channel Science gone mad waves this in front of the eyes of gay people and all of sudden The reproduction argument is valid enough to say ""See we could have kids as well"". This will not suddenly turn their hearts and minds. This will be only one more thing to add to their list. There are much better ways than this to both have children and get the repressed peckernecks to practice some goodwill towards others. I think we have enough parent-less kids made the old fashion way. Adding to that among the many other reasons there are, makes this in my mind just a bad idea. Your contribution in winning hearts and minds is probably the most effective and far reaching, not that it was part of some long ago planned strategic plan to infiltrate the straights, but look how strong, dignified and respectable your circumstances are and then compare to what this would bring to the table","end-gays-gay-marriage-decline-homosexual-population","01:46 AM","gay-rights-debates","60"
