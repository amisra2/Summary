"08-03-2011","15552",2,"Freedom","436146","The ad hominems just make you look foolish. Not without heterosexual reproduction I assure you. Medical techniques would not have effected most of our history.","jyoshu","436154","Aren't these two fellas endearing? Such warm examples for their pride movement! Just makes one wanna wave a rainbow flag, huh? Well, regardless the genes would still be passed on. It stands to reason to me that medical technologies would only make them that much more able to pass on supposed gay genes, not less. Gays will only be more and more able to 'get around' having to engage in any normal biological baby-making relationship. I just think the article was interesting. I don't really agree with it, frankly.","end-gays-gay-marriage-decline-homosexual-population","01:08 PM","gay-rights-debates","16"
"08-03-2011","15552",2,"Freedom","436178","Therefore the statement that homosexuals can reproduce without heterosexual relationships is simply absurd. Now that homosexuals aren't repressing themselves and acting like heterosexuals their reproduction overall will go down unless some serious medical advances are made.","jyoshu","436183","Oh I agree; though no 'relationship' is needed. (A woman could use a donation from a sperm bank, for instance.) The bottom line here really though, is that gays can never have children without either a.) doing things in a heterosexual way or b.) going-around what's normative by using technology to assist. Sounds like you agree with the author or the article.","end-gays-gay-marriage-decline-homosexual-population","07:26 PM","gay-rights-debates","18"

Made you a raving lunatic zealot, who has nothing in common with Christianity.","Easyrider","436184","You're nuts. You gays will say anything to try to justify your sin.

"08-03-2011","15552",2,"jyoshu","436183","Sounds like you agree with the author or the article.","Freedom","436187","I agree that less homosexuals are pretending to be heterosexual and therefore having kids. I disagree on a more fundamental level, that homosexuality is primarily an inherited genetic trait. That last is not a solid position but just a working model. It's maddeningly impossible to collect data on the subject, and those who are in an excellent position to report are so paranoid about homophobes they refuse to treat the matter objectively.","end-gays-gay-marriage-decline-homosexual-population","07:47 PM","gay-rights-debates","20"
