You can't be pointing fingers if your hands are unclean.","gansao","436303","Oh dear What do you call ' romantic love' sweetplums? Are you calling gay sex romantic love?

"08-06-2011","15552",5,"MrWriteLA","436298","The point IS...which we seem to have gotten completely off... is that the whole thing about you necessarily NEED a couple of male/female gender to produce a parental relational offspring is ferkakta. You don't, at least in the near future. Nobody may WANT to do it that way, but it may be possible . so... so what? Big friggin deal. Where is it written that two people who love each other and may even want to have a family together need to produce an offspring that's a result of their mutal DNA or else ""no deal""? Guess what? I have a son, produced as the result of a heterosexual relationship. He's cool, he's straight, has a girlfriend he's been with for 2 years, who both have a great relationship with me AND with his mom, I'm living in Spokane, in a monogomous relationship with my partner, whom I adore who has a great relationship with my son and my exwife, and we are known and loved by at least THREE straight, CHRISTIAN couples, which whom we go to concerts, plays, and block parties together, and have one terrific existence together, and pea-brained religio-fascist antiChrists like Gansao and Easyrider (by the way, EZ, Peter Fonda and Jack Nicholson are prepping a lawsuit against you for defaming their franchise--did you even SEE that movie, f-head?) can XXXX it out their collective @sses, cuz I have a great life which I'm enjoying to the max NOW and they'll discover that their supposedly great ""afterlives"" will be nothin but ashes in an urn.","gansao","436304","Bully for you.Im all for sexual deviants having a happy life. As for the man having a baby BS..yes it may mean that eventually a man may be able to be pregnant. We may be able to create a human/animal hybid or sew a mans head on a donkey( this may have already been done actually) but what that has to do with gays is beyond me, except to make bitter homosexuals like Matthew and Provo feel better about themselves.","end-gays-gay-marriage-decline-homosexual-population","05:52 AM","gay-rights-debates","62"
"08-06-2011","15552",5,"Freedom","436286","One day we might be able to beam the baby out of the womb.","Accipiter","436305","Comparing male pregnancy to the ability to beam people from one place to another is ridiculous. Safe male pregnancy is something we could see in 100 years. Beaming people around if it happens will certainly not happen any time soon, I think it's probably impossible anyway.","end-gays-gay-marriage-decline-homosexual-population","05:59 AM","gay-rights-debates","63"
"08-06-2011","15552",5,"Matthew S","436292","Maybe no one has tried. Pregnancy is pretty much plug and play. Just because there are billions of uteri around does not mean that is the only option available just that it is the easiest. Here is a run down of the world I imagine, and BTW is not as much a fantasy world as your ""volitional society"" 1 a stem cell is taken from me. 2 the stem cell is then forced to produce an egg 3 the egg is then fertilized with my husbands sperm 4 The fertilized egg is then implanted in me 5 I carry the baby to term 6 we produce a child that is biologically related to two men and carried to term by a man.","gansao","436306","Just as a matter of interest has steps 1 to 3 actually been achieved and the egg implanted into a woman?","end-gays-gay-marriage-decline-homosexual-population","06:01 AM","gay-rights-debates","64"

Instead I think something more along the lines of your caliber is in order:","Accipiter","436350","You are ignoring the fact that abdominal pregnancy is not only possible it has actually happened","end-gays-gay-marriage-decline-homosexual-population","11:02 PM","gay-rights-debates","66"

How am I coming off as bitter? I didn't express any kind of personal interst in being a pregnant male, nor did I suggest it would be good for the gay community. Your prejudiced, quick to jump to conclusions, condescending attitude, is coming through again. I certainly don't need for men, gay or straight, nor for any woman to be pregnant, to feel good about myself. I wouldn't seek pregnancy for that purpose were it reasonably possible. Who do you think you are, by assuming these negative things about me? Think before you speak, or type, or else you are just being very silly. I'm gay and I already feel quite good about myself. Maybe I'm just too shallow to trade in my great gay abs for stretch marks, and wouldn't want my partner doing so either. That was just a joke.","end-gays-gay-marriage-decline-homosexual-population","08:09 PM","gay-rights-debates","68"
