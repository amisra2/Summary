gansao  gayhumanist  gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive \nTurn No: 1:  S1: \nThats because you are drawn towards perverted sex.\n                    Turn No: 1:  S2:\nNo, you are. Where does this get us? All you are doing now is name-calling gansao. It's rhetoric with no logic like I've said. It's childish. It's stupid. Matthew was showing he can do the same to you.
Turn No:  2:  S1:
Stating the truth is not name calling. perverted - (used of sexual behavior) showing or appealing to bizarre or deviant tastes deviant adj. Differing from a norm or from the accepted standards of a society. n. One that differs from a norm, especially a person whose behavior and attitudes differ from accepted social standards. There you go.\nTurn No:  2:  S2:\nIt's not bizarre. It's not a specific behaviour when heterosexuals are engaging in the same activities. See above. Also, two men together may differ from the norm, statisically, as an identified couple, but don't differ from accepted social standards.
Turn No:  3:  S1:
So if I want to do the same thing with my sister..or father maybe, thats ok then is it?\nTurn No:  3:  S2:\nYes, the act itself is ok. However, the fact that it's with a member of your family goes against accepted social standards. I know where you're going with this old, tired, diversion.
Turn No:  4:  S1:
The truth never becomes tired but constantly denying it can become tiresome Sexual deviancy is sexual deviancy. 50 years ago gay marriage would have been seen as an abomination but now we are maybe on the cusp off accepting this( or having it accepted for us). Incest is far more common than some would have us believe. When gay sexual deviancy is totally accepted as the norm, the fathers who fiddle with their children will climb out the woodwork and start their campaign...

Is unnatural wrong? Isn't a virgin birth unnatural? How about a resurrection? Is the computer you're using as you read this, unnatural? Homosexuality isn't unnatural. Those homosexual "practices" have come naturally to many humans, without a single formal lesson.
Turn No:  1: S2:
Same whining argument could be proffered for incest or paedophilia acceptance so give that one a rest.
Turn No:  2:  S1:
Where do you get "whining"? We could say that incest and pedophilia are natural. Although other species are not incestuous and don't have anything comparable to pedophilia. There is much documented same-sex sex, in many species, however. I was speaking to Archangel's assertion that homoesexuality is not natural and his claim that was the only way to describe it.\nTurn No:  2:  S2:\nYou could say that incest and pedophilia were natural but it would knock the bottom out of your campaign for ' gay marriage' wouldnt it?
Turn No:  3:  S1:
No. No more than it should disallow heterosexuals to marry. Heterosexuality is natural too.\nTurn No:  3:  S2:\nWe cant really accept one form of deviant sex without eventually having to accept ALL forms of deviant sex.

Turn No: 1:  S1: 
Opposing same-sex marriage is hate. Society has never opposed a group's equality, with no rational reason, when that reason isn't hate, insecurity, fear. And it isn't long when debating with opponents that their hatred comes out very blantantly. GUEST's argument is laughable. He says they don't hate us as individuals, just everything we represent as being wrong, unnatural etc. That boils down to the same thing! S2 condescends to us by calling us spoiled children because the majority group with power won't "let us have", what they have.
Turn No:  1: S2:
Its not hate. It is drawing a line where pandering to sexual deviants stop.
Turn No:  2:  S1:
They said the same garbage during debate on inter-racial marriage. They tried to say those relationships were only about naughty sex. It was just bigotry, and it is in the case of same-sex marriage.\nTurn No:  2:  S2:\nInter racial couples do not practise deviant sex.
Turn No:  3:  S1:
Neither do gay people. You have failed to show that. Most people do not care what gay people do sexually. At any rate, you don't have a problem with gay persons having sex, I believe you said. Why does it suddenly make a difference because it's happening in a marriage? Why should the official recognition of gay relationships affect you? It's your own insecurity coming to light.\nTurn No:  3:  S2:\nWe should be tolerant of gay deviant sex. We shouldnt welcome it.
Turn No:  4:  S1:
Because it just might look TOO GOOD to yourself and/or others?\nTurn No:  4:  S2:\nYeah yeah. When the gay paints himself in a corner he throws out the same old insults

Turn No:  2:  S1:

Turn No:  3:  S1:
The public is the 'parent' figure and the law makers are ( or should be) the public's servant.\nTurn No:  3:  S2:\nThis then implies that homosexuals are are not part of the public and the law-makers are not their servants as well, and that you do indeed believe it is your right to allow and disallow things to your fellow citizens. That they are lesser group than you. You just proved your hate.

Homosexuals are a deviant minority.

Its nothing like racial segregation....
Turn No:  1: S2:
It's everything like racial segregation and every kind of segregation throughout the course of history. Every time prejudice/racism/sexism/anti-semetism/homophobia/etc. is challenged the perpetrators always claim "this is nothing like the last". But it always is. This is no exception.
Turn No:  2:  S1:

I dont think you know, I think you are just running at the mouth/ keypad without knowing what you are actually commenting on!\nTurn No:  2:  S2:\nYou think wrong. What makes you think this kind of discrimination is any different?
Turn No:  3:  S1:
So what did I contend was not segregation?\nTurn No:  3:  S2:\nYou said "Its nothing like racial segregation....", which implies that if society did the same thing to gays that they did to blacks it would be different, or less wrong.
Turn No:  4:  S1:
Wrong! Try again. What did I actually contend was nothing like segregation not what you thought I did. You jumped in with your silly little rant without actually knowing the point I made.\nTurn No:  4:  S2:\nThen you should've said "It's nothing like segregation". Don't blame me for your mistakes.
Turn No:  5:  S1:
You still dont know what you are talking about do you? My response to GUEST was correct. This is why you cannot be taken seriously. You are wrong\nTurn No:  5:  S2:\n*GUEST* I didn't say your response wasn't correct, I said it was phrased wrong. What makes you think throwing a temper tantrum will validate your argument? Funny how you call me an immature child yet you are the one slinging insults and personal attacks when you don't get your way.

First of all, to convince me of that you will to find real scientific evidence. Anything coming from Cameron is suspect for reasons already pointed out; he has kicked been out of the legitimate scientific community, gotten in trouble judges and had NUMEROUS scientists publicly condemn him for misuse of their research. Secondly even if this were true, and their lifespans were shorter, that does not legitimize anti-gay legislation or discrimination. What I am saying is that such measures from people like you hurt them. Their being gay does not hurt you. You are in the wrong as you are on the end that is inflicting damage.
Turn No:  1: S2:
Here's a hypothetical situation for you, Jito. Youre the minister of public health for a country in BFE. You're given indisputable proof that a small portion of the population has contracted a disease linked directly to their lifestyle that reduces their lifespan by 20 years. What do you do: a. Ignore it b. Take steps to prevent further spread c. Reward the infected and promote their lifestyle d. None of the above
Turn No:  2:  S1:
Homosexuality is not a disease so the analogy you are building is false. If you are going to segue into HIV, that virus will infect ANYONE and just being gay does not put you at greater risk. Promsicuity and IV drug usage do - but neither of those behaviors are the exclusive realm of homosexuals.\nTurn No:  2:  S2:\nDon't cop out, Jito. Anser the question AS WRITTEN. No assumptions.

Turn No: 1:  S1: 
It's not difficult. Heterosexuals can marry for love, they can marry for political reasons, they can marry for the benefits, they can marry for whatever reason under the sun. The legal requirements of marriage have nothing to do with the reasons to marry. The historic and cultural meaning of marriage can say which reason is more or less valid, but not the legal requirements. Seeing "your unborn children in her eyes", for example, is a culturally valid reason to get married, but it certainly is not one of the legal requirements. I realize that homosexuals are not attracted to members of the opposite sex and so they don't want to get married. However , that is not the same thing as being legally barred from marriage. Since we're talking about what rights heterosexual people have versus what rights homosexual people have, the only logical conclusion is that both groups have the same rights since marrying whomever you love is not a right. Yes. Marrying whomever you are romantically attracted to is not a right for either heterosexual people or homosexual people. I doubt gold-digger trophy wives are actually attracted to their eighty year old sugar daddys, but there it is.
Turn No:  1: S2:
Okay, Sigma. Explain why a homosexual couple should be barred from marrying one another.
Turn No:  2:  S1:
The burden of proof is on those who want to change the status quo :P However, marriage has traditionally been a formalization of heterosexual relationships. Since heterosexual relationships are the sole type that can reproduce, it would seem they have a purpose of value that homosexual relationships do not. That is a valid reason, imo, to resist changing marriage. Or did you mean legally?\nTurn No:  2:  S2:\nOf course I mean legally.
Turn No:  3:  S1:
Then the burden of proof is on the one changing the status quo. I haven't asserted that homosexual marriage shouldn't be legal, but that marrying whomever you want is not a right.

By the way, in Canada the top gay rights organization EGALE(Equality for Gays and Lesbians Everywhere), supports the age of consent at 16. It was bumped up to 16 from 14(unchanged since the 19th century), AFTER equal same-sex marriage came into existence.
Turn No:  1: S2:

Turn No:  1: S2:
Right. You don't want us to discuss what it is you condemn, unless it is discussed on your terms exactly.
Turn No:  2:  S1:
We discussed it. Your terms started to make me feel ill.\nTurn No:  2:  S2:\nThis from the man who admittedly sat and watched a gay porn movie. Was that real life I wonder? Was that why you seemed so desperate for an answer on whether or not one gay experience makes you gay?
Turn No:  3:  S1:
It was in a gay bar..however if it had little girls sticking their fingers into boys bottoms I would have left. That is more of your liking..you have revealed.. Another little aside that suggests if you dont like gays you must be gay...boring\nTurn No:  3:  S2:\nAnd you sat there and watched it. Now, you protest against it saying its so dirty dirty and makes you feel ill. I'm not the one protesting most loudly against a woman putting her fingers there on a man. Regarding younguns, I was just saying it could happen between two of them.
Turn No:  4:  S1:
I never said gay porn was dirty dirty..its certainly perverted though. I sat there with my coffee and cake..so what? We have established that gay sex is perverted...gays can have as much sex as they like with each other..I couldnt care one jot. I ( and the majority of people) do not want perverts to make a mockery of marriage and try to have perverted sex endorsed by this travesty.\nTurn No:  4:  S2:\nYou don't make any sense. Now of course you care about gay sex, considering what you've written here on the subject, and you are using the very thing you suddenly claim not to care about, to make an argument against gay marriage. It's ok if it's not seen as legitimate, you say. That's hypocrisy. It's either acceptable or it's not. You can either mind your own business and not give a flying fig, or not. Besides, no one has a clue what two married couples are doing in bed. That's not a requirement for marriage. It's quite possible married heterosexual couples are doing things you'd find perverted.
Turn No:  5:  S1:
Married hetrosexual couples cannot have gay sex. Gay sex is what identifies gay people. Gay sex is perverted. Perverted sex should never be seen as normal.Tolerated but not condoned. Gay marriage would condone perverted sex. We have been through this so many times I am bored .\nTurn No:  5:  S2:\nExactly. You're so pre-occupied with the notion that society shouldn't "condone" it. Why is that so important to you? How does it affect your life if it's being "condoned" as opposed to "tolerated"?

Heterosexual attraction is the basis of reproduction. That is significant. Homosexual attraction is not the basis of reproduction. It cannot have the same significance.
Turn No:  1: S2:
Bull. Just because you base your means on what is value due to reproduction does not make the attraction and love of a homosexual any less than that of a strait person.... NOT all strait people engage in sex to procreate. Would you then say that their relationships and unions are thus less significant than to those who only engage in intercourse for procreation? Or would you deem that because they ARE strait that they are then capable of procreation that then their unions are thus protected.... And of course then leave out the homosexuals because we cannot "procreate." In case you forgot we are all capable of procreating Sigma. Many older Gay men have sons, and daughters from previous marriages before they came out. I know one in particular that has a son....

Turn No:  2:  S1:
What I posted was a fact. Any meaning you pull from it is your own. Heterosexual attraction is the basis of reproduction. This is a significant fact, since our survival as a species depends on reproduction. Homosexual attraction does not have the same significance.\nTurn No:  2:  S2:\nSigma.... Listen carefully OK ? This isn't ancient day Israel where people are being slaughtered and deal with population shortages OK? We have a population explosion on our hands.... Nearly 7 BILLION people.... The flawed logic you try to steer toward basing that somehow homosexual is unequal to heterosexual is a fallacy in today's modern world.... Your comparing apples to oranges and also you purposefully overlook that homosexuals can STILL reproduce! We don't have our sexual organs removed when we come out of the closet. I'm sure if it came down to it if some doomsday 2012 thing happened, a few gay men could drop off a vial of sperm at the local hospital or if necessary impregnate a woman if needed... yeesh....
Turn No:  3:  S1:
So? This is a false conclusion. Heterosexual attraction was the basis for the evolution of our species. This will always be true, because we can't change the past (YET!!). This is significant. Homosexual attraction can never, ever, ever achieve the same significance for the same reason that two will not equal three. They simply are not the same thing. Homosexual relationships cannot naturally produce offspring. Heterosexual relationships can naturally produce offspring. This is also significant.

Creating Civil Unions creates a separate and unequal status for some of Americas citizens. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial court ruled that creating a separate class for gay and lesbian citizens is not permissible and that is why they have voted that only marriage equals marriage.

Board of Education.

This is something I don't get. Civil unions existed before the entire "gay marriage" push began, yet people who wanted to get them weren't second class citizens. What happened?
Turn No:  2:  S1:
What happened is that Gay people began to take a stand and finally demand full and equal rights under the laws of this country... We're tired of the scraps and the second class status myself included. You read the article over 1000 rights under Federal status are for married people... And even WITH Gay marriage legal in some states under DOMA, the Federal Government does not recognize them as legitimate!\nTurn No:  2:  S2:\nSo they weren't second class citizens before, but are now even though nothing changed? That seems a bit contrived, tbh. This sort of rant reminds me of a news story some years back about a self-proclaimed pedophile demanding that he not be treated different for his sexual orientation. I can't remember what happened to him though. In any case, you aren't a second class citizen. Even if you can't marry whomever you want to. No one can marry whomever they want to.

Turn No:  1: S2:
And you hit the nail on the head with this one. The US government does not consider marriage to be a sarcament. You are mixing religion and government. A marriage liscense is a secular document that is a contract between the state and the the couple, it has nothing to do with religion. You have said you favor civil unions for gay people and I am saying that if you think that civil unions are equal to marriage just a different name then you go turn in your liscense in favor of a civil union. However you know that they aren't so you will never do it, even if it were possible.
Turn No:  2:  S1:
As a voter, I can mix whatever I want. That's the part that you aren't getting. Uncle Sam can't establish a religion or give special consideration to one religion; voters can do whatever they please and I choose to not want same sex marriage included under the definition of marriage. As for civil unions, I think your time would be better spent trying to fill the gaps in it instead of trying to scrap the current definition of marriage.\nTurn No:  2:  S2:\nFine then I think the people of California should decide weather the people of Michigan can get to have drivers licenses.

Of course they would still apply. Who cares if those involved are in love or not? It's just a contract between any two people. If I want my best friend to inherit or to make medical decisions, I could marry them. I don't have to actually have any romantic feelings, since it's just a contract. The big deal is basically what you've said in this post. Marriage is meaningful. It has been a custom that has not included homosexual people (with rare if any exceptions). You want to change that meaning, this custom. When you change the meaning of something that is actually very meaningful to a great deal of people don't be surprised if you tick off a portion of that population. .
Turn No:  1: S2:
That is the whole point isn't it. Marriage is a contract between the state and the two people involved. The whole ironic thing is to the anti gay christianists that are so opposed to gay marries the religious marriage is what counts and is the important aspect but they can not stop gay people from getting religious marriage only the contract from the state, which to the anti gay christianists means nothing. How are they harmed if two men they do not know sign a contract with the state. Are they going to be offended If I form a corporation? It is none of their business, just as their marriages are none of my business. Yes they are forced to have to accept same sex marriages big f'n deal I am forced to accept their hetero marriages. They didn't ask my permission if they could get married so why should I have to ask their permission?
Turn No:  2:  S1:
I suppose. I'm not religious, so what Christians do is pretty meaningless to me. I would not claim anyone is harmed. But we all have to live in this society, so the official policies are our business. Your threat here is empty since heterosexual marriage is the status quo . You have to justify changes you wish to make to the status quo, but what currently is in place doesn't need justification.\nTurn No:  2:  S2:\nIt was a christian organization, or group, or christianally deluded legislators in every case that gathered signatures for and put these marriage amendments on the ballot in every state. If I own a business I am legally forced, as a gay man, to recognise that hetero marriage. Your right we all have to live in this society and they demand that I respect, and acknowledge, their marriages. One could use your argument about slavery, misogyny, or any other unjust system.

What civil rights? Are unmarried individuals denied rights? What privilege is that?\nTurn No:  4:  S2:\nThat is not the question I asked Do you believe taht basic rights such as freedom of speech and religion should go on to the ballot?

Since they are Constitutional rights, it would be slightly impossible to do :P What privelige is that? We don't have a right to love (at least, not one the gov't can help with).

In the current state of affairs, unmarried homosexual people can marry the same people that unmarried heterosexual people can and obtain the same benefits. I realize there is a certain amount of sophistry with that line of reasoning since the two groups don't wish to marry the same people, but it is not false statement. This renders the entire "gay rights" argument, as I know it at least, null since the current state of affairs is equal in terms of rights. I think there are combination of forces. On an instinctual level I would hazard that heterosexual relationships enjoy the perception of purpose and meaning where homosexual relationships do not. On an intellectual level, as I explained, arguing in terms of "rights" seems to be the wrong question to be asking in the first place.
Turn No:  1: S2:
At one time only a white person could marry another white person and a black person could only marry a black person. They were equal also. I can not marry another gay person but I can only marry a heterosexual person how is that equal? You are right so lets look at the constituion. Not allowing gay people tyo marry violates the 1st amendment, the 14th amendment, and the full faith and credit clause of the US constituion.
Turn No:  2:  S1:
I said: unmarried homosexual people can marry the same people that unmarried heterosexual people can. What if I said: unmarried black people can marry the same people that unmarried white people can. Would that be true if black people could not marry white people? The answer is no, white people could not marry the same partners that black people could. That is an unequal situation. Homosexual people and heterosexual people, on the other hand, have to follow the same rules. Who is not allowing homosexual people to marry? As far as I know, homosexual people are not barred from marriage. Homosexual people just have to follow the same rules heterosexual people do when they choose a partner. Now, what rights would that violate?\nTurn No:  2:  S2:\nGay people can not marry other gay people. A heterosexual can marry another heterosexual but a gay person can not marry another gay person. Why is this concept so hard for you to understand?
Turn No:  3:  S1:
It is not hard to understand. But the rules don't distinguish heterosexuals from homosexuals. The rules give us all the same right to marry the same people. It applies equally to homosexuals as to heterosexuals. The fact that homosexual people don't want to marry the opposite sex is irrelevent. They have equal rights. The fact that you want to change marriage is understandable so you can marry whomever you want, but right now you do have equal rights .\nTurn No:  3:  S2:\nNo it is an unjust system a gay person can not marry another gay person but a heterosexual can marry another heterosexual. I do not have a right to marry a person of my own sexual orientation the same way a heterosexual can marry a person of their same orientation. I do not equal rights.
Turn No:  4:  S1:
As I mentioned, the law does not distinguish between heterosexual or homosexual. The law does not care whether you or the person you want to marry is homosexual or heterosexual. Equality under the law only cares whether everyone can marry the same people. Because that's equal. Truth be told, I have a better chance arguing equality to allow siblings to marry than homosexuality has in arguing its case, imo. You may want to change marriage so you can marry a member of the same gender, and that may or may not be the morally correct thing to do. But you don't have a right to it.

So when Gay marriage is finally allowed. what's the next step? Positive discrimination? A campaign for more gay congressmen teachers, police etc etc Insisting that a more postive approach to gay sex should be taught in schools..maybe insisting that equal time should be given to gay sex in schools sex education. Where will it end?
Turn No:  1: S2:
What's the problem with any of that? Where will it all end you ask? Equality.
Turn No:  2:  S1:
I thought so.You will not be happy until an old man will be able to sodomise a young boy without being criticised, let alone prosecuted. And that is just the start of it.\nTurn No:  2:  S2:\nWell, of course, that's exactly what I was saying. Because an old man can now rape a young girl without being prosecuted. That's what I meant by equality. But by the way, pedophilia has nothing to do with sexual orientation, gay or straight. I don't want your ignorant little brats, gansao, if indeed you have any. That's a fear tactic. At one time people were prejudiced against Jewish people, by advancing "blood libel" myth. It was said that Jews kidnapped Christian children and used them in human sacrifices. This is the same idea, connecting pedophilia to gay people.
Turn No:  3:  S1:
Who said anything about rape? Peter Tatchell , a British gay activist advocated the age of consent being changed to 14 years old. You see all the straight people know that whatever ther gays get, they will want more..and you just proved it. You will never be happy to be tolerated..you want to be in a position that YOU will tolerate straights\nTurn No:  3:  S2:\nDid he say it should only be lowered for gay relationships? Probably not. Are there straight people who would advocate for changing the age of consent? Yes. There are different arguments for and against lowering the age of consent which have nothing to do with gay equality rights.
Turn No:  4:  S1:
Peter Tatchell the gay activist ..was campaigning for GAY people. The fact that straights would be included would be incidental.\nTurn No:  4:  S2:\nHe doesn't speak for every gay person. It's not at all incidental, if straight relationships were included. It's a separate set of arguments at any rate, from the ones that apply to gay equality. He was campaigning of the issue of age of consent. He was also campaigning for straight people who believe the age of consent should be lowered. It is possible to not lower the age of consent, and have gay marriage, or other gay equality issues.
Turn No:  5:  S1:
Tatchell did not campaign for straight people. He may even have said he did, I dont care if he did or didnt. I do not know of any prominent gay person who dissagreed with him.

Ohioprof  Steeeeve  gay-marriage \nTurn No: 1:  S1: \nThis is off-topic, but I do not see any forum on Supreme Court issues or constitutional interpretation generally. The New York Times has a little quiz to see how our views line up with those of the current Supreme Court and with the American public on various constitutional questions. Here is a link to the quiz: NY Times Advertisement Although I am liberal in my political views, my answers to the quiz questions indicate that I am in the center when it comes to constitutional questions.\n                    Turn No: 1:  S2:\nWhat an awful quiz. It reinforces my point that people are making the court a second legislative body. If we want them to make decisions like this we are better off just having congress do it. At least they are voted in.
Turn No:  2:  S1:
The problem with the quiz is that it just asks people's opinion about the issue; it does not address the constitutional questions involved. The Supreme Court should not rule based on their opinions of the issue; they should rule based on their interpretation of the constitution. The Supreme Court has ruled on the issues in the quiz, but their rulings should not have been based on what individual justices happen to think of guns or abortion.\nTurn No:  2:  S2:\nAnd the rulings shouldn't be considered "conservative" or "liberal".
Turn No:  3:  S1:
Right. Court rulings are interpretations of the constitution, and they are not, or should not be, expressions of the justices' personal political beliefs. Even the NYTimes story saying that the Roberts court leans "conservative" does not really make sense, as "conservative" suggests a political viewpoint, not a philosophy of judicial interpretation.\nTurn No:  3:  S2:\nRight, for example the ruling allowing corporations to run campaign ads or whatever was not really conservative...pro corporation maybe but that doesn't necessary mean conservative (perhaps more "republican"). Scalia actually goes around and does a speech where he gives examples of rulings he has made that upset both sides basically saying he doesn't care who he offends. Reading some of his opinions makes me believe he really doesn't care about offending people haha.

Bull. She's saying I'm a scary person because of my beliefs, and I am so rigid in my thinking I am unable to hear other people's understanding of the truth. Wrong, Bennedict. I hear other people just fine (so that was a lie), but when it comes to people saying other people are scary because they claim to know the truth, then that's an insult. Scary is what the flaming liberals are doing to America. Now, please answer the questions posed to you in my post # 140?

Your views are pretty scary to me, Easyrider, because your mind is closed to other people's perceptions of and views of truth.

If they're born again Christians they know that Jesus is the TRUTH (John 14:6). All the rest are spiritually challenged.\nTurn No:  3:  S2:\nSince Christians hold a variety of views about truth, I guess your claim that 70 percent of Americans believe as you do is not accurate.

I'm going to advise active gays to repent and receive Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior for the remission of their sins. They do that they can be happy for all eternity.

On Gay Marriage, Media Gives Obama a Pass - Yahoo! News This administration under my direction, has consistently said, we cannot discriminate as a country against people on the basis of sexual orientation What Ive seen happen over the last several years and what happened in New York last week I think was a good thing because what you saw was the people of New York having a debate, talking through these issues. It was contentious, it was emotional but ultimately they made a decision to recognize civil marriages. And I think thats exactly how things should work. And so I think it is important for us to work through these issues because each community is going to be different and each state is going to be different to work through them. In the meantime, we filed briefs before the Supreme Court that say any discrimination against gays, lesbians, transgenders is subject to heightened scrutiny and we dont think DOMA is unconstitutional (sic they do think DOMA is unconstitutional). So the combination of what states are doing, what the courts are doing, the actions were taking administratively, all are how the process should work I think what youre seeing is a profound recognition on the part of the American people that gays, lesbians and transgender persons are our brothers, our sisters, our children, our cousins, our friends, our co-workers and that theyve got to be treated like every other American.

Turn No:  1: S2:
That's your definition. It is certainly not my definition. You don't speak for all of society. I personally define marriage as a union of two people who love one another and wish to make a commitment to one another. If marriage is about reproduction, why does nobody bat an eye when a 65 year old woman marries a 68 year old man? If you believe marriage is "formalization of a mating pair", and "reproduction is implied", doesn't this cheapen the institution of marriage in your eyes? Obviously, they are not getting married to start a family...perhaps love is what is important?
Turn No:  2:  S1:
Mating pairs exist with or without marriage, and have no legal connection with marriage (since, legally, it doesn't matter if the two people even like one another, or ever intend on consumating said marriage). The only connection between a mating couple and marriage is the connection made on a cultural level. So, logically, the cultural meaning of marriage would be the purpose of a mating couple. While 'purpose' can mean different things, in this context I daresay most would refer to the evolutionary purpose of a mating couple: reproduction. Love is implied because love brings the couple together for that purpose. While legally a 27yr old marrying a 70yr old sugar daddy is not a problem, culturally speaking this marriage is not as meaningful as one that is in-line with the evolutionary purpose I outlined above. You can point to exceptions all you want, but all it does is outline the difference between the legal meaning and the cultural meaning of marriage.\nTurn No:  2:  S2:\nWho gave you the power to decide what is culturally meaningful?

No, you should legally define it any damn way you can get away with. The cultural definition comes from observation.\nTurn No:  3:  S2:\nBut who get's to decide that legal definition...that's the point. In this specific case in point, the anti crowd wishes to limit the rights of others simply based on personally held beliefs...when no harm is presented to any party involved. In a case such as this, I feel strongly that without a specific vector of harm, we must as a civilized society rule in favor of providing equal rights rather than limit rights of a minority. I think these 4 pages thus far make clear that cultural definition is based on subjective obeservation and personal opinion formed via that observation. Clearly, I and many others here do not share your cultural definition.
Turn No:  4:  S1:
In America the people generally vote on issues, or elect representatives to enact laws. That's how you change the legal definitions. This isn't about equality, snakespit . The title of this thread shows that :P In all seriousness, though, it really isn't about equality. I don't think you have a rational basis upon which to dispute that observation. It is an indisputible fact that the cultural view that has dominated this country (as evidenced by the definition of marriage) generally follows evolutionarily sound logic: monogamous pair bonding outside of close familial ties. Inclusion of homosexuals would obviously change that.

It is 'culturally assumed' that the purpose of a mating pair is to produce children, not that marriage itself is for that purpose. Marriage is considered a formalization of that bond, but it does not create that bond. While a man can have sex with many women, it is always an iteration of the male-female couple.

Can you show Evidence that it is Culturally assumed?.. Maybe in a Religious Culture, but Religion doesn't define all of us. With Adoption available there is no longer a Need to re-produce.

If the DOMA fails, even states with constitutional provisions against gay marriage will have to recognize gay marriages performed in other states.
Turn No:  1: S2:
This is debatable. Even before DOMA the courts have always ruled that marriage doesn't have to be recognized across states. Basically Full, Faith, and Credit doesn't apply if they point was to circumvent a state law.
Turn No:  2:  S1:
I stand corrected. I thought that the supreme court had picked that up back when interracial marriage was an issue. I was wrong.\nTurn No:  2:  S2:\nDon't feel too bad, for the last 75 years the Supreme Court has basically disregarded the constitution when making decisions; so who knows what they may rule.
Turn No:  3:  S1:
Wouldn't it be easier if they just stuck to it, though? Their opinions could be a single sentence "Nothing in the Constitution of the United States of America indicates that the federal government has anything to do with marriage". Done deal. They could just save that sentence and then replace "marriage" with "abortion", "education", or any number of other things.

You need to educate yourself on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and perhaps then you wouldn't come across as such a clown. No doubt they would if the Israelis stopped stealing Palestinian land, destroying Palestinian homes and killing Palestinians.

What happens between two (or more) consenting adult in the privacy of their bedrooms is their own business. They have the right to the benefits we give to couple should they wish for them and the recognition of marriage. Pedophilia, wife beating, adultery all have consequences either for children (who are not of consent age), violence etc... But adultery is legal, it is legal to have an affair outside of marriage.
Turn No:  1: S2:
Please see my previous post to ANorveyanFellow. There are dire consequences for the individual and even a nation that rebels against God. The Bible is full of such examples. "The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God." - Psalm 9:17
Turn No:  2:  S1:
Their is a separation of church and state for a reason EZ, to prevent the discrimination of a minority on religious grounds... gay marriage is a human right for consenting adult individuals. Perhaps your god does rail against gay marriage, but that should have no political weight on a secular nation consisting on hundreds of religions and secularist organisations and communities when it come to the laws that govern all peoples under that nation.\nTurn No:  2:  S2:\nChristians, Jews, and others of faith have voting rights too, and we can all vote as we please. In fact, if there's enough of us, we can pass a Constitutional Amendment to ban gay marriage, etc. Gay marriage is also outlawed by virtue of a number of state constitutions, passed by representatives of the people. I'm not buying that. Did you know the founding fathers and others attended church services in the US Capitol Bldg. and other federal buildings, and that continued up to and shortly after the Civil War? Kind of puts the "separation of church" and state in a different light for you, n'est pas?
Turn No:  3:  S1:
Your right, and gay marriage in no way inhibits your right to vote as you see fit... What is does do is prevent said religious groups from proposing laws, amendments and policies on religious grounds that would discriminate against a group of people. Again ill say it, freedom of religion also entails freedom from religion\nTurn No:  3:  S2:\nReligious folks, via our representatives, have proposed plenty of laws that discriminate against wickedness. And gay sex is wickedness. We also propose laws against the wickedness of aborting the innocent unborn. So we're alive and well in the voting booth, and the battle isn't over yet. There's also a higher court than the US Supreme Court, and that's God. And when he's had enough of this sodomy and wickedness he'll bring it to a screeching halt. And if not now, then at the Judgment. There won't be any gay pride cr*p in heaven.
Turn No:  4:  S1:
So you freely accept that your feeling and opinions are based on religious grounds, therefore should have no bearing on the laws passed by the state. The wisdom and strength of the constitution is talked about whenever individuals wish to prevent things such as gun reform, abortion etc... But when it suits you, you have no problem with ignoring the supposed wisdom of the founding fathers in their desire to create a nation for all through the separation of church and state. In conclusion, you only have conviction of the constitution when it suits and complies with your religious values, therefore you were the people the constitution was created to prevent from holding sway over law and society.\nTurn No:  4:  S2:\nNo one in any significant measure is promoting a theocracy or advocating a particular religion at the exclusion of all others, though perhaps the Muslims are. But as for whose "religion" should be approved, it isn't yours either. In the US Supreme Court decision Abington School District v. Schempp, 374, US 203, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 (1963) Justice Clark stated: "The State may not establish a 'religion of secularism' in the sense of affirmatively opposing or showing hostility to religion, thus 'preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do believe.' http://forum.mtstars.com/misc/v/13/1949.html
Turn No:  5:  S1:
I have no religion EZ, that is the point... Your views are those of a religious denomination and therefore should have no bearing on laws passed by the state which affect all. In a similar way that if Islam was the majority denomination then sharia law should not be imposed on the minority christian denomination... Sodom and Gomorrah has nothing to do with it... Jefferson regardless of his personal views came round to understand the positives of a free country where people who didn't share his beliefs were protected as much as himself.... Admittedly as long as you were male, white, wealthy and of an Anglo-Saxon origin. Give religion an inch and it will take a mile. People should be free from religion, just as you are free from theirs.\nTurn No:  5:  S2:\nThen you are a secularist, and there's no provision in the Constitution that favors secularism over people of faith. That's your view. I don't share it. In fact, considering the founding fathers went to church in federal buildings, hired paid Chaplains, printed a Bible, and spoke about how Christianity was the foundation of the country, I dare say you're the one who is out in left field. Sure it does. I'm not letting a secularist evict God from the public square or from the discussion. He didn't approve of sodomy, did he? In fact, which of the original states or founding fathers did?
Turn No:  6:  S1:
You will truly avoid the obvious to retain your weak claim to a christian US.... The separation of church and state is fundamental, it entails the FREEDOM FROM RELIGION for all, secularist, Buddhist, Muslim, Christian... The state cannot discriminate against any denomination on any religious grounds. What Jefferson and the rest of the founding fathers personally believed has no bearing, they recognized it as their personal belief and that their personal feeling and religion should not dictate the laws of a nation. It doesn't matter if they rebuilt the Basilica within the grounds of the white house, that doesn't mean Christians should be favoured above all others by the state. Im glad to hear it, i have no issue with Christians being involved in the discourse... I have a big problem with what is effectively religious law, and on this basis i hope you would support gun reform then.\nTurn No:  6:  S2:\nWe're not talking about establishing a national religious denomination (which was what the founding fathers were addressing). We're talking illicit gay unions. And I'm not saying the US is a "Christian nation," though some 70% of Americans claim to be Christians. I don't believe that for a minute.
Turn No:  7:  S1:
Give me a reason EZ that gay marriage should be banned outside of Christianity.... You have already read the statement about HIV and i hope you would see the falseness of that claim... Can give me a genuine reason that gay marriage should be banned outside of the sphere of religion?

You people aren't too bright. In fact, you're ate up with the dumb a*s with your skewed perspectives. Gods Judgment Saves Lives Let's do this: How many people would 100 evil men kill in their lifetimes? Let's say a thousand, and the 100 evil men wind up in hell when they die. Now, let's let those 100 evil men have 100 offspring that over time grow up to kill the original 1,000 other people, plus 1,000 more. Now, you have 200 evil men in hell and 2,000 murdered others. Let's take it to the 10th or so generation. Now you've had 10,000 evil men giving birth to 10,000 offspring and together those 20,000 evil men and or women offspring kill 200,000 people total. So, you now have 20,000 evil men and women in hell (vs. 100 if you had nailed them earlier), plus 200,000 other dead people. So God, being smarter than his critics, and able to see consequences further out in time than the stiff-necked "God is evil" crowd, saves 19,900 people from going to hell plus he saves 199,000 others from getting murdered.

Now you wouldn't deny that there are murderers in most every generation, would you?\nTurn No:  2:  S2:\nThere are murderers in every generation, but they are not hereditary... They are a mix of pre-meditated, opportunist, situational etc... Killing a murderer does not prevent murderer's arising in the next generation. And perhaps some of those murderer's wished to repent, would they not then have been welcomed into gods bosom? Would it not be a horrific thing to find yourself in "Heaven" and bump into the murderer who massacred your family feasting on the local buffet all because he said sorry? I think their must be crime in heaven....
Turn No:  3:  S1:
Nope. The New Testament says we're raised incorruptible. And the unrepentant murderers are cast into Hell. I think you see the earth through rose-colored glasses. There's tons of murderers in every generation. Heredity is not necessary to continue with crime. We see with the Muslims, for instance, that they train up their children to hate Jews, and there's no shortage of Muslim generations that have hated and killed Jews. And that's what we see in the Middle East during the Old Testament - one group or nation after another killing others. So I stand by my illustration.\nTurn No:  3:  S2:\nIf the murderer was genuinely repentant he would be accepted into heaven... Im not saying he is faking it...
Turn No:  4:  S1:
If he were repentant and he received Christ as his Savior (who paid for his sins at Calvary), then, on the basis of God physically dying for the sins of man, the murderer would be accepted into heaven. Remember, Moses killed a man and we see him centuries later on the Mount of Transfiguration. So there can be redemption for murderers.\nTurn No:  4:  S2:\nSo the murderer of my family is admitted to heaven At which point when the victims see him over the heavenly all you can eat buffet there is going to be trouble.

Turn No:  1: S2:
Homosexualism is not a valid measure of differentiation between two or more individuals. It is no different than claiming individual A has strong preference for people of African descent while individual B has strong preference for people of Mediterranean descent. Homosexualism has not been scientifically proven to be anything other than a simple preference for a specific type of activity. It is no more worth consideration or legal protection than bird watching or wearing brown shoes as opposed to any other color. Human sexuality is regarded as fluidic in nature and subject to change. Homosexualism as well at heterosexualism are nothing more than temporary phases of development. As such there is no reason to cater to what is nothing more than a temporary trend.

That is ridiculous. And their are 9 million people and a whole host of specialists that would vastly disagree with your presumption. Also Men/Women who are attracted to African/Asian/Caribbean/European have the right to marry. Your logic would boil it down to complete discrimination without cause just because they are attracted to a group you dont agree with. 9 million people in the U.S would disagree with your presumption they are experiencing a developmental trend, something which you have no personal experience of.\nTurn No:  2:  S2:\nNone of which proves that homosexualism is a legitimate differentiation in nature. It has not yet been scientifically proven to be anything more than a mere choice of preference. It is not something that should warrant constitutional protection anymore than someone's belief that women with red hair are superior to those with blond hair. Eleven million people in the United State believe that they have a right to citizenship and full constitutional benefits even though they are here illegally and engaging in larceny and tax evasion.

You skipped this point Xanamnes Men/Women who are attracted to African/Asian/Caribbean/European have the right to marry, Gay people dont.

For example a ballot initiative could go on the ballot saying that catholics can only open their church buildings for use every 4 Thursday night.

How about a ballot initiative outlawing door to door proselytizing they can do it from the sidewalk and in public spaces but they will not bother people at home. The bible through ballot initiative could be viewed as society does other graphically sexual and violent material and restrict the bibles usage to adults. Make the sale and use of the bible by minors illegal and impose the same penalties on people that we would for showing children pornography. I can even see a ballot initiative restricting marriage to same religious groups. For instance a mormon can only marry a mormon or a catholic a catholic.

Gay people are trying to go back to the way it was before DOMA, where there was no definition... and for your information the Constitution gives Congress the Power to lay taxes on you as well as everyone else. They are within their rights as elected officials to use force to make you pay your share ... and we already know you will because you only talk big but will not back up your position with action.

What did marriage mean before DOMA?\nTurn No:  2:  S2:\nTechnically it didn't have an official definition. It was just looked at as Marriage. Go back and do some reading, you might learn something. A Gay Couple in Hawaii decided to get Married, they were denied a Marriage license, they filed a Lawsuit and the State Supreme Court granted them the license and said it was unconstitutional to discriminate on the basis that they were gay. In fear that other states would be required to recognize Gay Marriages due to the Full Faith and Credit Clause DOMA was passed, Applying a Definition to Marriage as being between one man and one woman. It also changed the wording of the Fair Faith and Credit Clause relieving the states from having to recognize Gay marriages from other states. DOMA is and always has been Unconstitutional and it's just a matter of time before the Supreme Court hears the case . For someone who claims to be all about Liberty and Freedom you sure have a stick up your XXX about Gay rights.....

First answer my question, what did it mean. You've attempted to engage me before so you know full well that if you don't answer that question I will simply ask it again and I will keep asking it until you either shut up or give the answer. You could call it childish but that would make about as much sense as last time given that it was you who was refusing to answer the question and not I who refused to ask it. Second, how is it that a word without an official definition can be used in law? Even so far as to define rules for inheritance and taxation?\nTurn No:  3:  S2:\nWhat part of NO DEFINITION do you not understand? You have to remember we're talking about the Constitution here. In the Original Constitution of the United States of America Marriage was never Defined as being between a man and a woman. They applied no definition because they probably didn't think in the 1700's that Marriage needed a definition. They passed DOMA to specifically apply such a definition to discriminate against a group of people. Before DOMA the definition of Marriage would be .... 1 a : being in the state of matrimony 2 : united, joined Nothing about a man and woman , that was added for the purpose to discriminate.

The self-contradictory part where it was used for communication yet had no meaning. If it has no definition homosexuals cannot meet the criteria of null, therefore they can never be married. Is 1913 before DOMA? http://1913.mshaffer.com/d/search/_words.word,marriage What about 1828? http://www.1828-dictionary.com/d/word/marriage Or how about ancient rome? http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/...trimonium.html and hey look it's that whole rascal nero again, 'marrying' pretty much anyone he wanted regardless of roman law .\nTurn No:  4:  S2:\nYou really are dense aren't you. There was no Definition as applied to the LAW or the Constitution. So how long did it take you to find the dictionary definition that fit your position, not long I'm sure. You're still wrong, as far as the Constitution and the Laws of the United states there was no "Legal" definition before DOMA.
