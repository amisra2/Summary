Their bodies are not designed to be pregnant and even if it was made technically possible it will almost certainly be the worst option in terms of comfort, and safety for both father and child. It's bringing a hammer to a screwdriver's job. It might even be easier to alter gene expression to bring about partial sex change (that doesn't sound hopeful either). That won't do though because then the partner wouldn't be attracted to the more woman than man person. Seriously think about this. People call many things 'sci-fi', but not all imagined future technologies are the same. There are technologies which we haven't really pursued but given enough resources we could, there are technologies whose concepts have been proven but for any reason we do not have the precision or infrastructure to do. Then there are sci-fi ideas that are based on no sane possibilities whatever. This is one of those. We have no reason to believe that we can engineer a new organ safe enough to justify trying to incubate a baby in INSIDE A MAN. This isn't just some generic human part, you can't use a womb or womb DNA because that undoubtedly relies on female control systems. Of course I am not going to rule anything out, nobody should do that given the track record of skeptics on what humanity can accomplish; but I am cataloging this one with faster than light travel and telepathy.","end-gays-gay-marriage-decline-homosexual-population","09:41 PM","gay-rights-debates","34"

So is male pregnancy possible? Probably yes. Is male pregnancy safe? No, not at the present time. But at some point in the future, its likely that reproductive biologists will figure out how to direct the growth of the placenta away from vulnerable abdominal organs and onto an easily detachable, but blood-rich, surface for growth. And then, pregnancy will be possible for men who are 100% men, although it's certainly not something that I would want to do.","Provocateaur","436269","I'm not sure what you're really getting at here.

A fetus inside a man would push out his internal organs,would probably die along with its 'mum/dad'. The man would have to given huge amounts of female hormones too. So a man having a baby is so remote and dangerous that its not worth contemplating.

I don't know what you could do to upset their idea of what is natural more than this. This is the kind of thing that without a major shift in culture would bring back witch hunts. For me this is an area of science that needs to remain unknown. This isn't surgically altering your outside physical appearance or even ""hot wiring"" a system already designed for such a purpose. This is man playing God and he is nowhere near capable of doing such a thing.","end-gays-gay-marriage-decline-homosexual-population","10:05 AM","gay-rights-debates","45"
