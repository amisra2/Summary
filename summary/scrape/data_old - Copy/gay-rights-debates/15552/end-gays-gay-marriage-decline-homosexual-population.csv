Something you might muse about briefly, but it is flawed. 1. There are lots of reasons that genes hang around in the gene pool and not all are related to the survival of one individual's offspring. 2. Gay men and women have offspring from their own loins without the use of a heterosexual relationship. 3. Epigenetic phenomena are not considered.

Their bodies are not designed to be pregnant and even if it was made technically possible it will almost certainly be the worst option in terms of comfort, and safety for both father and child. It's bringing a hammer to a screwdriver's job. It might even be easier to alter gene expression to bring about partial sex change (that doesn't sound hopeful either). That won't do though because then the partner wouldn't be attracted to the more woman than man person. Seriously think about this. People call many things 'sci-fi', but not all imagined future technologies are the same. There are technologies which we haven't really pursued but given enough resources we could, there are technologies whose concepts have been proven but for any reason we do not have the precision or infrastructure to do. Then there are sci-fi ideas that are based on no sane possibilities whatever. This is one of those. We have no reason to believe that we can engineer a new organ safe enough to justify trying to incubate a baby in INSIDE A MAN. This isn't just some generic human part, you can't use a womb or womb DNA because that undoubtedly relies on female control systems.

Personally I would have the same reaction if a straight guy wanted to do this. Its like having your brain put into another body. Sure there is an upside, but a lot of downside also. By arguing this you pretty much concede that gays being unable to reproduce should be a factor in any discussion. By giving value to this as a way to overcome that objection you validate it as an objection needing to be overcome. It isn't, any other time that comes up it gets shot down with the simple example of straights who marry who cannot have children. Now this Sci Fi channel Science gone mad waves this in front of the eyes of gay people and all of sudden The reproduction argument is valid enough to say ""See we could have kids as well"". This will not suddenly turn their hearts and minds. This will be only one more thing to add to their list. There are much better ways than this to both have children and get the repressed peckernecks to practice some goodwill towards others. I think we have enough parent-less kids made the old fashion way. Adding to that among the many other reasons there are, makes this in my mind just a bad idea. Your contribution in winning hearts and minds is probably the most effective and far reaching, not that it was part of some long ago planned strategic plan to infiltrate the straights, but look how strong, dignified and respectable your circumstances are and then compare to what this would bring to the table","end-gays-gay-marriage-decline-homosexual-population","01:46 AM","gay-rights-debates","60"
