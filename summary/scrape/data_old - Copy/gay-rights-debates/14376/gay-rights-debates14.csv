They survived the AIDS plague (which they shared it with sexually normal people) and nowadays they are even getting married. One day one of them will become the first homosexual President of the USA","Easyrider","410281","There's a ton of them alive in Hell too.

"08-21-2010","14376",14,"gansao","410243","Once again you miss the point..you are being called a wanker...and its true You risked your life, but what else have you ever risked? Have you ever risked disapproval? Have you ever risked a belief? I see nothing particularly courageous in risking one's life. So you lose it, you go to your hero's heaven and everything is milk & honey 'til the end of time. Right? You get your reward and suffer no earthly consequences. That's not courage. Real courage is risking something you have to keep on living with, real courage is risking something that might force you to rethink your thoughts and suffer change and stretch consciousness. Real courage is risking one's cliches. from Another Roadside Attraction by Tom Robbins","mata","410285","YaY! Someone gets it!

Luke 10:1-12, Jesus declares certain cities more damnable than Sodom and Gomorrah, due to their response to Jesus' disciples, in the light of greater grace (RSV): ""And if any one will not receive you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or town. Truly, I say to you, it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomor'rah than for that town."" In Matthew 11:20-24 Jesus prophesies the fate of some cities where he did some of his works (RSV): ""And you, Caper'na-um, will you be exalted to heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But I tell you that it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you."" (Wiki)","gay-marriage","06:45 PM","gay-rights-debates","208"

"08-22-2010","14376",14,"Winston Smith","410289","is that is your summary of ""1984"" obviously you didn't understand it at all. Language was used as thought control, by controlling which words existed and which not Big Brother could prevent rebellious thoughts. All languages are used not only for expressing thoughts but also for concealing thoughts. The big mistake is to believe that by supressing words you can prevent thoughts. You can excise the word freedom from the dictionary, but that won't prevent people from yearning for freedom. Maybe because Orwell was a writer he gave too much importance to the power of language. By the way, Big Brother only controlled and spied on the intellectual class, not the low class of illiterate people. Why? because words and ideas had no effect on the lower class, they just wanted food and entertainment.","mata","410415","Y'know Winston I happen to agree with many of the things you say, I just don't understand when you seem to get so overwrought when people dont immediately jump on your bandwagon? Like your above reply, fr'instance. I agree with what you've said here. I was trying to express the same thing more simply, using the man's words , in one sentence . Rather than having the 'courage of your convictions' it seems petty. Whatever.","gay-marriage","09:25 AM","gay-rights-debates","210"
