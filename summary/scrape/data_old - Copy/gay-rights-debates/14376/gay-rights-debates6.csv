"07-21-2010","14376",6,"Ohioprof","407917","Jyoshu, my inability to reproduce with a man is due to my biological inability to do so. That's no different, in essence, from what you call ""biological incompatibility."" Playing with words does not make my biological inability to reproduce with a man any different from my biological inability to reproduce with a woman. I am biologically unable to reproduce with either a man or a woman. If you are not arguing that this biological inability to reproduce is a reason to bar people from marrying each other, then why did you bring it up?","jyoshu","407959","You would never be--and have never been--able to reproduce with a woman to begin with . Frankly, it's a little silly to even talk like the two are even comparable in terms of procreation. Women don't reproduce with women; men don't reproduce with men. Women DO reproduce with men. Because it's pretty common to hear gay pride proponents respond to this point in a way that implies their unions are the same thing in terms of procreation. It's not. Everyone already knows gays can find some way to circumvent the fact gay relationships aren't biologically procreative, by finding a member of the opposite sex, sperm banks, etc.; that's beside the point.","gay-marriage","06:24 PM","gay-rights-debates","77"
"07-21-2010","14376",6,"Bennedict","407955","you disgarded...political correctness? ok... i already know right from wrong. i figured it out myself by treating people with kindness and respect. do you honestly need to refer to a book in order to know what right is from wrong (albeit a very nasty and malign book)? the same bible that says to stone children to death if they misbehave. looking out for their best intersts......youre insulting them more like it.","Easyrider","407961","Does that get them to heaven when they die? You can be a believer in Jesus Christ and do the same thing but rescue people from an eternity of suffering. I'll let Thomas Jefferson answer you on that: ""A more beautiful or precious morsel of ethics I have never seen; it is a document in proof that I am a real Christian, that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus"" By the way, which doctrine of Jesus is ""nasty""? Got a scripture # on that? Show me that in the New Testament, under the New Covenant? Have you ever read the entire Bible? They wind up in Hell your way. With friends like that who needs enemies? I'd rather twinge their consciences and save their eternal souls.","gay-marriage","06:33 PM","gay-rights-debates","78"
"07-21-2010","14376",6,"Bennedict","407925","many things can cause infertility in males and females at any age, but whats most relevant here is genetic infertility.","jyoshu","407962","The inability of men to reproduce with men and women to reproduce with women isn't just an example of 'infertility'. It's rather an example of rather glaring biological impossibility due to gender. You might as well be trying to minimize the reasons people can't breathe underwater and flap their wings to fly away.","gay-marriage","06:34 PM","gay-rights-debates","79"
"07-21-2010","14376",6,"None","None","None","Bennedict","407966","ou, two requests to post references. If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them: Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear. -- Deuteronomy 21:18-21 He that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death. -- Exodus 21:15 He that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death. -- Exodus 21:17 i dont care what your beliefs are, im just discrediting the bible as being a trusted resource to be used against homosexuals. EDIT: in regards to calling the bible 'nasty', as if you need any more, the bible is full of nasty stuff. priests and other religious people simply pick and choose the good verses and the bad ones are to be taken figuratively. so you spend your entire life praising a book that is half figurative, half literal - not entirely knowing which is which, all of which can mean damn near anything under those pretenses. and to answer your question of if i have read the bible, yes i have. like many athiests, i was brought up in a loosely religious family - i went to catholic schools my whole life - studied 3 years of religion in high school.","gay-marriage","06:49 PM","gay-rights-debates","80"

Why isn't your Scripturephobic agenda worse, since it ignores the truth and misleads the populace? But that's what you believe, isn't it?

I've always had one challenge if someone wants to try to change my beliefs. And that is to show me that the resurrection of Jesus Christ is a lie. Can you do it?

Your challenge is flawed because you cannot prove it any more than anyone can disprove it. We have been over this time and time again. Your challenge is unnecessary because nobody wants to change your beliefs. You are free to believe that a woman who was created from a guy's rib took a magical apple from a talking snake and ate it.

Are you suggesting that the fact that once upon a time I might have been able to procreate with a man (though you do not know this), I should therefore now have the right to marry a man legally, but not a woman? The fact that women cannot reproduce biologically with women and men cannot reproduce biologically with men is irrelevant to whether they should have the right to marry. Likewise, the fact that elderly women cannot reproduce biologically with either men or women is irrelevant to whether they should have the right to marry. The right to marry should not be dependent on biological reproductive capacity, and it is not....except many opponents of same-sex marriage argue that gay people alone should be barred from marrying the person of their choice because they cannot reproduce with that person. You never hear these people argue that elderly people or any other kind of person should be barred from marrying the person of their choice because they cannot reproduce with that person. They single out gay people and say it's only gay people who should be barred from marrying the person of their choice because they cannot reproduce with that person.","gay-marriage","09:35 PM","gay-rights-debates","88"
