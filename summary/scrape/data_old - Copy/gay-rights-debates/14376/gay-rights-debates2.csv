If you dislike this and go against it your not a true Amercain. IF you say that same sex marriage is against the Bible your not a true Amercain.

So tough it, if men and women want to have same sex and marry each other, thats their choice and by Amercains we will honer their RIGHT!!! to do so!

Exactly what makes him a ""crappy"" president? GW Bush was the worst president in the history of the country. I am assuming that you mean that he was better then Obama? Would you please clarify your statement please?","gay-marriage","06:41 AM","gay-rights-debates","21"

While I disagreed on many levels with President Bush he isn't even in the running for the worst. He would have to stand in line behind all of the following and likely more (in no particular order): Clinton Carter Coolidge Buchanan Grant Harding Nixon Pierce Andrew Johnson","gay-marriage","01:25 PM","gay-rights-debates","23"

But now that homosexual sinners are coming out of their closets like the brazen hedonists that they are, we're regressing back to Sodom and Gomorrah values. Americans reject gay marriage. It's a perversion and an abomination.","gay-marriage","05:48 PM","gay-rights-debates","24"
"07-09-2010","14376",2,"snakespit","406709","Isn't it amusing that you say ""I served Uncle Sam and fought for my freedom of speech right"", yet you don't think gays should be able to serve in the military nor do you think they should have freedom of speech. You said so right here: Originally Posted by Easyrider: If I were in charge and a gay came out of the closet in the military, he'd get 3 months in the slammer, lose his stipes, and then suffer a bad conduct discharge. That's classy!","Easyrider","406911","Why do you lie about what people have said? They can serve and say whatever they want. But they need to stay in the closet or else they're out of here. There's consequences on earth and in the hereafter for the stiff-necked crowd. By the way, Did yo daddy plug da hole today?? Did e? ROTFLOL!","gay-marriage","05:59 PM","gay-rights-debates","25"

This makes no sense. Obviously, they cannot say what ever they want, and if they say the wrong thing, they are kicked out. That is not freedom of speech. Why should there be consequences on earth, because you believe that it is wrong according to your religious book? News flash for ya: Not everyone believes your religious book, and as such, not everyone feels obligated to abide by your book. Thankfully, you and your like-minded crowd of bigots are a dying breed. Right. Because that is all the oil spill in the gulf is to you...a big joke.","gay-marriage","02:13 PM","gay-rights-debates","26"

Pride is a deadly sin you know (to you anyway). This means - My delusion will get you anyway. Just because you realise it's a load of tosh makes no difference in my tiny mind. This is just a flippant throw away remark because he can't think of any sensible come back. No change there then. Carry on!","gay-marriage","05:23 PM","gay-rights-debates","28"

I can give plenty of examples where you have... Who said anything about being in denial? I was asking why all Americans, even those like myself who believe your book to be nothing more than philosophical fiction, should be subject to your religious whims.","gay-marriage","10:46 PM","gay-rights-debates","29"
