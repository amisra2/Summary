Where were you then? Got a double standard, do you? Fortunately it's not up to the spiritually challenged to determine who belongs where. And just because some of our so-called ""enlightened"" educators still aren't able to grasp the truth doesn't mean everyone else is walking around in darkness. And for the record, I do know the truth, and so do all other born again Christians. The TRUTH is a person, Jesus Christ. ""I am the way and the TRUTH and the life.

"07-24-2010","14376",10,"Ohioprof","408178","Since marriage is a fundamental right, states should have to demonstrate that they have a compelling state interest in denying a particular type of couple the right to marry. It's not enough to draw arbitrary distinctions between people and say that these people do not have the right to marry simply because it is convenient for the state to say so or because the majority dislikes the marriage in question. The burden should be on the state to demonstrate that it has a compelling interest in prohibiting a particular type of marriage.","Easyrider","408291","IMO the only demonstration needed by the states is the Word of God which clearly states that gay sex is a sin. Thus, gay marriage would be nothing more than institutionalized sin. Even the founding fathers were against Sodomy. Jefferson specifically wrote against sodomy. Today's educators are either ignorant of this or don't care. The problem today is a great many modern educators are so spiritually challenged and so oblivious to the early, moral foundations of America that they think it is chic and intelligent to defend gross iniquity. They have no real clue about what God and Country is all about. They don't know right from wrong. A great many of them no doubt voted for Obama - a flaming socialist for all intents and purposes. And they call themselves ""educators""? Are you kidding me? I think godly parents need to get more involved and get these people out of our classrooms.","gay-marriage","08:50 AM","gay-rights-debates","138"

And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear. -- Deuteronomy 21:18-21 So where is your scripture where Jesus allegedly got mad at the father for not killing his son when he was disobedient?

However, because we separate church and state, our laws must not advantage one religious viewpoint over others. Not all Christians or people of other faiths believe that ""gay sex is a sin,"" and nowhere does the Bible say anything at all about same-sex marriage. We should never allow one people of one religious faith to impose their religious beliefs on everyone else through the law. We are all free to believe and practice our own faiths by keeping religion separate from our government. Whether your or some others believe that same-sex marriage is ""institutionalized sin"" should be irrelevant in whether it is legal. The question should be whether same-sex marriage does harm to the society or its members, and whether a state has at least a rational basis but probably a compelling interest in banning same-sex marriage. People have the right to believe that Jews and Christians should not marry each other. People do not have the right to pass laws prohibiting Jews and Christians from marrying each other. On the K-12 level, in the public schools, it is not the job of teachers to impose religious doctrine on students. Indeed, they are prohibited from doing so. If you want teachers to teach what you believe is ""the truth,"" meaning religious truth, then you have to rely on teachers in private schools to do this. Public school teachers cannot do so, and they should not do so. Religious freedom requires that students not be subjected to the teaching of religious doctrine in the public school classroom.","gay-marriage","11:23 AM","gay-rights-debates","146"

"07-24-2010","14376",10,"Ohioprof","408279","Jyoshu: The Supreme Court has said in the past that marriage is a fundamental right, and we will see if they assert this now. It's not just my opinion; the Court has in the past declared this. The Court has never viewed fundamental rights as absolute, however. You are right that widespread acceptance of same-sex marriage will be a cultural change. I will argue that the culture has already been changing to accept gay people as free and equal citizens with the right to be themselves openly. The society has also been changing in acceptance of gay-headed families, even though most people still say they do not favor same-sex marriage. But the changes in attitudes over the past 30 years have been dramatic. I think that each significant cultural or social change needs to be debated on its own merits. I do think this debate is important to our society, so that we continue to live together in a civil way, without resort to violence. While I like in theory your proposal to remove all concrete legal and financial benefits from marriage and granting all benefits to every individual, I think it is politically unrealistic to expect this to happen.","jyoshu","408337","You mean in Loving? I think what remains to be seen is whether or not that means that any kind of marriage whatsoever could fit into that idea. Clearly that case meant interracial marriage (which was still a man and a woman). Whether it meant the more fundamental change of two men or two women pairing remains to be seen. Sure, but then so have many other sexual-based issues since the sexual revolution. It has followed a trend of many things becoming more accepted, many of them not good things. I believe the legitimacy of homosexual relationships has been emblematic and a part of an overall broader decline in moralistic values over the last 30 years. Well I think the real issue here is, quite simply, marriage . In other words, this is really about whether or not we will make legal marriage into a continually broadening institution for whatever comes along. The merits of that issue go much farther than just whether gay unions will be considered. And it is because the issue is about marriage that so many aren't comfortable with gay marriage. I disagree--I think eventually that will in fact be what happens. I believe the trend of history is for more and more moralistic-based issue groups to come along and demand legitimacy in this way. Eventually marriage will have to be closed, opened up completely, or relegated into a meaningless institution altogether.","gay-marriage","11:53 AM","gay-rights-debates","150"
