"07-25-2010","14376",13,"Steeeeve","408498","But this is because it violated a law passed by a super majority...aka an amendment. The constitution and its amendments are intended to frustrate the majority in some cases (aka stall them like I said) but at the end of the day with enough people in support you can even pass segregation laws. You could almost look at constitutionally enumerated rights as supreme rights since they are meant to force a certain social norm as opposed to rights enacted by simple law which can change from generation to generation easily. It takes a lot to make a ""right"" this way so when you do you know it is something serious. True but they were talking about federal government trumping the states rights to decide those things more than were talking about rights in general. This is somewhat self evident in that every right is restricted because of a majority and many laws are a restriction of rights from drinking ages to sexual conduct. What is a good reason and where does the constitution require one? In my analysis I explain why this make no sense and basically converts a judge to a moral arbiter. But this is meaningless. In substance what you get at is convincing a judge of what his morality should be. Let me give you a good example. If I'm a judge and I think you have a right to life from conception until natural death than there is going to be no rational basis for a law allowing abortion. If I'm a judge who thinks a woman as a right to her own body above anything else than there is going to be no rational basis for a law disallowing abortion. So both laws would be unconstitutional (not at the same time..you know what I mean). My position is that both judges are wrong. There is no right either way in the constitution and applying a ""rational basis"" to the law is really just bouncing the law off your own personal belief or something other standard which is NOT related to law to see if it ""makes sense"". In effect, you create law.","Ohioprof","408501","All of this gets back to the thorny question of what rights the constitution protects. If you argue that the constitution protects only the rights enumerated, then it's easier to point to the rights that the super-majority has codified in the form of amendments or specific constitutional provisions. But what about rights that have not been enumerated? Is marriage a right protected by the constitution? If not, then states can abridge marriage however they please, including prohibiting inter-racial marriage, and then the ruling in Loving v. Virginia must be wrong. Is voting a right protected by the constitution? For most of U.S. history, the Supreme Court has said said no, it's not. But this seems to have changed in recent decades, and now I suspect the Supreme Court would rule that the right to vote is protected by the constitution. Is privacy a right protected by the constitution? The Supreme Court has said yes, but it's not enumerated, and if we say that only the rights enumerated are protected by the constitution, then all the rulings that have been based on a right to privacy must be wrong. If we say that the constitution protects rights beyond those specifically enumerated (which I know you do not believe), then it's not clear what those rights are. What are the natural rights that are unalienable, to go back to the Declaration of Independence? And does the 14th amendment prohibit the states from denying those rights? A libertarian constitutional scholar named Randall Barnett has argued that the Court should base its constitutional interpretation on a presumption of liberty rather than a presumption that laws passed by the legislative branch or by voters are constitutional. He sees the threat to liberty in the actions of the majority through legislation, in effect the people asserting government power. He argues that the constitution makes individual liberty sacrosanct, not the power of majorities to pass laws that limit liberty. It's an interesting argument, but I have not had a chance to read enough of Barnett to fully grasp how he would have the Court interpret the 14th amendment or the 9th amendment.","gay-marriage","08:41 PM","gay-rights-debates","182"

Scalia actually goes around and does a speech where he gives examples of rulings he has made that upset both sides basically saying he doesn't care who he offends.

I mostly accept what the Supreme Court does, and I figure there isn't much of anything I can do about it even if I strongly disagree with a ruling. So I'd better understand the Court's rulings and come to grips with them. You mostly argue that much of what the Supreme Court does is bad interpretation of the constitution. I think this is why we end up arguing a lot or arguing past each other. I explain what I think the Court has done, and you argue why you think what the Court has done is wrong. I shrug my shoulders and say, ""That's just what they have done, how they have interpreted the constitution."" I don't always agree with the Supreme Court, but I cannot have any direct influence on them. I am an activist, but I usually focus my activism on trying to make legislative changes where we voters can have direct influence.

The right to vote is actually in there (15th amendment and 26th amendment) but doesn't say it can't be taken away. In fact, it can be and has been. Right, this is basically impossible which is why it has gone through a number of standards. It started out that those rights are rights ""deeply rooted"" in our nations traditions. This standard had to be set aside though because you couldn't rule unconstitutional things like abortion, homosexual conduct, death penalty for mentally handicapped, etc because many of those were forbidden for years or thought of in the negative. Haven't we had this conversation before? Barnett argues with another professor from Loyola I believe about the 9th amendment. Reading Barnett I think he extrapolates to much. At the end of the day the compelling state interest is still a total fraud as a constitutional test. Let's assume abortion is a right granted in the constitution...a compelling state interest test still makes no sense to apply to that just like it doesn't make sense to apply to the 2nd amendment, for example. What matters is the meaning of that right...which you can adapt to new technologies or changes in a society (such as the internet for the first amendment freedom of speech). Equal protection does doesn't have the meaning the courts have ruled it does over the last 60ish years.","gay-marriage","09:01 PM","gay-rights-debates","185"
"07-25-2010","14376",13,"Ohioprof","408470","First you dismiss what James Madison, one of the authors of the first amendment, wrote about religious liberty, and then you claim that practices engaged in after the founding demonstrate that the founders did not intend a complete separation of church and state. But the words of Madison himself demonstrate his intent.","Easyrider","408506","Not so fast. Madison believed Christianity to be the foundation upon which a just government must be built. Writing on June 20, 1785, he stated: Religion [is] the basis and Foundation of Government.

He was a strong supporter of religious liberty. That is why he sought to keep government from interfering with religion and to prevent any church from claiming a hold on the government. He believed, like his friend Jefferson, that the people are free to practice their faith only when the government is kept out of religion. He did not seek to create a Christian nation. He sought to create a nation where the people would be free to practice their Christian faith and other faiths. He believed that protecting religious liberty would enable Christianity to thrive and to water the tree of republican liberty generally. You are also right that most of the founders of our nation were men of faith. They were also men of diverse faiths and diverse views about faith. As I have said, many of the men who had significant influences on the creation of the republic and on the constitution were not traditional evangelical Christians, but Deists and people whose faith was shaped by the Enlightenment ideas of the age. The framers were to a large degree believers in reason and science as well as men of faith, and many of them looked to the laws of nature to explain phenomena, not to a God who intervenes directly in people's lives. But they were certainly not hostile to religion. They opposed an established religion, meaning government-sponsored religion and government-sponsored worship. (Note that it was not until the 20th century, well after the ratification of the 14th amendment, that the first amendment ban on established churches was applied to the states. The first amendment originally applied only to the national government, not the state governments, and the old Puritan Church, which became the Congregational Church, remained the established church of Massachusetts well into the 19th century.) I do not know the extent to which most K-12 public school teachers address the religious influences on the shaping of our republic in their classes, but I suspect that most social studies and history teachers on the K-12 level shy away from teaching about this. I think that's a shame. There is nothing unconstitutional in teaching about religion and its influence on the history of our nation. What is unconstitutional is teaching religion as doctrine in the public schools. On the college level, I teach a great deal about the influences of religion on American society and culture. I think it is important for our students to learn this.","gay-marriage","07:25 AM","gay-rights-debates","188"
