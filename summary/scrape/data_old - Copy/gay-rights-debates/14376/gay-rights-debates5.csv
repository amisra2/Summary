"07-20-2010","14376",5,"None","None","None","snakespit","407885","What Easy? You got quiet about anti-gay scientists all the sudden? For those of you who are just catching up, George Alan Rekers is the notable professor, psychologist, and ordained baptist minister who also was a scientific advisor and board member of NARTH (organization that promotes ""conversion therapy"" for gays). He has testified in court and committee in support of oppression of gays. He hired an online male prostitute from Rent-Boy to accompany him to Europe and give him rub and tugs. What a classy guy. People like Rekers are a reality, and exist in a small but statistically significant percentage of ""anti-gay"" professionals (ministers, scientists, psychologists, and politicians) who turn out to be merely trying to cover up their own homosexuality. It is projection. They are merely punishing someone else for their own sins. It's really kinda sick. Ted Haggard comes to mind.","gay-marriage","09:09 PM","gay-rights-debates","66"
"07-20-2010","14376",5,"jitobear","407678","As far as gay parenting (not all gay parents are adoptive - the reproduction organs of homosexuals aren't automatically broken. I know a gay man who is a biological grandfather - the actual facts, studies and stories of these children also say you are wrong. I co-parent with a gay man (I am the biological mother, he was my son's mentor and adopted him in a co-parent adoption years ago). Outside of the usual teen angst my son is just awesome and thinks people like you are bleedin' XXXXXX. He also hasn't ""caught gay"" yet. An lastly - pedophilia is a sexual attraction to children. Most child molesters are not true pedophiles but just another type of rapist. Rape is not about sexual attraction but power. Victims are not chosen because they turn the rapist on. Most child molesters are actually straight men.","jyoshu","407897","Almost always, the point being made is that two people in a homosexual relationship will never be able to conceive children because it's a sort of relationship outside of the procreative norm. That's just the reality of the situation. That there are are non-natural ways to get around that reality is beside the point. (Heck, I've even heard gays bring up--as wishful thinking, no doubt--the bizarro tabloid-like news accounts of womb transplants into men, and so forth.) I suppose one could still 'walk' around if he or she forwent normal walking for walking on their hands everywhere they went. The walking 'organs' (one's legs) would still not be ""automatically broken"". The usual 'rape-has-nothing-to-do-with-attraction' thing is a tragic over-simplification. If it were true, all rapists would target men and women with equal abuse, and everyone knows that's just not the case.","gay-marriage","10:04 PM","gay-rights-debates","67"

Hair color, weight/body type, skin color, etc etc. Gender is merely one criteria that is usually selected to the opposite sex, with the exception of prisons, where rapists have fewer choices to select from. Some of these prisoners might rape a man in prison, get released, and continue raping women back on the streets. Sure, there is a psychosexual component to rape, but it is as a rule not the motivating factor in the rape. Rape is a projection of power in which one gets to do as they want with impunity. Others wishes, desires, and rights are not important to a rapist.","gay-marriage","11:47 PM","gay-rights-debates","68"

"07-21-2010","14376",5,"None","None","None","Ohioprof","407915","To Jyoshu: I am legally allowed to marry a man, and I cannot procreate. I am post-menopausal, and no one tries to prevent me from marrying a man, even though a marriage between me and a man would be ""outside the procreative norm,"" to quote you. I think the argument that gay people cannot procreate as same-sex couples is just cover to try to mask homophobia. What really drives the anti-same-sex marriage arguments is homophobia. Fortunately, people can un-learn homophobia. Homophobia is learned, but clinging to homophobia is a choice. People can choose to stop being homophobic.","gay-marriage","09:55 AM","gay-rights-debates","70"

I never said the legality of gay marriage rests on those merits. But in the example you gave, you are still a woman mating with a man. The inability to procreate in that case is due to age, not due to biological incompatibility.","gay-marriage","10:12 AM","gay-rights-debates","71"

That's no different, in essence, from what you call ""biological incompatibility."" Playing with words does not make my biological inability to reproduce with a man any different from my biological inability to reproduce with a woman. I am biologically unable to reproduce with either a man or a woman. That should not be a reason to bar me from marrying either one. If you are not arguing that this biological inability to reproduce is a reason to bar people from marrying each other, then why did you bring it up?","gay-marriage","11:00 AM","gay-rights-debates","72"

EDIT: a couple may also be biologically incompatible. a friend of mine and his girlfriend are going through some rough times right now because their blood is not compatible with one another, and although they can procreate, the baby will have major blood problems. theyre currently figuring it out and getting medical treatment, but STILL - they are still legally able to get married despite their biological incompatibility.","gay-marriage","01:36 PM","gay-rights-debates","73"

I'm going to advise active gays to repent and receive Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior for the remission of their sins. They do that they can be happy for all eternity.
