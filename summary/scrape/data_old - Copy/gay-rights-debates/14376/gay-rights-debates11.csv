Take a lesson from our Founding Fathers: Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence who was also known as the ""Father of Public Schools,"" once had this to offer: ""The only foundation for a republic is...religion. Without it there can be no virtue, and without virtue there can be no liberty."" Don't miss the significance of that last statement: ..without virtue there can be no liberty...."" The principle is clear - a lack of virtue engenders bondage. As one writer noted, ""Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their fetters (bindings)."" The more liberties a godless people achieve, the more enslaved they ultimately become in their worldly obsessions. Still another founding father, the Reverend John Witherspoon, mirrored Benjamin Rush when he declared, ""...Civil liberty cannot long be preserved without virtue...."" There is a God, and if you continue to violate his commandments then you will be in bondage just like the Israelites were time and again in the Book of Judges when they ignored God. Thomas Jefferson understood this principle when he wrote: ""Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice cannot sleep forever.""

"07-24-2010","14376",11,"Ohioprof","408259","The problem, Steeeve, with saying the compelling state interest is in enacting a law that the people want is that this is exactly what the Bill of Rights was intended to prevent: the majority denying rights to the minority through the use of government. If minority rights are to mean anything and to be protected, they must be protected from the animus of majorities. In the case of Romer v. Evans, the Supreme Court struck down a state constitutional amendment voted in by the people, because the Court ruled that the amendment was based purely in animus against gay people. The Court ruled that the constitutional amendment did not even meet the rational basis standard. The fact that the people of Colorado voted for the amendment and thus wanted it was not sufficient to allow them to deny a right to a group of people, a minority. I think the Court ruled correctly in Romer v. Evans. I am sure you will disagree with me about this.","Steeeeve","408368","No, the bill of rights was intended to prevent the federal government from overstepping it's bounds...which you can look at as related to majority denying rights but really it is government denying rights (as government could always ""deny rights"" when the majority didn't want them to because the congress has the power). But this brings up an interesting question. How is it not a state interest that the citizens get laws enacted that they wish to have? The fact that it denys a right seems irrelevant and almost circular. ""You have to have a compelling state interest to deny a right"" and then ""something isn't a state interest if it denies a right"". This is why I find ""compelling state interest"" to be so absurd. If we injected everyone with truth serum we'd probably find out that it really means ""compelling reason to the judge"". Of course with moral questions that really varies. The problem was it was a ruling based upon pure emotion. Nothing I have read (in the history of the amendment) seems to suggest that equal protection can only be ""broken"" (it wasn't) if the court agrees with the reasoning. It is irrational at best and makes the court a bunch of moral arbiters. I think without question it was a wrong decision even if the Colorado amendment was total BS.","gay-marriage","02:17 PM","gay-rights-debates","157"

If a K-12 public school teacher were ever to teach my daughter a ""lesson from the Book of Revelation"" I would immediately file a lawsuit. I would also try to get the teacher disciplined and probably fired, unless the teacher issued an apology to parents and to the students and pledged never to teach religious doctrine in the public school classroom again. I feel very strongly about this. I do not want ANYONE ramming their religious beliefs down my child's throat, and certainly not in a public school. My daughter has the right not to be subjected to this in the public schools. I respect your right to believe what you will, but it's not your right or anyone else's right to force your religious beliefs on my child through the public schools. That's how it is, whatever you think of our Supreme Court. Teaching religious doctrine as truth in the public schools is without doubt creating an establishment of religion, and it violates the principle of religious freedom that has helped to make our nation free for all of us. The Supreme Court will back me up on that. If you want to teach your children religious doctrine in school, you are certainly free to send them to private school. That is also religious liberty.","gay-marriage","02:33 PM","gay-rights-debates","158"

Benjamin Rush became a Universalist, meaning he came to believe in universal salvation. This was considered heresy by most Christians at the time. My own faith is Unitarian Universalism, and my church was founded in the 1860s as a Universalist congregation. Thomas Jefferson was a Deist who did not believe that God intervenes in daily life and who did not believe in the miracles described in the Bible. He rewrote the Bible and stripped it of all miracles, including the resurrection of Jesus, which he excluded entirely from his Bible. James Madison was nominally Episcopalian, but some scholars regard him as a Deist. George Washington rarely spoke of his religious beliefs. He was Episcopalian in his church membership, and some scholars think he was also a Deist. John Adams was a Unitarian. Benjamin Franklin was a Deist who rejected the divinity of Jesus and a belief in salvation, but who retained a belief in religious practice and prayer. Many of the founders embraced the Enlightenment philosophy of their age and were not evangelical Christians in the traditional sense. The founders in the late 18th century were much concerned with fostering civic virtue, by which they generally meant a commitment to serve the common good. They drew their ideas about virtue from ancient Greek philosophers, notably Plato and Aristotle, and they modeled the new American republic partly on the republics of ancient Greece and Rome.","gay-marriage","03:07 PM","gay-rights-debates","161"

Anti-federalist writers like Agrippa and ""a Maryland farmer"" worried openly that majority rule would deny liberty to the minority, unless a Bill of Rights was included in the constitution to prohibit the majority from denying rights to the minority. James Madison also expressed great concern about the majority trampling on the rights of the minority. But Madison, as we have previously discussed, initially argued that a Bill of Rights was not necessary, because he thought the structure of the government itself, the separation of powers, would prevent the majority from trampling on minority rights. Madison had other reasons as well for initially opposing a Bill of Rights in the constitution. He later changed his mind, some say because of political pressure, and he was instrumental in writing the Bill of Rights that we now have. So while the Bill of Rights was inserted to prevent the government from trampling on the liberty of the people, if you read the antifederalist papers and also the writings of Madison on this topic, you see that their concern was that the majority would trample the rights of the minority through exertion of federal power. In the thinking of 18th century political theorists, in the struggle between power and liberty, the new constitution gave power to the majority of the people, but this left the problem of the majority of the people potentially using government power to deny liberty to the minority. The anti-federalist answer to this was a Bill of Rights, and Madison eventually agreed and participated in writing the Bill of Rights. Fast forward to the 20th century and Supreme Court interpretations of the 14th amendment. According to the Supreme Court, a state can have a compelling interest in a law that denies a right, but the bar is high for a state to demonstrate that it has a compelling interest in enacting the law. The Court, as we both know, has further developed this doctrine so that laws that deny rights on the basis of race or national origin or religion get strict scrutiny, meaning the state must show that it has a compelling interest in enacting the law. Laws that violate a fundamental right also apparently get strict scrutiny, although this doctrine is less clear, and it's hard to know whether the Court will apply strict scrutiny to a case challenging a restrictive marriage law. It is up to the Supreme Court to determine whether the state has a compelling interest in enacting a law in a case where the Court applies strict scrutiny. For cases in which a law denies rights on the basis of sex, the Court has applied a middle level of scrutiny, so that the bar is lower for the state to demonstrate its reasons for enacting the law. (I know you know all this, but I include it for background for other readers.) And for other kinds of discrimination, the Court typically applies the lowest level of scrutiny and demands only that states demonstrate a rational basis for enacting the law. Even with this low level of scrutiny, the Court ruled that the state of Colorado failed to show a rational basis for its state constitutional amendment that denied political rights on the basis of sexual orientation. The fact that the voters themselves voted in the constitutional amendment did not, in the view of the Court, give the state even a rational basis for enacting the law. I know you don't like any of this, but these balancing tests are what the Court does. I do not think the ruling in Romer v. Evans was based on ""pure emotion."" The Court majority considered what interest the state had in enacting the constitutional amendment, which denied people in the state the right to pass legislation barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The Court considered what the state's interest was in enacting this amendment, and the majority concluded that the only reason for the amendment was animus against gay people. This was not, in the view of the Court majority, even a rational basis for enacting the amendment, and they therefore ruled that the state could not abrogate an individual right with such an amendment.","gay-marriage","04:49 PM","gay-rights-debates","163"
