Marriage can only be between a man and a woman, as a symbol of love and possibly a means for the creation of a family. Unfortunately for homosexuals, there cannot be love between them. Homosexuality, in the majority of the cases, is a psychological disorder that arises at an early age for a lot of kids, and if not dealt with during adolescence, can lead to being gay. A lot of male kids are more ""effeminate"" when they're young, but when adolescence starts, thanks to the society which is against homosexuals, learn to be more manly, and lose any doubts about their sexuality. Unfortunately, today's society is becoming more and more open to it, causing homosexuality to spread. Therefore, you cannot call love a feeling that arises between two individuals because it exists only because of their psychological disorder. It's not love, it's an illusion of love. With women, it may be different. Because women are always a lot closer to each other than man. For instance they can easily kiss each other on the cheek without any kind of embarrassment or problem, thing condemned among men. So woman have a tendency to be bisexual, but they cannot naturally be completely lesbian. Now I believe that since we're all born different, there is a very scanty percentage of born homosexuals. We must however remember that by giving them the right to marry, we're spreading homosexuality. And homosexuality means bigger exposure to AIDS and other STDs, higher probability of pedophilia, the loss of distinction between a woman and a transsexual, and finally, the loss of distinction between a man and a woman. Therefore I do not think that for that ridiculously small percentage of uncurable individuals our society should risk so much. And let's not even get started about gay adoption. Poor kids. We should try to support secular organizations which specialize in homosexual treatments, like the biggest one, the NARTH. I rest my case.","gay-marriage","07:44 AM","gay-rights-debates","48"

Marriage is just a legal procedure which allows the authorities to keep track of relationships. It is not a religious thing (thought the church has tried to make it such). It also has little to do with procreation, as you don't need a licence to do the wild thing. See above. Do you have any evidence that homosexuality is just a disorder? Also, have you seen the number of hetrosexual men who appear effeminate (or butch lesbians), or homosexual men who appear 'normal'? You can't tell someone's sexual preference just by their mannerisms. So, now love is just a psychological disorder. Perhaps you are right. If you think you love someone, doesn't that mean you love someone? If I think I love chocolate, could I be wrong and actually hate the stuff? Now we are getting into the 'ick factor'. Just because men don't have the touchy-feely thing going for them, doesn't mean much at all. Again, you can't tell just from mannerisms - or what makes you go eeeeeerrrrrr . It sounds like you just get off on seeing two women together (nothing wrong with that), but two men together makes you go eeeeeerrrrrr . So there are real homosexuals out there. Nice to know. But you feel you can discriminate against the 'real' homosexuals, just to stop others from pretending to be homosexual. Isn't that a bit like locking up all those of Japanese descent because other Japs did something nasty. Hang on, already done that. Or bombing a muslim country because a few muslims crashed a plane. Er, still doing that. Perhaps we should lock up all Americans because of that business at Waco. Or all Brits because of he trouble they have a football matches. Or Canadians because of Ben Johnson. You see where I'm going? We can't make rules to discriminate against one bunch of people (innocent people) just because another bunch of people who maybe look a bit like them might be doing something wrong (and remember that the other bunch in question aren't actually doing anything wrong in this case). No it doesn't. No link there either. Male homosexuals like men, not boys and girls. Lesbians likewise. So what? So what? You'll be banning drag acts next. Lock up everyone who wears a turban. Or maybe a slightly off-white complexion might be enough. Yea, better off being unloved that being loved by someone who makes you go eeeeeerrrrrr . You can't treat it. They are just a bunch of people who say eeeeeerrrrrr a lot. What case?","gay-marriage","09:44 AM","gay-rights-debates","50"

People use the Bible all the time to try to support their personal beliefs and prejudices, and they come up with different ways to interpret the Bible. I personally do not believe the Bible is the word of God. I think the Bible is a collection of writings by people who were trying to understand God. I think God's truth is in all of creation, not just one collection of writings. There is much wisdom in the Bible, and there is much in the Bible that is fallacy. That's because it was written by a variety of human beings, with human foibles and limited understanding, which we all have. To the atheist who argues that homosexuality is a disorder, most psychologists disagree with you, and most view NARTH as an organization that foists a harmful agenda on the public in the guise of promoting ""science."" Bravo to Argentina. Many countries seem more advanced than the United States when it comes to recognizing equal marriage rights. The United States does not live up to its own civil creed of ""all men are created equal"" with ""unalienable rights."" But we are slowly moving in the right direction, state by state.","gay-marriage","05:16 AM","gay-rights-debates","54"

Most child molesters are not true pedophiles but just another type of rapist. Rape is not about sexual attraction but power. Victims are not chosen because they turn the rapist on.
