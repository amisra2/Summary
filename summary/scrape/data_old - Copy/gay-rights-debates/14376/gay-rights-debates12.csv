I have a problem when he uses those beliefs to dictate others actions, even when others may not share in his beliefs. That is why I call him a bigot.

But the words of Madison himself demonstrate his intent. As for the Abingdon case, you need to place your quotation into context and show us the whole of what Justice Clark wrote. His point was that, although the state may not show hostility to religion, religious exercises in the schools are in fact unconstitutional, and their prohibition does not represent hostility toward religion. See his statement in context: ""It is insisted that unless these religious exercises are permitted a 'religion of secularism' is established in the schools. We agree of course that the State may not establish a 'religion of secularism' in the sense of affirmatively opposing or showing hostility to religion, thus 'preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do believe.' Zorach v. Clauson, supra, at 314. We do not agree, however, that this decision in any sense has that effect. In addition, it might well be said that one's education is not complete without a study of comparative religion or the history of religion and its relationship to the advancement of civilization. It certainly may be said that the Bible is worthy of study for its literary and historic qualities. Nothing we have said here indicates that such study of the Bible or of religion, when presented objectively as part of a secular program of education, may not be effected consistently with the First Amendment. But the exercises here do not fall into those categories. They are religious exercises, required by the States in violation of the command of the First Amendment that the Government maintain strict neutrality, neither aiding nor opposing religion. ""Finally, we cannot accept that the concept of neutrality, which does not permit a State to require a religious exercise even with the consent of the majority of those [374 U.S. 203, 226] affected, collides with the majority's right to free exercise of religion. While the Free Exercise Clause clearly prohibits the use of state action to deny the rights of free exercise to anyone, it has never meant that a majority could use the machinery of the State to practice its beliefs.""","gay-marriage","11:46 AM","gay-rights-debates","174"
"07-25-2010","14376",12,"Ohioprof","408379","According to the Supreme Court, a state can have a compelling interest in a law that denies a right, but the bar is high for a state to demonstrate that it has a compelling interest in enacting the law. The Court, as we both know, has further developed this doctrine so that laws that deny rights on the basis of race or national origin or religion get strict scrutiny, meaning the state must show that it has a compelling interest in enacting the law. The Court considered what the state's interest was in enacting this amendment, and the majority concluded that the only reason for the amendment was animus against gay people.","Steeeeve","408485","I'm familiar with what the court has said but they fail to realize the substantive meaning of this. So I'm going to break down the illogical nature of the ""compelling state interest"" test and why if one did exist it would have to include citizen votes as an interest. First off, I subject the role of government (federal and state combined) is basically to provide ""establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity"". You might notice this is from our Constitution. The relevant part here is ""blessings of liberty"". Now, who decides what a liberty is? Should it be the citizens of United States or should it be a select group of people or something else. I would say generally in the United States we have both rights agreed upon by the citizens and those we find inherent from God (see DOI for what I mean on the later). For the sake of argument let's just look at rights agreed upon by the citizens. Who's job is it to determine what the rights agreed upon by the citizens should be? There is really the main question. Well if I felt the speed limit should be 70mph instead of 65mph who do I go to? I go to the General Assembly in my state and lobby them to change the speed limit laws. Traditionally in our government we have set it up so we have one person running executive aspects or rather carrying out the laws; one GROUP making the laws that are to be carried out; and one group to ensure the government and others are acting in accordance with the laws. As such you have the executive branch, legislative branch, and judicial branch. So what branch would you go to in order to make an 'agreed upon right' for citizens? Well naturally the legislative branch. The judicial branch's ONLY job with that should be to look at that law and say does it conflict with a superior law (aka the constitution) . Now, in form, the judges are claiming the 14th amendment equal protection clause implies a ""compelling state interest test"". The substance of this ruling makes this not true in the way they apply it. Why? Well what is a compelling state interest? As I established above one state interest, for the legislature, is to bring about laws that the public agrees upon. The courts have said this is not good enough. So what is the threshold? It isn't implied in the amendment so you can't turn there. If you looked at public opinion than you'd just break what you said you can't do. These leaves you with either looking at your own views or looking at a different set of opinions. So it isn't a ""compelling state"" interest anymore but would be a ""compelling interest to a judge or given subset of opinion"" test. By what standard you apply that is probably beyond anyone and certainly not taught in law school. So as you can see the FORM of the compelling state interest test makes no sense. The substance shows it to be a ""convince me"" test which basically results in 9 lawyers deciding the liberties of a nation of 300 million. This was feared in the anti-federalists papers if you remember and clearly not intended by the powers of the judiciary section of the constitution. The only compelling state interest that exists is to secure the Blessings of Liberty that the CITIZENS want secured. For those wondering about majority rule...basically the constitution is not there to prevent the majority from winning every time. The constitution merely slows down the majority. In the long run the majority should and does win out. and basically this was the reason. People thought it was gross and didn't want it. That is a good enough reason to enact a law and has been for many other laws. The court thought ""well it isn't gross and you can't make a law because you don't like something"" which is an emotional way of thinking, it isn't based in law.","gay-marriage","03:28 PM","gay-rights-debates","175"

I think that on some issues, the constitution does prevent the majority from winning, specifically in cases in which the majority passes laws that deny rights to minorities. The segregation laws are an example. The majority of voters in the South clearly supported segregation laws, and the Court eventually interpreted the constitution as preventing the majority from enacting or retaining these laws. Ultimately, of course, the constitution exists because of the will of the majority, and it is the majority who sustain the constitution and provide for its enforcement, but it is more than a simple majority. Changing the constitution requires a decision by a super-majority, in effect. Only a super majority of 2/3 of both houses of Congress and 3/4 of the state legislatures can amend the constitution, as you know. So you are right that it is the will of the people, expressed in a super-majority, that has created and sustains the constitution, which through the Bill of Rights prevents majorities from denying rights to the minority. Madison himself wrote about his concerns that the majority would deny rights to minorities, as did several of the antifederalist writers. On the Romer v. Evans matter, I think the Court majority's ruling was based on more than their dislike for the public animus against gay people or their belief that you ""can't make a law because you don't like something."" I think their ruling was based on the fact that the Colorado constitutional amendment denied a right to a class of people, and in the judgment of the Court majority the voters had no rational basis for doing this beyond animus against gay people. Colorado, in defending the amendment, failed to demonstrate what the Court deemed to be a rational basis, in effect a good reason, for enacting the law. And they applied this judgment because the Colorado constitutional amendment in question denied a right to people. Voters can pass laws because they don't like something, and voters do this all the time. What the Court said voters cannot do is pass a law denying a right to people simply because they don't like those people; they have to demonstrate that the state has at least a rational basis for enacting a law that denies people rights.","gay-marriage","07:17 PM","gay-rights-debates","178"

The constitution and its amendments are intended to frustrate the majority in some cases (aka stall them like I said) but at the end of the day with enough people in support you can even pass segregation laws. You could almost look at constitutionally enumerated rights as supreme rights since they are meant to force a certain social norm as opposed to rights enacted by simple law which can change from generation to generation easily. It takes a lot to make a ""right"" this way so when you do you know it is something serious. True but they were talking about federal government trumping the states rights to decide those things more than were talking about rights in general. This is somewhat self evident in that every right is restricted because of a majority and many laws are a restriction of rights from drinking ages to sexual conduct. What is a good reason and where does the constitution require one? In my analysis I explain why this make no sense and basically converts a judge to a moral arbiter. But this is meaningless. In substance what you get at is convincing a judge of what his morality should be. Let me give you a good example. If I'm a judge and I think you have a right to life from conception until natural death than there is going to be no rational basis for a law allowing abortion. If I'm a judge who thinks a woman as a right to her own body above anything else than there is going to be no rational basis for a law disallowing abortion. So both laws would be unconstitutional (not at the same time..you know what I mean). My position is that both judges are wrong. There is no right either way in the constitution and applying a ""rational basis"" to the law is really just bouncing the law off your own personal belief or something other standard which is NOT related to law to see if it ""makes sense"". In effect, you create law.","gay-marriage","07:49 PM","gay-rights-debates","179"
