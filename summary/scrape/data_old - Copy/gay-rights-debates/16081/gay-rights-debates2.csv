Why did the disciples and the apostles both specifically and directly condone slavery if Jesus thought it was wrong (I will not even ask why Jesus never, in his entire life, said it was wrong if he felt it was)? Why did Jesus specifically and unequivocally say that the old testament laws still applied if they did not? Why did God specifically and unequivocally say that he destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah for arrogance and failing to help the poor and needy if it was secretly all about gay sex (which frankly I think we have proven was not actually occurring at any point in the story)?","gay-marriage-media-gives-obama-pass","09:59 PM","gay-rights-debates","28"
