They need to watch what they are doing because some day it can and will be their freedoms going before a popular vote of the people. They want to play the democracy card and be able to vote upon other peoples rights then they will get burned with their own weapons. When the day comes I will gladly use my right to vote to outlaw the practice of Roman catholicism and mormonism and any religion or church that has bible or gospel in its name.

In the meantime, as I stated in another post, when the opportunity arises gays will press for preachers who preach that gay sex is a sin to be prosecuted and gays will be suing churches who reject them.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","04:10 PM","gay-rights-debates","48"

Hopefully if and when enough people are anti-religious to make your threat at all meaningful we will have established a society which outlaws the the notion of modifying rights by vote.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","09:55 PM","gay-rights-debates","55"

"06-26-2011","15258",4,"None","None","None","hwyangel","433283","Marriage (and only marriage) unites the three core dimensions of parenthood --biological, social and legal --into one pro-child form: the married couple. Marriage says to a child: The man and the woman whose sexual union made you will also be there to love and raise you. Marriage says to society as a whole: For every child born, there is a recognized mother and a father, accountable to the child and to each other. The foundational human rights document in the world today regarding children, the 1989 U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, specifically guarantees children this right. The last time I checked, liberals were supposed to be in favor of internationally recognized human rights, particularly concerning children, who are typically society's most voiceless and vulnerable group. Or have I now said something I shouldn't?","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","11:26 PM","gay-rights-debates","59"

Convention on the Rights of the Child does guarantee certain rights to children, but nothing in the Convention says or requires that the parents be One man and One woman. In fact it specifically added an Article to protect ALL parents from discrimination. And furthermore as of 2009 The United States had still not Signed or Ratified this Convention so as of now we are not bound to follow it. Here's the U.N. Convention on the rights of a child, I read most of it and I found nothing in it that even mentions Gay marriage. It refers to the Parents as just that.. THE PARENTS.. whether it be a Gay couple who adopt or a Monogamous couple who gave birth ALL Parents are included. Article 1 For the purposes of the present Convention, a child means every human being below the age of eighteen years unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier. Article 2 1. States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the present Convention to each child within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind, irrespective of the child's or his or her parent's or legal guardian's race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national,ethnic or social origin, property, disability, birth or other status. http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/pdf/crc.pdf","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","11:54 PM","gay-rights-debates","60"
