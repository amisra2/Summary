But more importantly, the constitution does not guarantee a right to some people's stagnant ideals of ""American culture"". It guarantees rights. It guarantees equality. And that's what this is about. And this is part of the alienation I was talking about earlier. A pretense that MY marriage in MY life is somehow some of your business. It ain't. YOUR ""American culture"" can continue to be how you want to observe your life. You have NO right to demand my rights and life be restricted just cause I might impact your ideals on ""American culture""... Gay marriage doesn't harm anybody. There is no ""legitimate state interest"" (mandated by the 14th amendment) to prohibit recognition of our marital rights. Polygamy on the other hand has bona fide victims.

It wasnt the polygamy that caused the victims of the Mormons it was many other factors from the fundamentalists. I am sure there are many polygamous families that are quite happy. I also do not propose that only Mormons should be allowed to have polygamous relationships nor should they be only multi wife marriages either. People should be allowed to do what they want within any sexual relationship if we are to change marriage( which gay marriages will do ) not just add on a deviant facimile to hetero marriage and disregard other sexual lifestyles that are equally deserving .

(Ya'll might want to be careful about same sex room mates. (lol).

It is a responsibility and legally binding document ment to protect childrens rights to a legitimate name, paternity, custody, child support, and inheritance. Things that can not be protected through adoption or power of attorney, as with same sex couples or barren couples.

Gay marriage, Polygamy, incest etc all have their own unique conditions that may be acceptable or not for different reasons. You have that backwards. Currently if you are a man and woman you are special because as a couple you can do something a gay couple can not. Gays want to be able under the same conditions with the same obligations take advantage of those same benefits. The only rational argument (and I use that phrase with a very broad understanding) is the religious which at the end of the day is very weak and the never talked about political one which is the cost to the government if it recognized gay marriage at the Federal level. What special rights do you think gay people want that nobody else has? Because marriage and everything that goes with it comes from the government. Religion is absolutely 100% unnecessary for marriage. Being married in the eyes of God may have value in Heaven (which it actually does not) but here on earth it has 0 value except emotionally. The religious argument is simply God prohibits gay marriage. Without going into the lengthy reasons of the defects in this argument I will leave it with religion has not the right to impose it's concept of permitted behavior onto anyone else. If a person chooses to follow religion then don't get into a gay relationship and then try and marry that person. Religion doesn't get to enjoy the freedom to practice as it sees fit when it includes taking away the freedoms of others Without government recognition there is no survivor rights, there are no property rights, there are no tax benefits, there is no spousal rights to name but a few and where these things can be attempted via contract some can not and others do not carry the same strength legally. Additionally, there can be a significant expenditure of time and money to end up in a weak legal position, things that an opposite sex couple do not generally have to deal with.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","01:28 AM","gay-rights-debates","25"

A POA is a fairly useless document for many of the benefits granted to married people. Secondly would you want to carry one around to show people any time it became necessary? Why would people be granted these special privileges for doing nothing more than living together. Common law requires there be an intent to live together as a couple and acting as such.

Those rights are easily established for family members which doesn't include your same sex partner. Again your making it all about kids and especially for gay couples that is not the primary concern. Even for straight couples it is a secondary concern until they actually have them and even then it sometimes remains so. As a recognized next of kin you don't need a will, the spouse or kids have rights and claims that are automatic Again a will is easily challenged potentially tying up assets for years which the surviving person may have paid for completely or in part. A POA allows someone to act on behalf of another when the person becomes incapacitated or dies I don't think the POA continues as the executor of that persons estate takes over whether it be someone named specifically or the courts. But mommy can turn around and seek immediate relief from and have recourse to attach daddy's wages and make daddy sell the house if he doesn't want her to live there.

My post was in response to Matt's earlier stereotyping of religion and basically anyone whose opinion does not agree with his. Using the same tactic as a vehicle to note the paucity of Mattew's methods is NOT a wider statement on homosexuality but a reference to the tried and true methods which Matt invokes in lieu of actual argumentation. Well, let me take that race card and throw it right back at ye: How do you suppose one would be viewed if they suggested a French Revolution solution to African Americans, homosexuals, jews et al? OUTRAGE!!!! Just look at your own indignation at your misinterpretation of my post. You cannot even muster a stifled yawn at Matt's ""revenge fantasy"". Yet Matt is granted a pass for suggesting this peculiar little solution upon those he labels as ""Fundies"", ""Christonazis"" and other such learned labels. You might not have observed these things in your 3 months here. Let me bring you up to speed with Matt. Matt and I have known each other for at least 4 years. In that time he has quite virulently spewed his anti Christian rhetoric whilst openly using names and labels as his sole means of attack. My problem is not with Matt's argument it is the method with which he chooses to ineffectively advance it. Let me make this easy for you. This post and my previous posts have not argued one way or another against homosexual marriage. Rather, they argue against Matt's own tortured logic. He argues for the same actions that he decries in his labeled stereotyped opponents. He lumps people of faith together and then wonders why people do not treat him with individual dignity. Matt is his own argument's worst enemy. I have been telling him for YEARS that he argues against his ends far more effectively than any theoretical ""Christonazi"". He is a caricature who does damage to his own argument. If you would advance the cause of full marriage equality you might do well to point out to Matt how his own brand of invective does not lend support to the ends he seeks to acheive.","Provocateaur","433285","Those African Americans, Jews, and gay people have all dealt with actual, REAL WORLD discrimination.

"06-27-2011","15258",6,"None","None","None","hwyangel","433316","Marriage law isn't designed for the private benefit of any person; it's for the benefit of society. When we pass a law, we pass a law because that law will benefit society as a whole. Society as a whole is befitted from the union of a male and a female in ways that are not valid for unions of two persons of the same sex. Society's interest in safe sex, for both physical and emotional health, support heterosexual marriage alone. Only heterosexual unions are capable of procreation. Heterosexual unions provide the optimal environment for nurturing and raising children. Once allowed to be officially married, homosexual couples will more than likely be able to adopt. I do not doubt the pure love that these couples would show a child, and I do not doubt their pure intentions. I do believe in the natural drive toward wanting to have children. Yet, I also know that it has been shown that children who are deprived of the parenting of one gender have a very strong tendency toward emotional and/or psychological problems. These issues will affect their entire life. The most prevalent argument that I hear is that homosexual couples wish to have the rights of being considered family, especially where hospital emergencies and inheritance issues are concerned. I would argue that if they really love each other that much, then they would take the steps necessary to secure those rights, even if they cannot be officially married. The problem of not being able to see each other in the case of a medical emergency is solved by signing the proper papers ahead of time, which would designate the partners as each other next of kin. Legally I could make anyone I wanted my next of kin, thus given the same rights as a family member. If that is not enough to satisfy the inheritance issue also, then I would propose that the couple write a will. Heterosexual couples even generally also go through the process of making a will. I think that it should also be noted that even in the case of a traditional marriage one spouse can fill out a will that would prohibit everything from being left to the other. A husband can just as easily leave everything to his favorite pet as he can to his wife. I have also heard that gay couples wish to have an official ceremony that friends and family may attend. There is no law against arranging such a gathering. People invite friends and family to second weddings all of the time. There is also the argument that scientifically we find that homosexuality is a natural response to overpopulation, and so we should not fight so hard against policies having to do with it. I will quickly agree that the studies are accurate, but also point out that we find that disease and cannibalism are at least equally common responses to the same problem. I am not trying to compare homosexuality to disease or cannibalism in any way. However, I would say that until we stop fighting disease and legalize cannibalism, I see this as an invalid argument to support the gay community. there is the problem of employers being required to provide health insurance for both partners. In some cases this would seem like a good thing, but in reality it would be too large a stress on the institution of family coverage. I also believe that family coverage is largely to support children, which currently most homosexual couples do not have.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","12:57 PM","gay-rights-debates","77"

"06-27-2011","15258",6,"hwyangel","433316","Marriage law isn't designed for the private benefit of any person; it's for the benefit of society. When we pass a law, we pass a law because that law will benefit society as a whole. Society as a whole is befitted from the union of a male and a female in ways that are not valid for unions of two persons of the same sex. Society's interest in safe sex for both physical and emotional health, support heterosexual marriage alone. Only heterosexual unions are capable of procreation. Heterosexual unions provide the optimal environment for nurturing and raising children. Once allowed to be officially married, homosexual couples will more than likely be able to adopt. I do not doubt the pure love that these couples would show a child, and I do not doubt their pure intentions. I do believe in the natural drive toward wanting to have children. Yet, I also know that it has been shown that children who are deprived of the parenting of one gender have a very strong tendency toward emotional and/or psychological problems. These issues will affect their entire life. The most prevalent argument that I hear is that homosexual couples wish to have the rights of being considered family, especially where hospital emergencies and inheritance issues are concerned. I would argue that if they really love each other that much, then they would take the steps necessary to secure those rights, even if they cannot be officially married. The problem of not being able to see each other in the case of a medical emergency is solved by signing the proper papers ahead of time, which would designate the partners as each other next of kin. Legally I could make anyone I wanted my next of kin, thus given the same rights as a family member. If that is not enough to satisfy the inheritance issue also, then I would propose that the couple write a will. Heterosexual couples even generally also go through the process of making a will. I think that it should also be noted that even in the case of a traditional marriage one spouse can fill out a will that would prohibit everything from being left to the other. A husband can just as easily leave everything to his favorite pet as he can to his wife. I have also heard that gay couples wish to have an official ceremony that friends and family may attend. There is no law against arranging such a gathering. People invite friends and family to second weddings all of the time. There is also the argument that scientifically we find that homosexuality is a natural response to overpopulation, and so we should not fight so hard against policies having to do with it. I will quickly agree that the studies are accurate, but also point out that we find that disease and cannibalism are at least equally common responses to the same problem. I am not trying to compare homosexuality to disease or cannibalism in any way. However, I would say that until we stop fighting disease and legalize cannibalism, I see this as an invalid argument to support the gay community. there is the problem of employers being required to provide health insurance for both partners. In some cases this would seem like a good thing, but in reality it would be too large a stress on the institution of family coverage. I also believe that family coverage is largely to support children, which currently most homosexual couples do not have.","pappillion001","433329","The laws are for an individual.

LOLLOL Single parent homes have never been promoted in our society. Divorce also was never recognized as a positive thing, and was in fact discouraged , and usually met with child support, alimony, and many other restrictions ment to protect the child.

Still looking for the marriage connection Marriage connection, no And marriage doesn't happen to be one of those qualifications does it? Now marriage can be a factor on certain SS and VA benefits, but you need not be married to be eligible as a primary recipient for any of the above. My question and the topic concerned marriage. Unless they happen to feed it to the guests at thier wedding as a requirement to have it made official or are raising vampires I don't see why that makes a difference. There is a long list of people blood banks won't take blood from. Being at risk for disease is not a deal breaker for a marriage. As a single guy coming from a single mom who raised two sons none of the women I known did those things either. Having also been married I don't recall either of those questions on my marriage application. I really do not understand this. Gays don't effect any of these things. If a gay couple adopts a child or uses artificial methods to become pregnant and they then divorce guess what one will have primary custody and one will pay support for the child. The courts will decide which one same as with straight couples. Why would it be any different. If a straight couple adopts are you suggesting if they split then there is no custody or support options available? Granting marriage rights would most likely do the opposite of what you are stating. Currently same sex couple living together are not liable to each other for anything. If one was succesfull and the other stayed at home and raised a child either adopted or from another relationship and they split the stay at home one has no right to anything. if they had married and adopted or had their own or adopted the child from another relationship now there is recourse and responsibility. A will does not make someone a relative. The purpose is to direct the courts as to the terms of disolving the decedents estate. Courts generally comply with the wishes of the deceased, but do not have to. There are ways that same sex couple can protect their property and have their wishes executed, but they tend to be costly and have drawbacks that don't always make them desireable. Same sex couples generally can bypass a lot of these issues simply because they are married. Yes that is the point. Gay couples who accept the burdens of marriage would also like to receive the benefits and not suffer additional consequences for playing house. That you can have all day long.

Same sex couples will have kids one of three ways. Adopt, one will already have a child from a prior relationship or artificially/donor/surragate. If their state allows marriage and they are married or if their state allows second parent adoption then the non bio parent adopts and both are legal parents no different than straight people. If their state does not allow these options then only the biological parent is responsible which is the same for straight couples. If the husband is not the father guess what it doesn't matter if they have been married 17 years or 7 months he isn't financially responsible. Unless adoption occurs then both are and that is for same sex and opposite sex couples. It still isn't. It just happens so often that people have become numb to it. The expectation is that a marriage will fail as most do and most people now are either an ex or child of an ex. It isn't gays that have caused greater acceptance of divorce it is straight people who divorce more than marry. After all gays have not been able to marry how can they be at fault for divorce? Talk radio steering you wrong again. Same sex couples can make brand new people same as kind and model as straight people. A child can come from a broken home as is the case for both couples but there is no requirement that the child come from a broken home. But let us say that is true or the majority will come from foster care. For someone who says they want to protect children your desire is to keep them in foster care where statistically they will grow up and fail to successfully integrate into society. Foster cares lengthy record on being just a step above being on the streets is far superior to the research showing gay couples for the most part make at least mediocre if not good parents. Why is that? I see it is gay people (the ones who can't have kids) who have flooded the foster care system necessitating the need to broaden its pool of potential parents to handle the increasing number of kids entering into the program. And foster care is preferred over single parent adoptions because one social worker for every 20 - 100 kids who is overworked and underpaid and has kids of their own to worry about is much better for than a single parent adopting 1 child.

If he has just said the first part, I would be cheering him on, but the last part proves that the first part was not an illustration of a morally unacceptable situation but his hope at getting revenge on an abstract collective. If he had left any avenue to interpret his statements as morally sound I would not have condemned them. He however explicitly expressed his desire to violate rights, not merely illustrate that the system allows such violation. As far as I express emotion on this forum, this is nothing new. I do not like the violation of rights and I object to their advocation in all circumstances and from all advocates. If homosexuals are human, I have defended their rights as strenuously as possible. It's reality for us all, except those who are deluded into thinking they chose choicelessness. Perhaps you feel outrage at the subjectivist fallacies that would claim that there is no truth, that the next best thing is the will of the majority. Perhaps you know that there is a moral truth even if you don't know exactly how to describe it, and you know that no matter how many people in the world ignore or deny it; it's there and it validates your actions not by social acceptance but by something more fundamental; something natural to humanity. If that is what you feel, then yes I have felt it; throughout the ages those who have had their rights violated have felt it. It is their value system which produces these emotions, it is recognition of this value system which demands men respect the rights of others. Too many homosexuals desperate for philosophical backing have been drawn to a most despicable current based on non-judgement. It advocates the immunization from the disapproval of others through the suspension of thought (for to think is to judge). This prompts them to ask 'who are you to judge me?' The answer I give is 'a person', but a counter-question cuts deeper into the fallacy. ""Who are you to judge yourself?"" Judgement is not the evil here. Remember that feeling I was just talking about, well there is a philosophy that claims you can know what it's about, where it comes from, claims that not only can you control it but once you understand where emotions come from they are not even forces you need to fight against in a struggle for peace, resolve, or self-control. It claims you can know moral truth not just feel it. That is the philosophical backing homosexuals (as a instance of the category human) need, their emotion is a poor argument, but their is reasoning which can be brought to bear. So do not pretend that the insignificant difference of sexual orientation has somehow magically made you so unique that you now face problems alien the human race that the 'rest of us' need to be made to understand. .... but my rights are up for a vote, and I have been crusading to expose it's injustice.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","01:43 AM","gay-rights-debates","117"

Which I would agree is important, but the information is presented not in a manner that attempts to identify various cause and effect relationships that result in the stats, but to place emphasis on one possible reason which they support. This was one of the more noticable instances of manipulating the facts. The place where your website got it's facts is here Fathers & Families | The Father Factor - Data on the Consequences of Father Absence Which goes under various version of The Fatherhood Initiative. This was part of their report Father Factor in Child Abuse An analysis of child abuse cases in a nationally representative sample of 42 counties found that children from single-parent families are more likely to be victims of physical and sexual abuse than children who live with both biological parents. Compared to their peers living with both parents, children in single parent homes had: a 77% greater risk of being physically abused an 87% greater risk of being harmed by physical neglect a 165% greater risk of experiencing notable physical neglect a 74% greater risk of suffering from emotional neglect an 80% greater risk of suffering serious injury as a result of abuse overall, a 120% greater risk of being endangered by some type of child abuse. Source: Sedlak, Andrea J. and Diane D. Broadhurst. The Third National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect: Final Report. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect. Washington, D.C., September 1996. Things I found most interesting as I read through the information is A) Women are not fit to raise children. From the information provided I don't see how we have achieved the level of civilization we have considering the considerable damage children suffer when left alone with mothers. B) The ability to raise wonder children by men seems to only be possible with their biological children. When rearing someone else's child they have little impact. The only rational conclusion is that the damage a mother causes is immediate and irreversible. C) I noticed two other odd things for the few dozen stats offered almost none came from a source more than once and there were stats with numbers like 165% and 220%. I felt perhaps women were not being fairly represented and maybe the site dedicated to fathers was just expressing themselves passionately, but not accurately. I went to the source they cited for the above stats and it stated the following Family Structure. Children of single parents were at higher risk of physical abuse and of all types of neglect and were overrepresented among seriously injured, moderately injured, and endangered children. Compared with their counterparts living with both parents, children in single-parent families had a 77-percent greater risk of being harmed by physical abuse (using the stringent Harm Standard) and a 63-percent greater risk of experiencing any countable physical abuse (using the Endangerment Standard); an 87-percent greater risk of being harmed by physical neglect and a 165-percent greater risk of experiencing any countable physical neglect; a 74-percent greater risk of being harmed by emotional neglect and a 64-percent greater risk of experiencing any countable emotional neglect; a 220-percent (or more than three times) greater risk of being educationally neglected; an approximately 80-percent greater risk of suffering serious injury or harm from abuse or neglect; an approximately 90-percent greater risk of receiving moderate injury or harm as a result of child maltreatment; and a 120-percent (or more than two times) greater risk of being endangered by some type of child abuse or neglect. Among children in single-parent households, those living with only their fathers were approximately one and two-thirds times more likely to be physically abused than those living with only their mothers. Although parents are not necessarily, nor even most frequently, the perpetrators of maltreatment, the relationship between parent structure and maltreatment incidence is understandable, considering the added responsibilities and stresses of single-parenting together with the likelihood that surrounding social and practical support may be inadequate. Family Size. The incidence of maltreatment was related to the number of dependent children in the family, especially in the categories of physical and educational neglect. For educational neglect, and for physical neglect according to the Harm Standard, the pattern was nonlinear: the incidence rates were highest for children in the largest families (those with four or more children), intermediate for ""only"" children, and lowest for children in families with two to three children. Children in the largest families were almost three times more likely to be educationally neglected, and nearly two and two-fifths times more likely to be physically neglected under the Harm Standard, compared to children in families with two or three children. Under the Endangerment Standard, the pattern was one of increasing incidence of physical neglect with greater numbers of children. Children in the largest families were physically neglected at nearly three times the rate of those who came from ""only"" child families. Additional children in a household mean additional tasks and responsibilities, so it is understandable why incidence rates of child abuse and neglect may be higher when there are more children. Accounting for why ""only"" children have higher rates of educational neglect and of physical neglect under the Harm Standard than children in families with two or three children requires a different explanation. One possibility is that there may be too many expectations focused on ""only"" children, whereas expectations (and disappointments) are diffused over multiple children in the larger families. Another possibility is that many ""only"" child households represent the early stages in their families' development, since a number of these families will have additional children, in time. Thus, many ""only"" children are in families with relatively young and inexperienced parents and caretakers. Executive Summary of the Third National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect As you can see they seemed to have left out some rather important details that were not consistent with their purpose. I would also point out that a lot of your stats include not just fatherless homes, but children of no parent homes as well. Foster care stats are horrible especially when they just turn 18 and are on their own. And lastly what does this have to do with same sex marriage? I mean your sort of putting the cart before the horse.

In this case of the street preacher, perhaps the police were being too ""heavy handed"", in applying it. I hope they now will recognize everyone has this basic freedom of expression, to attack abstract others, anywhere. Wait a minute, no one but an anti-gay right-wing Christian would be rude and mundane enough to be out there on the street, bothering people going about their daily business, about the supposed threat gays pose. But in theory, others could do the same thing and against Christians or anyone else.","gansao","433508","Ah Peter Tatchell..he who campaigns for the age of consent to be 14 years old. Yes I know about him and I admire him in many ways but not I that one. He was arrested because he said homosexuality was a crime against the creator..he was arrested for criticising gays. Even Tatchell recognised that . The offence that he was arrested for therefore was trumped up..thank you exposing this.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","03:33 PM","gay-rights-debates","122"
