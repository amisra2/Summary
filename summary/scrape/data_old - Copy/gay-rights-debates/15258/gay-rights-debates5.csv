"06-26-2011","15258",5,"E Mutz","433282","Again missing the irony. Read on kind Sir or Madam. And out comes the race card. Usually this comes out at the end of a losing argument. My post was in response to Matt's earlier stereotyping of religion and basically anyone whose opinion does not agree with his. Using the same tactic as a vehicle to note the paucity of Mattew's methods is NOT a wider statement on homosexuality but a reference to the tried and true methods which Matt invokes in lieu of actual argumentation. Well, let me take that race card and throw it right back at ye: How do you suppose one would be viewed if they suggested a French Revolution solution to African Americans, homosexuals, jews et al? OUTRAGE!!!! Just look at your own indignation at your misinterpretation of my post. You cannot even muster a stifled yawn at Matt's ""revenge fantasy"". Yet Matt is granted a pass for suggesting this peculiar little solution upon those he labels as ""Fundies"", ""Christonazis"" and other such learned labels. You might not have observed these things in your 3 months here. Let me bring you up to speed with Matt. Matt and I have known each other for at least 4 years. In that time he has quite virulently spewed his anti Christian rhetoric whilst openly using names and labels as his sole means of attack. My problem is not with Matt's argument it is the method with which he chooses to ineffectively advance it. Let me make this easy for you. This post and my previous posts have not argued one way or another against homosexual marriage. Rather, they argue against Matt's own tortured logic. He argues for the same actions that he decries in his labeled stereotyped opponents. He lumps people of faith together and then wonders why people do not treat him with individual dignity. Matt is his own argument's worst enemy. I have been telling him for YEARS that he argues against his ends far more effectively than any theoretical ""Christonazi"". He is a caricature who does damage to his own argument. If you would advance the cause of full marriage equality you might do well to point out to Matt how his own brand of invective does not lend support to the ends he seeks to acheive.","Provocateaur","433285","Those African Americans, Jews, and gay people have all dealt with actual, REAL WORLD discrimination. It's not theoretical or satirical, as in the case of alleged trials of the straight white Christian American male. So yes, suggesting further pain be inflicted on the historically disenfranchised groups, through the French Revolution revenge idea, would be quite incensing indeed. The concerns of the white heterosexual Christian American male are of less worry to me. I've had a racial minority male call me a ""cracker"" once because I'm a white male. He then quickly said he was just joking. I would never think of responding with the ""n"" word or some other such word, back, because I'm aware and educated on the history, the experience the group of people have in this society. I respect it. It's not equivalent to any disenfranchisement I may feel by being called ""cracker"". Though, ideally, and in theory, the word cracker shouldn't be used either. I don't know if Matt really believes these things, if he is playing devil's advocate, or is being satirical. Where are any of these ideas against white heterosexual Christian males, being put into force, as they have been with the other groups mentioned(gays jews blacks)? What should we be most focused on?","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","11:55 PM","gay-rights-debates","61"

For example: A man decides to kick his child out along with the childs mother or leaves and leaves them no support. Without having established paternity the woman and child are now homeless. With adoption, a secure home and income must be established before the adoption can take place. Also by redefining marriage the child would not have a right to a legitimate last name or nationality. Ok, possibly biological history doesn't mean any to you, but this is not about beliefs, is it? We are talking about rights. There are two examples.

It's not theoretical or satirical, as in the case of alleged trials of the straight white Christian American male. Why do you presume that Christians are white and male? Matt condemns his opponents as ""Fundies"" and Christonazis."" Since you claim not to know the reasons behind his methods why do make this curious assumption? You also noted: I don't know if Matt really believes these things, if he is playing devil's advocate, or is being satirical. So, you don't condemn Matt's language because you claim to not understand his purpose, yet you evince no such weakness of spleen in claiming my post was tantamount to racism when you did not know my purpose. Will you now retract your earlier rather disgusting suggestion that I was making a cheap and clueless stereotype or will you make an attempt at consistency and similarly renounce Matt's cheap stereotypes?","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","12:30 AM","gay-rights-debates","64"

A Gay Person who has a Partner is not allowed to make decision if their partner suddenly dies, or even allowed Visitation in some cases because they are not considered immediate family. A gay couple who lives together for 40 years and one dies, the survivor has no legal claim to his/her partners estate. That's just a couple of examples.. but there are over 1000 Rights that hetero couples have that Gay couples are being denied because of a unconstitutional Federal Law. I hear Right Wing Fundamentals scream for Equality as long as it benefits them, but they are only for equality if you are not Gay. Marriage was Never defined on a Federal Level because Marriage Laws are States Laws. The Federal Government did not have the Power under the Constitution to define Marriage and to do so in order to discriminate against one group of citizens is wrong no matter how you look at it.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","02:16 AM","gay-rights-debates","67"

"06-27-2011","15258",5,"Provocateaur","433272","How do you know? How many other gays have you talked to about this, and how many have showed this sentiment? The religious right on the other hand, have actually demonstrated their desire to interfere in the civil rights of gays.. I guess ""soon"" could be seen as relative. Non-religious is the fastest growing category, especially among those 29 and under. Statistics on Religion in America Report -- Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life Support for gay rights is on the increase, especially among the youth.. So your prejudiced suspicion of gays, as guilty until proven innocent, tells you. At least we didn't have to pay five bucks to the lady in the tent with the crystal ball, for that prognostication. That's because it's worthless.","gansao","433300","So you are saying that most gays would not use their vote against institutions that condemn homosexuality? Do I need to talk to every homosexual to not to doubt it? Soon IS a relative term.I am surprised you did not realise it. Oh dear..the criticise gay = prejudice BS again. Dont you tire of this ' poor me' argument? I doubt you ever will. A preacher being arrested in the Uk for preaching gay sex is a sin and a pub being picketed and the landlord arrested for ejecting gay men kissing in a bar plus other incidents tells me what I need to know about the subject.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","06:59 AM","gay-rights-debates","69"

The Constitution is Federal, there are some things the Federal Government does not have power over and those are State Issues. Marriage is and always has been a state issue and the federal government did not have the power to intervene on states issues. By defining marriage on a federal level the feds are discriminating against one particular group, which is unconstitutional. If a State puts a definition on marriage that is their Right . If a State decides they don't want to allow Gay Marriage that is their right. On a state level Gay Rights activists have to go through the process of either changing the Law through legislature within their state and or pass Laws that will award them the right to marry. On a Federal Level they have no authority and it is unconstitutional. I don't have a problem against a particular State constitution.. My main beef is with the Federal Government , or those within the Federal Government trampling on the constitution because of their own personal views or religious doctrine. DOMA has already been found unconstitutional by two courts and WILL be repealed once it goes through the process.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","08:23 AM","gay-rights-debates","70"

An adopted child was already denied this right by his/her biological parents, so it would not apply. I have friends that for example are able to research their lineage through martial records. And this is not something that can be obtained through adoption. A child that is adopted has a secure home and income because it must be established before the adoption can take place. But through marriage a birthed child can be garenteed the same secure home and income through child support. marriage is the only pro-child institution that covers all of thease rights. Same sex couples are able to establish their ""rights"" to medical releases through power of attorney. Far as taxes, I don't understand what ""break"" anyone is talking about, married couples who both work actually pay higher taxes than a single person. You may have noticed on your tax forms where it gives the option to file at a lower single rate? This is the ""tax break"".","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","08:25 AM","gay-rights-debates","71"

Most Adoption services seal the birth records to protect people whom have given their children up for adoption . There are adopted kids who were raised in a family with a man and woman who are being "" denied"" that same right. As far as the U.S. goes we did not agree to nor ratify that U.N Convention on children's rights so we're not bound by it's rules. and as far as taxes I'll put it this way, maybe you can understand it... There are things that normal Married couples can do that Legally Gay couples cannot do under Federal Law. With the passage of DOMA the Federal Government does not recognize legally binding Gay marriages from states where Gay Marriage is allowed. In a state such as Massachusetts where Gay Marriage is allowed a gay couple cannot file joint returns or take advantage of certain tax breaks that other married couples can.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","09:01 AM","gay-rights-debates","73"
