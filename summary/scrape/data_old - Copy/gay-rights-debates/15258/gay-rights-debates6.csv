But this preliminary analysis of the GAO report reveals a more complicated story: Most of these legal provisions are not benefits per se , but ways in which married couples are treated differently than unmarried couples or individuals in federal law.""

The Fact remains that Married Hetero Couples are awarded certain rights under the Law that Married Gay Couples are not awarded.

"06-27-2011","15258",6,"None","None","None","hwyangel","433316","Marriage law isn't designed for the private benefit of any person; it's for the benefit of society. When we pass a law, we pass a law because that law will benefit society as a whole. Society as a whole is befitted from the union of a male and a female in ways that are not valid for unions of two persons of the same sex. Society's interest in safe sex, for both physical and emotional health, support heterosexual marriage alone. Only heterosexual unions are capable of procreation. Heterosexual unions provide the optimal environment for nurturing and raising children. Once allowed to be officially married, homosexual couples will more than likely be able to adopt. I do not doubt the pure love that these couples would show a child, and I do not doubt their pure intentions. I do believe in the natural drive toward wanting to have children. Yet, I also know that it has been shown that children who are deprived of the parenting of one gender have a very strong tendency toward emotional and/or psychological problems. These issues will affect their entire life. The most prevalent argument that I hear is that homosexual couples wish to have the rights of being considered family, especially where hospital emergencies and inheritance issues are concerned. I would argue that if they really love each other that much, then they would take the steps necessary to secure those rights, even if they cannot be officially married. The problem of not being able to see each other in the case of a medical emergency is solved by signing the proper papers ahead of time, which would designate the partners as each other next of kin. Legally I could make anyone I wanted my next of kin, thus given the same rights as a family member. If that is not enough to satisfy the inheritance issue also, then I would propose that the couple write a will. Heterosexual couples even generally also go through the process of making a will. I think that it should also be noted that even in the case of a traditional marriage one spouse can fill out a will that would prohibit everything from being left to the other. A husband can just as easily leave everything to his favorite pet as he can to his wife. I have also heard that gay couples wish to have an official ceremony that friends and family may attend. There is no law against arranging such a gathering. People invite friends and family to second weddings all of the time. There is also the argument that scientifically we find that homosexuality is a natural response to overpopulation, and so we should not fight so hard against policies having to do with it. I will quickly agree that the studies are accurate, but also point out that we find that disease and cannibalism are at least equally common responses to the same problem. I am not trying to compare homosexuality to disease or cannibalism in any way. However, I would say that until we stop fighting disease and legalize cannibalism, I see this as an invalid argument to support the gay community. there is the problem of employers being required to provide health insurance for both partners. In some cases this would seem like a good thing, but in reality it would be too large a stress on the institution of family coverage. I also believe that family coverage is largely to support children, which currently most homosexual couples do not have.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","12:57 PM","gay-rights-debates","77"

It has long been a homophobic canard that all gays care about in respect to same-sex marriage is the ""benefits."" We're supposed to be greedy little Uriah Heeps, rubbing our hands in anticipation of some (unspecified) monetary windfall--to come, presumably, exclusively from the pockets of heterosexuals--that will supposedly accrue to us once our institution-destroying goal is achieved. The fact is, and has always been, that all we have ever wanted is equal rights across the board, including obligations and responsibilities... the exact same ones that apply to opposite-sex couples.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","01:20 PM","gay-rights-debates","78"

You whom I'm sure would deny a human being the fundamental and most general form of all rights, liberty; cannot take the high road for something that can't even be demonstrated to be a right! Right to marriage?! There can be no right to marriage, it's an agreement and nobody has a right to the volition of others. All that can be said on this matter is that no one has the right to stop people from interacting volitionally, but as hwyangel has pointed out (he is absolutely correct) no one is. It is a privilege you homosexuals want from the government not a right, and that privilege is on morally unsound footing for those that have it now! Hwyangel is absolutely correct that any official recognition through generalized form and societal recognition through benefits and programs is solely at the discretion of society and what it thinks best. We are all owed only what we are promised.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","04:48 PM","gay-rights-debates","81"

Society benefits from the hoped for elevated position of the individual. How many marriage laws can you name that benefit society before it benefits the individual? Such as? , So if there were no gay people there would be no STD's? Yes we all have in interest in these. I assume your suggesting that gays are more likely to be behind straights with respect to physical and emotional health. You should consider looking up this type of information from credible sources you may be surprised at what you find. While there is limited research available Gays are turning out to be pretty good parents. Why are there so many screwed up children if they have the optimum environment for growing up? If this is the best it gets we are in for bigger problems than gay marriage. Then you should be arguing about banning divorce. Marriage does not insure any of these things. The divorce rate is over 50%, single parent families by choice are on the rise and plenty of messed up people had two parents. As I stated before a POA can be challenged, it can become void in the case of death or incapacitation and it can be ignored. Do we ask that the spouse have a POA for the same scenario? Why not and why should it that way? The same goes for a will. Nest of kin need do nothing if there is no will. A will can easily be challenged by next of kin over boyfriend girlfriend. No you can't He can try, but he will not be successfull. That cat will end up in the pound. Again family has automatic rights that can overcome what you seem to think is a simple fool proof solution. It isn't. You can also celebrate your first birthday every year, but what is the point it wouldn't be real. Please provide evidence of this Without sounding to rude you obviuosly listen to a lot of talk radio. I would suggest you go to some pro same sex marriage websites and just get a look at some the evidence from the other side. Then try and find unbiased sources to confirm what each says.

Some States allow Gay Marriage, Some Don't.. The Federal Government doesn't have the Power to infringe on Marriage or Discriminate based on Sexual Preference, that's where the problem is. If a State doesn't want to allow Gay Marriages fine, the People in that state have spoken for their State. But the Federal Government HAS to apply the Law equally to Every Citizen in Every State, so if they are going to Recognize a Marriage from Arkansas and award that Couple all the Rights and Privileges and Penalties of Marriage then by LAW they should have to recognize Gay Marriages that Are Legally binding in other states.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","07:01 PM","gay-rights-debates","85"

What little research there is shows it would actually slow down the decline slightly. All you have done is made statements about how marriage and children will suffer because of same sex marriage based on things you have heard about. I have asked you to provide evidence to support these claims and you come back with we will just have to disagree. So I guess we will. I would still ask that you get some information from places that are both for and against and then confirm the position of each from credible sources then make up your mind and if you still believe the same things the same way we can happily disagree again.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","08:28 PM","gay-rights-debates","87"
