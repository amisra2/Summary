You go down to the court house and have a civil ceremony. Marriage has absolutely nothing to do with children. If two 100 year old heteros, who have no intention of and will not be breeding, can get a civil marriage license then there is no reason to deny a civil marriage license to two men or two women.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","07:22 AM","gay-rights-debates","121"
"06-30-2011","15258",9,"Provocateaur","433485","Why don't you talk to a prominent gay activist(possibly the most prominent) in the UK, who defended the street preacher--- Charges Dropped Against Anti-Gay U.K. Street Preacher :: EDGE Boston Notice how the gay officer wasn't the one who made the arrest. Also, was the preacher charged for his anti-gay speech, or under the anti-hooliganism law, since the police said he was being loud? Although he said he wasn't loud. I think anyone who goes out there on the street, speaking out against any group or political issue, runs the risk of bothering people going about their daily business. They have to be very careful, even for their own safety. For all we know, the ones who complained were not gay. Yes, ""criticizing"" gays as you call it, is anti-gay, when you don't have a logical argument. You're the one playing a false victim. As with the bar situation, and the government-funded adoption agency in Illinois, not being allowed to discriminate, does not make you a victim. The laws are supposed to protect, and apply to everyone equally, yes, including gay people. Laws are sometimes put to the test. In this case of the street preacher, perhaps the police were being too ""heavy handed"", in applying it. I hope they now will recognize everyone has this basic freedom of expression, to attack abstract others, anywhere. Wait a minute, no one but an anti-gay right-wing Christian would be rude and mundane enough to be out there on the street, bothering people going about their daily business, about the supposed threat gays pose. But in theory, others could do the same thing and against Christians or anyone else.","gansao","433508","Ah Peter Tatchell..he who campaigns for the age of consent to be 14 years old. Yes I know about him and I admire him in many ways but not I that one. He was arrested because he said homosexuality was a crime against the creator..he was arrested for criticising gays. Even Tatchell recognised that . The offence that he was arrested for therefore was trumped up..thank you exposing this.","i-now-support-full-marriage-equality","03:33 PM","gay-rights-debates","122"
