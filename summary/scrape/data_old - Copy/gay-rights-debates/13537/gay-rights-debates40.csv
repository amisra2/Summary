"05-24-2010","13537",40,"Addison48","403032","Ok so you keep saying we should take into consideration what marriage is culturally and marriage is culturally about love but for some reason love shouldnt be a part of the discussion for same sex marriage. Doesnt make sense to me.","Sigma","403042","I'm not sure how to make it clearer. When you talk about rights or the legal side of marriage, love is not part of that. When you talk about the cultural significance or perception of marriage, love is a part of that.

"05-24-2010","13537",40,"Addison48","403033","Might have a case? I have shown how it is exactly the same as the ban on interracial marriage when gender is the variable. What more do you need? I think YOU should present to ME a case on why I shouldnt be able to marry someone I love. And heterosexual couples ability to reproduce is not a reason to deny me the right to form a contract with a person who I want to as long as the person I am signing the contract with can legally consent to signing that contract. Neither is the cultural reasons for marriage. Both of those are not good enough to deny me the right to sign that contract with who I wish.","Sigma","403043","Except we are not having a discussion on the differences between men and women. We are having a discussion on the differences between heterosexual and homosexual people. I don't know if you have a case because we aren't discussing that issue :P You're right. Reproduction has nothing to do with being part of a legal contract. You're wrong. Reproduction is a part of the historical and cultural meaning of marriage. You don't have the right to sign a contract with whomever you wish. Therefore you are not denied that right.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","08:38 PM","gay-rights-debates","588"
"05-24-2010","13537",40,"Sigma","403040","And the article found exactly what I told you. To be sure, males can be expected to be at least minimally discriminating, because there may be costs associated with too much sexual gallivanting: A careless Lothario might be attacked, for example, by an outraged ""husband."" Or a philanderer might be cuckolded by other males having similar designs on his mate, unavoidably left unguarded. The more investment that must be put into the offspring, the more that sexual discrimination will be selected for. The female would prefer males who will invest in her offspring rather than one that would have an indiscriminate sexual appetite. A male, in turn, would want a faithful female that will have his offspring and no one elses. Therefore those traits would be selected for over evolutionary time. Adultery is an opportunistic strategy, similar in that way to rape. It certainly exists, but it is not the best strategy as the rule. I find it strange that your article asks this question: Certainly, the intense sexual jealousy and competitiveness among human beings strongly suggest that adultery has a long history in our species. (Why would our biology have outfitted us with such traits if utter fidelity were the rule?) The opposite is actually the case. Why would biology outfit us with sexual jealousy if multiple sexual partners were the best strategy? The conclusion does not fit. This is not adultery, though. How would you quantify how easy or hard it is? I gave you a relative statement. It would be easier to ban homosexual relationships than heterosexual relationships. And there better be a damn good reason to change marriage. I certainly won't stop you from loving whomever you want, but I don't see that as a good reason to change something that is meaningful to a great many people. I said: Imo, ignoring the historical and cultural relevence that heterosxuality has had on not only in the context of marriage but on our species as a whole, since reproduction is the sole reason we exist today, smacks of disrespect. Nowhere did I mention race. Reproduction can occur across races.","Addison48","403044","But that is not monogamy. Why am I even arguing this? It doesnt matter when it comes down to if same sex marriage should be legalized or not. But yes the jealously thing does certainly work. Why would jealously have developed if we were faithful? There would be no need for it. There are also individuals who commit adultery. But again this doesnt have anything to do with same sex marriage so I am no longer going to argue it. Again how easy it would be to ban heterosexual marriage or same sex marriage has nothing to do with the legality of same sex marriage. So we shouldnt allow someone to get married who values marriage because other people value marriage? Doesnt make sense. And how would changing marriage to include same sex couples hurt your marriage or make your marriage any less meaningful? It wouldnt. And I never claimed that you are stopping me from loving who I want but you certainly are stopping me from marrying someone I love. I am not saying heterosexuality isnt important and I am not saying heterosexuality isnt the reason we are here today. Nor am I somehow disrespecting heterosexuals. However wouldnt you think by not allowing same sex couples to marry that you are disrespecting homosexuals? Your right you never mentioned race. But I was making a point. Perceptions change. Homosexuals are valid couples. There is no reason they arnt.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","08:54 PM","gay-rights-debates","589"

Sexual jealousy has a point in encouraging monogamy, but has no reason to exist if, for example, harems were the norm. The article's conclusion did not follow. If you want to drop that discussion, it's fine with me. Well, it would completely change the meaning of marriage, certainly. To change marriage to contain non-heterosexual relationships would be to deny that heterosexuality has any cultural or historic meaning in the context of marriage. Stripped of this meaning, marriage is simply a contract between two people to share assets. It is not about love or family, in that case. I'd hazard that there are those who don't want to see that happen because they view heterosexual attraction as having significance that homosexual relationships do not. I'd also hazard that gay-right proponents want that to happen, because they want homosexual relationships to be seen as equal in importance in every way. To do that gay-right proponents have to trivialize anything that would seem to make heterosexuality as significant, including the formalized relationship in the form of marriage. If marriage has no meaning then there is no reason to exclude homosexual relationships, the thinking goes. Given the importance heterosexuality has, it doesn't make a lot of sense to disregard a custom that formalized heterosexual unions. Then you're changing the goal posts :P My sole point is that heterosexual people have the same rights as homosexual people. Certainly it is a reason. The question is whether that is a good enough reason. Imo, it seems obvious that it is a good enough reason to some people. Whether they give consent is irrelevent The rules say you cannot marry someone already married, a sibling, an animal or a minor. Or someone of the same gender. Or a host of other things. It doesn't matter whether they give consent.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","06:22 AM","gay-rights-debates","591"

A heterosexual is legally allowed to marry the person they love, and a homosexual cannot. Why is this so difficult for you? Alright, quit beating around the bush.

Heterosexuals can marry for love, they can marry for political reasons, they can marry for the benefits, they can marry for whatever reason under the sun.

Seeing ""your unborn children in her eyes"", for example, is a culturally valid reason to get married, but it certainly is not one of the legal requirements. I realize that homosexuals are not attracted to members of the opposite sex and so they don't want to get married. However , that is not the same thing as being legally barred from marriage. Since we're talking about what rights heterosexual people have versus what rights homosexual people have, the only logical conclusion is that both groups have the same rights since marrying whomever you love is not a right.
