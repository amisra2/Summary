"11-25-2009","13537",20,"Archangel","380062","The sad thing once again jason, is that you and Jake just fail to comprehend the seriousness of the spiritual situation you are in. And you prove that sentiment by thinking that anything about your lifestyle is funny in any way to anyone . So NO jason, from the saints at the pearly gates to Chuck Smith, to me, nobody is laughing at the reality of the perverted and sick sexual proclivities which define the unnatural practices which have been conceived of and engaged in by your ilk.","jazyjason","380090","Can't you tell sarcasm when you see it or are you really that blind? Funny thing is but I wasn't the one making jokes about gerbils being inserted into someones rectum YOU WERE . So do not sit here and once again spew the same ranting and raving about ""lifestyle"" and ""ilk"" like the thousands of other times before... And here we go again the proverbial merry go round. Sex sex sex sex sex.... Gee Archie is that all you think about when it comes to people? I mean honestly can;t you think of a better argument to come up with? No one cares what other people do in the bedroom simply because it is private! You don't define your next door neighbor based upon what he does in the bedroom, or your mailman or the guy who works in the toll booth. Simply put Americans could care less what other people do behind closed doors. And what you do behind closed doors does not define you as a person! If it did people would probably be calling you ""stale""..... Now there's a joke Archie laugh it up...","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","03:06 AM","gay-rights-debates","286"

And aren't they more of a way to get high rather than for sexual pleasure?","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","03:54 PM","gay-rights-debates","291"
