The only word needed to describe what your lifestyle and the practices which define it is UNNATURAL. PERIOD!!","QuackAttack1887","378696","The only way to describe your lifestyle is small minded, unhappy, way too spitiual and dead in fifty years, as will your religion if you're an example of a good christian man. Whatever happened to 'love thy neighbor'?","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","05:43 AM","gay-rights-debates","181"
"11-17-2009","13537",13,"jazyjason","378685","What? Meaningless and physical? Shows how much YOU know about a relationship between two people at all! I would LOVE for you to analyze some of the monogamous relationships of some gay couples that have lasted over 30 years and tell me that it is physical and meaningless. You have no idea whatsoever what you are talking about and frankly, it's just blatant stupidity laced in bigotry. MY relationship is not all physical and certainly is not meaningless. I would love for someone to judge any relationship your in and see how you feel about it...","gayhumanist","378699","You completely misunderstood. Please read back in the thread and forward to see context. I said the insecure homophobics and closeted individuals see it that way, certainly not myself. Secure and happy heterosexuals have no trouble acknowledging the love in gay relationships.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","06:08 AM","gay-rights-debates","182"

So in your opinion, someone who maintains a spiritual and moral outlook about life and actually holds to a traditional value system which has existed for thousands of years is the problem with our world today? On what do you base that assumption since it is only since adopting your liberal pop culture attitudes that we have these social problems at every level of our modern society? First you liars and immoral hypocrites force your perversions on my society and then you blame me for being the problem when I refuse to accept the negative results of the Godless society you are attempting to create in your secular humanist image. It makes no sense at all, but then again, your type of self destructive thinking never has. Once again my refugee friend from TCC, the only philosophy which will be dead in 50 years will be secular humanism and its proponents as you all run to destruction with your fingers in your ears. And once again, it is only your lack of spiritual insight which prevents you from appreciating that it is my rejection of the sins which stand against Gods Holy Word which is the greatest act of love I can show your ilk since I am sharing soul saving eternal truths with you. Remember it says to love the sinner but hate the sin? How else do I show I love you if I don't share the simple truths in the gospels with you? What is really so sad is that you interpret that hard and blunt truth we share as hate speech rather than the expression of love which is represents.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","06:31 AM","gay-rights-debates","184"
"11-17-2009","13537",13,"gayhumanist","378701","Not bogus at all. That's how SOME straight men, and closeted men operate. They won't or can't see the humanity in gay relationships. It's easier to have a sexual encounter with no feelings for closeted people. They can put that away in a compartment, and carry on with their straight facade. Is unnatural wrong? Isn't a virgin birth unnatural? How about a resurrection? Is the computer you're using as you read this, unnatural? Homosexuality isn't unnatural. Those homosexual ""practices"" have come naturally to many humans, without a single formal lesson.","Archangel","378703","I see the humanity in homosexuals; the ""secular humanist"" world view which lacks any and all spiritual insight as they live according to fleshly desires which ignore and deny any deeper spiritual awareness at all. And they not only ignore these spiritual elements of humanity which we believers promote, but they condemn them as unnecessary and backwards aspects of who we are as human beings. Is the virgin birth immoral? How about the resurrection? Is the computer you're using as you read this an immoral machine which by its very existence is destructive to everyone who uses it? The answer to all of these questions is an absolute NO!!! The virgin birth brought salvation to the world and the resurrection finalized our victory over death through Messiah. And since God is the designer of life then it is very presumptuous, and even blasphemous to call anything He did unnatural. As for the computer, an invention of modern technology being called unnatural, it just confirms the lengths you will go to in order to justify that which is nothing more than satisfying fleshly lusts but serves no positive human benefit as heterosexual sex does by propagating the continuation of the human race.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","06:54 AM","gay-rights-debates","185"

When have I jumped to assumptions with you before? Not on this forum. You're either lying or thinking of the other forum which has since become a waste land of a forum where everyone agrees with each other. Really, so as long as we keep our mouths shut, never challenge the secular humanist world view of if it feels good, then do it, and accept your corrupted value systems as right and normal then you wont have any issues at all with us, right? But if we dare to actually hold to spiritual principles which conflict with your secular humanist world view, then we are, to quote you: small minded, unhappy, way too spitiual and dead in fifty years, as will my religion if I'm an example of a good christian man.

We could say that incest and pedophilia are natural. Although other species are not incestuous and don't have anything comparable to pedophilia. There is much documented same-sex sex, in many species, however. I was speaking to Archangel's assertion that homoesexuality is not natural and his claim that was the only way to describe it.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","07:01 PM","gay-rights-debates","193"
