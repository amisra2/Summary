"11-17-2009","13537",14,"gayhumanist","378866","There's a lack of moral character in those who vote away the rights of others, like in Prop. H8. Yes, Americans are paranoid about homosexuality, you don't have to convince me of that. Some straight men would brag about scoring with a sexy woman in a public place but not getting caught. You're trying to change the subject, Larry Craig, er...JP Sartre. Anyway, I'm not the one in the closet that's for sure. Here's what you originally said: http://www.4forums.com/political/gay...rdered-10.html So I'm expected to actually believe that you, JP, Mr. Anti-Gay Conservative are having this type of intimate relationship with gay men, who feel comfortable opening up like this with someone like you. JP is of course, merely curious in seeking that information as to where the glory holes can be found. Just as Pastor Ted Haggard claimed he never intended to use the meth he sought out. There's only one reason JP would be in this fruit loop. He knows gay people alright, extremely well. Oh defensively mock away at gay men. You just prove my point above.","JPSartre12","378885","I don't see any lack of moral character in people exercising their Constitutional Rights to deny the sanctity of marriage to immoral associations by not allowing the definition of marriage to be bastardized. I've been married, faithfully, for over 31 years. What's the longest exclusive relationship you're had, a month. I guess you missed the term ""a high % of heterosexual males"" in my statement. And you assumed that my knowledge of glory holes came from chatting with gays as opposed to firsthand observations and other means. No, I didn't mock ""gay men"", I mocked you.

"11-18-2009","13537",14,"gayhumanist","378870","Where do you get ""whining""? We could say that incest and pedophilia are natural. Although other species are not incestuous and don't have anything comparable to pedophilia. There is much documented same-sex sex, in many species, however. I was speaking to Archangel's assertion that homoesexuality is not natural and his claim that was the only way to describe it.","gansao","378930","You could say that incest and pedophilia were natural but it would knock the bottom out of your campaign for ' gay marriage' wouldnt it?","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","05:25 AM","gay-rights-debates","199"
"11-18-2009","13537",14,"gayhumanist","378701","Not bogus at all. Is unnatural wrong? Isn't a virgin birth unnatural? How about a resurrection? Is the computer you're using as you read this, unnatural? Homosexuality isn't unnatural. Those homosexual ""practices"" have come naturally to many humans, without a single formal lesson.","gansao","378931","The computer is one of mans greatest achievements unnatural or not. The virgin birth of Jesus and the resurrection were miracles. Using these as examples to excuse perverted sex is a perversion in itself.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","05:54 AM","gay-rights-debates","200"

"11-18-2009","13537",14,"gayhumanist","379007","You have a gay man, Allan Turing to thank for it.. You They are SUPERNATURAL as is God. As in not natural... I'm not trying to excuse anything. Archangel was making the argument that it's unnatural. I was responding to that. You are deliberately trying to twist what I wrote, and not doing a good job of it. I don't presuppose two men having sex is a perversion, so I've no need to excuse it. That's your issue.","gansao","379011","Turing was a mathematician ,he had no part in building a computer. He was part of the team in bletchley park and had a large part in decoding the enigma machine but he didnt invent the computer..he refined the maths. but incomparable to deviant sex which is abominable Two men having sex is by definition a perversion and incomparable to anything noble. That is your issue.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","02:21 PM","gay-rights-debates","205"

There is artificial insemination. To survive and to thrive, offspring require a great deal of care which go beyond the couple's ability to naturally create more bodies and their sex acts.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","05:17 PM","gay-rights-debates","206"

"11-19-2009","13537",14,"gayhumanist","379072","Without Turing's revolutionary ideas there wouldn't be computers--. As I said, the issue was what is natural. It is no doubt labelled ""abominable"" by certain religions. An entirely religious argument doesn't involve reason. --. Ha. I didn't say any sex act is ""noble""! I'm just not as obsessed with sex acts that allegedly don't concern me like some people. I can't seem to find that definiton of sex between men, except in the unreasoned nonsense of homophobic people.","gansao","379241","Dont be ridiculous. Kraft cheese and merkins are not ' natural' why didnt you compare homosexuality to those? What seperates homosexuals and normal people is deviant sex...","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","02:58 PM","gay-rights-debates","209"
"11-19-2009","13537",14,"None","None","None","gansao","379243","Turing had a brilliant mind. He invisaged things that others did not but so did Archimedes but the pinnacle of science and engineering is not still the chariot is it? Turing was treated terribly after the war. It was a disgrace. Actually Turing was no engineer but the engineer that worked with Turing used his own money to build another computer from scratch but was thwarted at every turn by the government.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","03:05 PM","gay-rights-debates","210"
