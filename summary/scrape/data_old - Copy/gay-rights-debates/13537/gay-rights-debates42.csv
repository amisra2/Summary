(Heterosexuals included.) So the point about 'marrying for love' is sorta, well, irrelevant.","Shooterandproud","403456","I get what you're saying, but I don't see how it can be used to justify barring a whole class of people from marriage.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","01:43 PM","gay-rights-debates","616"
"05-30-2010","13537",42,"Sigma","403436","Traditionally it is one of them, certainly. However, traditionally, having children (meaning: heterosexual relationships) is also the reason for marriage, in addition to love. The two are entwined in the ""societal view"", if you will, of marriage. Keep in mind that you're trying to justify a change to a custom using a traditional meaning of that custom (love), when the traditional meaning (having biological children) specifically excludes homosexuals. It is a contradictory argument. It is hard to argue that homosexual people are denied any rights when they have the very same rights that heterosexual people have. You want to change the laws to marry whom you love, but marrying whom you love is not a right for anyone . That is not to say the laws shouldn't change, only that you haven't a right to those changes.","Shooterandproud","403459","There's always adoption. Claiming that something is right or shouldnt be changed because it is tradition is actually a fallacy. Ask yourself this. Since these laws came into effect, how many homosexuals have married and how many heterosexuals have married? It's similar to de facto segregation in the south during the mid 1900s. Legally, blacks could vote, but because of poll taxes and impossible ""literacy tests"", they couldn't. What ""rights"" they have legally is irrelevant if in reality they are being discriminated against.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","01:55 PM","gay-rights-debates","617"

The fact that it is tradition has no bearing on whether something should be changed or not. It has got nothing to do with the validity of anyone's argument. Fallacy: Appeal to Traditioin They can have kids. No, the intention of poll taxes and literacy tests was to prevent blacks from voting. But when presented with the fact that blacks were being discriminated against, southerners pointed to the fact that there was no discrimination, because the constitution said blacks can vote. The same applies here. The laws say gays can marry, yet they aren't because there are laws preventing them from marrying the person they want. Like I said before, it doesn't matter if the law explicitly states either ""homosexuals cannot marry"" or ""homosexual marriages are not permitted"", the end result is the same: discrimination.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","06:06 PM","gay-rights-debates","619"

I am not attaching a ""good"" or ""bad"" value to the tradition, therefore I do not fall under the fallacy. I am saying that the tradition is meaningful to a great many people, therefore resisting a change to that tradition is a valid position to take. I would have to say ""It should stay this way because it's traditional"" instead of saying ""It's meaningful to many people so it's reasonable to want to keep it this way"". I am not saying that view is right or wrong, but instead that it is a valid view to have. No, they can't. They can adopt. It is not the same thing, from a traditional view of marriage. Your analogy is flawed. It would be analogous if the laws allowed homosexual marriage, yet no one would actually perform them in the government. Then the two situations would be similar, where the law allows a thing but discrimination stops it. Here, the law does not recognize homosexual unions in the first place.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","06:21 PM","gay-rights-debates","620"

In order to keep a tradition, you must first prove that it is good. Lets say you're right. You're saying the squeamishness of some people trumps the utter misery this will cause within a whole class of people? Marriage is extremely important to the security of a family, and unless there is direct physical or psychological harm taking place to non-gays, the discomfort of others shouldn't hold weight unless they have some validity behind them. Lets look at the results of both legalizing and outlawing gay marriage. If gay marriages were legalized, some people would be uncomfortable. But so what? They can deal with it. People were uncomfortable when blacks and whites were allowed to marry too. But, when gay marriage is outlawed, families are shattered and financial insecurity is taken away by the government. Personally, I'd rather have the former. The stakes are simply too high. People need to learn to deal with their discomfort. So what. They're just as much the legal children of a couple as biological children. That too, but you have yet to prove to me how it matters. Homosexuals are not marrying, and it's not by choice. The end result is exactly the same . Nothing else should matter. If inequality persists then it doesn't matter if gays technically have the same legal rights.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","06:56 PM","gay-rights-debates","621"

I don't know if changing the situation would be good or bad and neither do you. There would be changes, one of them being that a meaningful tradition would be rendered irrelevent. I don't know if that is good or bad. I can say that apparently a great many people don't want that to happen. I can also say they have a valid point to make. Since I have said nothing of the sort (sqeamishness?) I cannot really respond to this. However, the concept of homosexual marriage is a very recent one so the claim of sudden and utter misery does not resonate with me, nor would the claim of utter misery since the beginning of time. No. I don't usually subscribe the the utilitarian viewpoint where an action is moral or immoral based upon the utility (happiness vs unhappiness) gained or lost from the situation. That sort of view can, too often, justify atrocities if it benefits the majority of people. Besides, I cannot judge whose unhappiness is more worthy of protection. Yes, but so what? The traditional view of marriage doesn't necessarily conform to the legal definition. The traditional view of marriage includes sharing children between the couple, meaning reproduction. This view necessarily does not include homosexual relationships. It matters a heck of a lot if homosexual people have the same rights as heterosexual people. You cannot show that discrimination prevents the exercising of rights that homosexual people have because no one has the rights you claim are being withheld. The entire position of the ""gay rights"" position rests on empty air.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","07:07 PM","gay-rights-debates","622"

The purpose of a debate forum is to express your opinion. Where did I use the word ""sudden""? Homosexuals have been utterly miserable due to persecution of this sort for thousands of years. Isn't this hypocritical? Because sacrificing the happiness of the few for the comfort of the many is exactly what you're doing. Correct me If I'm wrong, but am I not the one arguing for the protection of the minority from mob rule? What do the means in which the children come about matter. Homosexual couples can have children. They can't produce them, but they can have them. Therefore your argument is moot. Yes, I can. Homosexual people are prevented from marrying the ones they love by the government, heterosexuals are not. This isn't a hard concept. The fact that love is not in the legal definition of marriage is irrelevant. The opposition rests on something even flimsier. You claim that homosexuals have the same rights as heterosexuals because homosexuals can marry women is totally preposterous. It is not in anyone's nature to marry someone they're not sexually attracted to, despite the fact that there are exceptions (but there are exceptions to everything). Love is the core of marriage, and if you cannot marry the one you love, you cannot marry. I'm still unclear of your position. You're saying that because homosexual men can marry heterosexual women (and vice versa), everything is dandy and there are no problems?","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","08:06 PM","gay-rights-debates","623"

You have defeated your own utilitarian argument, though, since, as you point out, the happiness of the majority of people are squarely against your position. However, I don't generally like utilitarian arguments for the reasons I mentioned. Reproduction is part of the traditional view of marriage. Starting a family that shares the traits of both parents and born within the bonds of matrimony is part of the traditional view of marriage. Homosexual relationships necessarily are not included within the traditional view of marriage. It is very relevent, because it means that marrying whom you love is not a right. Therefore marrying whom you love is not a right that is being denied to homosexual people. Love and reproduction are the core of the traditional view of marriage, yes. However, you have not shown that marrying whomever you love is a right and so I cannot accept that right exists. No. My entire conclusion is that homosexual people and heterosexual people have the same rights.
