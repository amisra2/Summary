Why would someone that considers marriage a sarcament go down to city hall to have it turned into a civil union?","Matthew S","377005","And you hit the nail on the head with this one. The US government does not consider marriage to be a sarcament. You are mixing religion and government. A marriage liscense is a secular document that is a contract between the state and the the couple, it has nothing to do with religion. You have said you favor civil unions for gay people and I am saying that if you think that civil unions are equal to marriage just a different name then you go turn in your liscense in favor of a civil union. However you know that they aren't so you will never do it, even if it were possible.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","06:29 AM","gay-rights-debates","31"

Uncle Sam can't establish a religion or give special consideration to one religion; voters can do whatever they please and I choose to not want same sex marriage included under the definition of marriage. As for civil unions, I think your time would be better spent trying to fill the gaps in it instead of trying to scrap the current definition of marriage.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","08:41 AM","gay-rights-debates","32"
"11-06-2009","13537",3,"Archangel","376926","So does homosexuality. Their life expectancy is far shorter than heteros just as their actual numbers are far less than declared. Here is some evidence of that. An excerpt: http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2007_doc...lFootprint.pdf And here: 1.4% of Adults Homosexual? (the largest random sex survey ever conducted says yes) Canada","jitobear","377027","First of all, to convince me of that you will to find real scientific evidence. Anything coming from Cameron is suspect for reasons already pointed out; he has kicked been out of the legitimate scientific community, gotten in trouble judges and had NUMEROUS scientists publicly condemn him for misuse of their research. Secondly even if this were true, and their lifespans were shorter, that does not legitimize anti-gay legislation or discrimination. What I am saying is that such measures from people like you hurt them. Their being gay does not hurt you. You are in the wrong as you are on the end that is inflicting damage.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","09:07 AM","gay-rights-debates","33"

You're given indisputable proof that a small portion of the population has contracted a disease linked directly to their lifestyle that reduces their lifespan by 20 years. What do you do: a.

If you are going to segue into HIV, that virus will infect ANYONE and just being gay does not put you at greater risk. Promsicuity and IV drug usage do - but neither of those behaviors are the exclusive realm of homosexuals.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","11:11 AM","gay-rights-debates","35"

It's not the government's place to intervene, nor to promote one lifestyle over another. It should be a free market type of approach, no? If there is a market for McDonald's hamburgers, the government shouldn't be in the business of promoting carrot sticks, and deciding the burgers won't get equal time.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","04:07 PM","gay-rights-debates","37"
