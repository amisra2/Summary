We do if we value the historical, cultural and, heck, evolutionary meaning of marriage, since part of the theme has been people who are in love having children. That meaning is not legally enforcable, of course, but I think it is part of why most people view marriage as ""meaningful"". Perhaps they should be. To be honest, I don't have much issue with polygamy, incest or bestiality. Pedophilia is a very unfortunate orientation to have since they can never (and should never) be with the object of their desire. However, I also have no problem with the rules that don't legally recognize those relationships. If you're putting a line somewhere the place it currently is makes a lot of sense. That isn't a fair question: the rights in the situation are not a matter of opinion. I don't know the answer and, if the answer is important, I'm not going to pull an answer out of my XXX. Unfair and unequal are not the same thing.","Addison48","403011","Legally. Should same sex marriage legal. No you certainly didnt. The ban on interracial marriage made it so black people couldnt get married to white people while white people could and white people couldnt marry black people but could marry other white people and the ban on same sex marriage makes it so that women can marry a man while a man cannot and a man can marry a woman but a woman cannot. See the same thing. Yeah pedophilia and bestiality are wrong because the person/animal involved cannot legally give consent. I find it to be a fair question. Because if you are saying that homosexual couples are equal to heterosexual couples in terms of marriage right now then you have to concede that back when interracial couples were unable to marry that interracial couples and non interracial couples were equal.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","06:28 PM","gay-rights-debates","571"

"05-24-2010","13537",39,"Sigma","402999","I don't think that's true, any more than a totalitarian government would be easier. The government, as formulated by the Constitution at least, fits our nature pretty well. A government that goes against our nature would constantly run the risk of revolution. That is not easier. More to the point: Forming pair-bonds for mating is part of our nature. As your court case points out, marriage is fundamental. Going against that nature would be more trouble than going with it. Would it bother you if ultimately I am a selfish person? I don't intend to trivialize anything. However, why should I support homosexual marriage? If there is no reason, then it is change for the sake of change. Actually, JWilliam brought it up here . My response was that primaries work in a similar way to his analogy.","Addison48","403017","So why is it easy to keep gay people from getting married but hard to keep heterosexuals from getting married? Plus we dont deny people rights or benefits because it is to hard. Screwing everything in site is also part of our nature. However that isnt exactly encouraged in society nowadays. It bothers me if you are so selfish that you dont want something to happen that doesnt impact you whatsoever and would mean so much to so many people in this country. If heterosexual couples were not allowed to get married I would support heterosexual marriage becoming legal. The only thing you really have to do to support gay marriage is not vote against it if it ever comes down to it and if someone asks you about your feelings on the issue say you think it should be legal.

Indiscriminate sexual appetites would be selected against by evolution. If you think about it the answer should be easy. Heterosexuality represents the vast majority of all people. That would be a bit harder to restrict than, what, 10% of the population that is homosexual? I'm not entirely sure of percentage. We don't allow or deny rights because it's hard or easy but, as I've shown, homosexuals are not denied any rights. You could argue that they are denied acceptance, though I'm really not against it. I'm just not really for it either. I haven't been convinced it's a good idea and, imo, that's because any real national discussion can't take place as long as gay-rights proponents insist they are denied rights because they are homosexual. It could be that it is morally correct to allow homosexual marriage. I don't know if we'll ever know. There is also reason to deny it. As I've mentioned, heterosexual relationships are percieved as somehow more valid or as having a purpose that homosexual relationships lack. Imo, ignoring the historical and cultural relevence that heterosxuality has had on not only in the context of marriage but on our species as a whole , since reproduction is the sole reason we exist today, smacks of disrespect. I think that view has some merit. Of course, you'll reply ""we don't deny rights on this basis"" and then I reply ""it isn't about rights, it's about perception"" etc etc and then we don't actually discuss the issue at all :P","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","07:08 PM","gay-rights-debates","579"

Another way of putting it: We are (somewhat) biologically primed to form mateships, but at the same time, adultery is no stranger in our evolutionary past. So we arnt exactly set up for monogamy. Even in todays society we have sex multiple times before we finally settle down and get married. Well that 10% is certainly putting up a hell of a fight and have succeeded in some cases. So it certainly isnt easy to ban same sex marriages. What is keeping you from realizing its a good idea? What could be bad about it period? I have not found one reason so far to ban same sex marriage period. So far by not allowing same sex marriage I am not allowed to marry someone I love. And there had better be a damned good reason why I cant marry someone I love. You know back in the day interracial marriages were perceived to be less valid then non interracial marriages. Hell I find it crazy to even think I should have to prove the validity of my relationship to someone.

To be sure, males can be expected to be at least minimally discriminating, because there may be costs associated with too much sexual gallivanting: A careless Lothario might be attacked, for example, by an outraged ""husband."" Or a philanderer might be cuckolded by other males having similar designs on his mate, unavoidably left unguarded. The more investment that must be put into the offspring, the more that sexual discrimination will be selected for. The female would prefer males who will invest in her offspring rather than one that would have an indiscriminate sexual appetite. A male, in turn, would want a faithful female that will have his offspring and no one elses. Therefore those traits would be selected for over evolutionary time. Adultery is an opportunistic strategy, similar in that way to rape. It certainly exists, but it is not the best strategy as the rule. I find it strange that your article asks this question: Certainly, the intense sexual jealousy and competitiveness among human beings strongly suggest that adultery has a long history in our species. (Why would our biology have outfitted us with such traits if utter fidelity were the rule?) The opposite is actually the case. Why would biology outfit us with sexual jealousy if multiple sexual partners were the best strategy? I'm afraid his conclusion does not fit. This is not adultery, though. How would you quantify how easy or hard it is? I gave you a relative statement. It would be easier to ban homosexual relationships than heterosexual relationships. And there better be a damn good reason to change marriage. I certainly won't stop you from loving whomever you want, but I don't see that as a good reason to change something that is meaningful to a great many people. I said: Imo, ignoring the historical and cultural relevence that heterosxuality has had on not only in the context of marriage but on our species as a whole, since reproduction is the sole reason we exist today, smacks of disrespect. Nowhere did I mention race. Reproduction can occur across races.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","08:33 PM","gay-rights-debates","585"
