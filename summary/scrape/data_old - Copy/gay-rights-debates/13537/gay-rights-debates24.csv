"05-03-2010","13537",24,"gansao","400306","Some Christians believe that gay sex is a sin . So do I. I also believe that theft,adultery, violence etc etc is a sin too.but thieves, adulterers and violent people are still allowed to marry. Why shouldnt everyone be allowed to find their own path to hell? IMO gay people should be wheeling out accountants,doctors,engineers,truck drivers and toilet cleaners saying...look we are just like you. This can be done in the media, sport,etc It worked in Britain...IMO","Addison48","400316","How exactly did gay marriage get legalized in Britain?","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","07:18 PM","gay-rights-debates","347"
"05-03-2010","13537",24,"Easyrider","400313","That has absolutely no bearing on gay sex being a sin, which it is. This country has a heritage based in Judeo-Christian principles. Traditional marriage was always ok with God and our founding fathers, and gay marriage never was with either. Sure we do, on occasion. America is 70-80% Christian, and when we vote on issues like gay marriage, we often take our religious beliefs to the ballot box. Which is why gay marriage loses. And if someday there's enough of us to make America into a Christian nation via a Constitutional Amendment, we can do that too (though no one I know is really thinking seriously about doing that). We certainly aren't a secular nation. And unless we want to lose America we need to keep God as our Lord and Protector. Otherwise we'll go down the tubes like so many godless nations before us.","Addison48","400317","And homosexuality being a sin has no bearing on the laws of this country. See above. We certainly dont nor should we base any laws on religion. Separation of church and state after all. And no matter how many people want this country to be a Christian country doesnt matter. The constitution forbids it. We most certainly are a secular nation. Nor does our country need god. Please show why you believe America is a non secular nation. 1st Amendment - Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","07:24 PM","gay-rights-debates","348"

It influences my vote and the votes of many others. To say it doesn't is totally naive. 'Separation of church and state' isn't in the Constitution. And a good number of our founding fathers believed that religious principles were a solid foundation for our laws. For instance, James Wilson, one of the original Supreme Court Justices, and a signer of the Constitution, explained, ""Human law must rest its authority ultimately upon the authority of that law which is divine.....Far from being rivals or enemies, religion and law are twin sisters, friends, and mutual assistants...."" Concerning the outcome of the American Revolution, John Quincy Adams noted, ""The highest glory won from the American Revolution was this: it connected, in one indissoluble bond, the principles of civil government with the principles of Christianity."" In a letter to Thomas Jefferson dated June 28, 1813, John Adams wrote: ""The general principles on which the (founding) fathers achieved independence were....the general principles of Christianity."" Founding father Noah Webster proclaimed much the same message when he said, ""The religion which has introduced civil liberty is the religion of Christ and His Apostles....This is genuine Christianity and to this we owe our free constitutions of government"" (History of the United States, 1832). Did you know many of the founding fathers (including Thomas Jefferson) attended church services in government buildings, and church services continued in government buildings up to and shortly after the Civil War? They didn't teach you that in SECULAR GOVERNMENT CLASSES, did they? Did anyone on the liberal left tell you about that? If not, why not? So, the founding fathers had a completely different view of religious freedom in the public square than many people do today. It works both ways, Addison. In the US Supreme Court decision Abington School District v. Schempp, 374, US 203, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 (1963) Justice Clark stated: "" The State may not establish a 'religion of secularism' in the sense of affirmatively opposing or showing hostility to religion, thus 'preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do believe.' We voted gay marriage down and many of us did it based on our personal religious beliefs. You need to acknowledge something, Addison: There's more of us Christians than there are of you secularists, and a great many of us vote based on our religious beliefs. And no amount of denial on the part of the liberal left is going to make that go away. Not ever. America has a Godly heritage that goes back to day one, and it cannot be denied with a straight face.

So no religion doesnt have a thing to do with laws in this country. You are correct separation of church and state isnt in the constitution. The phrase originated in Thomas Jefferson's 1802 letter to the Baptist Association of Danbury. Where did the phrase ""separation of church and state"" originate? But the 1st amendment does say this. Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. So Thomas Jefferson coined the term and even though the exact words separation of church and state doesnt appear however the same basic idea does exist in the constitution. I knew about them holding religious services in government buildings. However that doesnt mean its ok. Your right they cant prefer no religion over religion and I never claimed that. If you voted gay marriage down because of your religion then you are in the wrong. You are keeping us from gaining equality because of your religious beliefs and that is wrong. You do not have the right to deny me equality. Now having said all that I dont want to debate separation of church and state. I want to debate on if gay marriage should be legal or not.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","08:48 PM","gay-rights-debates","352"

"05-04-2010","13537",24,"Addison48","400289","You cant get your marriage legally recognized without the government. You cannot get the benefits of marriage without your marriage being legally recognized by the government. That is what I meant by not being married. Polygamists fine. Incestuous marriages...well I dont like that a kid has a higher chance of being handicapped in some way. But if there was some proof to prove otherwise I would change my tune. And for the age limit thing. We dont let children sign contracts for a reason. They arnt mature enough to sign a contract. To me letting a kid get married is like letting a kid sign for a loan. Plus age will change. If you are 16 you will eventually be 18 and able to marry. Doesnt work that way for gay couples. I should have said it was a civil liberty technically. Gay couples dont have access to the same benefits that straight couples have. Therefor gay couples have been treated unfairly under the law.","Lurch907","400386","Ok, this I'll agree with. So were not talking about ""being married"" were talking about bovernment regognition of marriage. So, I think we can agree that government can and sometimes should put restrictions on which marriages it will recognize. What benefit is a homosexual person denied? A homosexual person does not have a seperate set of rules to follow, they have to follow the same rules as everyone else if they want government recognition of there marriage. There are two flaws in your claim: 1. You have not shown that a person is discriminated against, in regards to marriage recognition, because of their sexual orientation. You will have to show how the rules differ for a homosexual individual. 2. You have not demonstrated that government recognition of same sex marriage is something you are entitled to, aka a civil liberty. PS.

As I have said many times before I would be alright with marriage being limited to breeding age heteros because it would then exclude heteros also. However as long as non breeding heteros, and heteros past breeding age can get married then gay people must have that option also.","Lurch907","400389","1st: You are entitled to go to any church that will have you and marry any willing adult you wish. I'm sure the government won't stop you, but that doesn't mean they'll endorse it either. 14th Equal Protection: I have asked you on several occasions to show how homosexual individuals are not given equal treatment under the law, to date you have not done so. 14th: Full faith and Credit: The full faith and credit clause has never been universaly applied to state licenses. For example: Alaska has issued me a concealed weapons license, its completely worthless in California. An journyman's electrician license issued in New York is not recognized in Alaska. A business license issued in Florida is no good in Oregon. As I've told you before, you have just as much anyone else to start an initative regarding government recognition of marriage. If you don't like the rules, follow the channels and try to change them.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","01:05 PM","gay-rights-debates","360"
