There have been many popular actions that were considered normal at the time but we now know they arnt ok. What makes heterosexual marriage ok? We should allow same sex marriage because we as a country believe in equality for all people.","Sigma","402565","Oh I don't mean to suggest that the current state of affairs is moral or just. That's just how policy debates work. The challenger has the burden to justify their plan. What inequality currently exists? A straight, unmarried individual has the same rights a gay, unmarried individual has. In your example, where there is a national ban upon goth shirts there is an identifiable right that is being violated, and it isn't the promise of equality but would instead treated as a restriction on individual liberty. Of course, that's if we put aside the question of whether it is in the Federal Gov'ts power to ban clothing in the first place (it really isn't something the Federal Gov't can do, btw).","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","10:56 PM","gay-rights-debates","481"

I dont exactly think he realized what he was saying.","Sigma","402567","Children can , we just legally disregard it.

Since we've pretty well established that, legally, it is a binding contract between two people, love is neither necessary nor required for it to take place. Only by long tradition has marriage been between two people who love one another but, then, marriage is a lot of things by tradition.

"05-21-2010","13537",33,"Addison48","402525","Well the debate is if marriage should be extended to homosexual couples as well.","Winston Smith","402580","why should it be 'extended' ? There is a legal definition of marriage already. definition which existed when homosexuals existed. so if they were excluded for not meeting the conditions too bad. I am not going to call a chicken a duck. so call ""marriage"" by homosexuals whatever you want but marriage it ain't you are talking gays, right?

However that definition is excluding same sex couples from getting married. And in the name of equality which is one of the founding principals of this country we should allow same sex marriage. Creating a separate institution would not be equal so it does have to be called marriage. Are you serious or joking?

If you don't past the test, I won't change the test in the name of equality. marriage is heterosexual marriage by definition. so same sex marriage is a contradiction of terms : (same sex) (marriage) I am sorry but, ""marriage"" is taken, find your own word or institution to describe the union of same sex unions. The purpose of using the word ""marriage"" is to abolish the difference between the two unions. Sorry, but a duck is a duck.

Love is not legally part of marriage for this reason, and we have no right to have it. There is no right that heterosexual people have that homosexual people do not, since the requirements of marriage are the same for us all. Those who are unmarried, gay or straight, have the same rights. This is why speaking about marriage in terms of rights isn't compelling to most people, I think. Among nobility and the ruling class, sure, and love was not usually part of the bargain. Even then the purpose was for the couple to have children that were the heir to both houses. Love was for the lucky while children were expected. We are a class-less society with restrictions on inheritance, though, so it would be difficult for arranged marriages to be usual even if we wanted to. A more overarching theme is two people who love each other marry and have a family (meaning: have children). This is unfortunately true.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","09:54 AM","gay-rights-debates","492"
