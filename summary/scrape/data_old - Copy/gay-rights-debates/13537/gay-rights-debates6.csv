Because an old man can now rape a young girl without being prosecuted. That's what I meant by equality. But by the way, pedophilia has nothing to do with sexual orientation, gay or straight. I don't want your ignorant little brats, gansao, if indeed you have any. That's a fear tactic. At one time people were prejudiced against Jewish people, by advancing ""blood libel"" myth. It was said that Jews kidnapped Christian children and used them in human sacrifices. This is the same idea, connecting pedophilia to gay people.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","12:23 PM","gay-rights-debates","76"

"11-12-2009","13537",6,"gayhumanist","377900","What's the problem with any of that? Where will it all end you ask? Equality.","gansao","377909","How about a minister for gays in government? A commision for gay equality in the UN? Maybe an employer would have to justify NOT employing a gay person over a straight? Lets make calling a gay person ..homo..a hate crime? How about that?","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","12:26 PM","gay-rights-debates","78"

Peter Tatchell , a British gay activist advocated the age of consent being changed to 14 years old. You see all the straight people know that whatever ther gays get, they will want more..and you just proved it. You will never be happy to be tolerated..you want to be in a position that YOU will tolerate straights","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","12:31 PM","gay-rights-debates","79"

Probably not. Are there straight people who would advocate for changing the age of consent? Yes. There are different arguments for and against lowering the age of consent which have nothing to do with gay equality rights.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","12:42 PM","gay-rights-debates","81"

"11-12-2009","13537",6,"None","None","None","gayhumanist","377927","You keep answering ""yes"", I was trying to make you understand the possible reason in meeting social needs, not knowing the specifics of various governments and how they operate. Do you have a problem with any of it, and if so, why? Because it's gay? You say I am naive. I ask you then to explain why you think I am. Equal rights only discriminate against those who discriminate, whether they are gay or straight, or discriminating against those who are gay or straight. It was seem there is more social prejudice against gay persons in our society, than straight. If anyone has a disadvantage it is gay people, if that discrimination and bias falls under the radar because it is common.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","12:59 PM","gay-rights-debates","86"

It's a separate set of arguments at any rate, from the ones that apply to gay equality. He was campaigning of the issue of age of consent. He was also campaigning for straight people who believe the age of consent should be lowered. It is possible to not lower the age of consent, and have gay marriage, or other gay equality issues.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","01:05 PM","gay-rights-debates","87"

The same laws have always applied to straight people, as I've explained. Why is it any less classy for gay people to do the same things straight people do? Oh, yeah, they're gay.
