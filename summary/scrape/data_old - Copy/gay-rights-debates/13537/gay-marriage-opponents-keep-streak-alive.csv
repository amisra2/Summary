"11-05-2009","13537",1,"None","None","None","Winston Smith","376833","Another state affirms the obvious that a marriage is between a man and a woman, everything else is not. Period. Why has an isolated, rural state with a population of just 1.4 million become ground zero in the fight over gay marriage in the US? Earlier this year, Maine's governor, John Baldacci, reluctantly signed a law allowing same-sex couples to marry. But a group opposing gay marriage, Stand for Marriage Maine, has forced a statewide referendum to overturn it a ""people's veto"" which will be held today. Government restrictions on who can get married have long been part of US history. Maine barred whites from marrying blacks or Native Americans until 1881, and it wasn't until 1967 that the US supreme court ruled such anti-miscegenation statutes unconstitutional. Laws barring sodomy were overturned in 2003. But gay couples still struggle to attain this last legal equaliser. Currently, four other states allow same-sex couples to marry: Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts and Vermont. New Hampshire will join them next year. What makes Maine unique is that, if the ballot measure is defeated, it will become the first popular referendum in the country approving gay marriage. Initiatives expanding gay rights are also on the ballots in Washington and Michigan. Stand for Marriage Maine has received strong support, to the tune of nearly $350,000, from well-known opponents of gay marriage, including the Catholic church and National Organisation for Marriage. Opposing them, and the ballot initiative, is a consortium of gay rights advocates called NO on 1. The fight between the two groups has picked up where the battle over Proposition 8 in California left off last year. There, voters succeeded in overturning the California law allowing gay marriage. And so Stand for Marriage Maine has taken not just a page but the entire playbook used out west. It hired the same public relations firm for its campaign and has even run exact copies of television ads, harping on the same theme that proved successful in California: that allowing gays to marry would lead to ""teaching"" about it schools, preying on fears the public may have. But NO on 1 is also drawing on the experiences learned in the bitter Prop 8 loss. The campaign has been prepared to refute the claims that allowing gays to marry will affect school curricula (it will not). Its message has been a consistent portrayal of gay families as what they are, and makes one wonder what the fuss is about they lead the same boring lives as the rest of us. In Tuesday's election, the people's veto will likely be defeated and the law allowing same-sex marriage will stand. Supporters of gay marriage have raised almost twice as much money as opponents and enjoy strong support in the more urban and liberal southern part of Maine. Most people living here don't care much about the private lives of others and instead value the contributions each of us makes to our communities, our schools and our workplaces. In a country where 30 states have voted that ""marriage"" is between one man and one woman, a vote in favour of gay marriage would be a first a turn of the tide that will allow gay rights advocates in other states to take heart. Hopefully the old political adage ""As Maine goes, so goes the nation"" will ring true again.

"11-05-2009","13537",2,"jitobear","376884","No. Drinking and driving hurts people.","Archangel","376926","So does homosexuality. Their life expectancy is far shorter than heteros just as their actual numbers are far less than declared. Here is some evidence of that. An excerpt: Federal Distortion Of Homosexual Footprint (Ignoring Early Gay Death?) Non-reporting, Exaggeration of Homosexual Prevalence. By ignoring the paucity of older homosexuals, Federal bureaucracies in three countries exaggerated the size of the homosexual footprint. In 2003, Statistics Canada reported on a random sample of 121,300 adults, reporting 1.7% were bi/homosexual. Because of a decline in incidence from about 2% of adults aged in their 20s and 30s to a third of one percent among the old, inclusion of respondents aged 60+ yields a revised estimate of 1.4%. In 2005, the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics interviewed a random sample of 11,571 younger adults, but misreported findings to indicate more frequent same-sex sexual experience. In 2005, the British Department of Trade and Industry said a wide range of research indicated lesbian, gay and bisexual people constitute 5- 7% of the total adult population. Yet surveys which included adults of all ages put the prevalence closer to 1-2%. Curious mistakes and omissions for well-funded bureaucracies charged with reporting the truth. Link to Early Death. Exclusion of older adults increases the reported size of the homosexual footprint, and also tends to obscure the apparent early death of those engaging in homosexuality. Median ages of death in gay marriage for 561 gays and 91 lesbians in Denmark (19902002) and 31 gays and 6 lesbians in Norway (19972002) were similar to U.S. gay obituaries during the same period: 52 yr. for 710 gays who ostensibly did not die of AIDS, 42 yr. for those 1,476 who supposedly did; and 55 yr. for 143 lesbians. On average, ever-married men outlived the ever-homosexually-partnered by 23 years in Denmark (74 yr. v. 51 yr.), and 25 years in Norway (77 yr. v. 52 yr.); ever-married women outlived the ever-homosexually-partnered in Denmark by 22 years (78 yr. v. 56 yr.), and in Norway by almost 25 years (81 yr. v. 56 yr.). Implications. By not sampling (U.S., Britain) or reporting on (Canada) those aged 60+, the objectivity of central bureaucracies is called into question. That the ~2% of adults who engage in homosexuality have life spans at least 20 years shorter than the general adult population in countries contributing relevant data has implications for social policy: e.g., gay rights (the decrement in the gay lifespan appears similar in societies that legally protect homosexuals or dont, suggesting discrimination does not cause their earlier death); gay marriage (which unlike man-woman marriage appears not to increase longevity); adoption (children of homosexuals are more frequently orphaned); favorable depiction of the homosexual lifestyle in schools (which is inconsistent with condemning the lesser harm of smoking); special protections for those who engage in homosexuality (why not also protect others whose sexual choices such as polygamy or adultery cause disruption and extra costs?); and equitable allocation of social resources (why spend excessively on HIV when cancer, heart disease, etc. afflict many more citizens?). Eastern Psychological Assn Convention, City Center Sheraton, Philadelphia: 3/23/07 Federal Distortion Of Homosexual Footprint (Ignoring Early Gay Death?) Under political pressure rather than the weight of empirical findings,1 the soft disciplines (e.g., psychiatry, social work) did an about-face on homosexuality. Seventy years ago they attempted to treat those who engaged in same-sex sex, directing them toward conventional married, child-bearing productivity. Today these disciplines seek the social acceptance of gays and lesbians, even though homosexuals contribute less (e.g., less frequent child-bearing, less economically productive) and cost more (e.g., AIDS, STDs, substance abuse, smoking) than non- homosexuals.2 Federal or central government agencies are supposed to be different. In theory, aloof from politics and social fads, their sole function is to gather and tell facts. It is therefore of concern when they depart from their fact-telling mission to indulge in politics. Kinseys 1948 claim3 that 37% of all men had had a homosexual orgasm began a series of extravagant claims by gay activists about the prevalence of homosexuality. Three recent reports suggest national bureaucracies may have joined with activists in exaggerating the size of the homosexual footprint: Great Britains Department of Trade and Industry4 declared in 2005 that lesbian, gay and bisexual people constitute 5-7% of the total adult population. This announcement made Britain the first country to officially estimate its homosexual footprint and was most certainly news. But the uncertainties the department expressed about this estimate e.g. [t]here is very little reliable data about the size of the LGB population; [w]hilst no specific data is available, a wide range of research suggests (p. 13) is cause for concern. Why 5-7% when so many surveys have reported significantly smaller fractions of homosexuals?6,7,15,18 The research the department cited did not involve a new random sampling of all adults from Britain, but instead utilized studies with sampling frames from different countries that excluded anyone above the age of 44 or the age of 59. A sampling frame that stops at age 59 ignores about a quarter of adults. If homosexuals are less frequently represented among the older,8 the best estimate might be significantly lower than what was reported. In September, 2005, the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS] reported5 [a]bout 6.5 percent of men 25-44 years of age have had oral or anal sex with another man... 11 percent of women 25-44 years of age reported having had a sexual experience with another woman. These statements were inaccurate, since the questions that generated these statistics were about lifetime same-sex sexual activity, not merely sex with adults (e.g., for men ever done any of the following with another male [6% ever, but 2.9% in last 12 months; 1.6% reported such behavior only with men], and for women ever had any sexual experience of any kind with another female (p. 9) [11.2%; 4.4% in last 12 months; 1.3% only with female(s)]). In June 2004, Statistics Canada announced9 that for its random sample of 121,300 adults, 1.0% of Canadians aged 18 to 59 consider themselves to be homosexual, and 0.7% considered themselves bisexual. The 1.7% figure was employed both by Statistics Canada and the press. Yet, with older respondents (aged 60+) included, the figure drops 16% from 1.7% to 1.4%. http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2007_doc...lFootprint.pdf And here: http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1805593/posts","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","06:36 PM","gay-rights-debates","24"

He's been kicked out of many major psychological and sociological organizations and censured by a federal judge for his garbage research methods. He has a track record. On Cameron's research methods: ""What do vital-statistics buffs think of this technique? Nick Eberstadt at the American Enterprise Institute sums up the reactions of several of his fellow demographers: ""The method as you describe it is just ridiculous."" But you don't have to be a trained statistician to spot the fallacy at its heart, which is, to quote Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistician John Karon, that ""you're only getting the ages of those who die."" Gay men of the same generation destined to live to old age, even if more numerous, won't turn up in the sample. Other critics rattle off further objections. The deaths reported in these papers, mostly AIDS deaths, will tend to represent the community defined by such papers or directly known to their editors. It will include relatively more subjects who live in town and are overtly gay and relatively few who blend into the suburbs and seldom set foot in bars. It will overrepresent those whose passing strikes others as newsworthy and underrepresent those who end their days in retired obscurity in some sunny clime. Bennett is a busy man, but even he has access to the back of an envelope. A moment's thought might have suggested a few simple test calculations. Suppose he assumes--wildly pessimistically, given current incidence data--that half the gay male population is destined to catch the AIDS virus and die of it. The actual average age of AIDS patients at death has been about 40. (Presumably protease inhibitors will extend average longevity, but that will only increase Bennett's difficulty.) For the number 43 to be the true average death age for the entire population of gay males, HIV-negative gay men would, on average, have to keel into their graves at 46. Looked at another way, if even half the gay male population stays HIV-negative and lives to an average age of 75, an average overall life span of 43 implies that gay males with AIDS die at an implausibly early average age (11, actually). Against this, Cameron and his supporters argue that, according to their survey of obits, even if they don't have AIDS, homosexual males tend to die by their mid-40s (and lesbians by their late 40s). Some downright peculiar results followed from this inference. One is that--contrary to the opinion of virtually everyone else in the world--AIDS in fact hasn't reduced gay males' life expectancy by that much--a few years, at most. Moreover, the obits also recorded lots of violent and accidental deaths. From this Cameron and company concluded not that newsworthy deaths tend to get into newspapers, but that gays must experience shockingly high rates of violent death. With a perfectly straight face they report, for example, that lesbians are at least 300 times more likely to die in car crashes than females of similar ages in general.""

I am posting it in full, followed by my original email of April 4th to the EPA. I followed up with another email on the 7th, to which Dr. Hineline kindly responds. Dear Jim Burroway, Following up on your message of 7 April, the following is a statement suitable for public distribution, provided that quotations from it are not lifted out of context. Thank you for bringing the matter to our attention. Phil Hineline Paul Cameron and Kirk Cameron have posted for circulation a controversial and lengthy manuscript that purports, via the tagline at the bottom each page, to be the account of a presentation at the March 2007 meeting of the Eastern Psychological Assocition. The title of that manuscript, as well as its main emphasis, focuses upon an issue that was not present in the title nor was it in the supporting materials that were submitted by the Camerons for a poster presentation at EPA. The submitted title, which appears in the EPA printed program, is: Federal distortion of homosexual footprint. The accompanying Abstract asserts that the proportion of the Canadian population identified as lesbian, gay and bisexual is substantially lowered if adults over age 60 are included than if they are excluded from the sample. The asserted implication is that federal agencies are exaggerating the size of the homosexual proportion of the population by excluding adults over 60 from the assessments. In contrast, the manuscript at issue carries the title: Federal Distortion Of Homosexual Footprint (Ignoring early Gay Death?). Two of the three paragraphs in its accompanying Abstract focus upon the topic of the added parenthetical phrase, which is an inference indeed a topic that was not present in the materials submitted to EPA. Irrespective of its potential for controversy, it is highly unlikely that the augmented/altered version would have been accepted for presentation, for there clearly are many reasons other than differential longevity that could result in the under-reporting of homosexuals over 60. Whatever its content, even the format of the manuscript to which the EPA identification has been affixed a manuscript of more than 7000 words plus three tables and six graphs, would have been completely inappropriate as a poster presentation, which was the venue in which Dr. Cameron proposed to participate in the meeting. To clarify the relevant history and circumstances: After putting out the call for submissions to be proposed for the EPA meeting, we typically receive over 700 submissions as was the case this year. These submissions are divided into categories (e.g. Animal Learning, Social psychology, etc ..) and each section is reviewed by a volunteer on the program committee. As each submission typically has at least two authors, vetting authors against other organizations lists of people with problematic ethical records is simply an impossibility, especially given the time-frame of preparations for an annual convention. For acceptance, a work had to be complete, be methodologically sound using proper data collection techniques and/or experimental methods, the conclusions had to be derivable from the presented results, and the topic deemed to be one that could stimulate interest and discussion among those attending the meeting. The submission by Dr. Cameron indicated that there was a possibility that the prevalence of homosexuals in the population had been overestimated by previous techniques. Data were presented, reportedly using a broader defined sample than that used by government agencies, which indicated that the prevalence of homosexuality in the population was smaller than had been previously suggested. The submission by Dr. Cameron was for a poster presentation, and it was accepted as a poster, not as a paper or address. Whatever the Camerons ultimately presented, occurred in an hour-long poster session among approximately 70 posters. There was nothing in the materials submitted by the author for review by EPA that indicated that the work could, or would, be informative with respect to the longevity of homosexuals.

(In 2005, the average age of the groom was 37.4 years; for the bride, 34.7 years.15) But registered same-sex partnerships have only been available in Denmark since 1989, which means the gay sample got a late start. And if the typical age of someone entering into a same-sex partnership is around forty, then it stands to reason that the typical age at death of someone who has died so far would be similarly young. ............... In other words, Camerons sample only captured those who died so far, out of a sample that continues to live and grow older without dying.""

I'd hardly call those advancing this in parliament part of a heterosexual agenda. Nor other heterosexuals who support it.

You really dont know much about girls do you? I never suggested girls are weak, submissive victims, where did that pop up in your head? What do you think that the age of consent means? Tatchell knows full well what buggering means even if you dont Gay marriage is just another step in the promotion of gay sex by gays..you admitted it. What started as showing compassion and tolerance to men who indulged in homosexual sex has turned into a veracious gay pressure group intent on normalising the far from normal.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","04:26 PM","gay-rights-debates","98"

Because if what you say is true, I doubt he would have plunged the country into such a self destructive exercise as the civil war to free them for something he didn't believe in firmly. I mean, politically speaking, there was absolutely no upside to the civil war for him personally, (as his assassination proves) so why go there unless he believed it was the right thing to do in the long run for the country at large?","Symbiote","378008","It is a myth that Lincoln went to war to end slavery. In his own words: ""If there be those who would not save the Union, unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause. I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors; and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views. "" As I said, I have no interest in debating in great detail whether Lincoln was a racist or not. Racism is impossible to prove, since it relies on an occurence in someone else's mind, and is not in itself an evil. Whether Lincoln is a racist or not, even exceptionally racist or not, is simply a bit of historical trivia. What is true is that both his actions and words are consistent with going to war to ""preserve the union"", with slavery ending not ranking, at all, as a priority. I'm sure he believed what he was doing, that is, preserving the union, was right for the country at large. He fought against secession, as nationalists tend to do, just as China today seeks to fight the secession of Taiwan, Tibet and the Muslim northwestern provinces, just as Indonesia sought to prevent the secession of East Timor and Russia seeks to prevent the secession of Chechnya.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","07:45 PM","gay-rights-debates","100"

In fact, we believe in a separation of church and state, and being subject to the law. The ""Articles of Faith"" are 13 major points of our religious beliefs. This is number 12 ""We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law."" According to the Constitution, I don't see how we can deny gays the right to marry. It doesn't seem Constitutional to refuse. Having said this, very many people are saying, ""Why are you against gay marriage, then? It's not like it hurts YOU at all if some gay people get married!"" Oh, but it does. The reason that we ""Mormons"" opposed gay marriage so vocally is that giving gays the right to marry is that it endangers the traditional family. It means that the government recognizes gays as a family, and must protect them legally. Why is that a problem? Here's an example: A Mormon family in New Hampshire, where gay marriages are legal, almost got their kids taken away. Their kids were assigned to read in school a book about how gay marriage isn't wrong. According to our religion, gay marriage is wrong. The kids read it, and then when the teacher asked opinions on the book, the kid said, ""I don't believe it's right."" When they found that the parents taught their kids as many of us do, ""We don't believe it's right, but they are free to choose as they like,"" (we also say this about smoking, pre-marital sex and many other things,) they had social services investigate the family for teaching them such insidious things. IT'S MY RELIGION. I believe gays should have the freedom to marry, as long as it doesn't inhibit my FREEDOM OF RELIGION. Here's another example: religious adoption agencies loose state licensing. Right now, both our church and the Catholic Church have adoption agencies for Mormons/Catholics respectively who want their child to be raised in their religion. Neither considers gay couples, because both churches believe homosexuality to be a sin. (i.e., they will not be members of that church.) With the recognition of gay marriage, they would be forced to change that policy or close. (happened twice to Catholic institutions in New England.) Also, there's the point about our clergy being forced to perform marriages that they believe are wrong, in our churches. That's as good as asking an animal rights activist to stomp a puppy to death. Also, because of policies regarding gays, several churches have lost tax exempt status, costing them millions every year. I come from Atlanta. It's a big gay city. I have many very close and dear friends who are gay, including one of my three best friends from growing up. I have my beliefs, but I also believe that we are all children of God, and are all sinners, so we are in no position to judge. I treat all the gays I know just like anybody else. They do not deserve to be hated, ostracized, discriminated against, or PROHIBITED TO MARRY! However, I can't see a way of allowing gay marriage without giving up a large part of my religious freedom and my right to raise my children as I believe is right. I am for gay marriage, but can't see a way for it to happen until safeguards are put in place protecting traditional families and any religions that feel that gender is an eternal and spiritual thing.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","07:50 PM","gay-rights-debates","304"

What does this have to do with Gay marriage? Traditional.... Let me explain something to you. Gay marriage in NO WAY endangers your children in any way.... Two people committing themselves in a monogamous private relationship does not harm your kids... What you envision as a traditional family is just another extension of what family may or may not be. You have single mothers, single father, various homes that are different where kids are raised just fine... Many gay couples raise children in a loving caring home, and frankly your view of traditional is just sadly another fabricated image painted to you... That's an issue with social services not gay marriage.... Your blaming gays getting married for something taught by the state.... Personally I don't think such books are necessary, and I think it's fabricated.... A child being taken away because they have a difference of opinion? I highly doubt that... And even if it is true, Once again it is a matter of the state, not the gay couples wanting to get married. I don't want their kids taken away, and I feel parenting and teaching should be left up to the family. And if you so worried about what your kids learn, perhaps you should learn to teach them better as parents, not force the state to teach only to your views.... Oh please.... Equating a puppy being stomped because churches can't discriminate against others..... What a sad excuse.... In my opinion these couples shouldn't even bother with your church I'd tell them to go somewhere else.... And if they lost their tax exempt status so be it.... I don;t know the statute on New England's tax status but once again, a matter of the state.... Protect what? Marriage should be a matter of the state not the church in my opinion. If we did away with the church's involvement we wouldn't even be in this position to begin with... I just think that this whole notion of ""protect"" traditional families is just more pork to feed people who are ignorant and fearful of gays, or even have prejudiced views toward it....","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","09:09 PM","gay-rights-debates","306"

"02-24-2010","13537",21,"romebigred","392205","JazyJason: I'm not blaming gays for it, I am TOTALLY blaming legal. I couldn't agree with you more, it's not the gay's fault. BUT! It is still a problem that results when Gay marriage is legalized. When something like legal gay marriage is introduced, if there are anti-gays who are violent about it, it causes issues (once again, NOT the gays' fault). To try to prevent such issues in future, the state teaches children about all different types. ""Diversity Week,"" or something like that, and they teach about different types of families. Here is the ""traditional family,"" (legal term, not my term,) with a mother, father, children. Here is a single-parent family. Here is a gay family. Once again, I have no problems so far. But when they try to force a child to their views that contradict religious ones, the second amendment is violated, not to mention the first amendment. Imagine if you will, somebody trying to force your child to stand up and condemn gay marriage as a wrong and sinful practice. (not terms I use when teaching my kids to respect their gay peers,) It's terrible, isn't it? It's the exact same for me when a teacher threatens to call social services when my kid won't say that his personal view is complete and total acceptance. You don't believe that it's really become school curriculum? Check for yourself: Gay Curriculum Proposal Riles Elementary School Parents - Local News | News Articles | National News | US News - FOXNews.com Don't believe that it's widespread? Google ""Gay curriculum"" and check out stories of cases in Massachusetts, California, and New Hampshire. I think there were more, but that was the first page I got. Once again, I have NO PROBLEM with my kids being required to read them. I just have a problem with them being forced to agree. They are allowed to hold their own beliefs about the theory of relativity, but not sexual preference. Okay, even I'm not that close-minded. I'm not saying, ""If they can't legally get married, so be it."" What is the difference, really? None that I can see, except that you like yours. (That seems to me to be the definition of a double-standard) If expect others to care about YOUR issues, you should really try to care about theirs. Equality is a two-way street. If the majority overruns minority, it's terrible, and you get discrimination. If the minority overruns the majority, it's the same, except that there is usually a lot more violence. Not saying it's right. That's just how it is. Martin Luther King didn't have your attitude. His way was ""United we stand."" Unite with us, don't try to push under to get what you want. Equal is equal, friend. Disliking the metaphor doesn't answer the question, but you are right that it was extreme. How's this for a better one: It's like forcing a Jew to slaughter the animal and cook up the bacon. It's forcing somebody to change their religious beliefs because of a law. What's next, a law saying that my religion can't preach against alcohol or chastity before marriage? LAW SHOULD NOT DICTATE RELIGION. Religion is about God, not the Senate, or the Supreme court, and the first and second amendments support that. If separation of church and state actually exists, then state shouldn't rule church just like church shouldn't rule over state. The rest of my post went on to explain how it endangers my family. Having my kids being taken away is a danger. Not gays' fault, but it can happen anyway. You don't believe it. Google it. I'll see if I can find the report I was looking at yesterday, and post it before the end of the week. It seems to me that you hate us. I know that there are many many many very judgmental believers out there that hate gays on principle. There are also anti-gay nutjobs who are all for violence. You are understandably defensive. You probably figure that I'm one of them, but I'm not. I'm a true Christian, trying not to be one of them. Ghandi once said, ""I like your Christ, but I do not like your Christians. They are so unlike Christ."" I think that for the most part, he's right. Christ taught love and acceptance of all people as incredibly valuable children of God, all equal in His sight. So many Christians seem to think that that applies to everybody except gays. They are wrong. Very wrong. HOWEVER, those nutjobs still exist, and as long as they do, the hyper-defensive, don't-care-what-happens-to-you attitude is getting you no closer to winning them over. Why do you think that every time gay marriage is put to public vote, the majority votes against? It's because those nutjobs stand in the way. Until you try to understand them, they will make no effort to understand you. They aren't going away. They are going to stand in the way every time until you prove to them that you care just as much about their problems as you want them to care about yours. SUMMARY: I am not blaming gays. I'm saying we have some legal issues to clear up, but I think that gays are in the right. The gays are not the problem. The state is the problem; but until we clear up the problem, we will have big-time unrest. That is what I tried to say with the first post. Also, try to recognize an ally when you see one. I am not trying to stop gay marriage. I'm trying to clear the path so that nobody will be able to hold it back. Right now the legal system has too many potholes.","jazyjason","392319","Like I said it is ridiculous if social services got involved over a matter of opinion. And my personal take is you should teach diversity, tolerance etc. But I don't understand how you can teach someone to be gay, or to teach justification for gay marriage.... I think that should be where teaching stops on both sides personally... Everyone should be able to hold their own opinion and if that is being denied then it's wrong. However I don't trust fixed news anymore than I could throw their CEO.... Like I said it is the state..... I wasn't saying so be it let the kids get taken away.... And like I was saying earlier, Opinion shouldn't be restricted. I don't hate anyone I am just very critical when this could be spun in any certain direction. And it is refreshing to see someone with their head on their shoulders... Well they'll also spin that I'm a threat to children, that I'm a threat to the traditional family, that I want to tear away at your family and rob babies out of cradles and molest your young boys..... There is no understanding in my book. Either ignorant people who are scared of the unknown and eat it up like candy, or those who perpetrate such lies and deceit in the name of family and morality.. It is those ignorant people who have been sucked into the lies and spin of those who do truly hate that we can reach.... Well personally I think the State is the problem on alot of issues not just Gay marriage.... And if the opinions of these kids is being threatened then I'll be the first to protest against the state's handling.... Everyone is entitled to their beliefs.

In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion."" 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - ""Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God."" 1 Timothy 1:8-10 - But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine Jude 7 In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion.

Point being, government can choose which marriages to recognize, subject to the will of the people. Polygamists and siblings are in the same boat with regards to marriage, because the marriage rules apply to each ""individual"" equally. Nobody can have a government recognized marriage with whomever they want, the marriage has to comply with the rules, same rules for everybody. What your looking for is civil rights for couples, but it doesn't work that way, each individual has civil rights. As for making decisions, no marriage is required. In most cases a living will or other such documents do just as well. Loving v. Virginia was written at a time when a marriage between people of the same sex wasn't even a consideration, it wasn't even thought of as a possibility. LvV was written within the strict bounds of racial discrimination and cannot be used as an argument for same sex marriage because the judges issuing the ruling were not taking that into account. Below is part of a ruling by the New York Court of Appeals illustrating this point:","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","08:29 PM","gay-rights-debates","368"
"05-08-2010","13537",25,"Easyrider","400417","Gay marriage is not a right under the Constitution. Nor is pedophilia or polygamy. I'm sure they think they have their rights too. See above. People vote against gay marriage in election after election, and so far no one has said they can't do that. So you're contention that gay marriage is a right doesn't fly with the majority of Americans, or the Constitution. Here's what God says about gay sex: Leviticus 18:22 - ""Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable."" Leviticus 20:13 - ""If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads."" Romans 1:26-27 - ""Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion."" 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - ""Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God."" 1 Timothy 1:8-10 - But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine Jude 7 In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. There's no gay marriages in the Old Testament; No gay marriages in the New Testament; no gay sex approved anywhere in the Bible. Just the opposite - gay sex is condemned in both testaments. God is consistent on that. And to close: Whosoever shall be guilty of Rape, Polygamy, or Sodomy with man or woman shall be punished, if a man, by castration, if a woman, by cutting thro' the cartilage of her nose a hole of one half inch diameter at the least. - Thomas Jefferson, Amendment VIII: A Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments","Matthew S","400771","Do you love Jesus Easy?","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","07:09 AM","gay-rights-debates","369"

If we banned all gothic clothes so no one could wear gothic styled clothes it would only effect those who wanted to wear those clothes. Everyone would still technically have the right to wear the same clothes of other styles so everyone would be technically equal. Yet wouldnt banning a certain style of clothing that harms no one be wrong? Edit: It has been stated that since gay people can get married but to people of the opposite sex then they still have the same rights but then couldnt that be said of interracial couples too? Lets put it this way. Gay couples have the same rights as straight couples because they can get married to a member of the opposite sex but not the member of the same sex. Interracial couples have the same rights as non-interracial couples because they can get married to a member of the same race but not a member of the opposite race. See the similarities?

To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State's citizens of liberty without due process of law.

If we banned all gothic clothes so no one could wear gothic styled clothes it would only effect those who wanted to wear those clothes. Everyone would still technically have the right to wear the same clothes of other styles so everyone would be technically equal. Yet wouldnt banning a certain style of clothing that harms no one be wrong? Marriage is one of the ""basic civil rights of man,"" fundamental to our very existence and survival.... To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State's citizens of liberty without due process of law. The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discrimination. Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State. Now lets just change one variable.

Hell even the anti-gay marriage people agree with that. But can you give me an example of acceptable different labels? There was gay marriage in ancient Rome and Greece. There was also forms of gay marriage in Africa and Native America. However the Supreme Court did not say that marriage is fundamental to our existence and survival as a species. They said it was fundamental to our existence and survival as a nation. In fact marriage didnt exist when man first walked the earth and is bad for our survival in that instance. And this has nothing to do with political correctness and everything to do with equality under the law. See above for the existence and survival thing. Investing in their offspring does not mean monogamy. It just means taking care of the kid they had. They can still sleep with other women and have kids with them and then invest in their offspring with the other woman as well. Basically its a cost benefit analysis. Females are more likely to be monogamous while males arnt. And in todays society monogamy is kind of going away. Homosexuals do raise children however and we dont live in the stone age anymore. Marriage has always changed and so have we. Marriage is a legal contract between two people to provide benefits to the couple that are relevant to monogamous couples. Nothing more. That is all marriage is legally. And homosexual couples can benefit from those benefits just like straight couples can. So yes homosexual attractions have the same amount of significance as heterosexual attractions and homosexual relationships should be legally equal to heterosexual relationships if we want to live in a country were all are equal under the law.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","05:19 PM","gay-rights-debates","417"

"05-17-2010","13537",29,"gansao","402078","Enlighten me JJ.Explain further...","jazyjason","402194","Essentially there are certain rights that a full marriage has that a civil partnership does not. Here is a quote outlining the basic differences. Difference Between Civil Union and Marriage - Civil Unions vs. Gay Marriage The Difference between Gay Marriage and Civil Unions by Kathy Belge You hear the politicians saying it all the time. I support Civil Unions, but not gay marriage. What exactly does this mean? Some even say they support equal rights for gays and lesbians, but not gay marriage. Is this possible? And why do gays and lesbians want marriage so badly when they can have civil unions? First of all, What is Marriage? When people marry, they tend to do so for reasons of loveand commitment. But marriage is also a legal status, which comes with rights and responsibilities. Marriage establishes a legal kinship between you and your spouse. It is a relationship that is recognized across cultures, countries and religions. What is a Civil Union? Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships exist in only a handful of places like New Jersey and Washington and Oregon. Vermont was the first state to create civil unions in 2000 to provide legal protections to gays and lesbians in relationships in that state because gay marriage is not an option. The protections do not extend beyond the border of Vermont and no federal protections are included with a Civil Union. Civil Unions offer some of the same rights and responsibilities as marriage, but only on a state level. What about Domestic partnership? Some states and municipalities have domestic partnership registries, but no domestic partnership law is the same. Some, like Oregon's domestic partnership law comes with many rights and responsibilities. Others offer very few benefits to the couple. What are some of the differences between Civil Unions and Gay Marriage? Recognition in other states: Even though each state has its own laws around marriage, if someone is married in one state and moves to another, their marriage is legally recognized. For example, Oregon marriage law applies to people 17 and over. In Washington state, the couple must be 18 to wed. However, Washington will recognize the marriage of two 17 year olds from Oregon who move there. This is not the case with Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships. If someone has a Domestic Partnership, that union is not recognized by some states and not others. Some states have even ruled that they do not have to recognize civil unions performed in other states, because their states have no such legal category. As gay marriages become legal in other states, this status may change. Immigration: A United States citizen who is married can sponsor his or her non-American spouse for immigration into this country. Those with Civil Unions have no such privilege. Taxes: Civil Unions are not recognized by the federal government, so couples would not be able to file joint-tax returns or be eligible for tax breaks or protections the government affords to married couples. Benefits: The General Accounting Office in 1997 released a list of 1,049 benefits and protections available to heterosexual married couples. These benefits range from federal benefits, such as survivor benefits through Social Security, sick leave to care for ailing partner, tax breaks, veterans benefits and insurance breaks. They also include things like family discounts, obtaining family insurance through your employer, visiting your spouse in the hospital and making medical decisions if your partner is unable to. Civil Unions protect some of these rights, but not all of them. But cant a lawyer set all this up for gay and lesbian couples? No. A lawyer can set up some things like durable power of attorney, wills and medical power of attorney. There are several problems with this, however. 1. It costs thousands of dollars in legal fees. A simple marriage license, which usually costs under $100 would cover all the same rights and benefits. 2. Any of these can be challenged in court. As a matter of fact, more wills are challenged than not. In the case of wills, legal spouses always have more legal power than any other family member. 3. Marriage laws are universal. If someones husband or wife is injured in an accident, all you need to do is show up and say youre his or her spouse. You will not be questioned. If you show up at the hospital with your legal paperwork, the employees may not know what to do with you. If you simply say, ""He's my husband,"" you will immediately be taken to your spouse's side. Defense of Marriage Law Even with lesbian and gay marriages being performed and recognized in some states, the Federal Defense of Marriage Law prohibits the federal government from recognizing gay and lesbian relationships. This puts gay and lesbian couples who are married in a legal limbo. How do they file their tax returns? Do they have to pay the tax on their partners health insurance? How do they fill out legal and other forms, single or married? Creating Civil Unions creates a separate and unequal status for some of Americas citizens. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial court ruled that creating a separate class for gay and lesbian citizens is not permissible and that is why they have voted that only marriage equals marriage. The precedent was set with Brown v. The Board of Education regarding segregation in public education. Ironically, Massachusetts marriage law went into effect on the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education. The United States Constitution guarantees equality for all. As you can see, marriage and civil unions are not the same. Creating equal access to marriage is the only fair way to ensure equality for gay and straight couples alike.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","09:18 PM","gay-rights-debates","425"

"05-17-2010","13537",29,"Addison48","402170","They are not just labels. Marriage is an institution. Hell even the anti-gay marriage people agree with that. But can you give me an example of acceptable different labels? There was gay marriage in ancient Rome and Greece. There was also forms of gay marriage in Africa and Native America. However the Supreme Court did not say that marriage is fundamental to our existence and survival as a species. They said it was fundamental to our existence and survival as a nation. In fact marriage didnt exist when man first walked the earth and is bad for our survival in that instance. And this has nothing to do with political correctness and everything to do with equality under the law. See above for the existence and survival thing. Investing in their offspring does not mean monogamy. It just means taking care of the kid they had. They can still sleep with other women and have kids with them and then invest in their offspring with the other woman as well. Basically its a cost benefit analysis. Females are more likely to be monogamous while males arnt. And in todays society monogamy is kind of going away. Homosexuals do raise children however and we dont live in the stone age anymore. Marriage has always changed and so have we. Marriage is a legal contract between two people to provide benefits to the couple that are relevant to monogamous couples. Nothing more. That is all marriage is legally. And homosexual couples can benefit from those benefits just like straight couples can. So yes homosexual attractions have the same amount of significance as heterosexual attractions and homosexual relationships should be legally equal to heterosexual relationships if we want to live in a country were all are equal under the law.","Sigma","402196","Well, the examples I've already given are ""black"" and ""white"" as labels for races. ""Gay"" and ""straight"" are labels. Legally speaking, the word ""marriage"" refers to a pooling of assets. Tbh, I'm not sure what is meant by calling it an ""institution"". As we've established, equality already exists. The fact that no one can wear goth shirts is equal treatment, even if it impacts those who want to wear goth shirts more than those who don't. If you would, what did the court mean by the ""survival of the nation""? Ancient Rome and Greek treatment of homosexuality does not really help your case. The Lex Scantinia is the first instance of recorded Roman law that regulated sexual behavior which including pederasty, adultery and passivity and potentially legislating the death penalty for homosexual behavior among free-borns (slaves could be used for any sexual activity, it seems, and frequently were used for homosexual sex). Even the Roman philosopher Gaius Musonius Rufu, who expressed progressive views on women becoming philosophers, described homosexuality as ""against nature"" even though he seemed to consider adultery as the most illicit of sexual activity. Of course, the Roman idea of masculinity was associated with penetrative sex. A free-born who was penetrated had been ""feminized"". In Craig Williams' book ""Roman Homosexuality"", he describes a court case of a Roman soldier from an author of the era: This soldier had been propositioned by his tribune, a relative of the commander Marius, during the war against the Cimbri in 104 B.C.; not only did he reject the tribune's advances, but he killed him in outrage, and despite the fact that the dead man was his relative, Marius ruled that it was a case of justifiable homicide. Defending the soldier's action, the speaker in Calpurnius' declamation first poses a rhetorical question to the slain tribune: ""Is he not yet a man to you, though he is already one of Marius' soldiers?"". That is, the speaker is arguing that, in trying to violate the soldier's sexual integrity, the tribune had disregarded his manhood. Among the free-born, being penetrated was disgraceful in a man. Homosexual relationships, then, could not enjoy equality with heterosexual relationships. It is a cost-benefit analysis. A male only has so much investment he can spread around. While both sexes have a genetic incentive to commit adultery, they also have a strong genetic incentive to ensure their partner is monogamous. A male would not wish to waste investment on another man's child and a woman would not want her mate to invest in another woman's child. Thus, monogamy would be selected for over evolutionary time while adultery would be an opportunistic strategy in a similar way rape is an opportunistic strategy. A woman who has a mate that has indescriminate sexual appetites gains less investment in her children and thus her and that male's reproductive fitness is reduced. A woman who is in a life-long monogamous relationship maximizes the survival of her own offspring and the offspring of that male. The ideal situation for the male is to commit adultery in secret and have another male raise his mistress's children while he raises his wife's. The ideal situation for a woman is to have a male that will invest in her children and no one else's even if the children are not his. The ideal situation for the couple is to be in a life-long monogamous relationship where their genetic interests are tied up in their common children. Marriage means more than that to most people, I daresay, though I agree that is all it is legally. Any two people can stand to gain from marriage benefits. Heck, when you strip any meaning from ""marriage"", why are there any restrictions at all? Why are there age limits? Why are there species limits? Why is it limited to couples only? The reason there are limits is that marriage is meaningful to us. When you change that meaning you will meet resistance. Heterosexual attraction is the basis of reproduction. That is significant.

Not really. Schools ban certain clothing all the time and can even restrict clothing to only one style. I find nothing wrong with that. On a national level it still would not be wrong, though this is a value judgement and would vary person to person. Clothing just isn't very important to me. However, it would be unconstitutional and therefore I would not accept such a restriction even if I did not care what the restriction was. There was only heterosexual marriage. Homosexual liasons were allowed with slaves because slaves were considered acceptable sexual objects (no matter the gender), but any free-born Roman besides his wife was off-limits. To further complicate matters, freed-men and -women (as opposed to free-born) occupied a third level of sexual allowance. Those who freed them were considered to be ""owed"" a duty (which may have included sexual services), but were off-limits to everyone else as a free-born would be. Also, if a free-born man was penetrated even by a slave that man was considered degenerate. A ""real man"" only penetrated others. True homosexual relationships did not openly exist. Time and effort, money and resources. When you raise a child you invest your time, effort and money into that child. Of course they would still apply. Who cares if those involved are in love or not? It's just a contract between any two people. If I want my best friend to inherit or to make medical decisions, I could marry them. I don't have to actually have any romantic feelings, since it's just a contract. Age of consent is a legal construct just as marriage is. We can change that As for animals, who cares if they can consent? They're animals, not people. The big deal is basically what you've said in this post. Marriage is meaningful. It has been a custom that has not included homosexual people (with rare if any exceptions). You want to change that meaning, this custom. When you change the meaning of something that is actually very meaningful to a great deal of people don't be surprised if you tick off a portion of that population.

If it is just a contract, though, then you don't need to enter into it with someone you love.

If you will excuse using you as an example: Marriage is not denied to you, if you accept the restrictions on the choice of partner. Similarly, if I wished qualify for veteren benefits I would have to serve my country. Neither of us have a right to these benefits, we have to qualify for them. No, I'm saying that I think a majority of people view heterosexual attraction as somehow more valid, or at least different in a significant way, because that type of relationship has the capability to produce children. Imo, resistance to the idea of changing the custom of marriage is an expression of this belief that heterosexual relationships are different in some significant way. I think that is a valid belief to have, and I mourn that it is commonly disregarded as unimportant by gay-rights proponents. Heterosexual relationships are the only type of relationship that can produce children. This is true even if a percentage are unable to have children or are voluntarily childless. As I said, it doesn't matter whether any particular person or couple can have children, it is the type of relationship or sexual behavior that I'm concerned with. Couples don't have rights, individuals do. Unmarried people don't have marriage benefits because they are not married. Unmarried individuals do not qualify for marriage benefits in a similar way that I do not qualify for veteren benefits. I do not have a right to marriage benefits if unmarried. I do not have a right to veteren benefits if not a veteren. Unmarried people, gay or straight, are not denied any rights because they are not married (at least, they better not be denied any rights). Granted, homosexual people cannot marry whom they love. That is tragic, and I truly sympathize. But speaking about marriage in terms of rights is, imo, erroneous. Love is not a right (at least, not one the gov't can help with). Loving whom you are married to is not a right.

I realize there is a certain amount of sophistry with that line of reasoning since the two groups don't wish to marry the same people, but it is not false statement. This renders the entire ""gay rights"" argument, as I know it at least, null since the current state of affairs is equal in terms of rights. Oh, I don't think there is much if any misunderstanding or even fear. ""Disgust"" is more likely the emotion involved since disgust is an other-condemning emotion in one of the three moral spheres. It would be similar to the instinctual repulsion toward sex with siblings, which would inspire a ""disgust"" reaction. The only fear that would manifest would be a fear of contamination, since that is why the emotion of disgust evolved in the first place. That is not to excuse the reaction, merely to explain it. I think there are combination of forces. On an instinctual level I would hazard that heterosexual relationships enjoy the perception of purpose and meaning where homosexual relationships do not. On an intellectual level, as I explained, arguing in terms of ""rights"" seems to be the wrong question to be asking in the first place. Between heterosexual and homosexual, yes... in a sense. Perception wise, sure. Consider this: The male sexual mind is easily aroused by a possible sex partner -- indeed, by the faintest hint of a possible sex partner. Zoologists have found that the males of many species will court an enormous range of objects having a vague resemblance to the female: other males, females of the wrong species, females of the right species that have been stuffed and mounted to a board, parts of stuffed females such as a head suspended in midair, even parts of stuffed females with important features missing like the eyes and the mouth. The male of the human species is aroused by the sight of a nude woman, not only in the flesh but in movies, photographs, drawings, postcards, dolls, and bit-mapped cathode-ray-tube displays. It could be that homosexual love or attraction is seen as having no more meaning, purpose or significance than a creature courting a stuffed animal, in comparison to heterosexual love or attraction. Homosexuality might be seen as a variation that occupies the fringes in the normal distribution of human sexuality. In that case heterosexual courtship and marriage is seen to have a purpose that is considered beyond the proximate desire for sex, namely creating new life in the form of children. Even if that purpose is ultimately unrealized if the couple has no children, the attraction is still as valid. If two roomates have an equal desire for sex but only one leaves to seek out sex, neither desire for sex is any less valid than the other just because one roomate acted upon the desire and the other did not. The fact that homosexuals love their partners is irrelevent in this context. There are people who fixate on video game characters, claim to love them and actually attempt to marry them. I believe some successfully have , in other countries (one married his body-pillow with a videogame character on the pillowcase). Also, zoophiles claim to genuinely love their animal partners and I would be hard pressed to say either of these groups are wrong because love is a personal experience. However, I would hazard that the attraction to real females is seen as somehow more 'valid' than the attraction to a videogame character.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","12:39 AM","gay-rights-debates","498"

But anyone who wanted to get married had to meet this criteria which was applied to everyone. This is the same argument that you are using to prove that there is no inequality between hetrosexuals and homosexuals. Yes, there is. A heterosexual couple can get married. A homosexual couple cannot. Your objection is a semantic one. Admittedly, no one has the right to marriage. But again I will reiterate. That is not the issue. The issue is homosexual couples cannot get married while heterosexual couples can. In so doing the government recognizes the heterosexual couple as significant members of the same family and award that couple benefits which include the ability to visit one another in a hospital, the ability to make impotortant life decisions if one of the members should become incompasitated, the ability to cover one another under their insurance, the ability to file taxes jointly, the ability to purchase property together and survivorship rights of said property, inheritance rights, and many others.

The same thing could not be said between heterosexual and homosexual men. Certainly there are overarching themes relating to marriage. You've named at least one yourself.

"05-23-2010","13537",36,"Winston Smith","402744","This is the definition of marriage, the legal definition of marriage in most parts of the world, according to : Dictionary, Encyclopedia and Thesaurus - The Free Dictionary marriage [mrd] n 1. the state or relationship of being husband and wife 2. (Law) a. the legal union or contract made by a man and woman to live as husband and wife This is the definition of wife: wife [waf] n pl wives [wavz] 1. (Law) a man's partner in marriage; a married woman Related adj uxorial 2. an archaic or dialect word for woman Nowhere does it say that because one of two male homosexuals calls the other ""wife"" it means the so called one has become a woman. A transvestite is not a woman. He may dress and make himself up as a woman but a man he remains. A duck is a duck. If legally the definition of ""marriage"" is changed to accomodate homosexual unions so be it. I couldn't care less. words are important, therefore to call two same sex homosexuals living together ""marriage"" is extremely important to them. It legitimizes their union as a normal, community sanctioned union. That is why they don't want a different term for their union. They want to be mainstream, they want to be accepted as normal. They are not, the norm is always by definition the majority not the minority. Unfortunately, or should I say fortunately rather, they are as we all know a minority, otherwise the human race would be a fraction of what it is, which looking at it from the enviromental perspective it would be a good thing. call a duck a duck and a chicken a chicken is the bottom line. two men engaging in sodomy is a sexual practice but a deviant one. Not normal by any definition of the world, unless we are talking of ancient Sodom","Addison48","402876","So there are different definitions for marriage. A transsexual is legally a woman.

Homosexual people are prevented from marrying the ones they love by the government, heterosexuals are not. This isn't a hard concept. The fact that love is not in the legal definition of marriage is irrelevant. The opposition rests on something even flimsier. You claim that homosexuals have the same rights as heterosexuals because homosexuals can marry women is totally preposterous. It is not in anyone's nature to marry someone they're not sexually attracted to, despite the fact that there are exceptions (but there are exceptions to everything). Love is the core of marriage, and if you cannot marry the one you love, you cannot marry. I'm still unclear of your position. You're saying that because homosexual men can marry heterosexual women (and vice versa), everything is dandy and there are no problems?","Sigma","403485","Except I am not asserting we should or should not persue an action based upon the happiness or unhappiness it would generate.

"10-25-2010","13537",44,"Shooterandproud","406013","You misunderstand. I am justifying why it is a right. All traditions are meaningful to some people. That doesn't mean we shouldn't change them. You are being sneaky by not picking a side but still attacking my arguments. You're stating fragmented opinions without forming a conclusion on whether gay marriage should be allowed. Sorry, I should've specified. IF it were allowed, what prevents you from marrying another woman? They're not. The government has no business dictating who marries who. And you don't think it would be a ""large burden"" to marry another woman? You stated a case where the government had to make special accommodations for someone who is different. Why does this standard apply to certain types of people and others not? Homosexuals are incapable of having a happy and successful marriage with someone of the opposite sex. This falls under ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"". Since heterosexuals are provided the means to have a happy marriage and homosexuals are not, homosexuals are not equal to heterosexuals. Loving marriages are not a right, but the means to have them are .","Sigma","415600","Shooterandproud , sorry it's been so long for the reply :P As I understand it you believe marrying whomever you wish should be a right because you don't like the consequences if it is not. That isn't the same thing as this being a right. Whether it should be a right or not is a bit immaterial, since it is very clearly not a right. This can be demonstrated. Yes, traditions can be meaningful! While of course you're right in that we cannot avoid changing traditions on that basis, neither can we ignore that resistance to changing a meaningful custom is reasonable . Given the size, scope, and historical significance of this particular custom, it surprises me not at all that gay right's proponents have had the trouble they have. I'm baffled why gay proponents are surprised by the resistance, and offended by their characterizations of those who oppose them. I'm attacking your arguments for assumptions you should not be making. I assume I'm a woman in this scenario. I'm not sure the thrust of the question. The only barrier to recognition by the government is... recognition by the government. Well, the problem is that it's pretty well accepted that the government can dictate whom we may not marry. Multiple partners, close relatives, same-sex partners, non-human partners and underage partners are all not recognized as legitimate by the government. There is no clear reason why the government has ""no business"" in one of these but is perfectly legitimate in another of these. In other words, if the government can legitimately regulate what is a recognized relationship in any area, you can no longer keep the government out of relationships entirely. Because access to public buildings is a right that everyone has, therefore the government has the responsibility to ensure that reasonable access exists. There exists no right to marry whomever you love, therefore the government has no responsibility to ensure you can marry whom you love. As long as you have the same access to marriage that everyone else has (namely, the same rules apply to everyone equally), then the government's responsibility ends. I deny that is so. At the risk of belaboring our poor wheelchaired man, he has the right to reasonable access to the public building but has no real right to how this is accomplished. If either a ramp or an elevator provide equal access then it would be the discretion of the government which was used. I must point out that marriage, as it is currently thought of, pre-dates the government. The government never provided marriage, it simply gave marriage legal standing. The same wouldn't be true for homosexual unions.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","06:01 PM","gay-rights-debates","656"
