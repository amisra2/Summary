"05-23-2010","13537",36,"JWilliam","402868","Yes, the qualifying criteria for marriage at the time was unequal which is why race was removed from criteria. But anyone who wanted to get married had to meet this criteria which was applied to everyone. This is the same argument that you are using to prove that there is no inequality between hetrosexuals and homosexuals. Yes, there is. A heterosexual couple can get married. A homosexual couple cannot. Your objection is a semantic one. Admittedly, no one has the right to marriage. But again I will reiterate. That is not the issue. The issue is homosexual couples cannot get married while heterosexual couples can. In so doing the government recognizes the heterosexual couple as significant members of the same family and award that couple benefits which include the ability to visit one another in a hospital, the ability to make impotortant life decisions if one of the members should become incompasitated, the ability to cover one another under their insurance, the ability to file taxes jointly, the ability to purchase property together and survivorship rights of said property, inheritance rights, and many others. These priveleges are being denied to homosexual couples. Not people, couples. They are being denied the above privelges not because the don't deserve them but because some people don't like the idea of them having sex.","Sigma","402873","Not the criteria. The effect. Except that neither the qualifying criteria nor the effect is unequal between heterosexual and homosexual individuals. True, but couples do not have rights, individuals do. Agreed. I think it's more complicated than that, but that is essentially so. Heterosexual relationships are perceived as somehow more valid or as having a purpose that homosexual relationships lack. This is true (if ""purpose"" is the right word) on an evolutionary level, so the view has some validity. Of course, that should have no automatic policy implications but it would explain some of the resistance to the idea.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","08:17 PM","gay-rights-debates","526"
"05-23-2010","13537",36,"Sigma","402736","In actuality it was not equal when the races could not marry each other. For example, a black man did not have the right to marry the same women that a white man would have the right to marry. The rules were only superfically the same. Instead it created an inequality. The same thing could not be said between heterosexual and homosexual men. Certainly there are overarching themes relating to marriage. You've named at least one yourself. Marriage, as a custom, was intended for two people who love each other. I would add that marriage, as a custom, was intended to form the basis of a family with children. Neither intention is legally enforcable, of course, but it does color our perceptions.","Addison48","402875","And the rules arnt only superficially the same now with same sex marriage? However I still maintain that they are similar. After all they were banning people from marrying outside of their race. It is true that they werent allowed to marry the exact same people but then again neither are men and women. A man can marry a woman but a woman cannot marry a woman. And a woman can marry a man but a man cant marry a man. So it is still the same thing. Yes it is possible that marriage could have been used back in the day to form the basis of a family with children but whats to stop gay people from raising a child? And marriage has changed throughout the years and that is not the reason to get married anymore. Love is the reason nowadays we get married.

"05-23-2010","13537",36,"Winston Smith","402744","This is the definition of marriage, the legal definition of marriage in most parts of the world, according to : Dictionary, Encyclopedia and Thesaurus - The Free Dictionary marriage [mrd] n 1. the state or relationship of being husband and wife 2. (Law) a. the legal union or contract made by a man and woman to live as husband and wife This is the definition of wife: wife [waf] n pl wives [wavz] 1. (Law) a man's partner in marriage; a married woman Related adj uxorial 2. an archaic or dialect word for woman Nowhere does it say that because one of two male homosexuals calls the other ""wife"" it means the so called one has become a woman. A transvestite is not a woman. He may dress and make himself up as a woman but a man he remains. A duck is a duck. If legally the definition of ""marriage"" is changed to accomodate homosexual unions so be it. I couldn't care less. words are important, therefore to call two same sex homosexuals living together ""marriage"" is extremely important to them. It legitimizes their union as a normal, community sanctioned union. That is why they don't want a different term for their union. They want to be mainstream, they want to be accepted as normal. They are not, the norm is always by definition the majority not the minority. Unfortunately, or should I say fortunately rather, they are as we all know a minority, otherwise the human race would be a fraction of what it is, which looking at it from the enviromental perspective it would be a good thing. call a duck a duck and a chicken a chicken is the bottom line. two men engaging in sodomy is a sexual practice but a deviant one. Not normal by any definition of the world, unless we are talking of ancient Sodom","Addison48","402876","So there are different definitions for marriage. A transsexual is legally a woman. It should be changed to accommodate same sex couples. And we dont want the word marriage to be normal. We want the word marriage to be equal. Completely different. Right call a gay person gay and a straight person gay but call a union of two people marriage. Dont really care if it is normal or not.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","08:36 PM","gay-rights-debates","528"

It is not a gay-rights issue then, but a gender rights issue. The comparison was solely meant to cover homosexual rights versus heterosexual rights. Marriage has changed but not so much the perception of it. Certainly nothing stops a homosexual couple from adopting (aside from local law), but they can never naturally produce a child. Only a heterosexual couple can do that. Since the perception of marriage is a couple in love that forms the basis of a family that they create between them, even adoption would not include a homosexual couple into that vision. I'm not sure anything could. No worries","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","09:05 PM","gay-rights-debates","530"

"05-23-2010","13537",36,"JWilliam","402869","If the called the union between a mam and a woman something else. Would you support it? The issue is not about sex. It's about being legally recognized as a family Exactly. And currently the law is treating homosexuals unfairly based upon something that us not in their control. No need to feel sorry. I am not homosexual.","Winston Smith","402883","we would be back to square one, for whatever they'd call them, you'd want the union between two men to be called the same, right? . again, you have to change the definition of family if necessary not unfairly, just according to reality. You are not treating a chicken unfairly by not calling it a duck, or vice versa. If the law says that marriage is between a man and a woman, that's the law. To bend the law would be wrong.

"05-24-2010","13537",36,"Sigma","402833","Yes, but those are social barriers, not legal ones. The government is not in the business of telling us why we marry someone, whether it is out of love or for some other reason.

Remember our variable? If the question is the rights of homosexuals versus heterosexual then the variable is sexual orientation, not gender. If that's the variable then my argument stands. Heterosexuals have the same rights that homosexuals have and it would not be similar to racial barriers. Like I said, that was only true among nobles and ruling classes. It was a peculiarity forced upon them by their position, not how the 'purpose' was viewed. What do you think all the stories of ""oh I need to marry the prince but I love the stableboy"" stories are all about? It would be similar, today, of marrying someone for the benefits. The overarching theme is and was as a custom for two people who love each other and ""seeing your children in their eyes"", as the song goes. I'm not talking about legal requirements. You don't have to love whom you marry or have children with whom you marry. You don't have to live with them or, indeed, have anything to do with them after you marry. It's a contract, remember? Homosexuals already have the right to marry. They have every right that heterosexuals do.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","06:43 AM","gay-rights-debates","540"
