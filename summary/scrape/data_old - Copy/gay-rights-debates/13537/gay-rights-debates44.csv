"06-29-2010","13537",44,"Sigma","403687","By no means. If, for example, I listed dire, but not illegal, consequences if you are allowed to speak your mind you should reply ""it doesn't matter what the consequences are because I have the right to do it "". It is the same situation here, only in reverse. It doesn't matter what the consequences are because we are discussing whether it is a right or not. Evaluating whether or not we should ""be able to speak your mind"" based upon the happiness or unhappiness it causes is a Utilitarian argument. That is the argument you are attempting to use to justify changing laws. I have not suggested that traditions are intrinsically good, or this custom should be kept because it is traditional. There is no fallacy. I assume you think I'm male. The only thing that would prevent a male marrying another male is the fact that the marriage would not be recognized by the government, so I can only assume you are saying: Marriages between heterosexual people and homosexual people would not be recognized by the government . You contend that there are ""sexual barriers"" that prevent marriage. Now show me how ""sexual barriers"" are the government's responsibility to remedy. Reasonable equal access to public buildings is the responsibility of government to provide. Since wheelchair-bound people would find it a large physical burden to access these buildings with only stairs, reasonable steps are needed to ensure equal access. However, in our situation, homosexual people are physically capable of using stairs but they don't want to. To demand escalators under ""equal access"" would not be reasonable. You have equal access, even if you hate stairs with a passion and refuse to use buildings with stairs, because how much you like using the stairs is not the responsibility of the government.","Shooterandproud","406013","You misunderstand. I am justifying why it is a right. All traditions are meaningful to some people. That doesn't mean we shouldn't change them. You are being sneaky by not picking a side but still attacking my arguments. You're stating fragmented opinions without forming a conclusion on whether gay marriage should be allowed. I asked: What prevents homosexual people from marrying heterosexual people? Your avatar is a man. Of course I thought that. Sorry, I should've specified. IF it were allowed, what prevents you from marrying another woman? They're not. The government has no business dictating who marries who. And you don't think it would be a ""large burden"" to marry another woman? You stated a case where the government had to make special accommodations for someone who is different. Why does this standard apply to certain types of people and others not? Homosexuals are incapable of having a happy and successful marriage with someone of the opposite sex. This falls under ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"". Since heterosexuals are provided the means to have a happy marriage and homosexuals are not, homosexuals are not equal to heterosexuals. Loving marriages are not a right, but the means to have them are . Sorry for the late reply.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","10:00 PM","gay-rights-debates","646"

That isn't the same thing as this being a right. Whether it should be a right or not is a bit immaterial, since it is very clearly not a right. This can be demonstrated. Yes, traditions can be meaningful! While of course you're right in that we cannot avoid changing traditions on that basis, neither can we ignore that resistance to changing a meaningful custom is reasonable . Given the size, scope, and historical significance of this particular custom, it surprises me not at all that gay right's proponents have had the trouble they have. I'm baffled why gay proponents are surprised by the resistance, and offended by their characterizations of those who oppose them. I'm attacking your arguments for assumptions you should not be making. I assume I'm a woman in this scenario. I'm not sure the thrust of the question. The only barrier to recognition by the government is... recognition by the government. Well, the problem is that it's pretty well accepted that the government can dictate whom we may not marry. Multiple partners, close relatives, same-sex partners, non-human partners and underage partners are all not recognized as legitimate by the government. There is no clear reason why the government has ""no business"" in one of these but is perfectly legitimate in another of these. In other words, if the government can legitimately regulate what is a recognized relationship in any area, you can no longer keep the government out of relationships entirely. Because access to public buildings is a right that everyone has, therefore the government has the responsibility to ensure that reasonable access exists. There exists no right to marry whomever you love, therefore the government has no responsibility to ensure you can marry whom you love. As long as you have the same access to marriage that everyone else has (namely, the same rules apply to everyone equally), then the government's responsibility ends. I deny that is so. At the risk of belaboring our poor wheelchaired man, he has the right to reasonable access to the public building but has no real right to how this is accomplished. If either a ramp or an elevator provide equal access then it would be the discretion of the government which was used. I must point out that marriage, as it is currently thought of, pre-dates the government. The government never provided marriage, it simply gave marriage legal standing. The same wouldn't be true for homosexual unions.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","06:01 PM","gay-rights-debates","656"
