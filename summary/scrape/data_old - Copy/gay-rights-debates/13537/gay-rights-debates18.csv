"11-22-2009","13537",18,"gayhumanist","379691","Well yes. That's because of your circular fallacies. There isn't general agreement that being gay is a perversion. Ball's back in your court.? So what if allowing gays to marry will encourage gays? You could then say allowing straights to marry encourages straights. Why is gay encouragement any skin off your back if you like being straight?","gansao","379694","perversion (pr-vrzhn, -shn) n. 1. a. The act of perverting. b. The state of being perverted. 2. A sexual practice or act considered abnormal or deviant. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- deviant (dv-nt) adj. Differing from a norm or from the accepted standards of a society. n. One that differs from a norm, especially a person whose behavior and attitudes differ from accepted that was easy Yes allowing straights to marry encourages straights.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","03:37 PM","gay-rights-debates","258"
"11-22-2009","13537",18,"gayhumanist","379692","Yes it is, and a crackpot one at that.? You're making this claim. The onus is on you to provide evidence and logic, proof, to support it..? How likely is the latter to happen?","gansao","379695","Gays like you prove it I have but you , unsurprisingly, refuse to accept it All the more reason for not allowing sexual perverts to marry","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","03:40 PM","gay-rights-debates","259"
"11-22-2009","13537",18,"gayhumanist","379705","Yet another unsubstantiated assertion.. No. See above... You're using bigotry to support bigotry.","gansao","379709","It has been quite well substantiated by you and your gay friends Yes, see above Calling sexual perverts sexual perverts is not bigotry","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","04:28 PM","gay-rights-debates","262"
"11-23-2009","13537",18,"gansao","379669","We should make homosexuality illegal","jazyjason","379732","Yes yes and go back to the days of Hitler and the Pink Triangles... Have you learned NOTHING of history and the suffering of others? Or do you refuse to acknowledge such things and turn a blind eye to the very real and vivid suffering of human beings at the hands of sinister evil and hate? Just tonight I attended a candle light vigil in West Hollywood for the tow most recent gay victims of violence. one 15, one 19. Both brutally murdered, one raped by his uncle before being stabbed in the head and neck then having his body tossed in a closet. Fitting is it not? I refuse to allow your shallow ignorant ramblings to gain any ground period. You refuse to see or feel our suffering. You have not read the accounts of those persecuted under Hitler, those Gays who made it out but could not tell their stories due to the laws of the time. Those who were still trapped in their lives despite being liberated out of the death camps. Do not make so light the love and commitment of others to those whom they profess to love. I would fight to the death to preserve my love for my partner, and I surely would not stand idly by and allow someone to take away that love for whatever reason...","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","03:28 AM","gay-rights-debates","264"
"11-23-2009","13537",18,"jitobear","379511","This then implies that homosexuals are are not part of the public and the law-makers are not their servants as well, and that you do indeed believe it is your right to allow and disallow things to your fellow citizens. That they are lesser group than you . You just proved your hate.","JPSartre12","379801","You made a rather large leap of logic above. One can certainly feel superior to another group without hating that group. Take, for instance, the mentally and/or physically disabled. You can feel superior to a Down Syndrome person and not hate that person. In fact, most would have a positive inclination to help this perceived ""inferior"" person, so your comment above is illogical or incomplete.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","01:09 PM","gay-rights-debates","265"

Drama queen! I never suggest you all deserved the death camps but given the choice of making you pariahs or equals..I'd go for the pariah option. Your chaste and pure love affair comes across like a Barbara Cartland novel until the deviant sex starts ..then its Jackie Collins all the way...","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","04:50 PM","gay-rights-debates","266"
"11-23-2009","13537",18,"gayhumanist","379711","Like foundit said, objecting to a group discriminating against another group, does not mean you support discrimination against the group discriminating. That's messed up, and muddled like all your other thinking. Childish. It is when there is absolutely no reason for it that even apporaches anything logical.","gansao","379839","Just as I suspected . You do not have a feasible argument","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","04:52 PM","gay-rights-debates","267"

Am I chasing after heterosexual men or preying upon others? No. So don't call me a pervert just because all you can think of when it comes to gay people is sex. And I never said accept the love me and my partner share. I could care less if you accepted anything! You think I am trying to change your mindset? Certainly not. Only from oneself can the heart be changed in all matters.. Yes but you certainly said make homosexuality illegal which was exactly done in the days of Hitler and Franco resulting in the deaths of thousands upon thousands of gay people! And once again there with the sex.. You know I just have to wonder why are you so obsessed with what I do behind closed doors? Why do you make it a point to fling that little tidbit out at every turn? Have I ever said what I have done in the bedroom? No! Have I ever implied having others accept what I do privately? Of course not.. But then again this is only one element. And all you rant about is the sex part. Have you not read my previous posts saying that my partner and I have not engaged in sexual intercourse? Due to our own personal reasons for each other and that we value our relationship on a deeper level than that? I guess you skipped over that part.. Seriously I think you and Easy both need some form of counseling on your obsession of sex. And not just sex but same gender sex.. In all my time on these boards you two are the most who have at every turn of every post made some reference to intercourse... I wonder if there is not a deeper underlying reason for this...","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","05:03 PM","gay-rights-debates","268"

Are you sure I couldn't encourage you, there, gansao? Don't worry, it will never happen. That IS most certainly a statement of insecurity. People secure in their heterosexual identity or way of life, have nothing to concern themselves with if gays are being accepted.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","10:33 PM","gay-rights-debates","270"
