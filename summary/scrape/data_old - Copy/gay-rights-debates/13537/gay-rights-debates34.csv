It legitimizes their union as a normal, community sanctioned union. That is why they don't want a different term for their union. They want to be mainstream, they want to be accepted as normal. They are not, the norm is always by definition the majority not the minority. Unfortunately, or should I say fortunately rather, they are as we all know a minority, otherwise the human race would be a fraction of what it is, which looking at it from the enviromental perspective it would be a good thing. call a duck a duck and a chicken a chicken is the bottom line. two men engaging in sodomy is a sexual practice but a deviant one.

Love is not legally part of marriage for this reason, and we have no right to have it. There is no right that heterosexual people have that homosexual people do not, since the requirements of marriage are the same for us all. Those who are unmarried, gay or straight, have the same rights. This is why speaking about marriage in terms of rights isn't compelling to most people, I think. A more overarching theme is two people who love each other marry and have a family (meaning: have children).","JWilliam","402640","The point is that unmarried heterosexual couples can get married and unmarried homosexual couples cannot.

I realize there is a certain amount of sophistry with that line of reasoning since the two groups don't wish to marry the same people, but it is not false statement. This renders the entire ""gay rights"" argument, as I know it at least, null since the current state of affairs is equal in terms of rights. Oh, I don't think there is much if any misunderstanding or even fear. ""Disgust"" is more likely the emotion involved since disgust is an other-condemning emotion in one of the three moral spheres. It would be similar to the instinctual repulsion toward sex with siblings, which would inspire a ""disgust"" reaction. The only fear that would manifest would be a fear of contamination, since that is why the emotion of disgust evolved in the first place. That is not to excuse the reaction, merely to explain it. I think there are combination of forces. On an instinctual level I would hazard that heterosexual relationships enjoy the perception of purpose and meaning where homosexual relationships do not. On an intellectual level, as I explained, arguing in terms of ""rights"" seems to be the wrong question to be asking in the first place. Between heterosexual and homosexual, yes... in a sense. Perception wise, sure. Consider this: The male sexual mind is easily aroused by a possible sex partner -- indeed, by the faintest hint of a possible sex partner. Zoologists have found that the males of many species will court an enormous range of objects having a vague resemblance to the female: other males, females of the wrong species, females of the right species that have been stuffed and mounted to a board, parts of stuffed females such as a head suspended in midair, even parts of stuffed females with important features missing like the eyes and the mouth. The male of the human species is aroused by the sight of a nude woman, not only in the flesh but in movies, photographs, drawings, postcards, dolls, and bit-mapped cathode-ray-tube displays. It could be that homosexual love or attraction is seen as having no more meaning, purpose or significance than a creature courting a stuffed animal, in comparison to heterosexual love or attraction. Homosexuality might be seen as a variation that occupies the fringes in the normal distribution of human sexuality. In that case heterosexual courtship and marriage is seen to have a purpose that is considered beyond the proximate desire for sex, namely creating new life in the form of children. Even if that purpose is ultimately unrealized if the couple has no children, the attraction is still as valid. If two roomates have an equal desire for sex but only one leaves to seek out sex, neither desire for sex is any less valid than the other just because one roomate acted upon the desire and the other did not. The fact that homosexuals love their partners is irrelevent in this context. There are people who fixate on video game characters, claim to love them and actually attempt to marry them. I believe some successfully have , in other countries (one married his body-pillow with a videogame character on the pillowcase). Also, zoophiles claim to genuinely love their animal partners and I would be hard pressed to say either of these groups are wrong because love is a personal experience. However, I would hazard that the attraction to real females is seen as somehow more 'valid' than the attraction to a videogame character.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","12:39 AM","gay-rights-debates","498"

Among nobility and the ruling class, sure, and love was not usually part of the bargain. Even then the purpose was for the couple to have children that were the heir to both houses. Love was for the lucky while children were expected.

The equal rights you dipict regarding gay marriage are just as superficial as the equal rights you condemn regarding interracial marriage.

These rights are the same, superficial as you have stated but the same. As it stands now the selective qualifer for marital rights is ""of the opposite sex"". So yes, a gay man has the right to marry same women as a straight man. But that is not point, is it? That's not what this fight is about.
