This straight gal is here to tell you most people really don't care about the sex lives of other adults and current stats show that with the exception of gay marriage that most people support equal rights for gays and believe homosexuality is perfectly acceptable.. My son's (adoptive) father is gay, is a marvelous father and one the greatest blessings in our life. My old man is one these big macho, traditional, conservative types and my son's father a hundred times the man and father my father is. Frankly, he is one of the best fathers I have ever known. Denying needing children a loving parent(s) to satiate you bigotry, now THAT is a crime.","gansao","378271","No they dont, most people do not trust gays Good for you.
