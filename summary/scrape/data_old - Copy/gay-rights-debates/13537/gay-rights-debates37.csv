That is a de facto legal barrier. You say to gay men, ""you may marry any woman you like"". That is a ""let them eat cake"" sentiment. I know you must see this point.

This would be similar to saying you have the right to vote democrat. Now a republican still has the right to vote but would have no intention of doing so as their vote will not be representative of their choice.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","09:20 AM","gay-rights-debates","544"

It would be like saying I am barred from veteren benefts because I am unable or unwilling to join the armed forces. If a homosexual does not want to marry a woman because he doesn't love her that is a social concern. The legalities of marriage don't require or even expect love in a marriage. I believe the primaries operate similar to this. You can only vote for the party you are registered to vote for, not whom you want to vote for.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","12:04 PM","gay-rights-debates","545"
"05-24-2010","13537",37,"Winston Smith","402909","No, we don't allow marriage based on same sex couples. So, you have to be in love to get married? is that a legal requisite ?","Addison48","402962","Never said we allow same sex marriage. However in certain states we do. Also never said love was a legal requisite to marriage. I said the reason people (at least most of them) get married is because of love.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","12:46 PM","gay-rights-debates","546"
"05-24-2010","13537",37,"Sigma","402924","No, like I said the case could be made for gender rights but not gay rights. Remember our variable? If the question is the rights of homosexuals versus heterosexual then the variable is sexual orientation, not gender. If that's the variable then my argument stands. Heterosexuals have the same rights that homosexuals have and it would not be similar to racial barriers. Like I said, that was only true among nobles and ruling classes. It was a peculiarity forced upon them by their position, not how the 'purpose' was viewed. What do you think all the stories of ""oh I need to marry the prince but I love the stableboy"" stories are all about? It would be similar, today, of marrying someone for the benefits. The overarching theme is and was as a custom for two people who love each other and ""seeing your children in their eyes"", as the song goes. I'm not talking about legal requirements. You don't have to love whom you marry or have children with whom you marry. You don't have to live with them or, indeed, have anything to do with them after you marry. It's a contract, remember? Homosexuals already have the right to marry. They have every right that heterosexuals do.","Addison48","402964","So you still dont think the ban on same sex marriage is just like the ban on interracial marriage? How so? But if you want to change the variable to gender inequality then fine by me. The genders are not equal due to the same sex marriage ban. Yes it was only between the higher classes...much like many things in society back then. Ok so if you dont have to have the ability to have children to get married then why are you using that as an argument against same sex marriage? Homosexuals do NOT have the right to marry who they love. Much like in the case of Loving vs. Virginia. Would you say that back in the day that interracial couples had the same exact rights to get married as non interracial couples? What is your reason to not allow same sex marriage. What harm would it do?","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","12:53 PM","gay-rights-debates","547"

You'd have a much better case because gay people are not denied any rights. I'm not arguing against homosexual marriage. I'm countering the argument that homosexuals are denied rights. Marrying whom you love isn't a right. Loving whom you marry isn't a right. If the variable was race, then black men could not marry the same women that white men could marry. That isn't equal. In this case if the variable is sexual orientation then homosexuals can marry the exact same people heterosexuals can. The gay rights issue is dissimilar to the race issue.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","01:03 PM","gay-rights-debates","550"

You would have to add a qualifier such as ""barring opposite sex couple from getting married to those they love "" in order for that statement to be correct.

Now do you agree same sex marriage should be legalized? Although since the Supreme court has decided that marriage is indeed a basic civil right and they also decided that the 14th amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by racial discrimination and since I showed that not allowing gay people to marry a member of the same sex is indeed the same thing as not allowing interracial couples to marry then I would still have to say gay people do not have the equal right to marry. Ok then. Why are you using that as a counter argument that homosexuals are denied rights? Choosing who you marry is however a right. Now about the fourth line on the variable being race. Lets pretend that interracial couples still arnt allowed to get married. Who exactly would you say is being denied their rights? Non interracial couples or interracial couples or both?","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","01:18 PM","gay-rights-debates","552"
