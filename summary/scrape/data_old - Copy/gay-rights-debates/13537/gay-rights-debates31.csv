"05-18-2010","13537",31,"Matthew S","402284","That is the whole point isn't it. Marriage is a contract between the state and the two people involved. The whole ironic thing is to the anti gay christianists that are so opposed to gay marries the religious marriage is what counts and is the important aspect but they can not stop gay people from getting religious marriage only the contract from the state, which to the anti gay christianists means nothing. How are they harmed if two men they do not know sign a contract with the state. Are they going to be offended If I form a corporation? It is none of their business, just as their marriages are none of my business. Yes they are forced to have to accept same sex marriages big f'n deal I am forced to accept their hetero marriages. They didn't ask my permission if they could get married so why should I have to ask their permission?","Sigma","402286","I suppose. I'm not religious, so what Christians do is pretty meaningless to me. I would not claim anyone is harmed. But we all have to live in this society, so the official policies are our business. Your threat here is empty since heterosexual marriage is the status quo . You have to justify changes you wish to make to the status quo, but what currently is in place doesn't need justification.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","10:16 PM","gay-rights-debates","451"
"05-18-2010","13537",31,"Sigma","402269","To be fair, there are other restrictions as well. However, you missed the point of what I posted. To the vast majority of people the custom of marriage is much more meaningful than simply a contract. Since that custom has historically not included homosexuals, it would have to be changed... and when you change something that is so meaningful, you will meet resistance. Also, not being qualified for certain benefits is not denying your rights. I do not qualify for veteren benefits because I am not a veteren, for example. You are in the same boat as every unmarried American, gay or straight. It's not an argument. It's a fact. Heterosexual sex can naturally produce offspring. Homosexual sex cannot. It is a significant fact, but that's all it is. The fact that heterosexual couples can naturally produce children is a significant fact. I daresay that the majority of people would agree with me on that score. It does not automatically have policy implications but it does support the view that heterosexual attraction and the formalization of that attraction (read: marriage) is different or should be different from homosexual attraction. It is not that any particular person is unable to have children, it is more that a homosexual relationship cannot naturally produce children. This fact has nothing to do with legal rights, but it influences how that relationship is viewed in relation to heterosexual relationships.","JWilliam","402291","I completely understand this. But the point I'm making is that it's the legal side of marriage that homosexuals are being denied. Veterans qualify for veteran benefits because they choose their country over their life. And our country is giving back to them. What qualifies heterosexuals over homosexuals in regards to marriage benefits? I was referring to the argument that heterosexuals deserve marriage benefits because they produce offspring. I agree. You even have my support in this. However, is still not a valid reason to deny a homosexuals marriage rights. It does if your granting priveleges to one group as opposed to the other. Are you implying that if they used a term other ""marriage"", say ""civil union"", there wouldn't be a problem? Neither can a heterosexual relationship in which one person is sterile. What if homosexuals donated their sperm and eggs? Could they qualify for marriage benefits? The point is that the gay rights issue has everything to do with rights. Homosexuals are not fighting for the right to be gay. They are fighting to be recognized by the state so that when the find the person they love they can obtain the inheirtance rights, the property rights and the medical rights that heterosexual couples can.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","10:47 PM","gay-rights-debates","452"

If you will excuse using you as an example: Marriage is not denied to you, if you accept the restrictions on the choice of partner. Similarly, if I wished qualify for veteren benefits I would have to serve my country. Neither of us have a right to these benefits, we have to qualify for them. No, I'm saying that I think a majority of people view heterosexual attraction as somehow more valid, or at least different in a significant way, because that type of relationship has the capability to produce children. Imo, resistance to the idea of changing the custom of marriage is an expression of this belief that heterosexual relationships are different in some significant way. I think that is a valid belief to have, and I mourn that it is commonly disregarded as unimportant by gay-rights proponents. Heterosexual relationships are the only type of relationship that can produce children. This is true even if a percentage are unable to have children or are voluntarily childless. As I said, it doesn't matter whether any particular person or couple can have children, it is the type of relationship or sexual behavior that I'm concerned with. Couples don't have rights, individuals do. Unmarried people don't have marriage benefits because they are not married. Unmarried individuals do not qualify for marriage benefits in a similar way that I do not qualify for veteren benefits. I do not have a right to marriage benefits if unmarried. I do not have a right to veteren benefits if not a veteren. Unmarried people, gay or straight, are not denied any rights because they are not married (at least, they better not be denied any rights). Granted, homosexual people cannot marry whom they love. That is tragic, and I truly sympathize. But speaking about marriage in terms of rights is, imo, erroneous. Love is not a right (at least, not one the gov't can help with). Loving whom you are married to is not a right. Marrying whomever you love is not a right.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","11:39 PM","gay-rights-debates","454"

In any formal debate the burden is upon the challenger to show the significance and harm that the status quo does not already solve. If the solvency is inherent with the status quo then the proposed change should be rejected. In the same way innocence doesn't need to be proven (since it's presumed), the burden of proof is on those who want to change the status quo.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","11:47 PM","gay-rights-debates","455"

Christianity/religion is so ingrained in culture in such a widespread way you might as well just be saying that it was the public that did this. It was still the overwhelming will of the people. - Those examples are of things that DID go through a process of the determination by the will of the people. Until enough of the public approved, slaves were still slaves. Society had to be convinced to some degree before things could get to the point where they could change. Same-gender hooking-up qualifying as reason to change marriage isn't passing that process for the most part, particularly on the federal level. In the few states it HAS done so, it's often had to do so by belligerently running counter to the will of the people. But it's a strategy that won't last. - But more importantly, the examples you gave aren't examples of people trying to redefine marriage. - And even more importantly, the example of gay relations is a behavior-defined issue, whereas slavery/civil-rights was a race-defined issue.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","10:04 AM","gay-rights-debates","459"
