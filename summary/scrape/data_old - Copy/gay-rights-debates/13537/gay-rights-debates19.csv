"11-23-2009","13537",19,"gansao","379851","When the gays paint themselves into a corner they always come out with the old chestnut that I you criticise gay sex you must be gay...yawn. I have stated that I believe gays should be allowed to do whatever they want to each other but should not be allowed to 'marry' or encourage anyone else to engage in their own perverted life style.","jazyjason","379909","I never implied your gay. I was pointing out that you obsess about what other people do in the bedroom and then use it as a means to dictate what rights those people should have solely based upon your perceived notion.. Also you give a double standard here. You do not care what gay people do supposedly sex wise but you want to refute them the right to marry in a private ceremony that in no way includes you or forces you in anyway... And how do you encourage people to be gay? Drop them off at the nearest A&F and say have at it? Please... You are once again going off the same old stereotypes that you can teach someone to be gay or as the sinister fundamentalists would put it ""indoctrinate""...","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","11:29 PM","gay-rights-debates","273"

"11-24-2009","13537",19,"gayhumanist","379899","OOOhh. Are you sure I couldn't encourage you, there, gansao? Don't worry, it will never happen. That IS most certainly a statement of insecurity. People secure in their heterosexual identity or way of life, have nothing to concern themselves with if gays are being accepted.","gansao","380011","so if one disagrees with pedophilia, incest or animal sex they must, by your argument be latent pedophiles, incestuous and long to have sex with animals...its rubbish and you know it.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","05:04 PM","gay-rights-debates","277"

There are rational reasons to object to those things. Not so with sexual actions or attractions between adult males.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","06:33 PM","gay-rights-debates","280"

I don't see what concern it is of theirs if it is encouraged. Unless they worry it might be encouraging. I say, go for it, go for it!","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","06:37 PM","gay-rights-debates","281"

I've never been around them much but they seem to be therapeutic animals in a sense. Kind of like when I watched a documentary on how inmates lives are transformed when they train and develop a bond with horses as part of rehabilitation.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","09:42 PM","gay-rights-debates","284"
