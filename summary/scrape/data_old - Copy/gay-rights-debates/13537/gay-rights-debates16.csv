"11-21-2009","13537",16,"gayhumanist","379505","Opposing same-sex marriage is hate. Society has never opposed a group's equality, with no rational reason, when that reason isn't hate, insecurity, fear. And it isn't long when debating with opponents that their hatred comes out very blantantly. Archangel's argument is laughable. He says they don't hate us as individuals, just everything we represent as being wrong, unnatural etc. That boils down to the same thing! Gansao condescends to us by calling us spoiled children because the majority group with power won't ""let us have"", what they have.","gansao","379507","Its not hate. It is drawing a line where pandering to sexual deviants stop.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","02:40 PM","gay-rights-debates","227"

That they are lesser group than you. You just proved your hate.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","02:43 PM","gay-rights-debates","230"

Most people do not care what gay people do sexually. At any rate, you don't have a problem with gay persons having sex, I believe you said. Why does it suddenly make a difference because it's happening in a marriage? Why should the official recognition of gay relationships affect you? It's your own insecurity coming to light.","gay-marriage-opponents-keep-streak-alive","02:50 PM","gay-rights-debates","235"
