Pretty much every commentator I've read believes the Supreme Court certainly will take it up.","Xcaliber","448871","Chances are they will take up the DOMA case before they take this one and when DOMA is ruled unconstitutional and repealed this case becomes a non issue and the Supreme Court will most likely refuse to hear it leaving the 9th District ruling as the final word.","court-calif-ban-gay-marriage-unconstitutional","02:15 PM","gay-rights-debates","16"
"02-08-2012","16111",2,"Xcaliber","448870","Look doofus, the Supreme Court has already ruled 14 times that Marriage is a Fundamental Right.. they are never going to uphold a Law which tramples on the rights of American Citizens... no matter how much you pray for it.","Freedom","448884","Support this. Derive the right to marriage, define it objectively, prove DOMA contradicts it.","court-calif-ban-gay-marriage-unconstitutional","08:22 PM","gay-rights-debates","17"

To go to Hades requires a belief in the Greek God of the underworld. The western half of San Francisco would slide north west and up not fall into the ground.

Pretty much every commentator I've read believes the Supreme Court certainly will take it up.","jazyjason","448911","I doubt it. Simply because the ruling is so narrow and only deals with California. The ruling itself is not rather gay marriage but a minority having a right then the majority taking that right away. That in and of itself is unconstitutional.","court-calif-ban-gay-marriage-unconstitutional","02:32 PM","gay-rights-debates","25"
"02-09-2012","16111",2,"Easyrider","448830","What a surprise. The pro Sodom and Gomorrah 9th Circus Court of most overturned decisions makes Jazy's day. Well, there's a higher court, both on earth and in heaven, and your little butt-headed, constitutionally-challenged liberal jurists are themselves going to take this ruling right in their shorts.","jazyjason","448912","Well at least we all know your wasting valuable oxygen with your mouth breathing.
