"02-27-2011","15071",2,"gansao","424905","So it follows that gay couples who are not a mating pair( because they cannot) must be equated to a childless couple...this is dishonest.","jyoshu","424906","In this case, I have to agree with you. An infertile couple that's a man and woman is hindered by a certain type of procreative handicap , so infertility really isn't part of the issue. Marriage still mainly exists because of procreation which a same-gender couple cannot do.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","02:52 PM","gay-rights-debates","16"
"02-27-2011","15071",2,"snakespit","424888","That's your definition. It is certainly not my definition. You don't speak for all of society. If marriage is about reproduction, why does nobody bat an eye when a 65 year old woman marries a 68 year old man? If you believe marriage is ""formalization of a mating pair"", and ""reproduction is implied"", doesn't this cheapen the institution of marriage in your eyes? Obviously, they are not getting married to start a family...perhaps love is what is important?","Sigma","424911","Mating pairs exist with or without marriage, and have no legal connection with marriage (since, legally, it doesn't matter if the two people even like one another, or ever intend on consumating said marriage). The only connection between a mating couple and marriage is the connection made on a cultural level. So, logically, the cultural meaning of marriage would be the purpose of a mating couple. While 'purpose' can mean different things, in this context I daresay most would refer to the evolutionary purpose of a mating couple: reproduction. Love is implied because love brings the couple together for that purpose. While legally a 27yr old marrying a 70yr old sugar daddy is not a problem, culturally speaking this marriage is not as meaningful as one that is in-line with the evolutionary purpose I outlined above. You can point to exceptions all you want, but all it does is outline the difference between the legal meaning and the cultural meaning of marriage.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","03:26 PM","gay-rights-debates","17"
"02-27-2011","15071",2,"pappillion001","424899","That is only one cultural meaning. Older couples who had no intention of creating a family unit as well as those who simply didn't want children are accepted without a second thought. And why is that? In a world that has been ruled by male dominance where homosexuality was and is still considered a weakness or failing there has only recently been any serious attempt to change the perception. The fact that women were property that fathers used to the benefit of the family has evolved into an equal partnership (mostly). Marriage has many definitions and purposes especially if looked at over the last several thousand years, making the view of tradition or culture subject to the desires of the society. Traditionalist can hold onto the way they know and feel comfortable with, but same sex couples wouldn't take that away. Nothing would prevent straight couples from the exact same marriage whether gay people can marry or not.","Sigma","424913","Yes, but they are anamolies. It's culturally assumed that people will eventually want children (especially women) even if in actuality it does not always happen. The stereotype is true often enough that the anomalies are just that, anomalies. The driving force behind marriage is not changed by the existence of individual idiosyncrasies any more than the definition of a species changes simply because some members are unable to reproduce (a species is defined by a population able to reproduce amongst themselves). Well, yes, homosexuals have to take away the traditional view of marriage. Homosexuals have to change the definition of marriage in order to be included. Both the cultural and legal meaning of marriage specifically excludes homosexuals. Yes, the meaning of marriage can change. Homosexuals are trying to do that right now. I'm not saying it's necessarily good or bad to change the meaning of marriage, but it absolutely must happen in order for homosexuals to be included. As a consequence of this, homosexuals will not enjoy the cultural and traditional meaning of marriage, because marriage will no longer have the cultural and traditional meaning that it once did.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","03:34 PM","gay-rights-debates","18"
"02-27-2011","15071",2,"Matthew S","424903","Nonsense Two 70 year old heteros on their 3 or 4th marriages are hardly going to have children. So as long as people beyond breeding age are allowed to contract marriage there is nothing wrong with gay people enetring marriage.","Sigma","424914","Only if you reduce the meaning of marriage to a contract between two people. In that case you've stripped any and all cultural meaning from the practice and homosexual marriage would be no more meaningful than two friends becoming married for the benefits. I would not view that as a happy occurance.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","03:39 PM","gay-rights-debates","19"

Other forms of marriage produce children. Indeed, it would be much more productive if your financial status were also considered - rich men get to marry several women as they can afford to support them and their children (this model is prevalant in the Bible - how's that for tradition?). Rich women could afford to support many men - nope, that's no good because you still only have one baby machine (never mind). Besides which, with resources becoming more scarce, what's with the ' we gotta keep producing loadsa sprogs ' ideology? We only need to produce enough to continue the line, and we are certainly managing that. In fact we produce to many of the damn things. Why not let the gays look after the surplus, and let them have the rights in payment for this service?","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","03:47 PM","gay-rights-debates","20"

The fact that so many marriages fail or that so many modern marriages fail to live up to its traditional meaning suggests that society needs to redefine marriage not to include homosexuals. That would just legitimise the failures.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","04:05 PM","gay-rights-debates","22"

Marriage is considered a formalization of that bond, but it does not create that bond. While a man can have sex with many women, it is always an iteration of the male-female couple. Evolution doesn't look that far ahead. Or look ahead at all.

Maybe in a Religious Culture, but Religion doesn't define all of us. With Adoption available there is no longer a Need to re-produce. There are married couples who are not Able to reproduce, so why are they any different that a Gay Couple?. Should be not recognize an older couple who got married but are not able to produce children? Suppose a woman has Ovarian Cancer when young and is unable to have children should we then tell her she can't marry the one she loves because they won't produce a child?. We all know that Gay Couples can't reproduce in the old fashioned way but they can and have adopt children and raise them as well as a straight couple.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","06:53 PM","gay-rights-debates","29"

You started out by saying that it was to do with producing children. When examples of 'mating pairs' who couldn't actually produce children, and other alternatives that produce children more efficiently, were brought to your attention you had to come up with some trick that would exclude the alternatives. The 'mating pair'! Very clever. Complete bollocks, but very clever.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","07:11 PM","gay-rights-debates","30"
