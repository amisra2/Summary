"03-05-2011","15071",7,"Matthew S","425316","If marriage is to be about breeders and breeding children, and my rules are adopted by the state then yes I am alright. If my rules were adopted then almost no one would get married, and those who get married have to breed if they don't they are no longer married. They have to have 3 witnesses to their act of breeding, along with a video of the event stored in the public records of the county were they live.","gansao","425317","I would add that the only breeding pairs allowed would be one of each sex( thats is no turkey baster sex with sub contracted female ) Therefore the child would have both a male and female parent. All one sex parenting would be prohibited. Marriage would be elevated to a privilege only to be allowed for the most physically fit and intelligent individuals and would have to be a life commitment( or at least until the children grew up) The fact that gays would not be allowed( or at least severly discouraged) to actually breed may result in far fewer homosexuals..that is if it is indeed a genetic condition Why you feel the need for three witnesses attending the ' breeders' sexual act I cannot imagine","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","07:18 AM","gay-rights-debates","91"

One wants to make sure they understand the seriousness of the legal contract they are entering to breed children for the state.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","08:14 AM","gay-rights-debates","92"

Why not for themselves? The contract would be the marriage not the sexual intercourse..a dna test of the baby would confirm that it was a result of sex between the couple. A 'breeding' couple would most likely have a bond that no homosexual couple could imagine... the same as all heterosexual couples that produce children between themselves. The very best that a homosexual couple can offer a child is an equivalent of a dysfunctional heterosexual family. I agree that couples should be forced to make a binding commitment and be vetted before they are allowed to produce children. In the past marriage was considered a lifelong commitment and the ability to provide for the children relied on the parents health and wealth. Children from poor unhealthy parents were more likely to die than rich healthy ones and a couple that did not stay together became social pariahs. Homosexuals had no place in their understanding of marriage, no more than the ' breeder' style of marriage that you have dreamed up. Also in the past marriages were arranged by wealthy families with the couple carefully picked and the females were relied upon to produce heirs for the husbands..they also had a custom of looking at the the sheets after the couple consumated the marriage to see if they had intercourse and that the newlywed wife was a virgin. In fact you could say that you the idea you dreamed up is a relic of the past that excludes homosexuals from marrying...well done","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","08:59 AM","gay-rights-debates","93"
"03-05-2011","15071",7,"Matthew S","425316","Once again the state of Iowa issues one piece of paper to everyone. What part of that do you not understand? The other states and the federal government must recognize all or none. If marriage is to be about breeders and breeding children, and my rules are adopted by the state then yes I am alright.","Sigma","425327","I understand every part of that. Nothing makes States recognize all or none, Matthew S . In fact, it's been true since the ratification that States establish their own marriage laws... and anyone in the State is subject to those marriage laws. It doesn't matter what other States say about your marriage because you're not in those States. No you aren't because some people would have marriage benefits but you will not. You've been very vocal that if anyone gets marriage benefits when you do not then it must be unconstitutional. Are you now saying that it's perfectly Constitutional for only some people to get marriage benefits? And you're wrong, of course. People would get married. Besides 'having witnesses' (which is for the signing of the contract not the execution, duh), a lifelong relationship with children is the ideal marriage. It's what people hope to have.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","09:56 AM","gay-rights-debates","94"

At some point you'll have to realize that biological differences exist and sometimes that has ramifications for how you're treated. It's a bit like being left-handed; the world is sort of built around people being rightys. Sorry. You're sitting there demanding the world be changed to suit leftys as if it is your due, while at the same time casually denying that anything was made for rightys in the first place. It's insulting, ignorant and arrogant. I'd oppose you for those reasons alone :P You can . You really can. All you need is for a lot of people to agree with you.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","01:26 PM","gay-rights-debates","99"
