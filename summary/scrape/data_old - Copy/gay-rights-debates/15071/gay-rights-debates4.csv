"02-28-2011","15071",4,"smiley","424970","Are gay people not people? A group does not reproduce? What complete and utter rubbish. Note the phrase 'In one form or another'. This tends to suggests that there are other forms of marriage. Why prohibit all but one? This suggests that groups also provide meaning. Why prohibit them? If non-productive couples do not detract from the meaning of marriage, why balk against gay non-productive couples being allowed to share in that meaning? Customs such as the marriage of 1 man to many women (examples of which occur throughout history both within and without the bible), the marriage of 1 woman to many men (this tends to occur in cultures with a short supply of females), the marriage of two men (from roman and greek history), the marriage of 1 man, 1 woman and an additional homosexual shaman (a sign of good fortune in some native american cultures). These customs and more are ancient and have provided meaning to marriage for many throughout the years, yet you ignore them all in favour of your narrow and discriminatory view of marriage.","Sigma","424974","The question was a rhetorical device. Your question had no informational value. Since, biologically speaking, only a heterosexual couple can reproduce, I think I stand on pretty solid ground here. I'm not suggesting we prohibit anything. A group provides meaning only insofar as it is composed of heterosexual couples. I'm not suggesting we prohibit group marriage, though. As I explained before: non-reproductive members are still members of the species... but other species are not part of the population we are talking about. In this analogy, homosexuals are not part of the population. In roman and greek history, it was not homosexual marriage. At least as we understand it. Being penetrated feminized the recipient which carried a social stigma. Men would kill each other for being propositioned because it threatened their masculinity. As to the rest, it didn't occur to me that you'd want to talk about them. If you like, we can talk about Arab nations who prefer to have sex with little boys, and just use women for reproduction. But, yes, even for those ancient customs, those who were a part of that culture certainly found meaning in participating in those relationships. Plural marriage especially, the culture feels it's an obligation to have more than 1 wife. Efforts to change the custom would naturally find resistance in those who find meaning in those customs. That is certainly evidenced by LDS members who defy the prohibition on plural marriage.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","09:55 AM","gay-rights-debates","46"

I was merely asking if gay people fall into that category. And I think you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Of course groups reproduce. Whole species would die out if this were not the case. Okay, not those that reproduce asexually. Really? You appear to be saying that 1 man 1 woman is the only way to go. Am I wrong in this conclusion? It appears I am mistaken. Sorry. But you still seem to be saying that heterosexual couples are the only means of providing meaning to marriage. Isn't that a little presumptuous? Can no-one else experience meaning in a relationship? Wow! Why are homosexuals not part of the population? You must come from a very isolated region not to have seen them. But it was marriage between 2 men nonetheless. In fact they were quite common until Christianity bacame the official religion of the Roman Empire. At least you now admit that meaning can be found in marriage arrangements other than your chosen form. And I notice that you are trying to sneak in examples where harm is done to one party, which is not the case in modern homosexual relationships (at least no more than in modern heterosexual relationships).","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","10:49 AM","gay-rights-debates","47"

I know exactly what I'm talking about. Groups do not reproduce. Couples within groups certainly can reproduce, but groups themselves do not. If you cannot see the distinction then I don't know that any further discussion on the topic will make it clearer to you. Yes. I am saying that the cultural meaning of marriage is related to the biology and evolutionary purpose of a mating pair. I am not suggesting we legally enforce anything. I am saying heterosexual couples do provide the cultural meaning of marriage. I am not suggesting this cannot or should not change. But if it does change than the meaning that marriage has thus far had is pretty much dead; without biology to base meaning on then marriage will solely gain cultural meaning with nothing underlying it (as much meaning as pederasty did to the Romans, for example). This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it certainly is a trade-off that is worth worrying about. It's an analogy. Inattention connotes indifference. Or disrespect. Not a marriage as we understand it. Since the cultural meaning would obviously be based on our understanding of the custom, I think the complex interaction between slave-born (who were used freely for sex regardless of gender), freed (who were beholden to those who freed them, but no one else) and free-born (where homosexual relationships carried a social stigma, if not outright disallowed) have little bearing on what we're talking about here. I don't think harm really matters, since we're talking about meaning . And I notice you bring up pederastic societies such as the Greeks and Romans, but as soon as I bring up a modern example I'm the bad guy?","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","11:02 AM","gay-rights-debates","48"
"02-28-2011","15071",4,"Sigma","424913","Yes, but they are anamolies. It's culturally assumed that people will eventually want children (especially women) even if in actuality it does not always happen. The stereotype is true often enough that the anomalies are just that, anomalies. The driving force behind marriage is not changed by the existence of individual idiosyncrasies any more than the definition of a species changes simply because some members are unable to reproduce (a species is defined by a population able to reproduce amongst themselves). Well, yes, homosexuals have to take away the traditional view of marriage. Homosexuals have to change the definition of marriage in order to be included. Both the cultural and legal meaning of marriage specifically excludes homosexuals Yes, the meaning of marriage can change. Homosexuals are trying to do that right now. I'm not saying it's necessarily good or bad to change the meaning of marriage, but it absolutely must happen in order for homosexuals to be included. As a consequence of this, homosexuals will not enjoy the cultural and traditional meaning of marriage, because marriage will no longer have the cultural and traditional meaning that it once did.","pappillion001","424984","Yes those cases are a minority. My point was that there is no penalty for those that don't or can't and is the assumption based on learned behavior or natural compulsion? Cultural assumptions are not limited to procreation and is not the driving force behind marriage. Arguably children play less of a role in the decision to marry now than 100 years ago. The increase in intentionally single parents is helping that trend to continue to increase. People marry for the relationship first the family second. . The current popular definition of marriage has and is not been what it is currently. The definition has evolved over time and will continue to do so. Words change in meaning all the time. Fornicate used to refer to an archway. Change can be good, bad, both or nuetral. Women got over being property and being bartered off as a baby factory to whoever was willing to take her off her families hands and that seems to have turned out ok. Given the current state of marriage I still don't see how gays could do anything to cheapen the nexperience more than straight people already have.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","06:28 PM","gay-rights-debates","49"
"02-28-2011","15071",4,"Sigma","424961","No, you should legally define it any damn way you can get away with. The cultural definition comes from observation.","snakespit","424987","But who get's to decide that legal definition...that's the point. In this specific case in point, the anti crowd wishes to limit the rights of others simply based on personally held beliefs...when no harm is presented to any party involved. In a case such as this, I feel strongly that without a specific vector of harm, we must as a civilized society rule in favor of providing equal rights rather than limit rights of a minority.

It is present in greater or lesser quantities, certainly, but is no less 'natural' for that. Given that the desire for children is the reason our species exists, that fact is understandable. I certainly am not proposing a penalty for homosexuals either. Well, yes, and this is through the technological and economic progress that made it possible for couples to have sex and raise children without a pitiless division of labor in which a mother had to devote every waking moment to keeping the children alive. Clean water, sanitation, and modern medicine has lowered infant mortality and reduced the need for large numbers of children. Contraception, amniocentesis, ultrasound, and other reproductive technologies have made it possible for women to defer childbearing to the optimal point in their lives. But our instincts do not change with technology much if at all. The difference in the sexes is not arbitrary, and our instincts evolved along those lines. The desire for a mate and for children still exists, and marriage formalizes that bond. No question. I'm not talking in terms of 'good' or 'bad' because those are value judgements. However, whether or not a definition can change does not mean that the desire to keep the meaning is unjustified or invalid. That has not been the cultural norm, however, and certainly not the biological norm.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","07:16 PM","gay-rights-debates","51"

"03-02-2011","15071",4,"jyoshu","425050","I don't think you and other gays are being 'singled out'. I think people are just trying to protect marriage from being broadened into what is effectively a meaningless institution. They see this as an affront to marriage, and that's the reason there is resistance to changing marriage. Just because a given group happens to be a minority doesn't mean they are being victimized when they don't get what they want. I think we need to be very careful here and keep in mind that one can discuss and debate gay marriage without conflating it to all the other things you mentioned. The very debate itself is WHETHER gay marriage is a 'civil right', to begin with. That is not determined yet. If you don't think we should be debating this in a forum like this, you should take it up with the owners of the forum rather than complaining about it when people DO debate it.","snakespit","425054","I just don't get it. How exactly is the inclusion of gay marriage a threat to the institution of marriage? In a country where ~50% of all first time marriages end in divorce, celebrities change spouses faster than the seasons, television ""reality shows"" make a mockery of the process, and you can get married in a drunken stupor at a drivethru chapel in Las Vegas...what is the threat? You don't hear much from the anti crowd about these things cheapening the institution of marriage. It's a noble thought that people actually care about the ""institution of marriage""...but I'm not buying it. I think it is simply people's opposition to and hatred of homosexuality that feeds this need to ""protect marriage"". I think as the more conservative baby boomer generation dies off, we will eventually see the end of this state sponsored bigotry. I was gonna try to respond to Sigma with something like this...but he does indeed seem to be ""impervious to logic"". Sure it has. Those who support gay marriage have determined that it is a civil right. Those who are against it have determined that it is not. What you should have said is that SCOTUS has not yet legally decided if it is a civil right or not. If it was determined by SCOTUS to be a civil right tomorrow, I doubt that many of the people who are against gay marriage today would change their opinions. I won't speak for Matthew, but I took his comment as to mean that we should not have to debate about gay rights. I did not take it as meaning that he did not want to or that we should not debate gay rights. I have to agree with him, I find it sad that in the year 2011 we are still having this debate, but I am fully willing to carry on with it as long as gays do not have equal rights.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","12:44 PM","gay-rights-debates","60"
