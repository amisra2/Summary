They want to be together in a bond that makes them one with each other forever. It is a wonderful thing to have such a bond. It is special. It is love. When a man and a woman get married, no one blinks an eye. If two men or two women do the same, then many people do not approve. They claim that it is not right or that it soils the real meaning of marriage. What is the real meaning of marriage? The answer to that question is in line one of this article. It is because they love each other. Does it matter if the couple is gay or straight? Should it matter? No! After all, why should it. Gays want their equal rights and among those equal rights is the right to be married. I agree with wanting equal rights. We are all people which means we are all the same. It does not matter if someone is gay, white, black, a man, a woman, tall, short, young, old or whatever. We all want our equal rights. That is our right. However, we need to go beyond equal rights when it comes to gay marriage. Society needs to understand that any marriage is not about the right to be married. It is about wanting to be married as a loving couple. Love is not something that should be decided on by voters. It is not a court issue either. It should not be an issue at all. Marriage is between two people in love. It is not between two people, the voters, the courts and anyone else who has an opinion. Gay marriage does not bring down the meaning of marriage. It makes the true meaning of marriage even better. That is what love does. It makes things better. Society has come a long way in the last fifty years in terms of equality, but we still have a long way to go. It is a shame that love is something that needs to be fought for. I am not gay, but I am the same as you as you are to me. May love conquer all. George Vreeland Hill","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","07:35 PM","gay-rights-debates","1"

Based on results Love is not the best foundation for marriage or maybe people should either get a better understanding of what love is or look for other reasons in addition to love. Let me just say I do not oppose same sex marriage. Gay couples could not do anything to hurt the idea of marriage that straight couples have not already been doing for centuries. You say that it is about love, but you actually hold onto it's about a piece of paper and recognition of others. That is what marriage gives you over two people who have the same relationship without being married. If your looking for the perks or rights that go along with being married then it isn't just about love. If not then what difference does it make whether your married legally?","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","06:38 AM","gay-rights-debates","8"

I personally define marriage as a union of two people who love one another and wish to make a commitment to one another. If marriage is about reproduction, why does nobody bat an eye when a 65 year old woman marries a 68 year old man? If you believe marriage is ""formalization of a mating pair"", and ""reproduction is implied"", doesn't this cheapen the institution of marriage in your eyes? Obviously, they are not getting married to start a family...perhaps love is what is important?","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","11:19 AM","gay-rights-debates","9"

Sibling marriage was widespread in the time of the Egyptian Ptolemies. That makes it ok to marry your sister and if you object, you must be an incestphobe. Which means that you must have secret incestuous feelings....... Think thats a crop of XXXX?

Older couples who had no intention of creating a family unit as well as those who simply didn't want children are accepted without a second thought. And why is that? In a world that has been ruled by male dominance where homosexuality was and is still considered a weakness or failing there has only recently been any serious attempt to change the perception. The fact that women were property that fathers used to the benefit of the family has evolved into an equal partnership (mostly). Marriage has many definitions and purposes especially if looked at over the last several thousand years, making the view of tradition or culture subject to the desires of the society. Traditionalist can hold onto the way they know and feel comfortable with, but same sex couples wouldn't take that away. Nothing would prevent straight couples from the exact same marriage whether gay people can marry or not.","gay-marriage-not-about-equal-rights-about-love","12:38 PM","gay-rights-debates","12"
