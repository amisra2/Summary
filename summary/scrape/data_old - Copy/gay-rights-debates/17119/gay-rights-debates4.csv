You rail against the Mideastern countries for their treatment of Christians and sharia law, but you are so happy to impose that same sharia law upon us. You are just the same as the Islamists that you despise.","Freedom","455711","He has not advocated the execution, imprisonment, or even mandatory therapy for homosexuals that is an unfair accusation. It is the homosexual lobby who are trying to force him and people like him to recognize homosexuality in the public sphere and thus condone and support it, and their reaction to that is the sum of the so called 'gay-bashing' in modern western countries. That is why I could live in peace with easyrider but not a collectivist, he believes in freedom if only because the founders of the united states did.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","01:16 PM","gay-rights-debates","46"

That homosexuals should be put to death and their blood is on them? He has not advocated that in all the posts he's made since I've been here. You think you have a right to public support and that is why you have a blindness to the nature of what he wants. Homosexual marriages have not been banned by any state, some refuse to recognize them and that is all. You can still sign any contract with anyone you want. You can still have as much sex as you want with whoever you want. There are no oppressive laws and the sooner you realize that the sooner we all can stop hearing this avalanche of self-absorbed entitled complaints.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","05:03 AM","gay-rights-debates","48"

His religious belief is the law and he supports that law. It is a religious law that is no difference then sharia law. His religious beliefs should have nothing to do with civil law. Further my religious beliefs are being violated.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:02 PM","gay-rights-debates","49"

There was no specific definition applied to Marriage until religious whack-jobs decided to apply that definition. The Law in the U.S. did not define Marriage as being between one man and one Woman until they decided to add the specific definition to discriminate for religious reasons. Marriage Laws change all the time, they have changed throughout history . At one time in the U.S. polygamy was also legally recognized, Until religious zealots decided to outlaw it. So show me the recorded history that defines marriage as one man and one woman. Show me where the definition in the Dictionary prior to changes in the law defined marriage as Between one man and one woman.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","11:59 AM","gay-rights-debates","51"

"05-25-2012","17119",4,"Freedom","455916","A person can sign multiple contracts, but why should we care? The public has the right to define who and what they support.

You think two people should get special protection because they signed a contract. This is the problem with calling social programs laws, you don't need to sign a law in order for it to protect you. This is not a law it's a contract, and you are trying to force the public to sign.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","07:46 PM","gay-rights-debates","60"
