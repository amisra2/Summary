I am a filthy sinner, you are a filthy sinner, we're all filthy sinners. So please step off your high horse on this matter as if you are a more moral or deserving person in Gods eyes, you are not. We are saved by grace and grace alone. Homosexuality is immoral, this I believe. But I disagree with how it is blown out of proportion, as if it is the one sin to rule them all. Nonsense, it is an immoral act like any other of the immoral acts our race commits. So yes, I agree it is immoral. Doesn't mean gays shouldn't have the right to get married if they so choose. Jesus never forced his will upon people, he always gave them a choice in all things. Did he berate or condemn prostitutes and tax collectors for their immorality? Nope. He had lunch with them, socialized with them, treated them with kindness and love. And they chose to follow him. Jesus explained things, laid matters of right and wrong out how they were, and let people chose for themselves. So America making laws that gays cannot marry is frankly quite unbiblical as I see it.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","02:41 PM","gay-rights-debates","229"

You should be ashamed backing that abomination when you know it's immoral. He told the adulteress to go and sin no more. He told another sinner that was healed to stop sinning or something worse would happen to him. He told the followers of Jezebel in Revelation chapter two that he would make those who commit adultery with her suffer intensely, unless they repent. And he cast Jezebel on a bed of suffering. And you're going to tell me there won't be any temporal consequences for gay sex sinners or those who support them? Get real. That's perfect. So let's legalize pedophilia, wife beating, support adultery, and all that other rot while we're at it, then. After all, God won't care or do anything, right? Very sad.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","11:18 PM","gay-rights-debates","230"

Considering that the woman almost got stoned to death for adultery, telling her not to commit adultery again is common advice and not just moral advice. Telling someone to stop sinning, there will be consequences, is truthful talk. He is telling them that their actions will have consequences and they should stop. He isn't threatening them, he isn't ordering them. Jesus supped with tax collectors and with prostitutes, immoral people. He socialized and interacted with them, and he gave them a choice to follow him. Nowhere, nowhere does he hint at forcing people to follow his laws. There is a difference between something happening out of mutual consent, and something happening because someone was forced to do it. Jesus and God have always been about choice. It ones choice to follow God, it is ones choice to obey his laws. And that is why I believe gay marriage should be legal. I do not believe it is moral, I do not believe the church should be involved in it. But I do believe that we all should have the choice to follow Gods laws. Telling gay people they cannot get married will not solve anything. Like any other sin, it is matter of the soul/heart, and only the power and grace of God can heal someone of sinful tendencies.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","12:45 AM","gay-rights-debates","231"

I completely agree norvey, your spot on the money. What happens between two (or more) consenting adult in the privacy of their bedrooms is their own business. They have the right to the benefits we give to couple should they wish for them and the recognition of marriage. Pedophilia, wife beating, adultery all have consequences either for children (who are not of consent age), violence etc... But adultery is legal, it is legal to have an affair outside of marriage.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","07:13 AM","gay-rights-debates","233"

Maybe not overtly, but he sure spelled out dire consequences for them if they didn't follow his laws. If you think otherwise just read Deuteronomy chapter 28. Did you miss what happened to Sodom and Gomorrah because they exercised their free will choices?","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:10 AM","gay-rights-debates","234"

In fact, if there's enough of us, we can pass a Constitutional Amendment to ban gay marriage, etc. Gay marriage is also outlawed by virtue of a number of state constitutions, passed by representatives of the people. I'm not buying that. Did you know the founding fathers and others attended church services in the US Capitol Bldg. and other federal buildings, and that continued up to and shortly after the Civil War? Kind of puts the ""separation of church"" and state in a different light for you, n'est pas?","obama-supports-gay-marriage","12:50 PM","gay-rights-debates","239"
