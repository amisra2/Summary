In fact, there's plenty of biologists who are Christians, and who believe in the resurrection. And there's plenty of former atheists who have come to the truth of that too. Well, that ""tyrannical god"" you speak of ultimately wipes out evil and creates a paradise where there's ""no more tears and no more sorrows.."" So I'll take that over what you and your fellow atheists have any day.","Hdreams","475517","Damn, 1 year of college Biology (where im sure you were open minded). Im curious if you even got to Mitosis... I might as well say ""i saw passion of the Christ, and determined Christianity is a load of XXXX"".... I would like you to speculate for me how the blood of Christ became Uncoagulated. As within 12 hours of death the blood would have semi-solidified in the body and by 2 days would have been a jelly like solid which breaks apart the RBC (red blood cells) and releases heam into the surrounding plasma. Meaning that firstly Jesus wouldnt be able to transfer Oxygen form lung to blood. Secondly that he wouldn't be able to remove cellular toxins and also no urination. Thirdly no eating as their would be no take up of vitamins, minerals etc. Fourthly no major muscle movement as the lack of sugar and oxygen to any myoglobin.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","04:53 AM","gay-rights-debates","451"

No doubt you're ignorant concerning propitiation, sanctification, regeneration, Bible archaeology, and a whole host of such issues. First, explain to me in great detail (since you're the big biology expert) the exact sequence of events that resulted in the first living cell (speaking of abiogenesis). Name all the organic molecules that were present and/or produced, along with the enzymes. Then explain the composition of the original DNA (if any), and which came first - the cell walls or other components of the cell, such as mitochondria, lysosome, etc. You're on, Einstein.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","09:01 AM","gay-rights-debates","453"

"07-08-2013","17119",31,"Hdreams","475528","Bible Archaeology? So this is Archaeology that supports the biblical tales? please elaborate if you will. I have seen supposed bible archaeology and i presume you are referring to William F. Albright and the Evangelical view of biblical archaeology but id like to know from your view.... This should be good. I asked you a specific issue that disproves the argument of Resurrection and you came back with an evasion. You said you were open minded that if the Resurrection could be disproved that would be the game so i am challenging it. What basis in the bible or theology does the laws of biology and coagulation of the blood after death cease when Jesus was dead. Abiogenesis has nothing to do with human biology after death and coagulation... Why the evasion, lets deal with one issue at a time or you get nowhere. But to humor you i will lay out to the best of my knowledge some of what you ask in the hope that you have some level of academic or argumental capacity to answer the question i pose of you.... Firstly enzymes are advanced and complicated proteins and would not have been a building block of life to my knowledge though very primitive example's of them could have been present (This is a possibility)... The basic blocks of DNA, thymine guanine cytosine adenine... being the basic blocks of dna have been proposed through abiogenesis to be mutually attractive to their respective base pair... Much like the accumulation of iron filings under the influence of a magnet... You can see how this proposition would be plausible to create small chain helical structures of a primitive form of DNA/RNA (RNA being the early form of this structure) The forces between the two necleotide pairs have been well recorded in their level of attraction and i will cite this here. http://www.pnas.org/content/92/12/5297.full.pdf http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/conten.../3289.full.pdf All of these nucleotides are found in nature as well as phosphoric acid which along with deoxyribose and ribose form the backbone of the DNA molecule. Moving onto your question of the cell wall, ribosome, nucleus, mitochondria, lysosome etc and their incorporation to form a cell. Firstly free floating proteins are common and do not require a cell. So the first organic molecules would have been fine to exist without cellular structure. Most apparatus of what we consider cell infrastructure most likely is the incorporation of multiple organisms into one structure or under 1 roof for lack of a better term. Mitochondria have their own Rna sequences and this is one of the methods we can use to track human population movements into our pre-history, by referencing and analyzing the mitochondrial code. The modern cell wall being the Lipid bilayer is a modern and recent invention in the history of life... For several billion years life was Uni-cellular and the most common form of life was the distant and primitive ancestors of modern algae, extremophiles etc which likely had no or semi formed lipid encapsulating them. The cell wall would have been a major advance in the evolution of life and given a degree safety to proteins from the ""elements"". I could go on here but i doubt any further elaboration would simply generate the same answer i imagine i will get here anyway.... Your initial request which i have answered partially within the limits of my free time and that you can check on the internet and study for yourself. Lastly i would say that your question in itself is also the actions of one scared to hear the answers... You ask me to explain the encapsulation of the development of life and the current theories we have simply because you have no answer to the problem of coagulation in a dead Jesus. The subjects are in no way related and you might have well have asked about the moon but you simply wish to evade any problematic question.","Easyrider","475530","There all kinds of websites on Bible archaeology. Some are good and some aren't. This is what I was saying when I said you did 1 (one) superficial reading of the Bible. It's obvious since you're asking about it that you did zero investigative studies on Bible archaeology. And now you want me to show it to you? Do your own homework like you should have done before debating the issue. Sorry, sport. I wasn't there and am not privy to how God performs his miracles. If you can quote scientific studies showing God and the supernatural do not and cannot exist, THEN you might have a case for disproving the resurrection. I have multiple historical accounts from independent sources. You have squat. Abiogenesis deals with how life allegedly EVOLVED from non-organic life. You atheists always try to use that evasive argument that it's not related to evolution so you don't have to deal with it. This is all very nice but you weren't there when abiogenesis allegedly occurred, so you really don't know the specific process and order of what actually occurred, do you? In fact, you can't even, with any evidence, demonstrate what the exact environment was back then; what temperatures were at the time, etc., etc. You can only theorize. BUT, because you believe it happened, you take your best guess and defend it. OH YE OF GREAT FAITH !! In fact, scientists can't even create life in a clinical environment under carefully controlled conditions, can they? And if they could, it would be by INTELLIGENT DESIGN. Wrong, sport. What I was doing was giving you a dose of your own medicine. You made a nice try at answering, but it's obvious to me you haven't a clue what really occurred, precisely where it occurred, or what elements were actually present at the time. On sciences attempts to explain / justify abiogenesis: There isnt any doubt that science, for the moment at least, is at a dead end. The optimism of the 1950s is gone. The mood at the 1999 international conference on origin of life was described as grim full of frustration, pessimism, and desperation. Nobody pretends that any alternative provides a reasonable path of how life went unguided from simple chemicals to proteins to basic life forms. Quote by Walter L. Bradley, Ph.d., who received his B.S. in Engineering Science and his Ph.D. in Materials Science from the University of Texas in Austin. He taught as an Assistant and Associate Professor of Metallurgical Engineering at the Colorado School of Mines before assuming a position as Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University (TAMU) in 1976. Dr. Bradley, also served as Head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University and as Director of the Polymer Technology Center at TAMU. He currently serves as Distinguished Professor of Engineering at Baylor University. Designed or Designoid Klaus Dose, the biochemist whos considered one of the foremost experts in this area, summed up the situation pretty well: More than thirty years of experimentation on the origin of life in the fields of chemical and molecular evolution have led to a better perception of the immensity of the problem of the origin of life on earth rather than to its solution. At present all discussions on principle theories and experiments in the field have either ended in stalemate or in a confession of ignorance. But the atheists have great faith it occurred!!","obama-supports-gay-marriage","12:54 PM","gay-rights-debates","458"

"07-09-2013","17119",31,"Easyrider","475338","Nonsense. God and the UN gave them that land. In the Old Testament the original inhabitants of the ""promised land"" were forcibly evicted due to their many atrocities against Israel and others. Example: The sins of the Canaanites Killing the Canaanites: A Response to the New Atheism God didn't destroy Israel forever, jackass. There's plenty of scriptures on how Israel would be restored in the last days. Screw the UN. They used to be half way lucid in the beginning but now they've turned into a politically-correct, anti-semitic gang of id*ots. Nobody in their right mind thinks the UN is worth a a hoot in hell anymore. There's not that many sane people around who bow down to Muslim thuggery, but apparently you're one of the dead heads who do. There's no shortage of examples of Arab / Muslim attacks against Israel, so don't even bother trying to go there. Anyone we can pay to kill Muslim thugs / terrorists is money well spent. And don't forget all the Arab countries that support terrorism against Israel, like Iran and Syria. If you like those maggots so much move on over there.","daewoo","475554","Yes...the cannanite were forcibly evicted. God later exiled the Israelites and prohibited them from returning until he personally came and led them back. The FACT is that if you actually believe that the bible is the word of god then you are committing a grave sin by supporting Israel in defiance of gods will. REPENT or you will burn in hell. Isn't that your favorite line? Yes...when GOD HIMSELF comes and calls the jews home. Prior to that they are prohibited from moving to Israel en mass or making war on the nations of the world. You are the one who was arguing that since the UN gave israel to the jews that they were totally legit. Turns out that once again you have no idea what you are talking about. So they attack us because we are responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of their people and that is thuggery? Sounds more like revenge to me...or the inevitable results of our own actions. There are indeed many examples of Arab/Muslim attacks against Isreal. There are just a LOT, LOT more examples of Israeli attacks against Arabs. If you are anti terrorism, you have to be anti Israel. Israel literally only exists because of Zionist terrorism. During and immediately after WWII the British were in control of the region and were not inclined to steal land from others to give to a bunch of jews. The zionists launched a large scale terrorism campaign against the British which ultimately led to the British dropping the whole mess in the lap of the UN.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","08:39 AM","gay-rights-debates","461"

"07-09-2013","17119",31,"Hdreams","475561","I actually know quite a bit about supposed bible archaeology, the gentleman i referenced was its founding father so to speak. You obviously dont though... You asked me to explain aspects of biology and i complied. You then refuse to explain aspects of your side. .. Academically you have no ground to stand on here. So you say that the Resurrection is the lynchpin for you, now and in other threads. Still regardless of what evidence refutes the ressurection, that doesnt matter because if you also cant disprove god then the ressurection happened. So even if it was shown the ressurection didnt even happen, it doesnt matter because god could exist and so does. You have sources from mostly biased individuals... ...living 2000 years ago who didn't understand anything about the world around them. I don't understand religious individuals propensity to mis-use scientific terms and get so confused by them, it really is straight forward. Ill give you the definition shall i: a hypothetical organic phenomenon by which living organisms are created from nonliving matter. Nowhere in that sentence is the word evolve... 8 year olds understand this, are you seriously still struggling with this? You attack science because it cant create life yet??? You are truly a strange one.. What has theology achieved or created that can compare to the achievements of science? In medicine, geology, physics, chemistry, engineering, construction, cosmology, and many many many many many more fields.... You will see the creation of life in your life-time, of that i am sure...","Easyrider","475581","Unfounded, self-serving conjecture. I'm supposed to know the intricacies of how God performed a miracle 2,000 years ago? Nice try. The Bible itself strongly implies it. I'll give you a hint where - the author of the scripture is Paul. There's numerous historical testimonies it happened. I know you'd like somebody to sweep that under the rug so you don't have to deal with it, but it's there nevertheless. You have some compelling evidence they're not telling the truth, let's see it. If you can't then your self-serving bias charge is just a lot of hot air. They weren't testifying about the world around them; they were testifying about Jesus whom they obviously knew very well, having walked with him for over 3 years. Seem pretty self-serving to me. If you don't have abiogenesis or something akin to it your evolution is in the toilet. And you know it. I was just saying science has yet to prove or disprove the existence of God and the supernatural. That's not attacking science. That's demonstrating its current limitations. You're the one in la la land thinking science has all the answers to the theological. That's the wrong question. The real questions are what have men who believed in God and the Bible done to further science? And the answer is plenty. If you're ignorant of the answers to that then you really are lost. By INTELLIGENT DESIGN, like how God did it. And I'll believe it when I see it. Jesus is Lord!","obama-supports-gay-marriage","02:02 PM","gay-rights-debates","465"
