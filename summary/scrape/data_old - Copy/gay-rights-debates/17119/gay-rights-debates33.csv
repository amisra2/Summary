And be careful who you call a bigot, lest you be recognized yourself as an anti-God / anti-Biblical bigot.","Hdreams","475673","I didn't say you were a bigot, i implied the reason gay marriage already isnt a right is due to bigotry... Their is no article about black marriage, Muslim marriage or other denomination in the constitution either, but they are here and recognized as a right, as will gay marriage be...","obama-supports-gay-marriage","08:17 PM","gay-rights-debates","481"

But you're probably right about the next bit. As there is no evidence that heaven even exists, it is unlikely that either gay marriage or gay sex (or any form, of marriage or sex) will exist there. Finally, you're definitely a bigot. And I am being very careful in calling you such. The evidence in overwhelming.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","08:45 PM","gay-rights-debates","482"

No doubt you disapprove of pedophilia? Is that due to a moral decision or bigotry on your part?","obama-supports-gay-marriage","12:56 PM","gay-rights-debates","484"

The main difference is being able to give legal consent.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","01:17 PM","gay-rights-debates","485"

Pedophilia and being gay equate to the same thing for you? you are amusing... like a real life, walking talking 1920's experience... You have no morale authority, a seeming lack of anything resembling so called Christian compassion and an absolute lack of tolerance. You really would fit in well in Islam... They believe in Jesus too you know so you could still believe in the resurrection an all, but you also get winged horses in the mythology and a new book to read and covet. To top it all you could express your intolerance for women's rights openly as well, on top of all the other intolerance. But you have to be careful which branch of Islam, alot of them would see you as fundamental... perhaps Hezbollah or maybe at a stretch the Muslim brotherhood...","obama-supports-gay-marriage","05:48 PM","gay-rights-debates","489"

For the record, I didn't say pedophilia and homosexuality were the same thing. That's your latest stretch of the imagination. But they are both morally wrong. Yeah, I do - the Word of God. You have subjective moral relativism that often changes with the wind. You'd fit well in Sodom and Gomorrah. Youd no doubt encourage their depravity as well. The Islamic faith does not believe that Jesus is divine. And if they thought he was a prophet why didnt they believe him when he said no one comes to the Father except through him? So please update your theology. And you and the other dead -heads here need to repent of your rebellion against God and Christ before you all die and wind up in Hell. Wise up.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","05:50 AM","gay-rights-debates","491"

Thar is why he is the second most quoted prophet in the Qur'an (the first being Moses). They also believed him when he repeatedly said he was NOT divine....and when he said that the old laws (laws from the old testament such as dietary laws) STILL APPLY. You are the one who apparently did not believe Jesus.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:35 PM","gay-rights-debates","495"
