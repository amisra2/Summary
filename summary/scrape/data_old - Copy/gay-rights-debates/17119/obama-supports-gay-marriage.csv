One of the reasons Obama cited for his support of gay marriage was that we ought to ""...you know, treat others the way you would want to be treated"" (the Golden Rule). That's pathetic. Under that standard we ought to respect people who practice pedophilia, because that's how they would want to be treated. Same with adulterers, people who practice incest, etc. Obama is the most Biblically-challenged President I think we've ever had. Any Christian or Bible-believing Jew who supports this man is a spiritually bankrupt reprobate.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:14 PM","gay-rights-debates","1"

Support for legal gay marriage decreases markedly with age, ranging from 70% support among those aged 18 to 34 Republicans in particular seem fixed in their opinions; there was no change at all in their support level this year, while independents' and Democrats' support jumped by double-digit margins.","daewoo","454801","For First Time, Majority of Americans Favor Legal Gay Marriage Retard.

And thus sayeth the Word of God: Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error. Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done. Although they know Gods righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them. - Romans chapter 1","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:01 PM","gay-rights-debates","8"

As daewoo eluded to there was a time in this country when it was illegal to marry someone from another race. At one time Women were not allowed to vote. At one time People were enslaved .

Why should an insurance company cover a homosexual couple, when that couple can't define marriage; and thus can't claim to be married? My concern is that no benefits are awarded at the cost of stealing those benefits from the unwilling. This is the part of the show where you have nothing to retort and just go away, thank you. There is no right to violate rights, and homosexual marriage would not be an issue if it weren't for their erroneous claim to societal support; because then it would truly be between two (or more) people and they would need neither permission nor validation from the government.","Xcaliber","455044","Smarter than you will ever be, that is a fact. The Only reason there is a definition now as far as Law is concerned is because a bunch of religious XXXXXX decided to apply one. Before Bigotry became the norm the LAW didn't have a definition. The Government / State Governments applied said definition for the sole purpose of discrimination.

If you truly were for upholding the constitution then you would understand . The fact that by denying Gay people the right to marry you not only discriminate against them but you force your religious definition of marriage on them, which is also against the Constitution.

To say that a contract is not a law, and to say contracts and laws are separate is not the same thing. A law applies to everyone (equal protection), it is a statute defining a prohibited activity. You can have a law stating that to violate contracts is prohibited, but you can't have a law that only applies to just joe and sally even though you can have a contract that applies to joe and sally. You do not need to sign laws to give them power over you, you do need to sign a contract to give it legal power over you. Predefined? Xcaliber claims there was no definition before DOMA. It is because it is a legal relationship that from a legal perspective it must have a concrete definition. The governments not going to chase down some couple for saying they are married, but they aren't going to give them tax breaks either because they don't meet the criteria. Of course they do. Speaking from a 'moral perspective' (as always) a contract is valid only if the list of signers on the bottom have sufficient authority to promise the constraints and conditions of the contract. If a contract describes the duties of bob and jill, and bob and jill sign it; it's valid because jill has the right to make promises on her behavior and bob has the right to make promises about his behavior. If they include rob in the contract and attempt to constrain him to some duty, and he does not sign; that contract is not valid. The contract is formalized promises and works on the volition principle. If it was only two private individuals who had to sign off on a marriage contract, homosexuals would not need government help. Existing contract law would guarantee it's legal and enforced. They want more than a contract between two people, they want a contract that because of government law is providing privileges and protections which they do not have the authority to provide for themselves. i.e. the government is a co-signer and the government does not have a duty to sign because it represents the people and the people do not have a duty to sign. Everything involving government involves morals until government is moral. No contract has been nullified, there are no laws against making any contract.

Your gay-sex pipe dream was demolished at Sodom and Gomorrah. You didn't learn your lessons then and it's obvious you have no moral foundation now. Not only that, but unless you repent, you will in no way enter into heaven. Let's once again look at the Scriptures and see what you're trying to sweep under the rug in order to try to justify your illicit gay sex sin: Leviticus 18:2 2 - ""Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable."" Leviticus 20:13 - ""If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads."" Romans 1:26-27 - ""Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion."" 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - ""Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God."" 1 Timothy 1:8-10 - But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine Jude 7 In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion.

I am arguing under the presumption of a moral government, i.e. one that does not violate rights and whose actions reflect the will of the people (and not just the majority). Even under a proper moral government people could decide to support heterosexual marriage and not homosexual marriage. They would have every right to do that, just as they have the right to support PETA over Rush Limbaugh. Where does the constitution guarantee equal treatment? People who think the constitution guarantees something the government isn't doing, in my experience have not read the thing in a while. You find this so important, but it isn't. I have given you every opportunity to make a case that other sexual orientations were not of the same nature as homosexuality i.e. immutable arising at young ages (before sexual experience) and you have backed down every time.

I am waiting for you to leap of your high horse like lightning now and suddenly start talking about how if enough people don't like the immutable sexual orientation, or more specifically the acts it motivates discrimination and indeed imprisonment is justified. Thus implying there is nothing sacred or inviolate about an inclination being immutable, but when you forget this conversation; next time you will be throwing this out there for homosexuals again as if it were some kind of race. There is no protection in the constitution against discrimination based on definition because it would be absurd.

The government, if properly structured; can represent multiple groups of people at the same time for each issue a new instance of representation. The idea that the majority speaks for the unanimity and representatives speak for the majority has created authority of representatives over people whom they do not in fact represent. This is a violation of the volition or liberty principle. Correct. A right to the support of others is a contradiction, it means a right to their duty; and their liberty demands they have the right to choose their own obligations and duties. You have the right to offer your neighbor help, but your neighbor does not have a right to your help. If you give it, it is a privilege because it was dependent on your consent.

I have commented on this before, there are two distinct functions of governments. To protect rights and carry out the wishes of the people in public policy. These are very different things. The former changes in practical application but never in it's source or nature. If all government did was protect rights, it would do very little indeed. In fact just the military and justice system. Much of what the government does is merely investment and social programs that society as a whole wishes to be carried out. Each group is defined by those programs (each with their own objective criteria for goals, methods, and execution i.e. a constitution) which the individuals in that group support. The government represents that group by taking the funds from that group and executing the plan. These plans (or government actions as I call them) are not exclusive to each other, and therefore do not come in conflict with each other. This is different from the current system in that governments believe and try to form a unified set of actions even though they have conflicting interests. Of course no one would have to fund anything, a sub-category of that principle would be that no homosexual would have to fund anything they think is benefiting heterosexuals. I believe a Prussian king once said that the dream of a perfect plan is the greatest enemy of a good plan. It is a good plan is for most to agree on what they can, the enemy of that plan is dreaming that we will all agree on everything . People will work together easily enough if they agree and they are given a practical framework in which to cooperate. It is not something that can be morally or practically forced to happen. I look at history and I see one truth above all others, the reason people want their own nations is because they do not want to submit their will to that of neighbors. The divisions of nations are limited to geographical differences, but far more kinds exist, and they cause civil strife within nations. All of this proceeds from the premise that some master plan must be chosen and then everyone must support it whether they agree with it or not. All previously conceived types of government have been at their core mechanisms for producing a final word on this master plan. Monarchies were not disconnected from the will of the people, but the king had the final word. In most modern countries the majority has the final word. America was a minority in the British empire, by the standard of democracy which we claim to hold dear British parliament had every right to levy every tax they did. The revolution was about the fact that the minority had the right to rule the minority. I am merely extending the principle to it's logical conclusion and extrema. Every individual has the right to rule him or herself. The policy you espouse, and which is commonly accepted is the policy of division. My government could safely be applied as a single entity to all the world and there would be no danger of oppression or tyranny on the smallest village. You want cooperation, the first step is to have a frame work for cooperation; and if that frame work is in constant threat of destruction or is itself tyrannical in nature cooperation will be the most rare result. Now, look at the world. You may not believe in my 'utopia dreamworld' but I at least have a theory which explains and predicts history and all the evil we see. You move there, that's what your moral theory looks like in the absence of systems based on the premise of objective morality like the law. That is the consequence of subjectivism yes, might makes right. There is no moral truth, just moral perceptions each taking concrete form only in the military strength of those who so perceive. Subjectivism rejects an objective truth subject to rational debate, it claims there is no truth out side of what people think and therefore debating morality is pointless exercise which comes down to ""he believes what he wants to, and so do I"". That is the world my enemies live in, and I cannot reach them because their assumptions allow them to dismiss all attempts to reason with them. There can be only one proper standard which applies to everyone, an objective standard. Need is not a right to steal. How does 'the research' know? But not for other orientations, at least one of which you have been unwilling to attack as you have the others. They may not be, your moral standards may be wrong. To immoral acts? To stop them with force. No not a right, homosexuals have the exact same rights as everyone else; there will never ever be any need to single out a category of human beings and define special rights for them. Helping homosexual couples is not giving them a right it's giving them a privilege. Rights are not given and taken away, only recognized or ignored. Extending a privilege is not a moral wrong so long as those extending the privilege have authority to do so (i.e. they are extending their own consent), no recourse is or ever will be needed. That's untrue, there is a smooth continuum just as there is between homosexuality and heterosexuality. Some prefer humans and will accept animals a second best, some couldn't tell you which they prefer (on a purely sexual level), and some prefer animals to the point where they have no more inclination to sleep with humans than a homosexual does to sleep with the opposite sex. What they all have in common is sexual attraction to animals, preference is irrelevant except in some mysterious way which you have consistently refused to explain to my satisfaction (just bleating 'fundamental'). Zoophiles do not have equal rights to either homosexuals or heterosexuals in that sex itself is often outlawed. If you are claiming that the equal protection clause grants homosexuals the right to marry, how can you deny that it would grant zoophiles the right to have sex? Let me preempt you, you are going to whine again about how you judge everything as it's own case and you don't think it's right to have sex with an animal. Well a lot of people don't think it's right to treat heterosexual marriage and homosexual marriage the same. You want to respond to them you are going to have to appeal to an objective moral principle which supersedes their unsupported assertions and I will do the same to your complaints about zoophilia. Just as you demand reasons for considering homosexual marriage of lower worth than heterosexual marriage, I demand reasons for considering zoophilic sex wrong but homosexual sex right. By refusing to blindly apply equal protection to zoophiles you admit implicitly that it does matter whether the claimed action is in fact moral and proper, that clause is no magic bullet to remove all discrimination because you refuse to retract your discrimination even though I invoke it.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","11:28 PM","gay-rights-debates","77"

You do not need to sign laws to give them power over you, you do need to sign a contract to give it legal power over you. Predefined? Xcaliber claims there was no definition before DOMA. It is because it is a legal relationship that from a legal perspective it must have a concrete definition. The governments not going to chase down some couple for saying they are married, but they aren't going to give them tax breaks either because they don't meet the criteria. Of course they do. Speaking from a 'moral perspective' (as always) a contract is valid only if the list of signers on the bottom have sufficient authority to promise the constraints and conditions of the contract. If a contract describes the duties of bob and jill, and bob and jill sign it; it's valid because jill has the right to make promises on her behavior and bob has the right to make promises about his behavior. If they include rob in the contract and attempt to constrain him to some duty, and he does not sign; that contract is not valid. The contract is formalized promises and works on the volition principle. If it was only two private individuals who had to sign off on a marriage contract, homosexuals would not need government help. Existing contract law would guarantee it's legal and enforced. They want more than a contract between two people, they want a contract that because of government law is providing privileges and protections which they do not have the authority to provide for themselves. i.e. the government is a co-signer and the government does not have a duty to sign because it represents the people and the people do not have a duty to sign.

If things were as you claimed, there would be no such thing as power of attorney, or health care proxys, or any kind of business structure besides sole proprietorship because all of those things are contractually instituted and the law (which is not just a list of prohibited behavior) requires that EVERYBODY recognize them. It gets even worse....a property deed does not confer ownership of a piece of land, it is simply a record that a purchase contract was properly executed and filed. Same with your car title. Stealing a car and then saying ""I choose not to recognize the sales contract because it was between 2 private parties and thus is not binding on me"" is not going to get you very far with the cops. By your logic, it would be OK to say ""Homosexuals cannot form an LLC"" or ""Black people may not organize a corporation"" because, after all, those are from a legal standpoint exactly the same as marriage....they are predefined contractual agreements between private parties that everybody is required to recognize. That would not be AT ALL discriminatory...right...since the government is just choosing not to be an automatic participant in the contract. Any actual THINKING person, however, recognizes that when these predefined contractual arrangements are codified the government is agreeing to be a party to the resultant contracts. Any thinking person is also going to recognize that gender discrimination is not something the government is allowed to do since it is bound by the constitution. Telling Matthew that he may not enter into such a contract because he has a penis is EXACTLY like telling a woman she man not form a corporation because she lacks one. The only moral form of government is one where all disputes are handled by death match. 2 men enter, 1 man leaves.

A sales contract is not binding on a would be thief, the owners right to the property is. Stealing from the original owner and stealing from the new owner is both stealing. Since the contract is proper and someone may consent to transfer ownership the police rightly consider the item as belonging to the new party. If anyone is forced to recognize and support LLC or corporations they too are immoral. How about you and I sign a contract that states that we are jointly entitled to 10% of tax revenue. Is the contract invalid or does the government have a duty to sign any contract by it's citizens? I did not tell him he couldn't enter into a contract , I told him he needs everyone involved to sign. The government is a party in so far as it agrees to enforce valid contracts, but if the contract places more duties than that upon the government the government has no duty to sign and the contract is invalid without that consent. That is incorrect, disputes must be resolved by identifying the party whose asserted rights are truly rights. There is no such law. States will simply not recognize homosexuals as married. If those rights cannot be extended through contract, that is a problem. It is improper to force anyone to testify. They shall follow the pattern you establish above, either they should not be confined to state recognized marriage contracts, or they are immoral requirements. In the case of hospitals for example their care is constrained by the volition of their patient, that patient can declare his/her wishes directly, or can declare someone else a proxy for their consent.

In fact, it lays out a specific procedure and requirements for making somebody an authorized user on my account. A procedure that is completely short circuited in the event that I give somebody power of attorney, because the law says they are required to respect that contract. Except for those who are. And you do realize that you are just strengthening my argument in regards to gay marriage...right? The biggest part of marriage from a legal perspective is the right of your spouse to act as your agent. You are the one putting forth that premise. There is no ""illusion"" in the real world because the law forces everybody to recognize those purchase contracts, thus transferring actual ownership, and with them the transference of ownership rights. If the world worked as you claim it does, and nobody is forced to recognize a contract that they are not an immediate participant in, the entire thing would be nothing but an illusion. They require that the business be treated as a unique and individual legal entity. You cannot hold the owners directly or financially responsible for the acts of the company. Typically yes. What we are talking about here is contracts that are specifically sanctioned by law. Wrong. When you are talking about contractual arrangements that are specifically authorized and defined by law, they move beyond ""privilege"" and is by definition a legal right. You have the legal right in this country to be married. More specifically, you have a liberty right to be married, and once married you have a claim right to force others to recognize that marriage. In discussing power of attorney above, executing a power of attorney contract results in creation of a claim right...others are compelled, or have a duty, to recognize your decision to create an agent to act on your behalf. Likewise transference of property creates a claim right in that it creates in others a duty to recognize your ownership of the property in question. Wrong answer, sport. There are natural rights and there are legal rights (rights created through legislation). And the government is not allowed to practice discrimination in neither of these activities. No, its not. Both marriage and medical proxy-ship (I like that term) are legal rights. Neither is a natural right. As legal rights, they can be fully shaped via legislation so long as they are equally applied (no discrimination) and do not infringe on a natural right. Except that a hospital, while required to recognize the decisions of a persons medical proxy, may choose to ignore those decisions if they feel they are not being made in the best interests of the patient. They do not have that option when receiving directions directly from the patient. And, again, the biggest legal part of marriage is your spouses ability to act as, and be recognized as, your agent in pretty much all matters. If you are married and would want your wife to be your health care proxy, there is no need to create a health care proxy because your wife is already your proxy by law. Sorry, I fully intend to force you to recognize my marriage, and have the legal right to do so. Establishing gender as a requirement to formation of a contract is by definition discrimination and is illegal....it violated a recognized and enforced natural right. Amazingly enough, a federal appeals court just issued a ruling today that seems to agree with me...that the fact the government may not discriminate based on sex is a long settled principal.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","02:56 PM","gay-rights-debates","94"

"05-31-2012","17119",7,"None","None","None","Winston Smith","456345","The answer to the question, ""Are Mormons Christians,"" is simple. They are not Christians for several reasons, and their unbiblical doctrines show them to be a ""Christian"" cult. The name Christian was first used, as Acts 11:26 records, to identify the disciples of Jesus Christ. The word ""Christian"" is the Greek word ""christianos,"" and it means an adherent of Jesus Christ. It literally means ""Christ ones"" (Acts 11:26, 26:28, 1 Peter 4:16). The correct definition of the word is one who is a follower of the Jesus Christ of the Bible. For almost two thousand years it has never had a reference to anyone other that the historical Jesus Christ of the New Testament. Why Mormons Are Not Christian. First: Mormons do not follow or believe in the historic Jesus Christ of the Bible, but rather in a difference Jesus. This is why most Biblical Christians emphatically insist that Mormons are not Christians. Let me explain. The god of the Mormons is not the God of the Bible. To the Mormons, Jesus is the firstborn son of an exalted ""man"" who became the god of this world. The man-god of Mormonism was made the god of this world because of his good works on another planet somewhere out in the universe. He ""earned"" godhood, and was thus appointed by a counsel of gods in the heavens to his high position as the god of planet Earth. The Mormon god of this world was a man, like all men, who became a god. This is what the celestial marriage and the temple vows are all about. LDS men, by doing their temple work, are striving for exaltation by which they, too, shall one day become gods. Their wives will be the mother goddesses of ""their"" world and with their husband will produce the population of their world. This is the Mormon doctrine of ""eternal progression."" Note the following quote from the Mormon Journal of Discourses, vol. 1, page 123, made by the LDS Apostle Orson Hyde: ""Remember that God, our heavenly Father, was perhaps once a child, a mortal like we ourselves, and rose step by step in the scale of progress, in the school of advancement; has moved forward and overcome, until He has arrived at the point were He is."" Lorenzo Snow, late President of the Mormon church, made this statement in the second verse of his famous poem entitled, ""Man's Destiny"": ""As Abra'm, Isaac, Jacob, too, babes, then men--to gods they grew. As man now is, our God once was; As now God is, so man may be,-- Which doth unfold man's destiny. . ."" The God of the Bible is not an exalted man. The God of the Bible is omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient. The Bible says He is the only God and there are no other Gods. He had no beginning or end and he is a spirit being and never was a man. Note the clear teaching of the Bible as to who the real God is: Numbers 23:19, ""God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?"" Psalms 102:26-27, ""They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end."" Isaiah 43:10-11, ""Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour."" Isaiah 44:6, ""Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God."" Isaiah 44:8, ""Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any."" Isaiah 45:21-22, ""Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me. Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else."" Jeremiah 23:24, ""Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD."" Malachi 3:6, ""For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed."" John 1:16-18, ""And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace. For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him."" John 4:24, ""God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth."" Romans 1:22, ""Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things."" Colossians 1:15, ""Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:"" 1 Timothy 1:17, ""Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen."" 1 Timothy 6:16, ""Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen."" Clearly, Mormonism's god is not the God of Christianity who is the God revealed to us in the Bible. The Mormon god is a god formed from the imaginations of Joseph Smith, and in truth is a false, non-existent god or idol. Second: The Jesus Christ of Mormonism is not the Jesus Christ of the Bible. The Mormon Jesus is the son of this man-god. The Mormon Jesus is the brother of Lucifer, and according to LDS teaching, he married several of the Marys of the New Testament. He is not, to the LDS church, ""God incarnate"" as the Bible plainly states. Clearly, the Mormon god and Jesus are not the true. God and Jesus of the Bible Orson Hyde, the Mormon Apostle said, ""We say it was Jesus Christ who was married in the marriage of Cana of Galilee"" (Journal of Discourses, Vol. 2, page 80). Brigham Young, said, ""When the Virgin Mary conceived the Child Jesus ... He was not begotten by the Holy Ghost. And who is His father? He is the first of the human family"" (Journal of Discourses, pages 50-51). Compare this with the Word of God, ""And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God"" (Luke 1:35). Mormons teach that Jesus Christ suffered for sin in the Garden of Gethsemane when He sweat ""as it were"" great drops of blood. Mormons totally avoid the Biblical teaching of Christ's atonement for sin which was accomplished on the Cross. Note the following quote from, ""What Mormons Think of Christ"" (LDS publication, pages 32-34): ""Christians speak often of the blood of Christ and its cleansing power. Much is believed and taught on this subject, however, it is utter nonsense and so palpably false that to believe it is to lose one's salvation."" It goes further to say that salvation is ""conditional on faith, and repentance, and baptism and keeping the commands of God."" I would like to add, yes, it is very true that Christians do speak much of the blood of Christ. Note the emphasis the Bible places on the blood of Christ: ""But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin"" (1 John 1:7). ""How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"" (Hebrew 9:14). ""And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood"" (Revelations 1:5). The ejection of this Biblical truth by the LDS church shows again it is not a Christian church. Note that in the following verses the Bible says salvation, which is forgiveness of sin and receiving of eternal life, is a gift of God, and it is not obtained by ""works"": ""For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast"" (Ephesians 2:8-9). ""But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness"" (Romans 4:5). I am aware that the L.D.S church has several definitions of salvation and several degrees of glory. A good discussion of the problem is found on the Internet at http:CastYourNet.com/LDS-Shock. The real Jesus Christ is the ""only begotten of the Father."" He is not one of many sons and certainly not the brother of Satan as the following Scriptures clearly state: John 1:18, ""No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him."" John 3:16, ""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."" John 3:18, ""He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God."" Hebrews 1:5, ""For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?"" 1 John 4:9, ""In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him."" Jesus Christ of the Bible is God Incarnate in Man John 1:1, ""In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."" John 1:14, ""And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth."" John 10:30 ""I and my Father are one."" Jesus claimed to be one with the Father. In John 14:9, Jesus said to see him is to see the Father. In John 8:25, 56-59, 18:6,8 Jesus used the Jehovistic ""I AM,"" identifying Himself as God. In Matthew 22:42-45, Jesus claimed to be the Old Testament ""Adonai."" In Mark 2:5-7, Jesus forgave sin, a prerogative belonging only to God. In Matthew 14:33; 28:9; and John 20:28-29, Jesus asserted Himself as God by allowing men to worship Him. John 1:3 states that Jesus is the Creator, and Genesis 1:1 states that God was the Creator. Only those who believe in the real Biblical God and Jesus Christ have the right to use the name ""Christian."" The Mormon prophets historically have openly ridiculed those who believe in the God, Jesus, and Holy Spirit that the Bible reveals. One question that I would ask all Mormons is this: ""If I accept you as a Christian, will you accept me as a Mormon?"" Would you accept me as a Mormon if I reject Joseph Smith and all the LDS prophets as being prophets of God. If I do not believe in the Book of Mormon or the LDS Scriptures, baptisms for the dead, the temple endowments, the LDS gospel, would you accept me as a Mormon? The answer is obviously, you would not. In like manner, when Mormonism denies the Bible and every Christian doctrine do you think that Biblical Christians should accept Mormons as Christians? Again the answer is very obvious, no we will not. You cannot legitimately claim to be Christians when you refuse to accept what the Bible teaches and what a true Christian believes. I would implore Mormons to honestly and openly examine their teachings about God and Jesus Christ and examine who the Bible defines as being a Christian. There is no benefit in calling yourself a ""Christian"" when Biblically you are not. Because we love the souls of men and want to see them, too, spend eternity in Heaven with our Savior, we strongly object to anyone proclaiming to the world a false Jesus Christ. We do not want to see anyone miss having their sins forgiven and receiving eternal life, because they were deceived. Jesus said that He alone was the truth, the way and the life. ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me"" (John 14:6). Belief in the real Jesus Christ is the only way a man can receive forgiveness of sin and eternal life. The LDS, church in presenting a false Christ is, in fact, leading souls away from salvation and the real Jesus. They reject God's truth and substitute another Jesus who does not exist and cannot save. Only those who believe in the Biblical Jesus Christ will go to heaven when they die. Those who put their trust in a false Christ will be eternally lost. Every true Child of God knows this, and that is why we try so hard to point men away from false churches, prophets, gods and Christs, that they may find God's true Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, and be saved. Let God speak for Himself by His Word. Matt. 24:24, ""For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect."" ""Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole. This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved"" (Acts 14:10-12). [Pastor Cooper P.

"06-01-2012","17119",7,"daewoo","456320","Well....I am sitting here looking at one, and it does not include ""legal delegates"". In fact, it lays out a specific procedure and requirements for making somebody an authorized user on my account. A procedure that is completely short circuited in the event that I give somebody power of attorney, because the law says they are required to respect that contract. Except for those who are. And you do realize that you are just strengthening my argument in regards to gay marriage...right? The biggest part of marriage from a legal perspective is the right of your spouse to act as your agent. You are the one putting forth that premise. There is no ""illusion"" in the real world because the law forces everybody to recognize those purchase contracts, thus transferring actual ownership, and with them the transference of ownership rights. If the world worked as you claim it does, and nobody is forced to recognize a contract that they are not an immediate participant in, the entire thing would be nothing but an illusion. They require that the business be treated as a unique and individual legal entity. You cannot hold the owners directly or financially responsible for the acts of the company. Typically yes. What we are talking about here is contracts that are specifically sanctioned by law. Wrong. When you are talking about contractual arrangements that are specifically authorized and defined by law, they move beyond ""privilege"" and is by definition a legal right. You have the legal right in this country to be married. More specifically, you have a liberty right to be married, and once married you have a claim right to force others to recognize that marriage. In discussing power of attorney above, executing a power of attorney contract results in creation of a claim right...others are compelled, or have a duty, to recognize your decision to create an agent to act on your behalf. Likewise transference of property creates a claim right in that it creates in others a duty to recognize your ownership of the property in question. Wrong answer, sport. There are natural rights and there are legal rights (rights created through legislation). And the government is not allowed to practice discrimination in neither of these activities. No, its not. Both marriage and medical proxy-ship (I like that term) are legal rights. Neither is a natural right. As legal rights, they can be fully shaped via legislation so long as they are equally applied (no discrimination) and do not infringe on a natural right. Except that a hospital, while required to recognize the decisions of a persons medical proxy, may choose to ignore those decisions if they feel they are not being made in the best interests of the patient. They do not have that option when receiving directions directly from the patient. And, again, the biggest legal part of marriage is your spouses ability to act as, and be recognized as, your agent in pretty much all matters. If you are married and would want your wife to be your health care proxy, there is no need to create a health care proxy because your wife is already your proxy by law. Establishing gender as a requirement to formation of a contract is by definition discrimination and is illegal....it violated a recognized and enforced natural right.","Freedom","456404","The law says the are required to get your consent, the law allows them to get it from your delegate. If they don't want to deal with your delegate they don't get your consent. They are not being forced to accept your delegate anymore than they are being forced to accept you. No one is. And my point is that since you already have a right to declare someone your agent, you have the right to declare your spouse an agent which means that the ' biggest ' part of marriage is available right here and right now to homosexual couples. No it doesn't, it forces them to recognize ownership rights, and it recognizes the purchase contracts. No one has to be a party to transfer of ownership rights except the original owner, hence the need for only one signature. They are forced to recognize people's rights but no contract naming them as a participant is valid until they sign it. You are mincing terms, when I said recognize you knew I meant 'recognize they were married' and thereby are forced to call them married and treat them the same as they heterosexual marriages. They have to recognize the rights of homosexuals which includes their right to property and to extend consent through agency. If I wanted to sue the company of course I would have to recognize it existed. I am not forced to sell to the company, buy from the company, give special treatment to the company or any of it's members. Excellent, those are all immoral. The government does not have a right to force people (violate rights), and thus their special sanction cannot extend that right. Right Rights cannot be asserted in to existence. Note also that you said specifically authorized and defined by law. What happens when it is claimed that the definition itself is discrimination? Well you could redefine it, but that would be beyond the scope of this supposed legal right because it would be beyond the definition given. I am not interested in legal rights, only rights, and the definition of marriage is a class of contract between men and women. There can be no right to force others to do what you wish them to do. The only moral use of force is to stop another from violating rights, and it is not a violation of anyone's rights to fail to do something for them. The 'duty' to recognize the need for the consent of others or their right to their property existed before the contract and cannot be a result of it. Right answer, soccer. Legislation cannot create rights. The idea that such could be believed to happen worried many founding fathers. That's an inappropriate double negative, and they practice discrimination all the time. They discriminate between citizens and non-citizens, between the employed and the unemployed. If the rarest of minorities applies for unemployment, but they have a job; they won't get it. Not because they are a minority, but because they don't fit the definition of a candidate. That is the situation we are dealing with here. The law does not care if you're homosexual, but you can't instantiate a marriage contract if your contract doesn't fit the definition of marriage. What do you mean by applied equally? Does that mean their definitions cannot contain any discrimination between types of people? (unemployed and non-citizen are in fact categories of people). That is merely a degree of proxy-ship (I'm glad you like that term?), one has the right to allow another to speak for them as them, or just up till a certain point. The point of contracts is to state such things clearly. You are reduced to complaining about convenience? Write a marriage contract, include all proxy extension, sign it; the government will enforce it so long as it's valid, and it will be valid so long as the two signers have the authority to consent to all constraints of the contract. Gender is not a requirement for the formation of 'a contract', it is part of the class definition for a 'specifically sanctioned' contract. The tax code and unemployment benefits providing conditions for those benefits based on income is also by definition discrimination.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","04:08 PM","gay-rights-debates","102"

The point is, as you said; not to undermine the law of other states but to prevent corruption that might occur if one state starts rejecting the legal works of other states just because they are other states. Another example: California has criteria A for open carry permit. Texas has criteria B for open carry permit. Texas open carry permit is not valid in California. Full faith and credit means California must recognize that the state of Texas looked into the matter and concluded Rick met the criteria for a Texas state open carry permit . That is all full faith and credit requires, it does not require California to recognize that Rick has met the criteria for California state open carry permit; which is good because that is not what Texas was claiming. If however the criteria are the same for both states, California would have to accept the open carry permit because they already accept that Texas confirmed that Rick meets their common criteria.

If however the criteria changed, this one no longer be true. Such is the case with homosexual marriages.

If you are talking purely religious reasons....a law that said ""The Lord Almighty and Jesus Christ and Joseph Smith say marriage is between a man and a woman"", I think there would be a religious issue there. I wish people could get it through their heads that when we are talking about the legality of Gay marriage...or any marriage...it has nothing to do with religion. Legal marriage has nothing to do with religion. It is all a matter of contract law. If you beat your wife for being disobedient, or kill her for committing adultery, no court is going to set you free because the bible says that is part of marriage. If you wife files for divorce and you walk in to court with a bible and say it is not possible because the bible says so, you are going to end up divorced anyway. If you marry a woman against her will because her father says it is OK, it does not matter if the bible says it is OK, you are going to do 30 to life for kidnapping, most likely with another 15 tacked on for rape. Ironically enough, that is the same argument I used to use when I was opposed to legalizing gay marriage...mostly because I just didn't think it was worth the trouble and mess. I argued that the legal part of marriage was not the important part...it was the ""spiritual"" part that mattered....even if all the paperwork vanished tomorrow, nothing would change between me and my wife...it is not the paperwork that makes the marriage, it is the commitment. For all intents and purposes, that is the ""religious"" side of marriage. Sorry to say, the religious folks have already lost that battle...I know several gay couples who consider themselves married despite the lack of paperwork. As I thought about it more, when it comes to the legality of gay marriage, it is actually the spiritual or religious side of things that is irrelevant. The legal side of things actually is a big deal when I started thinking about it a little more. I have said before that marriage is, from a legal standpoint, basically a prepackaged civil contract that recognizes certain rights between 2 parties. For some people that might not matter....personally, though, I use my wife as my proxy all the time. It would cost a fortune in legal fees to draft all the power of attorney forms and joint ownership agreements, and health care proxys and liability contracts that are all automatic now because they are part of that pre packaged contract. That changed my opinion completely. I don't care if we call it ""marriage"" or not, but I see no reason that you should not be able to assign another individual, regardless of their sex or even their relationship to you, the same legal status as a spouse.

If you are talking purely religious reasons....a law that said ""The Lord Almighty and Jesus Christ and Joseph Smith say marriage is between a man and a woman"", I think there would be a religious issue there. I wish people could get it through their heads that when we are talking about the legality of Gay marriage...or any marriage...it has nothing to do with religion. Legal marriage has nothing to do with religion. It is all a matter of contract law. If you beat your wife for being disobedient, or kill her for committing adultery, no court is going to set you free because the bible says that is part of marriage. If you wife files for divorce and you walk in to court with a bible and say it is not possible because the bible says so, you are going to end up divorced anyway. If you marry a woman against her will because her father says it is OK, it does not matter if the bible says it is OK, you are going to do 30 to life for kidnapping, most likely with another 15 tacked on for rape. Ironically enough, that is the same argument I used to use when I was opposed to legalizing gay marriage...mostly because I just didn't think it was worth the trouble and mess. I argued that the legal part of marriage was not the important part...it was the ""spiritual"" part that mattered....even if all the paperwork vanished tomorrow, nothing would change between me and my wife...it is not the paperwork that makes the marriage, it is the commitment. For all intents and purposes, that is the ""religious"" side of marriage. Sorry to say, the religious folks have already lost that battle...I know several gay couples who consider themselves married despite the lack of paperwork. As I thought about it more, when it comes to the legality of gay marriage, it is actually the spiritual or religious side of things that is irrelevant. The legal side of things actually is a big deal when I started thinking about it a little more. I have said before that marriage is, from a legal standpoint, basically a prepackaged civil contract that recognizes certain rights between 2 parties. For some people that might not matter....personally, though, I use my wife as my proxy all the time. It would cost a fortune in legal fees to draft all the power of attorney forms and joint ownership agreements, and health care proxys and liability contracts that are all automatic now because they are part of that pre packaged contract. That changed my opinion completely. I don't care if we call it ""marriage"" or not, but I see no reason that you should not be able to assign another individual, regardless of their sex or even their relationship to you, the same legal status as a spouse. If you want to assign somebody as your proxy, and commingle your financial and business interests with theirs without a hassle, you should be able to.","Steeeeve","466520","And none of the laws say that. They all say marriage is between and man and a woman. The reasoning behind someone voting for that law is irrelevant. 100% of the people who voted for the law could have done so because while they were sleeping they got a vision which told them to vote a certain way and there is absolutely nothing unconstitutional about that. When the Supreme Court gets around to finally allowing gay marriage (and they will) it will be done based upon an incorrect interpretation of the 14th amendment as opposed to a 1st amendment violation. The spiritual side of marriage is by far the more important side, in my opinion. Yeah the ""proxy package"" is helpful in dealings with the government but it's not nearly as important to me. I think both sides of the argument fail here. Both think if they win that the spiritual side of marriage will come back and be in their lives.

Once you strip away the emotional baggage and religious significance, what is left is a civil contract, not entirely dissimilar to the formation of a corporation. I have trouble imaging a court upholding a law that 2 women cannot start a corporation. I think that is maybe the biggest problem on both sides of the argument. The antis want to argue that allowing gays to marry would cheapen their own marriage somehow. You see an awful lot of gay people arguing that somehow their marriage is only ""real"" if the government sanctions it. Frankly, those people are in crappy marriages. If the government stopped recognizing my marriage tomorrow it would not change the relationship between myself and my wife at all. I think that any good marriage is like that on a spiritual level. It is a personal commitment or bond between 2 people. They don't need some third party to put a stamp of approval on it. Once the spiritual side of marriage is off the table, all that is left is the legal. I can understand why that would be a big deal to somebody. In some states (mine included) your spouse is your medical proxy. I could name another medical proxy, but my wife could still over-rule them if she wanted. You hear stories about gay people not being allowed to be there when their ""spouse"" of multiple decades lays dying in the hospital because they are not actually relatives. Put yourself in that situation. If my wife was laying in a hospital bed dying and somebody told me I could not be with her, they had better have a swat team standing behind them. I would kill anybody who stood in my way and damn the consequences. Whatever you may feel about the morality of 2 men getting married, they feel the same way about each other that you feel about your wife, and I feel about my wife. Putting them in that situation is just plain evil. You say that the proxy package is not that important to you, but then you have it. You don't have to worry that if you died on the way to work tomorrow that your family would come in and wipe your spouse out because some of them didn't approve of your lifestyle. That happens to gay couples all the time. There is no automatic inheritance for them and in most states your next of kin are the only party that have legal standing to challenge a will...and they do...and often they win because the fact that you were with your partner for 50 years is meaningless in the eyes of the law. I have a friend who is gay. He has been with the same partner for 10 years. They have a better ""marriage"" than most straight people I know. 2 years ago they were in a car wreck. My friend broke his pelvis, his partner broke several ribs, an arm, and got a nasty concussion. He was unconscious when they reached the hospital. Under Kansas law, the hospital could only stabilize the guy, not actually treat him, without his next of kin giving consent. My friend was his partners medical proxy, but apparently it had not occurred to him to carry that paperwork around with him all the time. His partner lay there for almost 6 hours before he could get somebody to go to their house, dig out the paperwork, and get it to the hospital.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","08:06 PM","gay-rights-debates","123"

Telling people the truth that gay sex is a sin is bullying people? That's bizarre. My beliefs on gay sex are based in the Bible, and nothing else. One could say yours were based in Sodom and Gomorrah. Love speaks the truth. Active gays need to repent of their sins and receive Christ as their Lord and Savior for the remission of their sins, or they're lost on Judgment Day.

In addition to having at least one male sex partner, 14% of participants had at least one female sex partner during the past 12 months. Unprotected anal intercourse with a male partner was reported by 54% of the participants; 37% reported having unprotected anal sex with a main male partner (someone with whom the participant had sex and to whom he felt most committed, such as a boyfriend, spouse, significant other, or life partner), and 25% reported having unprotected anal sex with a casual male partner (someone with whom the participant had sex but with whom he did not feel committed, did not know very well, or had sex with in exchange for something such as money or drugs). Noninjection drug use during the past 12 months was reported by 46% of participants. Specifically, 38% used marijuana, 18% cocaine, 13% poppers (amyl nitrate), and 11% ecstasy. Two percent of the participants reported injecting drugs for nonmedical purposes in the past 12 months. Of the participants surveyed, 90% had been tested for HIV during their lifetime, 62% had been tested during the past 12 months, 51% had received a hepatitis vaccination, 35% had been tested for syphilis during the past 12 months, and 18% had participated in an individual- or group-level HIV behavioral intervention. Interpretation: MSM in the United States continue to engage in sexual and drug-use behaviors that increase the risk for HIV infection. Although many MSM had been tested for HIV infection, many had not received hepatitis vaccinations or syphilis testing, and only a small proportion had recently participated in a behavioral intervention.

Destroying those two cities, punishing the sinful, etc. But those are most certainly NOT guidelines for us mere humans to live our lives. God is the general, he can see the whole picture and thus can act. We are grunts, we can't see a fraction of what he can see. Our job is to follow orders. Jesus had given us our 'marching orders' as it is. And nowhere does he tell us to influence politics, make laws prohibiting this and that, etc. We are citizens of heaven, not of heaven. And out duty, our God-given duty, is to love others. To serve them in humility and kindness, to not judge them. To provide BOUNDLESS mercy and to walk in the light of Christ. Frankly, I've wondered if Christians should even be involved in laws. We're not primary citizens of this earth, so why should we really bother? Perhaps we should be neutral, a red cross like, helping people and treating them all equally. Our job, our duty is to follow the rules Jesus has given us. Our other duty is to walk with God and talk with him, so he may guide us in his plans. Condemning the gays and fighting their movement is not Christian. God has given us all -every last human being- a choice in how to live our lives. We wanted the freedom, we got it. And every last one of us has sinned, we do daily. So to condemn the gays -or anyone for that matter- is both utterly pointless and completely hypocritical. If anything, you should be even more loving and compassionate and friendly towards the gay community because they very much need the love of God in their lives. A sin is a sin in the end EZ, being gay is not some special, particularly horrible type of sin. It doesn't require any special treatment or any such nonsense.

Most of your remarks would be equally applicable to a heterosexual couple or other denomination, here let me show you the extent of your biased religious agenda. Next, they push their illicit agenda into every corner of America. Suing the Boy Scouts and anyone else who disagrees with them. People suffer financial loss defending themselves from christian lawsuits. Evangelicals try and sometimes succeed in pushing their Christian agenda in elementary schools and elsewhere where it doesn't belong. Nine year old children shouldn't have to hear that Billy's daddy is doing another woman, or that it's ok to do it. They push their agenda in our faces until we're quite sick of it. We don't need to know which way people perform sex acts. You see what i did there, and the schools bit lines up perfectly... And the adulterous hetero as well. They call you a bigot because you are, you are intolerant toward them and expect them to be happy with being a second class citizen. Unfortunately reason has prevailed in the last 100 years EZ. First with womens rights, then racial rights and now it will be sexual rights. If they are an end unto themselves that should make you happy right? Not passing on their sinful genes...

LOS ANGELES (Sept. 24, 2009) - Susan Atkins, a follower of cult leader Charles Manson whose remorseless witness stand confession to killing pregnant actress Sharon Tate in 1969 shocked the world, has died. She was 61 and had been suffering from brain cancer. The matronly, gray-haired Atkins who appeared before a parole board in 2000 cut a far different figure than that of the cocky young defendant some 30 years earlier. ""I don't have to just make amends to the victims and families,"" she said softly. ""I have to make amends to society. I sinned against God and everything this country stands for."" She said she had found redemption in Christianity. The last words she spoke in public at the September hearing were to say in unison with her husband: ""My God is an amazing God."" Breaking News and Opinion on The Huffington Post The Bishop of Rochester, Dr Michael Nazir-Ali, has defended traditional biblical teachings on homosexuality and said the Church should not be ""rolled over by culture"". ""The Bibles teaching shows that marriage is between a man and a woman. That is the way to express our sexual nature. ""We welcome homosexuals, we dont want to exclude people, but we want them to repent and be changed."" Change and repent, bishop tells gays - Telegraph Assuming Susan Atkins repentance and conversion in Christ was legitimate, she will get to heaven before the unrepentant gay pride practitioners.

He set us up to break the law and then punishes us when we do just what he wanted us to do. ...and he knew that was going to happen before he created that person so the person was doing what it was designed to do and what your god wanted it to do. Why does that deserve punishment? The more I see of Christians, the more I doubt their sanity. Your god requires 'justice' so he gets it by the most UNJUST of methods; he punishes the innocent for the crimes of the guilty...brilliant! Another thing that you might like to consider is the ever recurring theme of 'FORGIVENESS' that runs through the Bible, yet forgiving is clearly something that is not very high on your god's list of priorities. His main preoccupation is very clearly REVENGE. He demands that we forgive those that trespass against us but him - well he needs blood sacrifices and punishment. He demands that we do something that he isn't prepared to do himself and that makes him a hypocrite.","ANorveyanFellow","475177","I'm sorry, but I have come to decide that going over all this with you is a waste of time.

And why is hell the only other option? Was that part of god's plan too? Now we have to work out why you believe this god's judgement to be flawless, his judgement to be fair and just. Do you make this judgement because he claims to be perfect in every way? Maybe you do not question his judgement because he told you not to. Perhaps you should start by examining the evidence of his judgement (ie questioning his judgement). Look at his actions rather than just believing his words. Don't start from the assumption that he is perfect and therefore must have good reasons for his actions. Is this the same god who struck a man down for collecting firewood on the Sabbath? Was that fair and just? Is this the same god who sent she bears to rip forty-two children to pieces because they taunted Elisha? Is that the action of a just god? Is this the same god who allowed Satan to kill Job's sons as part of a bet (presumably, he had the power to stop him)? Fair, just? Need I go on? If you look at the evidence (if you count the bible as evidence) of your god's actions, without the assumption that all he does must have some greater meaning (you only have his word for that) you cannot come to the conclusion that he is just and fair and perfect. And just to push the point, if I were a perfect being with perfect judgement, I would have done a far better job of advertising the fact than to produce a book listing all the atrocities I had committed, but ordering that no-one question the fairness of these actions on pain of eternal torture.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","09:23 AM","gay-rights-debates","322"

It is an ignorant, ridiculous, farce. We are all dumber for having read it. Are you mentally retarded? First, most muslims do not hate jews. Do you know why so many Jews fled to the middle east during WWII? It was because it was pretty much the only place on the planet that they were NOT hated. Even here in the US jews were HEAVILY discriminated against. In the middle east they were not. After israel declared itself its own nation...a Jewish nation...and started killing Arabs in the area (Palestinians) Middle eastern Muslims started hating the jews and zionists. Most of them STILL dont hate jews who do not live in israel...non zionist. Since Israel became a nation they have killed 90,785 Palestinians. The Palestinians have killed 3,722 Israelis. The Israelis literally seized Palestinian homes, herded them into refugee camps, then shelled the camps. That does not even include the casualties of wars of aggression that the Israelis have fought against their neighbors. If you include those the Israelis have outkilled the arabs/palestenians by over 600:1. So..yea...the Israelis are hated by pretty much everybody who has any concept of justice, not just muslims, and they are hated for the same reason that the Nazis were. When it comes to middle eastern arabs, that is 100% their own doing. Statistically speaking there is not a single family in the middle east who has not lost a family member to Israeli aggression. Today, in the middle east, most muslims hate israelis because they are a bunch of murdering scumbags. That does not necessarily translate into a hatred of jews in general, unless you are an ignorant bafoon who does not understand the difference. In fact, nearly 30% of terrorist attacks that have taken place in isreal in the last 2 decades have been aimed at NON JEWISH TARGETS. Also, most muslims do not even live in the middle east and simply do not care one way or another.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","08:20 PM","gay-rights-debates","345"

Realistically native Americans have a MUCH, MUCH stronger claim on the US than the Jews do on Israel. Prior to the creation of Israel there had not been a self ruled Jewish state in the middle east for nearly 8000 years. Also, the Jews were not forcibly evicted from the region...they left on their own. The native Americans, on the other hand, owned the entire continent less than 300 years ago. White settlers murdered millions of them and broke literally dozens of treaties that gave the native americans LEGAL TITLE to wide swaths of what is currently the US. The US government violated multiple supreme court rulings that found that the indians legally owned their land and the government did not have the right to remove them. So, easy, if a native American showed up at your house tomorrow, murdered everybody in your family, and seized the house as their own, you would be OK with that? The Israelis had no legitimate claim to the land they seized. That Indian that just chopped your wife's head off WOULD have a legitimate claim, so it is a little different.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","05:51 AM","gay-rights-debates","377"

Israel has it's own land, 'given' to them by the UN. Since the late 1940's they have persistently invaded Palestine, stolen land in order to build settlements and ousted the legal owners of that land. They have acted despicably and maggots like you should hang their head in shame for supporting them. Even if there were only a handful, they have a greater right to the land than you.","Easyrider","475435","Take a Midol, you miserable PMS wretch. I'll stick with what I said. As far as I recall, the only lands Israel annexed are those where enemies of Israel attacked them and lost. And when they've invaded areas like Lebanon it's because they were attacking Israel first. That's the penalty the attacking imbeciles pay. So stick that in your uneducated rump. Anybody who screws with Israel is going to get screwed worse in return. Why don't you fly your portly-a*s over to your pro-Palestinian friends and explain that to them. They're obviously too ignorant to figure it out. Sorry, sport, but the law says you're full of it.

"07-08-2013","17119",31,"Hdreams","475528","Bible Archaeology? So this is Archaeology that supports the biblical tales? please elaborate if you will. I have seen supposed bible archaeology and i presume you are referring to William F. Albright and the Evangelical view of biblical archaeology but id like to know from your view.... This should be good. I asked you a specific issue that disproves the argument of Resurrection and you came back with an evasion. You said you were open minded that if the Resurrection could be disproved that would be the game so i am challenging it. What basis in the bible or theology does the laws of biology and coagulation of the blood after death cease when Jesus was dead. Abiogenesis has nothing to do with human biology after death and coagulation... Why the evasion, lets deal with one issue at a time or you get nowhere. But to humor you i will lay out to the best of my knowledge some of what you ask in the hope that you have some level of academic or argumental capacity to answer the question i pose of you.... Firstly enzymes are advanced and complicated proteins and would not have been a building block of life to my knowledge though very primitive example's of them could have been present (This is a possibility)... The basic blocks of DNA, thymine guanine cytosine adenine... being the basic blocks of dna have been proposed through abiogenesis to be mutually attractive to their respective base pair... Much like the accumulation of iron filings under the influence of a magnet... You can see how this proposition would be plausible to create small chain helical structures of a primitive form of DNA/RNA (RNA being the early form of this structure) The forces between the two necleotide pairs have been well recorded in their level of attraction and i will cite this here. http://www.pnas.org/content/92/12/5297.full.pdf http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/conten.../3289.full.pdf All of these nucleotides are found in nature as well as phosphoric acid which along with deoxyribose and ribose form the backbone of the DNA molecule. Moving onto your question of the cell wall, ribosome, nucleus, mitochondria, lysosome etc and their incorporation to form a cell. Firstly free floating proteins are common and do not require a cell. So the first organic molecules would have been fine to exist without cellular structure. Most apparatus of what we consider cell infrastructure most likely is the incorporation of multiple organisms into one structure or under 1 roof for lack of a better term. Mitochondria have their own Rna sequences and this is one of the methods we can use to track human population movements into our pre-history, by referencing and analyzing the mitochondrial code. The modern cell wall being the Lipid bilayer is a modern and recent invention in the history of life... For several billion years life was Uni-cellular and the most common form of life was the distant and primitive ancestors of modern algae, extremophiles etc which likely had no or semi formed lipid encapsulating them. The cell wall would have been a major advance in the evolution of life and given a degree safety to proteins from the ""elements"". I could go on here but i doubt any further elaboration would simply generate the same answer i imagine i will get here anyway.... Your initial request which i have answered partially within the limits of my free time and that you can check on the internet and study for yourself. Lastly i would say that your question in itself is also the actions of one scared to hear the answers... You ask me to explain the encapsulation of the development of life and the current theories we have simply because you have no answer to the problem of coagulation in a dead Jesus. The subjects are in no way related and you might have well have asked about the moon but you simply wish to evade any problematic question.","Easyrider","475530","There all kinds of websites on Bible archaeology. Some are good and some aren't. This is what I was saying when I said you did 1 (one) superficial reading of the Bible. It's obvious since you're asking about it that you did zero investigative studies on Bible archaeology. And now you want me to show it to you? Do your own homework like you should have done before debating the issue. Sorry, sport. I wasn't there and am not privy to how God performs his miracles. If you can quote scientific studies showing God and the supernatural do not and cannot exist, THEN you might have a case for disproving the resurrection. I have multiple historical accounts from independent sources. You have squat. Abiogenesis deals with how life allegedly EVOLVED from non-organic life. You atheists always try to use that evasive argument that it's not related to evolution so you don't have to deal with it. This is all very nice but you weren't there when abiogenesis allegedly occurred, so you really don't know the specific process and order of what actually occurred, do you? In fact, you can't even, with any evidence, demonstrate what the exact environment was back then; what temperatures were at the time, etc., etc. You can only theorize. BUT, because you believe it happened, you take your best guess and defend it. OH YE OF GREAT FAITH !! In fact, scientists can't even create life in a clinical environment under carefully controlled conditions, can they? And if they could, it would be by INTELLIGENT DESIGN. Wrong, sport. What I was doing was giving you a dose of your own medicine. You made a nice try at answering, but it's obvious to me you haven't a clue what really occurred, precisely where it occurred, or what elements were actually present at the time. On sciences attempts to explain / justify abiogenesis: There isnt any doubt that science, for the moment at least, is at a dead end. The optimism of the 1950s is gone. The mood at the 1999 international conference on origin of life was described as grim full of frustration, pessimism, and desperation. Nobody pretends that any alternative provides a reasonable path of how life went unguided from simple chemicals to proteins to basic life forms. Quote by Walter L. Bradley, Ph.d., who received his B.S. in Engineering Science and his Ph.D. in Materials Science from the University of Texas in Austin. He taught as an Assistant and Associate Professor of Metallurgical Engineering at the Colorado School of Mines before assuming a position as Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University (TAMU) in 1976. Dr. Bradley, also served as Head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University and as Director of the Polymer Technology Center at TAMU. He currently serves as Distinguished Professor of Engineering at Baylor University. Designed or Designoid Klaus Dose, the biochemist whos considered one of the foremost experts in this area, summed up the situation pretty well: More than thirty years of experimentation on the origin of life in the fields of chemical and molecular evolution have led to a better perception of the immensity of the problem of the origin of life on earth rather than to its solution. At present all discussions on principle theories and experiments in the field have either ended in stalemate or in a confession of ignorance.

You're full of cr*p. Jesus even calls himself Lord of the Sabbath and ""I AM."" Virtually every Christian denomination in America recognizes Jesus as God. Here's some more evidences you can try to ignore. Is Jesus God? What do the Scriptures say? John 1:23 quotes Isaiah 40:3 as saying John the Baptist was to prepare the way for the LORD (Jehovah). John prepared the way before Jesus so Jesus must be LORD (Jehovah). In Isaiah 44:8 God is the only Rock. Psalm 18:31 says, Who is the Rock except our God? I Corinthians 10:4, identifies Jesus as the Rock. Jesus must also then be God the Rock. Isaiah 44:24 says that God (Jehovah) is the one who has made all things. Colossians 1:16, speaking of Christ, says that all things were created by Him and for him. Jesus must therefore be Jehovah God. In Jeremiah 10:10 it says the LORD (Jehovah) is the true God. I John 5:20 states that Jesus is the true God. Jesus must be the true God. Isaiah 43:10,11 says that I, even I, am the LORD; and there is no savior besides Me. Jesus is the Savior (Matthew 1:21, Titus 2:13; 2 Peter 1:1, etc., etc.). Jesus must be God the Savior. Jehovah knows all things (Psalm 147:5). Jesus knows all things. (John 16:30). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah alone is the only one who knows the hearts of all men. (1 Kings 8:39; Jeremiah 17:9-10). Jesus knows the hearts of all men. (John 2:24-25; Rev. 2:18, 23). Jesus must be God. Jehovah is our sanctifier. (Exodus 31:13). Jesus sanctifies us (Hebrews 10:10). Only God is the sanctifier of men. Jesus must be God. Jehovah is our peace (Judges 6:23). Jesus is our peace (Ephesians 2:14). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah is our righteousness (Jeremiah 23:6). Jesus is our righteousness. (Romans 3:21-22; 1 Corinthians 1:30). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah is the giver of life who will not allow His people to be delivered / snatched out of His hand (Deuteronomy 32:39). Jesus is the giver of life who will not allow His people to be snatched out of His hand. (John 10:28). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovahs voice is like the roar of rushing waters (Ezekiel 43:2). Jesus voice was like the sound of rushing waters (Revelation 1:15). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah is present everywhere.(Proverbs 15:3; Jeremiah 23:24; I Kings 8:27); Jesus is omnipresent (John 1:48; Matthew 18:20; 28:20). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovahs nature does not change (Malachi 3:6). Jesus nature does not change. (Hebrews 13:8). Jehovah is the only God we are to serve(2 Kings 17:35); Jesus (identified as the Creator in Colossians 1:16-17) is to be served (Colossians 3:24). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah the Lord is to be set apart as holy (Isaiah 8:12b-13). Jesus, as Lord, is to be set apart as holy (1 Peter 3:14b-15a). Jehovahs glory is not to be given to another (Isaiah 42:8). Jesus shares Jehovahs glory (John 17:5). Jesus must be Jehovah. Gods name is Jehovah (or YahwehYHWH Isaiah 42:8). Jesus has Jehovahs name (John 17:11; John 16:14-15). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah is the mighty God (Jeremiah 32:17-18; Isaiah 10:20-21). Jesus is the mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) who is Almighty (Revelation 1:7-8). Jehovah is the first and the last (Isaiah 44:6; 48:12). Jesus is the first and the last (Revelation 1:17-18; 22:12-13, 20). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah is the Alpha and the Omega (Revelation 1:8; Revelation 21:6-7). Jesus is the Alpha and the Omega (Revelation 22:12-13, 20). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovahs title is the Holy One (Isaiah 47:4). Jesus is the Holy One (Acts 3:14; John 6:69). Jesus must be Jehovah, the Holy One. Jehovah is the stumbling stone of Israel (Isaiah 8:13-15). Jesus is the stumbling stone of Israel (1 Peter 2:6-8). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah is the great Judge who gives life to whom he wishes and who renders to each man according to his deeds (Psalm 98:9; Deuteronomy 32:39; Jeremiah 17:9-10). Jesus is the only judge who gives life to whom he wishes and renders to each man according to his deeds (John 5:21-22; Revelation 2:18, 23). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah is the great shepherd who leads his people to the spring of the water of life (Psalm 23:1-2; Revelation 21:6-7). Jesus as the shepherd of His people, leads them to springs of the water of life (John 10:11-18; Revelation 7:17). THERE IS ONLY ONE SHEPHERD John 10:16. Jehovah is Lord of Lords (Deuteronomy 10:17). Jesus is Lord of Lords. (Revelation 17:14; 19:16). The Father is Lord of all (Matthew 11:25; Acts 17:24). Jesus is Lord of all. (Acts 10:36). THERE IS ONLY ONE LORD (Jude 4) . Jehovah created the universe (Psalm 102:25-27). Jesus created the universe (John 1:3; Colossians 1:15-19; Hebrews 1:10-12). THERE IS ONLY ONE CREATOR. (Isaiah 44:24). Jesus must be Jehovah.

Fortunately you will not succeed...nobody has in 1500 years.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","03:04 PM","gay-rights-debates","512"
"09-03-2013","17119",35,"daewoo","477107","That is cute and all, but also WRONG. Lets look at the first verse he uses to make his claim...John 14 Of course he limits it to verse 9, but we will look at it in context: Whoops...he is saying god is in him...he is filled with the spirit of the lord...not that he is literally a physical manifestation of God. Even in John, which was heavily redacted and is the only gospel that claims that Jesus claimed to be anything but a man, Jesus never claims to actually be god.

And you're a spiritual imbecile. 53 Surely You are not greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets died too; whom do You make Yourself out to be? 54 Jesus answered, If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; it is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say, He is our God ; 55 and you have not come to know Him, but I know Him ; and if I say that I do not know Him, I will be a liar like you, but I do know Him and keep His word . 56 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad. 57 So the Jews said to Him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham? 58 Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am. 59 Therefore they picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple.","daewoo","477126","Lets put that into context: Sorry, sleazy, once again you are full of schit. Jesus expressly refers to god as his father and says that god glorifies him, that he knows god and keeps the word of god. He is VERY clearly not talking about himself here. Before you make yourself look even more foolish and ignorant I am going to point out that the gospel of John was written within a Johannine community and in its present form was completed about 90AD. The cathars, who we briefly covered earlier and who believed that Jesus was an angel, trace their roots directly back to that community (via Paulicianism....named for Paul of Samosata). In other words, you are not going to find anything in the gospel of John that establishes that Jesus was god, because the guys who wrote the gospel of John believed that Jesus was an angel who was sent here in human form. The gospel of john is pretty much the dumbest place imaginable to start looking for evidence that Jesus was God. Do you know anything at all about the religion you claim to follow, or do you just make up silly BS as you go?","obama-supports-gay-marriage","06:20 PM","gay-rights-debates","515"
