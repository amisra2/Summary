One, that roving gangs of gays would start attacking heterosexual men. The second one was that a gay man would have a woman's uterus transplanted in him for the goal of having a baby. That's how sick you people are.","smiley","466777","So now you're judging people on the basis of what someone has prophesied might happen. If you're looking for the sick mind in this instance, look at the one who made the prophecy - and you're not far behind for making your preemptive judgement, with an enormous generalisation tagged on the side.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","03:33 PM","gay-rights-debates","136"

Remember a wise man once said ""Religion is the opiate of the masses""","gansao","466778","Also if you believe Karl Marx was wise you have made a mistake. If homosexuals had the good book on their side they would be going down on their knees even more than they do now. I would rather fantasize about a creator that gave us the morals of the New Testament than fantasize about the bloke next doors backside thanks","obama-supports-gay-marriage","03:42 PM","gay-rights-debates","137"

Remember a wise man once said ""Religion is the opiate of the masses""","Xenamnes","466780","The wise man you speak of was not making a factually accurate comparison in his statement but rather voicing a general discontent for the practicing of religion and having beliefs in matters that cannot be immediately verified through currently available scientific measures. Opiates are a narcotic substance used in medicine for beneficial purposes but also abused in recreational manners for the purpose of intoxication. Simply having beliefs in higher powers does not creative negative side effects on a person's health, their economic standing or driving in general. Those who practice religion do not generally become incapable of standing upright or hallucinate that a random strange has transformed into a literal rabid animal and is trying to kill them. Further separating the two standards is the fact that narcotic substances create physical addictions and one cannot simply give up their physical addictions in the same manner they would simply stop thinking in a certain manner. Anyone choosing to forgoe narcotic substances after becoming physically addicted would face the possibility of dying without adequate medical treatment to stabilize their body. The same cannot be said for religion. Religion is no more than opiate than is a person choosing to believe in something they want to believe. It is no more of an opiate than the homosexual community choosing to believe that they are somehow entitled to a widespread mainstream acceptance of its selected practices.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","04:33 PM","gay-rights-debates","138"

The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.","smiley","466799","There is certainly no evidence that he does exist, so the 'attack' presumably doesn't exist either. In other posts I have merely pointed out that the actions that have been ascribed to your god would make him unworthy of worship. To quote Dawkins . .

Scientists have been unable to fabricate an effective cure or treatment and cannot even explain what causes the diseases to occur in the manner that they do. In some of these cases the diseases are so rare they do not even have a name and the only proof of their existence is when one out of several hundred million individuals becomes afflicted. Are we to assume that these diseases do not truly exist because of their baffling nature to science and their extreme rarity of occurrence? Or do we concede that science is not capable of answering every question and solving every mystery that is presented?","obama-supports-gay-marriage","12:58 PM","gay-rights-debates","145"

These diseases manifest themselves in the real world and are observable. They can be tested, and the results of those tests can be measured. As for the science you mention, for scientists to admit that they 'don't know' or 'can't explain' something is just plain honest. Something they do all the time.

"11-21-2012","17119",10,"Easyrider","454731","Obama Now Supports Gay Marriage President Obama Affirms His Support for Same Sex Marriage | ABC News Blogs - Yahoo! One of the reasons Obama cited for his support of gay marriage was that we ought to ""...you know, treat others the way you would want to be treated"" (the Golden Rule). That's pathetic. Under that standard we ought to respect people who practice pedophilia, because that's how they would want to be treated. Same with adulterers, people who practice incest, etc. Obama is the most Biblically-challenged President I think we've ever had. Any Christian or Bible-believing Jew who supports this man is a spiritually bankrupt reprobate.","simone","466811","O Krikey!
