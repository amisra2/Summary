In fact, if there's enough of us, we can pass a Constitutional Amendment to ban gay marriage, etc. By the way, did you know the founding fathers and others attended church services in the US Capitol Bldg. and other federal buildings, and that continued up to and shortly after the Civil War? Kind of puts the ""separation of church"" and state in a different light for you, n'est pas?","Hdreams","475009","Your right, and gay marriage in no way inhibits your right to vote as you see fit... What is does do is prevent said religious groups from proposing laws, amendments and policies on religious grounds that would discriminate against a group of people. Again ill say it, freedom of religion also entails freedom from religion","obama-supports-gay-marriage","12:52 PM","gay-rights-debates","241"

And gay sex is wickedness. We also propose laws against the wickedness of aborting the innocent unborn. So we're alive and well in the voting booth, and the battle isn't over yet. There's also a higher court than the US Supreme Court, and that's God. And when he's had enough of this sodomy and wickedness he'll bring it to a screeching halt. And if not now, then at the Judgment. There won't be any gay pride cr*p in heaven.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","01:06 PM","gay-rights-debates","243"

The wisdom and strength of the constitution is talked about whenever individuals wish to prevent things such as gun reform, abortion etc... But when it suits you, you have no problem with ignoring the supposed wisdom of the founding fathers in their desire to create a nation for all through the separation of church and state. In conclusion, you only have conviction of the constitution when it suits and complies with your religious values, therefore you were the people the constitution was created to prevent from holding sway over law and society.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","01:12 PM","gay-rights-debates","244"
"06-30-2013","17119",17,"Easyrider","474990","Please see my previous post to ANorveyanFellow. There are dire consequences for the individual and even a nation that rebels against God. The Bible is full of such examples. ""The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God."" - Psalm 9:17 Conspiracism is a particular narrative form of scapegoating that frames demonized enemies as part of a vast insidious plot against the common good, while it valorizes the scapegoater as a hero for sounding the alarm","Accipiter","475016","You should read this whole thing ez, its like the book of your mind.

For instance, Thomas Jefferson, who attended church services in the US Capitol , provided the following: Thomas Jefferson, A Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments Whosoever shall be guilty of Rape, Polygamy, or Sodomy with man or woman shall be punished, if a man, by castration, if a woman, by cutting thro' the cartilage of her nose a hole of one half inch diameter at the least. Amendment VIII: Thomas Jefferson, A Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments And don't confuse a ""modern civil society"" with a righteous country. Finally, can you identify ONE SIN that the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah were guilty of that's not prevalent even now in the United States?","obama-supports-gay-marriage","01:20 PM","gay-rights-debates","247"

Your views are those of a religious denomination and therefore should have no bearing on laws passed by the state which affect all. In a similar way that if Islam was the majority denomination then sharia law should not be imposed on the minority christian denomination... Sodom and Gomorrah has nothing to do with it... Jefferson regardless of his personal views came round to understand the positives of a free country where people who didn't share his beliefs were protected as much as himself.... Admittedly as long as you were male, white, wealthy and of an Anglo-Saxon origin. Give religion an inch and it will take a mile. People should be free from religion, just as you are free from theirs.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","01:34 PM","gay-rights-debates","251"

That's your view. I don't share it. In fact, considering the founding fathers went to church in federal buildings, hired paid Chaplains, printed a Bible, and spoke about how Christianity was the foundation of the country, I dare say you're the one who is out in left field. Sure it does. I'm not letting a secularist evict God from the public square or from the discussion. He didn't approve of sodomy, did he? In fact, which of the original states or founding fathers did?","obama-supports-gay-marriage","01:40 PM","gay-rights-debates","252"

The separation of church and state is fundamental, it entails the FREEDOM FROM RELIGION for all, secularist, Buddhist, Muslim, Christian... The state cannot discriminate against any denomination on any religious grounds. What Jefferson and the rest of the founding fathers personally believed has no bearing, they recognized it as their personal belief and that their personal feeling and religion should not dictate the laws of a nation. It doesn't matter if they rebuilt the Basilica within the grounds of the white house, that doesn't mean Christians should be favoured above all others by the state. Im glad to hear it, i have no issue with Christians being involved in the discourse... I have a big problem with what is effectively religious law, and on this basis i hope you would support gun reform then.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","01:50 PM","gay-rights-debates","253"

Should we therefore ban all marriage due to this? The rise of HIV is higher in drug users than homosexuals, if HIV was truly the reason you were piping up you would be railing for stricter drug laws and not banning homosexual marriage.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","02:08 PM","gay-rights-debates","255"
