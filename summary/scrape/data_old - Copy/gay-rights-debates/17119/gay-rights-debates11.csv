Satan is thus your daddy, the father of lies (John 8:44).

"11-25-2012","17119",11,"Xenamnes","466780","The wise man you speak of was not making a factually accurate comparison in his statement but rather voicing a general discontent for the practicing of religion and having beliefs in matters that cannot be immediately verified through currently available scientific measures. Opiates are a narcotic substance used in medicine for beneficial purposes but also abused in recreational manners for the purpose of intoxication. Simply having beliefs in higher powers does not creative negative side effects on a person's health, their economic standing or driving in general. Those who practice religion do not generally become incapable of standing upright or hallucinate that a random strange has transformed into a literal rabid animal and is trying to kill them. Further separating the two standards is the fact that narcotic substances create physical addictions and one cannot simply give up their physical addictions in the same manner they would simply stop thinking in a certain manner. Anyone choosing to forgoe narcotic substances after becoming physically addicted would face the possibility of dying without adequate medical treatment to stabilize their body. The same cannot be said for religion. Religion is no more than opiate than is a person choosing to believe in something they want to believe. It is no more of an opiate than the homosexual community choosing to believe that they are somehow entitled to a widespread mainstream acceptance of its selected practices.","Matthew S","466891","I have always thought religion was a dangerous drug that needs to be regulated.

Religion is a cluster of beliefs that do not have the ability to drastically alter chemical reactions in individuals. Religion is no more of a drug than the belief that the homosexual community is entitled to protection against negative views and opinions held by critics. The homosexual community appears to believe it is somehow entitled to special consideration in decision making and given preferential treatment simply because they want to be seen as equal to others. However there are many who want different things in this world and they all believe they are worthy of consideration. There are those who want to have enough food to feed their families from one day to the next, or the money to keep the utilities from being shut off, or for their children to have adequate access to basic medicine. Even with the government providing a great number of free goods to those living in the vicinity of the poverty line there are still millions who cannot be helped. Perhaps it is time to ask you the question Matthew S. Why does the homosexual community believe it is more entitled to consideration and the possibility of government assistance when there are millions of individuals with substantially more pressing needs than their own? Why should the ability to marry be considered above funding for homeless shelters, free clinics, drug rehab centers and government housing?","obama-supports-gay-marriage","09:49 AM","gay-rights-debates","155"

It is a legitimate question why their desire is more valid than the desires of those who have considerably less than them. Why should homosexual marriage be an issue for government to devote so much time and funding to when there are currently millions who cannot even provide food to their children or guarantee a roof over their heads? Is there some degree of selfishness present for them to say they do not care about those that are struggling to survive so long as they get what they want first and foremost? The member Matthew S has gone on record in the past stating that he would rather see the country fall into economic collapse than even consider the possibility of a president that would work on economic recovery instead of catering to the demands of the homosexual community. He is more concerned with being able to marry into a mono-gender relationship than the well being of three hundred million who may be facing poverty and suffering in this recession.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","12:41 PM","gay-rights-debates","157"

Have you ever read the Bible? ALL have sinned and fallen short of the Glory of God, and need Christ for salvation. The measure of ""Who's good,"" isn't determined by politically correct men, but by God. And like Jesus (who is God) said, ""There is no one good except God."" And yes, there's going to be a whole bunch of people in Hell. Do you think the act of gay sex qualifies anyone for heaven?","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:13 PM","gay-rights-debates","160"

And to say that gays are bad, that gays are perverts, you are just being prejudiced. Like why are they different? Because they love someone of the same sex? Love is love, no matter who is taking part in it. The mindset you display for gays is discouraging. Let's take the fact that there are many gay kids across the united states. Saying that they're a black spot in society gives reason to believe that you support bullying of these children. That's outrageous. Also, your beliefs hold very close to the beliefs of the West Boro Baptist Church. I just can't wrap my mind around the idea that you could treat your peers differently, not equal to you, in a country that prides itself on Freedom. If the citizens of this country don't treat their own neighbors as the waant to be treated themselves (BTW love thy neighbor) then we are a nation of hypocrites. We're fakes. I hope that you'll someday see that treating people indifferently, evening in accordance to a contradictory book of morals written over a thousand years ago, is wrong","obama-supports-gay-marriage","02:27 PM","gay-rights-debates","161"

Sorry, the entire New Testament is 1st Century. Unlike today's moral relativism, God's morals haven't changed since the Torah. Murder is still murder; thievery is still thievery, adultery remains adultery, etc. Like the Bible says, ALL HAVE SINNED (EVEN GAYS) AND FALLEN SHORT OF THE GLORY OF GOD. And they all need a Savior for the remission of their sins. So adultery is approved too? NAMBLA? You can't be serious. As the Bible says, ""Love does not rejoice in iniquity."" 1 Cor. 13 No, it's your mindset that approves of perversity that is discouraging. LOL! Telling people the truth that gay sex is a sin is bullying people? That's bizarre. My beliefs on gay sex are based in the Bible, and nothing else. One could say yours were based in Sodom and Gomorrah. Love speaks the truth. Active gays need to repent of their sins and receive Christ as their Lord and Savior for the remission of their sins, or they're lost on Judgment Day. There's nothing contradictory about gay sex being a sin in Scripture. It's a sin in the Old Testament and it's a sin in the New Testament. It's also fairly apparent you've never studied the Bible. You've just bought into a lot of lies about it. Sad.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","07:53 PM","gay-rights-debates","162"
