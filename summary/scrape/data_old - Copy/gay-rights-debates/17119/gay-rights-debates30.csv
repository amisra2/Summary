"07-07-2013","17119",30,"Easyrider","475482","Nope. Unless you can bust the Resurrection of Jesus Christ you haven't a leg to stand on. Sounds like a pretty confused statement to me - built on a serious of questionable propositions - chief among them that there's no clarity of reason.","Hdreams","475484","In your eyes EZ, to any of the groups i mentioned your views seem just as proposterous... Ill give you a clue, its someone who id imagine would be a figurehead of one of the pillars of your faith and country... But obviously, you know better ay... Tolerance and compassion is for those wimpy XXX Democrats and Jesus lovers...","obama-supports-gay-marriage","11:15 AM","gay-rights-debates","437"

I have been trying to figure out whether or not Jesus had a penis. If he did it certainly would have been a waste of flesh don't you agree? He probably had a female genitalia but you are the expert so you tell me.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","11:28 AM","gay-rights-debates","438"
"07-07-2013","17119",30,"None","None","None","Accipiter","475486","OK I figured it out, Jesus had a vagina so that way he wouldn't be gay since he hung out with a bunch of guys all the time and never had sex with a woman. Man sometimes the truth is tricky to figure out isn't it.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","11:46 AM","gay-rights-debates","439"

You seem to have wolfed down the idea that the Resurrection of Jesus Christ is a myth or something akin to that. Can you back that up? Then let's see your reasons / arguments / evidence. Because I'm here to tell you that unless you can't, you have no credibility with me, and you will also be in dire danger of having no eternal salvation. You need some solid ground to stand on with this, HD, and right now you don't have it. I already told you why, IMO, it has a questionable proposition, and I told you what that was. Do you have an answer for that?","obama-supports-gay-marriage","11:55 AM","gay-rights-debates","440"

And you want me to prove it wrong? Ok, ill humor your preposterous statement in one way, which is more than it even deserves... How many people have died roughly since just 1AD? not even counting the pre-history as we have insufficient records and would be speculating. So global population was between 400 million and 1 billion between 1AD and the 19th century. so say 250 million every 25 years (Generation) to air on the low side... 1 billion every century... so that's 19 billions deaths, add the estimated 5 billion deaths of the last 150 years. We have 24 billion deaths. So in conclusion we have the odds of resurrection, i.e a man rising from the dead at 1 in 24 billion. Thats some long odds. To put it another way that would roughly be the equivalent of winning Euro-Millions lottery (1 in 73 million) every week for almost 134,000 years. The odds of CERN opening a black hole due to the super-collider were actually lower than this... As are easily the odds of the existence of life not only in the galaxy/universe but in the solar system. The only one been wolfing down things EZ is you my friend, and those falsehoods while they may not appear to you now... they will... I hope they will at least, before you waste the life you have not living and embracing new idea's to the fullest and content to sit back assured through nothing more than fable and tradition to await the heaven you feel your ""Piety"" deserves.

If the Gospel accounts are such a mythical pile of rubbish then you should be able to demolish the multiple, independent, historical accounts of the resurrection. But you can't, can you? Try again? The same guy who laid out the punishment for sodomy. Nice!","obama-supports-gay-marriage","05:08 PM","gay-rights-debates","444"

If you choose to believe in something so preposterous as Resurrection. Which is already disproved by biology and all the things i mentioned, then their is nothing that would ever dissuade your belief. What is harmful is the way you berate and intimidate other groups such as gays, women, ethnicities etc, all based on the non-sense of a primitive mythology that propagated among a fundamental group. I dont have issue with religion in a personal belief. What people do in their own home when they are not hurting anyone else is their own agenda and right. Its a shame you spend so much time criticizing the actions and beliefs of so many others and don't stop to check where your own foundations have been built. You are the very reason supposed militant Atheists exist in a secular world. The irony is your behavior and hyperbola drive's more people away from Christianity. 1 in 24 billion EZ... May the odds be ever in your favour....","obama-supports-gay-marriage","07:30 PM","gay-rights-debates","445"

In fact, nothing in science has proven that. And you have your own miracles you have to believe in to make your world view fly: You believe the universe came into existence from nothing, out of nowhere, entirely without a cause. You have to believe in the mathematically improbable occurrence of abiogenesis - that life came from non-life, that the rational came from the non-rational, that order came from chaos, and specified information came from randomness. Those are some serious miracles, and require a lot more faith to believe in than a religious creationist can possibly muster. As Norm Geisler says, I dont have enough faith to be an atheist! Look who's talking - 'Mr. Criticize Others' himself. Your hypocrisy is stunning. <Flush> Somebody drove you away from Christianity before I ever spoke with you. It was probably another deluded atheist like you feeding you a bunch of cr*p about how the resurrection of Jesus Christ is a big lie. And you swallowed it whole. So it's your butt on the line when you die. Remember, I warned you of the consequences. You can't get to heaven without Christ as your Savior, and you will no doubt drop into Hell for your personal rebellion against God. p.s. You failed miserably to falsify the resurrection.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","07:52 PM","gay-rights-debates","446"

I said nothing about god..... As for the rest of your response, it isn't worth dignifying with argument... As i said, nothing could ever dissuade you, an anyone that tried regardless you would find their argument wanting.

In fact, there's plenty of biologists who are Christians, and who believe in the resurrection. And there's plenty of former atheists who have come to the truth of that too. Well, that ""tyrannical god"" you speak of ultimately wipes out evil and creates a paradise where there's ""no more tears and no more sorrows.."" So I'll take that over what you and your fellow atheists have any day.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","08:36 PM","gay-rights-debates","448"
