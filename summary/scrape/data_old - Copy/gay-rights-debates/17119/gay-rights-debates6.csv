"05-27-2012","17119",6,"Freedom","None","Not a separate agenda and funding scheme for each group.cheme for each group. No standard at all? Why call utopia what can easily exist. We also call it anarchy. If there is no standard, and I decide it's right for me to enslave you, and you decide it's not right; you will fight me. You can't argue with me because you claim there is no standard. That is the root of war. The moral code you just appealed to is called subjectivism, and all the pain and suffering mankind has inflicted on itself is the result of that ethical theory. Whether or not there is a victim depends on if someone's rights were violated. Since not being paid by others for choosing a life partner is not a violation of rights one is not a victim for being unpaid. I see, so you have an ex-zoophile example; and a reason why people would choose to be zoophiles? Consensus is irrelevant, truth is relevant. How do you know homosexuality is immutable? Are you saying someone can only be fundamentally attracted to one class of object? I have moral authority, if you are bigger you can take my money by your own volition, but you can't do it morally. It is not a right, you would not be asking people if it's a right you would be asking who will support it. Who will extend the privileged of recognition will change from individual to individual, not just neighborhood to neighborhood. Sex with animals is the fundamental way the zoophile may express sexual identity.","Provocateaur","456049","What would the groups be divided by? Will each group have it's own totally different rules or laws? How do I interact with another group if I don't follow their laws, and they don't follow mine? How are conflicts to be resolved? Would the gay group not have to fund anything that could possibly benefit a heterosexual and vice-versa? Would we divide by race or material wealth? How about coming together on some things which make sense, instead of pointless division? Move to torn-apart, violent, lawless, Somalia, and you can have it. I'm to fight you for my freedom, but I can't argue with you? If one individual is stronger than another, they can do what they want to the weaker one. You're talking about total disorder. Pain and suffering would have little meaning(in the eye of each beholder or pain causer). There would be no recourse for justice from an outside authority. There would be no standard which defined justice. Well then it's not a violation of rights if it is taken as the individual sees that it's needed. On homosexuality, it's in the research. It's the case for homosexuals and heterosexuals. By my individual moral standards I can, under your system. Mine are as good as yours or that of any other individual. What is your recourse, your remedy? Support it as what? As a rule to how we get along together? Essentially, a right. Yes, even worse when it comes to any kind of order. More privileged classes may still emerge under such a system, and it may not be in a just way with recognition, recourse and remedy of a moral wrong. They seek human companionship and do not prefer the animals, except in rare cases. With homosexuality and heterosexuality it's fundamentally how they are oriented. However, even if I concede the point that sometimes it is fundamental to the zoophile. Aren't there also two involved in a happy gay or straight attraction? What about the animal in zoophilia? With homosexuality and heterosexuality we can say it's the fundamental immutable trait for both parties. We can't say that for the zoophile and the non-human object of their affection. We're also talking about equal marriage rights between gay and straight. A zoophile can't have that with an animal. The animal isn't intelligent enough.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:18 PM","gay-rights-debates","76"

I have commented on this before, there are two distinct functions of governments. To protect rights and carry out the wishes of the people in public policy. These are very different things. The former changes in practical application but never in it's source or nature. If all government did was protect rights, it would do very little indeed. In fact just the military and justice system. Much of what the government does is merely investment and social programs that society as a whole wishes to be carried out. Each group is defined by those programs (each with their own objective criteria for goals, methods, and execution i.e. a constitution) which the individuals in that group support. The government represents that group by taking the funds from that group and executing the plan. These plans (or government actions as I call them) are not exclusive to each other, and therefore do not come in conflict with each other. This is different from the current system in that governments believe and try to form a unified set of actions even though they have conflicting interests. Of course no one would have to fund anything, a sub-category of that principle would be that no homosexual would have to fund anything they think is benefiting heterosexuals. I believe a Prussian king once said that the dream of a perfect plan is the greatest enemy of a good plan. It is a good plan is for most to agree on what they can, the enemy of that plan is dreaming that we will all agree on everything . People will work together easily enough if they agree and they are given a practical framework in which to cooperate. It is not something that can be morally or practically forced to happen. I look at history and I see one truth above all others, the reason people want their own nations is because they do not want to submit their will to that of neighbors. The divisions of nations are limited to geographical differences, but far more kinds exist, and they cause civil strife within nations. All of this proceeds from the premise that some master plan must be chosen and then everyone must support it whether they agree with it or not. All previously conceived types of government have been at their core mechanisms for producing a final word on this master plan. Monarchies were not disconnected from the will of the people, but the king had the final word. In most modern countries the majority has the final word. America was a minority in the British empire, by the standard of democracy which we claim to hold dear British parliament had every right to levy every tax they did. The revolution was about the fact that the minority had the right to rule the minority. I am merely extending the principle to it's logical conclusion and extrema. Every individual has the right to rule him or herself. The policy you espouse, and which is commonly accepted is the policy of division. My government could safely be applied as a single entity to all the world and there would be no danger of oppression or tyranny on the smallest village. You want cooperation, the first step is to have a frame work for cooperation; and if that frame work is in constant threat of destruction or is itself tyrannical in nature cooperation will be the most rare result. Now, look at the world. You may not believe in my 'utopia dreamworld' but I at least have a theory which explains and predicts history and all the evil we see. You move there, that's what your moral theory looks like in the absence of systems based on the premise of objective morality like the law. That is the consequence of subjectivism yes, might makes right. There is no moral truth, just moral perceptions each taking concrete form only in the military strength of those who so perceive. Subjectivism rejects an objective truth subject to rational debate, it claims there is no truth out side of what people think and therefore debating morality is pointless exercise which comes down to ""he believes what he wants to, and so do I"". That is the world my enemies live in, and I cannot reach them because their assumptions allow them to dismiss all attempts to reason with them. There can be only one proper standard which applies to everyone, an objective standard. Need is not a right to steal. How does 'the research' know? But not for other orientations, at least one of which you have been unwilling to attack as you have the others. They may not be, your moral standards may be wrong. To immoral acts? To stop them with force. No not a right, homosexuals have the exact same rights as everyone else; there will never ever be any need to single out a category of human beings and define special rights for them. Helping homosexual couples is not giving them a right it's giving them a privilege. Rights are not given and taken away, only recognized or ignored. Extending a privilege is not a moral wrong so long as those extending the privilege have authority to do so (i.e. they are extending their own consent), no recourse is or ever will be needed. That's untrue, there is a smooth continuum just as there is between homosexuality and heterosexuality. Some prefer humans and will accept animals a second best, some couldn't tell you which they prefer (on a purely sexual level), and some prefer animals to the point where they have no more inclination to sleep with humans than a homosexual does to sleep with the opposite sex. What they all have in common is sexual attraction to animals, preference is irrelevant except in some mysterious way which you have consistently refused to explain to my satisfaction (just bleating 'fundamental'). Zoophiles do not have equal rights to either homosexuals or heterosexuals in that sex itself is often outlawed. If you are claiming that the equal protection clause grants homosexuals the right to marry, how can you deny that it would grant zoophiles the right to have sex? Let me preempt you, you are going to whine again about how you judge everything as it's own case and you don't think it's right to have sex with an animal. Well a lot of people don't think it's right to treat heterosexual marriage and homosexual marriage the same. You want to respond to them you are going to have to appeal to an objective moral principle which supersedes their unsupported assertions and I will do the same to your complaints about zoophilia. Just as you demand reasons for considering homosexual marriage of lower worth than heterosexual marriage, I demand reasons for considering zoophilic sex wrong but homosexual sex right. By refusing to blindly apply equal protection to zoophiles you admit implicitly that it does matter whether the claimed action is in fact moral and proper, that clause is no magic bullet to remove all discrimination because you refuse to retract your discrimination even though I invoke it.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","11:28 PM","gay-rights-debates","77"

"05-28-2012","17119",6,"Freedom","455972","That is what the word marriage means in english, when translated from other languages it is because that is what the other words meant. Polygamy and marriage was not a special class. It was considered a multi-marriage i.e. wives were not married to each other only the same husband. It's not in the constitution now, DOMA was an act of congress not an amendment. If you're wondering why they singled that out for legal definition, it's because a group of people are trying to redefine it. If you did that to any other word, say make citizen mean of European descent they would do the same thing. That does not mean there was no definition of citizen or that it has changed. It has been prevented from change. They have a right to do this because laws were written with their current set of definitions. To seek to undermine the law by redefining the words used is no better then ignoring it completely. Every time you say this I ask you the same question. What right am I trampling on? I am an advocate of different government. I talk big about liberty and freedom because they are important to me, not the shallow bromides which constitute your entire understanding of the terms. I am against the invasion of liberty of the general populace at the hands of the homosexual lobby.

"05-28-2012","17119",6,"Freedom","455980","That is not I said. To say that a contract is not a law, and to say contracts and laws are separate is not the same thing. A law applies to everyone (equal protection), it is a statute defining a prohibited activity. You can have a law stating that to violate contracts is prohibited, but you can't have a law that only applies to just joe and sally even though you can have a contract that applies to joe and sally. You do not need to sign laws to give them power over you, you do need to sign a contract to give it legal power over you. Predefined? Xcaliber claims there was no definition before DOMA. It is because it is a legal relationship that from a legal perspective it must have a concrete definition. The governments not going to chase down some couple for saying they are married, but they aren't going to give them tax breaks either because they don't meet the criteria. Of course they do. Speaking from a 'moral perspective' (as always) a contract is valid only if the list of signers on the bottom have sufficient authority to promise the constraints and conditions of the contract. If a contract describes the duties of bob and jill, and bob and jill sign it; it's valid because jill has the right to make promises on her behavior and bob has the right to make promises about his behavior. If they include rob in the contract and attempt to constrain him to some duty, and he does not sign; that contract is not valid. The contract is formalized promises and works on the volition principle. If it was only two private individuals who had to sign off on a marriage contract, homosexuals would not need government help. Existing contract law would guarantee it's legal and enforced. They want more than a contract between two people, they want a contract that because of government law is providing privileges and protections which they do not have the authority to provide for themselves. i.e. the government is a co-signer and the government does not have a duty to sign because it represents the people and the people do not have a duty to sign. Everything involving government involves morals until government is moral. No contract has been nullified, there are no laws against making any contract. Ad hominem","daewoo","456107","This is a retarded line of imaginary logic. If things were as you claimed, there would be no such thing as power of attorney, or health care proxys, or any kind of business structure besides sole proprietorship because all of those things are contractually instituted and the law (which is not just a list of prohibited behavior) requires that EVERYBODY recognize them. It gets even worse....a property deed does not confer ownership of a piece of land, it is simply a record that a purchase contract was properly executed and filed. Same with your car title. Stealing a car and then saying ""I choose not to recognize the sales contract because it was between 2 private parties and thus is not binding on me"" is not going to get you very far with the cops. By your logic, it would be OK to say ""Homosexuals cannot form an LLC"" or ""Black people may not organize a corporation"" because, after all, those are from a legal standpoint exactly the same as marriage....they are predefined contractual agreements between private parties that everybody is required to recognize. That would not be AT ALL discriminatory...right...since the government is just choosing not to be an automatic participant in the contract. Any actual THINKING person, however, recognizes that when these predefined contractual arrangements are codified the government is agreeing to be a party to the resultant contracts. Any thinking person is also going to recognize that gender discrimination is not something the government is allowed to do since it is bound by the constitution. Telling Matthew that he may not enter into such a contract because he has a penis is EXACTLY like telling a woman she man not form a corporation because she lacks one. The only moral form of government is one where all disputes are handled by death match. 2 men enter, 1 man leaves. Except, of course, for the ones that say that 2 homosexuals may not make a marriage contract. You know...that one....the one this entire thread is based on. No, saying that YOU are foolish, pathetic and ridiculous would be an ad hominem attack. Saying it about your argument is not.

"05-28-2012","17119",6,"Freedom","456110","Things are as I claimed. Contracts extend the consent of signers, in the power of attorney, the power is being extended to the attorney from the person. None of the situations you described require consent of non-signers. If you don't want to recognize someone as a valid representative, that's your choice; just as it would be your choice to not deal with the original authority in the first place. A sales contract is not binding on a would be thief, the owners right to the property is. Stealing from the original owner and stealing from the new owner is both stealing. Since the contract is proper and someone may consent to transfer ownership the police rightly consider the item as belonging to the new party. If anyone is forced to recognize and support LLC or corporations they too are immoral. How about you and I sign a contract that states that we are jointly entitled to 10% of tax revenue. Is the contract invalid or does the government have a duty to sign any contract by it's citizens? I did not tell him he couldn't enter into a contract , I told him he needs everyone involved to sign. The government is a party in so far as it agrees to enforce valid contracts, but if the contract places more duties than that upon the government the government has no duty to sign and the contract is invalid without that consent. That is incorrect, disputes must be resolved by identifying the party whose asserted rights are truly rights. There is no such law. States will simply not recognize homosexuals as married. If those rights cannot be extended through contract, that is a problem. It is improper to force anyone to testify. They shall follow the pattern you establish above, either they should not be confined to state recognized marriage contracts, or they are immoral requirements. In the case of hospitals for example their care is constrained by the volition of their patient, that patient can declare his/her wishes directly, or can declare someone else a proxy for their consent. Whether or not the hospital chooses to recognize that proxy is irrelevant, the proxy contract is valid and thus defying the proxy is the same as defying the patient to the government. All entities should be required to recognize the need for consent.","daewoo","456114","Wrong answer, nitwit. You apparently dont have a whole lot of experience in the business world.

That has been settled for decades.","Freedom","456119","ad hominem That's because their agreement with you includes legal delegates, do deny you representative is to break an agreement they already made. Because it is entirely within your authority to delegate your own powers to whom ever you wish. This is not saying that anyone is forced to deal with you or your attorney. Do you expect me to accept the implicit premise here that there are no such things as ownership rights and it's all just an illusion projected by purchase contracts? A deed does not place any duties or constraints on the general public, laws against theft do. All the deed does is establish ownership. How am I required to recognize those formation documents? What duties do they attempt to place on me? Are you saying that to be valid, a contract which forces recognition on others needs to be itself specially recognized? If it assigns privileges to a specific class of contracts, it has the right to uphold the definition of that class. No contract is a right, they are all privileges contingent on the consent of the signers. Equal protection by the laws, not equal privilege. The proper interpretation of that phrase is equality of rights, not equality of privileged. Rights cannot be won, they are natural. Morality is fixed, and has been natural since before recorded history. To the strong go the spoils is an observation about what is and can be, but not a moral observation. Is it right that to the strong go the spoils? So is becoming a citizen and getting unemployment. That's improper unless you signed a contract giving primacy to her proxy-ship. I am talking to you, so it is your agreement that I am satisfied with. You're thinking is inverted here. The contract exists to establish volition. To extend the right to make decisions for someone requires only the consent of the extender. It is not the contract which the hospitals are being forced to recognize, but the fact that the proxy does have the right to speak for the person. This is no more duty upon them then the fact that they needed the persons consent in the first place, also without need of a contract. The contract does not say something like ""And hospitals must give us 20% off"", it says something like ""The poxy is the proper and legal voice of the signer in medical matters"". Merely an extension of the signers rights just like a purchase would be. The contract does not establish the rights only extends or transfers them. The signer does not have any right to medical treatment at 20% off or medical treatment at all. Thus his signature alone is not sufficient to make a contract with such stipulations valid. Thanks to living in utopia freedom land world I don't have to make such decisions for anyone but myself. I would not support marriages through government, the rest of you can do as you please. So long as you don't try to force me or others to do it with you of course No it isn't. If someone tried to make a corporation where there were no shareholders they couldn't do it, they would be discriminated against because that is not a corporation and does not have to be recognized as such. If the person is black or what not that is irrelevant. Just as in theory the gender of the parties in a marriage contract is irrelevant to the law, what matters is that they are trying to instantiate a contract which does not meet the criteria of marriage and thus are not entitled to any privileges government has assigned to such a class of contracts. I'm not saying such cases cannot be used for discriminatory purposes but they are themselves not discriminating based on gender. For instance, making it law that everyone who votes must be able to read is not discriminating based on race it's discriminating based on the ability to read, the two just went together often enough that it was a way to circumvent the unconstitutionality of explicit discrimination.
