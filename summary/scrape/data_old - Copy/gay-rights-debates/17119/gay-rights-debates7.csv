One of the reasons Obama cited for his support of gay marriage was that we ought to ""...you know, treat others the way you would want to be treated"" (the Golden Rule). That's pathetic. Under that standard we ought to respect people who practice pedophilia, because that's how they would want to be treated. Same with adulterers, people who practice incest, etc. Obama is the most Biblically-challenged President I think we've ever had.

"05-31-2012","17119",7,"Freedom","456119","That's because their agreement with you includes legal delegates, do deny you representative is to break an agreement they already made. Because it is entirely within your authority to delegate your own powers to whom ever you wish. This is not saying that anyone is forced to deal with you or your attorney. Do you expect me to accept the implicit premise here that there are no such things as ownership rights and it's all just an illusion projected by purchase contracts? A deed does not place any duties or constraints on the general public, laws against theft do. All the deed does is establish ownership. How am I required to recognize those formation documents? What duties do they attempt to place on me? Are you saying that to be valid, a contract which forces recognition on others needs to be itself specially recognized? If it assigns privileges to a specific class of contracts, it has the right to uphold the definition of that class. No contract is a right, they are all privileges contingent on the consent of the signers. Equal protection by the laws, not equal privilege. The proper interpretation of that phrase is equality of rights, not equality of privileged. Rights cannot be won, they are natural. So is becoming a citizen and getting unemployment. That's improper unless you signed a contract giving primacy to her proxy-ship. You're thinking is inverted here. The contract exists to establish volition. To extend the right to make decisions for someone requires only the consent of the extender. It is not the contract which the hospitals are being forced to recognize, but the fact that the proxy does have the right to speak for the person. This is no more duty upon them then the fact that they needed the persons consent in the first place, also without need of a contract. The contract does not say something like ""And hospitals must give us 20% off"", it says something like ""The poxy is the proper and legal voice of the signer in medical matters"". Merely an extension of the signers rights just like a purchase would be. The contract does not establish the rights only extends or transfers them. The signer does not have any right to medical treatment at 20% off or medical treatment at all. Thus his signature alone is not sufficient to make a contract with such stipulations valid. Thanks to living in utopia freedom land world I don't have to make such decisions for anyone but myself. I would not support marriages through government, the rest of you can do as you please. So long as you don't try to force me or others to do it with you of course No it isn't. If someone tried to make a corporation where there were no shareholders they couldn't do it, they would be discriminated against because that is not a corporation and does not have to be recognized as such. If the person is black or what not that is irrelevant. Just as in theory the gender of the parties in a marriage contract is irrelevant to the law, what matters is that they are trying to instantiate a contract which does not meet the criteria of marriage and thus are not entitled to any privileges government has assigned to such a class of contracts. I'm not saying such cases cannot be used for discriminatory purposes but they are themselves not discriminating based on gender. For instance, making it law that everyone who votes must be able to read is not discriminating based on race it's discriminating based on the ability to read, the two just went together often enough that it was a way to circumvent the unconstitutionality of explicit discrimination. Ah yes, when daewoo declares it, you know it is","daewoo","456320","Well....I am sitting here looking at one, and it does not include ""legal delegates"". In fact, it lays out a specific procedure and requirements for making somebody an authorized user on my account. A procedure that is completely short circuited in the event that I give somebody power of attorney, because the law says they are required to respect that contract. Except for those who are. And you do realize that you are just strengthening my argument in regards to gay marriage...right? The biggest part of marriage from a legal perspective is the right of your spouse to act as your agent. You are the one putting forth that premise. There is no ""illusion"" in the real world because the law forces everybody to recognize those purchase contracts, thus transferring actual ownership, and with them the transference of ownership rights. If the world worked as you claim it does, and nobody is forced to recognize a contract that they are not an immediate participant in, the entire thing would be nothing but an illusion. They require that the business be treated as a unique and individual legal entity. You cannot hold the owners directly or financially responsible for the acts of the company. Typically yes. What we are talking about here is contracts that are specifically sanctioned by law. Wrong. When you are talking about contractual arrangements that are specifically authorized and defined by law, they move beyond ""privilege"" and is by definition a legal right. You have the legal right in this country to be married. More specifically, you have a liberty right to be married, and once married you have a claim right to force others to recognize that marriage. In discussing power of attorney above, executing a power of attorney contract results in creation of a claim right...others are compelled, or have a duty, to recognize your decision to create an agent to act on your behalf. Likewise transference of property creates a claim right in that it creates in others a duty to recognize your ownership of the property in question. Wrong answer, sport. There are natural rights and there are legal rights (rights created through legislation). And the government is not allowed to practice discrimination in neither of these activities. No, its not. Both marriage and medical proxy-ship (I like that term) are legal rights. Neither is a natural right. As legal rights, they can be fully shaped via legislation so long as they are equally applied (no discrimination) and do not infringe on a natural right. Except that a hospital, while required to recognize the decisions of a persons medical proxy, may choose to ignore those decisions if they feel they are not being made in the best interests of the patient. They do not have that option when receiving directions directly from the patient. And, again, the biggest legal part of marriage is your spouses ability to act as, and be recognized as, your agent in pretty much all matters. If you are married and would want your wife to be your health care proxy, there is no need to create a health care proxy because your wife is already your proxy by law. Sorry, I fully intend to force you to recognize my marriage, and have the legal right to do so. Establishing gender as a requirement to formation of a contract is by definition discrimination and is illegal....it violated a recognized and enforced natural right. Amazingly enough, a federal appeals court just issued a ruling today that seems to agree with me...that the fact the government may not discriminate based on sex is a long settled principal.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","02:56 PM","gay-rights-debates","94"

"05-31-2012","17119",7,"None","None","None","Winston Smith","456345","The answer to the question, ""Are Mormons Christians,"" is simple. They are not Christians for several reasons, and their unbiblical doctrines show them to be a ""Christian"" cult. The name Christian was first used, as Acts 11:26 records, to identify the disciples of Jesus Christ. The word ""Christian"" is the Greek word ""christianos,"" and it means an adherent of Jesus Christ. It literally means ""Christ ones"" (Acts 11:26, 26:28, 1 Peter 4:16). The correct definition of the word is one who is a follower of the Jesus Christ of the Bible. For almost two thousand years it has never had a reference to anyone other that the historical Jesus Christ of the New Testament. Why Mormons Are Not Christian. First: Mormons do not follow or believe in the historic Jesus Christ of the Bible, but rather in a difference Jesus. This is why most Biblical Christians emphatically insist that Mormons are not Christians. Let me explain. The god of the Mormons is not the God of the Bible. To the Mormons, Jesus is the firstborn son of an exalted ""man"" who became the god of this world. The man-god of Mormonism was made the god of this world because of his good works on another planet somewhere out in the universe. He ""earned"" godhood, and was thus appointed by a counsel of gods in the heavens to his high position as the god of planet Earth. The Mormon god of this world was a man, like all men, who became a god. This is what the celestial marriage and the temple vows are all about. LDS men, by doing their temple work, are striving for exaltation by which they, too, shall one day become gods. Their wives will be the mother goddesses of ""their"" world and with their husband will produce the population of their world. This is the Mormon doctrine of ""eternal progression."" Note the following quote from the Mormon Journal of Discourses, vol. 1, page 123, made by the LDS Apostle Orson Hyde: ""Remember that God, our heavenly Father, was perhaps once a child, a mortal like we ourselves, and rose step by step in the scale of progress, in the school of advancement; has moved forward and overcome, until He has arrived at the point were He is."" Lorenzo Snow, late President of the Mormon church, made this statement in the second verse of his famous poem entitled, ""Man's Destiny"": ""As Abra'm, Isaac, Jacob, too, babes, then men--to gods they grew. As man now is, our God once was; As now God is, so man may be,-- Which doth unfold man's destiny. . ."" The God of the Bible is not an exalted man. The God of the Bible is omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient. The Bible says He is the only God and there are no other Gods. He had no beginning or end and he is a spirit being and never was a man. Note the clear teaching of the Bible as to who the real God is: Numbers 23:19, ""God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?"" Psalms 102:26-27, ""They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end."" Isaiah 43:10-11, ""Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour."" Isaiah 44:6, ""Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God."" Isaiah 44:8, ""Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any."" Isaiah 45:21-22, ""Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me. Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else."" Jeremiah 23:24, ""Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD."" Malachi 3:6, ""For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed."" John 1:16-18, ""And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace. For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him."" John 4:24, ""God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth."" Romans 1:22, ""Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things."" Colossians 1:15, ""Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:"" 1 Timothy 1:17, ""Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen."" 1 Timothy 6:16, ""Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen."" Clearly, Mormonism's god is not the God of Christianity who is the God revealed to us in the Bible. The Mormon god is a god formed from the imaginations of Joseph Smith, and in truth is a false, non-existent god or idol. Second: The Jesus Christ of Mormonism is not the Jesus Christ of the Bible. The Mormon Jesus is the son of this man-god. The Mormon Jesus is the brother of Lucifer, and according to LDS teaching, he married several of the Marys of the New Testament. He is not, to the LDS church, ""God incarnate"" as the Bible plainly states. Clearly, the Mormon god and Jesus are not the true. God and Jesus of the Bible Orson Hyde, the Mormon Apostle said, ""We say it was Jesus Christ who was married in the marriage of Cana of Galilee"" (Journal of Discourses, Vol. 2, page 80). Brigham Young, said, ""When the Virgin Mary conceived the Child Jesus ... He was not begotten by the Holy Ghost. And who is His father? He is the first of the human family"" (Journal of Discourses, pages 50-51). Compare this with the Word of God, ""And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God"" (Luke 1:35). Mormons teach that Jesus Christ suffered for sin in the Garden of Gethsemane when He sweat ""as it were"" great drops of blood. Mormons totally avoid the Biblical teaching of Christ's atonement for sin which was accomplished on the Cross. Note the following quote from, ""What Mormons Think of Christ"" (LDS publication, pages 32-34): ""Christians speak often of the blood of Christ and its cleansing power. Much is believed and taught on this subject, however, it is utter nonsense and so palpably false that to believe it is to lose one's salvation."" It goes further to say that salvation is ""conditional on faith, and repentance, and baptism and keeping the commands of God."" I would like to add, yes, it is very true that Christians do speak much of the blood of Christ. Note the emphasis the Bible places on the blood of Christ: ""But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin"" (1 John 1:7). ""How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"" (Hebrew 9:14). ""And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood"" (Revelations 1:5). The ejection of this Biblical truth by the LDS church shows again it is not a Christian church. Note that in the following verses the Bible says salvation, which is forgiveness of sin and receiving of eternal life, is a gift of God, and it is not obtained by ""works"": ""For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast"" (Ephesians 2:8-9). ""But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness"" (Romans 4:5). I am aware that the L.D.S church has several definitions of salvation and several degrees of glory. A good discussion of the problem is found on the Internet at http:CastYourNet.com/LDS-Shock. The real Jesus Christ is the ""only begotten of the Father."" He is not one of many sons and certainly not the brother of Satan as the following Scriptures clearly state: John 1:18, ""No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him."" John 3:16, ""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."" John 3:18, ""He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God."" Hebrews 1:5, ""For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?"" 1 John 4:9, ""In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him."" Jesus Christ of the Bible is God Incarnate in Man John 1:1, ""In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."" John 1:14, ""And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth."" John 10:30 ""I and my Father are one."" Jesus claimed to be one with the Father. In John 14:9, Jesus said to see him is to see the Father. In John 8:25, 56-59, 18:6,8 Jesus used the Jehovistic ""I AM,"" identifying Himself as God. In Matthew 22:42-45, Jesus claimed to be the Old Testament ""Adonai."" In Mark 2:5-7, Jesus forgave sin, a prerogative belonging only to God. In Matthew 14:33; 28:9; and John 20:28-29, Jesus asserted Himself as God by allowing men to worship Him. John 1:3 states that Jesus is the Creator, and Genesis 1:1 states that God was the Creator. Only those who believe in the real Biblical God and Jesus Christ have the right to use the name ""Christian."" The Mormon prophets historically have openly ridiculed those who believe in the God, Jesus, and Holy Spirit that the Bible reveals. One question that I would ask all Mormons is this: ""If I accept you as a Christian, will you accept me as a Mormon?"" Would you accept me as a Mormon if I reject Joseph Smith and all the LDS prophets as being prophets of God. If I do not believe in the Book of Mormon or the LDS Scriptures, baptisms for the dead, the temple endowments, the LDS gospel, would you accept me as a Mormon? The answer is obviously, you would not. In like manner, when Mormonism denies the Bible and every Christian doctrine do you think that Biblical Christians should accept Mormons as Christians? Again the answer is very obvious, no we will not. You cannot legitimately claim to be Christians when you refuse to accept what the Bible teaches and what a true Christian believes. I would implore Mormons to honestly and openly examine their teachings about God and Jesus Christ and examine who the Bible defines as being a Christian. There is no benefit in calling yourself a ""Christian"" when Biblically you are not. Because we love the souls of men and want to see them, too, spend eternity in Heaven with our Savior, we strongly object to anyone proclaiming to the world a false Jesus Christ. We do not want to see anyone miss having their sins forgiven and receiving eternal life, because they were deceived. Jesus said that He alone was the truth, the way and the life. ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me"" (John 14:6). Belief in the real Jesus Christ is the only way a man can receive forgiveness of sin and eternal life. The LDS, church in presenting a false Christ is, in fact, leading souls away from salvation and the real Jesus. They reject God's truth and substitute another Jesus who does not exist and cannot save. Only those who believe in the Biblical Jesus Christ will go to heaven when they die. Those who put their trust in a false Christ will be eternally lost. Every true Child of God knows this, and that is why we try so hard to point men away from false churches, prophets, gods and Christs, that they may find God's true Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, and be saved. Let God speak for Himself by His Word. Matt. 24:24, ""For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect."" ""Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole. This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved"" (Acts 14:10-12). [Pastor Cooper P.

And my point is that since you already have a right to declare someone your agent, you have the right to declare your spouse an agent which means that the ' biggest ' part of marriage is available right here and right now to homosexual couples. No it doesn't, it forces them to recognize ownership rights, and it recognizes the purchase contracts. No one has to be a party to transfer of ownership rights except the original owner, hence the need for only one signature. They are forced to recognize people's rights but no contract naming them as a participant is valid until they sign it. You are mincing terms, when I said recognize you knew I meant 'recognize they were married' and thereby are forced to call them married and treat them the same as they heterosexual marriages. They have to recognize the rights of homosexuals which includes their right to property and to extend consent through agency. If I wanted to sue the company of course I would have to recognize it existed. I am not forced to sell to the company, buy from the company, give special treatment to the company or any of it's members. Excellent, those are all immoral. The government does not have a right to force people (violate rights), and thus their special sanction cannot extend that right. Right Rights cannot be asserted in to existence. Note also that you said specifically authorized and defined by law. What happens when it is claimed that the definition itself is discrimination? Well you could redefine it, but that would be beyond the scope of this supposed legal right because it would be beyond the definition given. I am not interested in legal rights, only rights, and the definition of marriage is a class of contract between men and women. There can be no right to force others to do what you wish them to do. The only moral use of force is to stop another from violating rights, and it is not a violation of anyone's rights to fail to do something for them. The 'duty' to recognize the need for the consent of others or their right to their property existed before the contract and cannot be a result of it. Right answer, soccer. Legislation cannot create rights. The idea that such could be believed to happen worried many founding fathers. That's an inappropriate double negative, and they practice discrimination all the time. They discriminate between citizens and non-citizens, between the employed and the unemployed. If the rarest of minorities applies for unemployment, but they have a job; they won't get it. Not because they are a minority, but because they don't fit the definition of a candidate. That is the situation we are dealing with here. The law does not care if you're homosexual, but you can't instantiate a marriage contract if your contract doesn't fit the definition of marriage. What do you mean by applied equally? Does that mean their definitions cannot contain any discrimination between types of people? (unemployed and non-citizen are in fact categories of people). That is merely a degree of proxy-ship (I'm glad you like that term?), one has the right to allow another to speak for them as them, or just up till a certain point. The point of contracts is to state such things clearly. You are reduced to complaining about convenience? Write a marriage contract, include all proxy extension, sign it; the government will enforce it so long as it's valid, and it will be valid so long as the two signers have the authority to consent to all constraints of the contract. Gender is not a requirement for the formation of 'a contract', it is part of the class definition for a 'specifically sanctioned' contract. The tax code and unemployment benefits providing conditions for those benefits based on income is also by definition discrimination.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","04:08 PM","gay-rights-debates","102"

""So long as man remains free he strives for nothing so incessantly and so painfully as to find someone to worship. But man seeks to worship what is established beyond dispute, so that all men would agree at once to worship it. For these pitiful creatures are concerned not only to find what one or the other can worship, but to find community of worship is the chief misery of every man individually and of all humanity from the beginning of time. For the sake of common worship theyve slain each other with the sword. They have set up gods and challenged one another, Put away your gods and come and worship ours, or we will kill you and your gods! And so it will be to the end of the world, even when gods disappear from the earth; they will fall down before idols just the same","Winston Smith","456436","It has been written :","obama-supports-gay-marriage","03:59 AM","gay-rights-debates","103"
