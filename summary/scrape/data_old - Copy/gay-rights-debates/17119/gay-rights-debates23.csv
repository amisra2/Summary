Gods Judgment Saves Lives Let's do this: How many people would 100 evil men kill in their lifetimes? Let's say a thousand, and the 100 evil men wind up in hell when they die. Now, let's let those 100 evil men have 100 offspring that over time grow up to kill the original 1,000 other people, plus 1,000 more. Now, you have 200 evil men in hell and 2,000 murdered others. Let's take it to the 10th or so generation. Now you've had 10,000 evil men giving birth to 10,000 offspring and together those 20,000 evil men and or women offspring kill 200,000 people total. So, you now have 20,000 evil men and women in hell (vs. 100 if you had nailed them earlier), plus 200,000 other dead people. So God, being smarter than his critics, and able to see consequences further out in time than the stiff-necked ""God is evil"" crowd, saves 19,900 people from going to hell plus he saves 199,000 others from getting murdered. (please excuse any math errors). Get the picture? God SAVES!!","smiley","475194","So the guy picking up sticks on the Sabbath was an evil man? Perhaps he was a man that might have saved thousands from hell. We shall never know. It's easy to pull a few numbers out of thin air and claim that they support your opinion, but if you can't produce any evidence for those numbers, why should we believe them? Yet you ignore even god's word when it doesn't suit your purpose.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:33 AM","gay-rights-debates","331"

I think you see the earth through rose-colored glasses. There's tons of murderers in every generation. Heredity is not necessary to continue with crime. We see with the Muslims, for instance, that they train up their children to hate Jews, and there's no shortage of Muslim generations that have hated and killed Jews. And that's what we see in the Middle East during the Old Testament - one group or nation after another killing others. So I stand by my illustration.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","01:44 PM","gay-rights-debates","340"

It is an ignorant, ridiculous, farce. We are all dumber for having read it. Are you mentally retarded? First, most muslims do not hate jews. Do you know why so many Jews fled to the middle east during WWII? It was because it was pretty much the only place on the planet that they were NOT hated. Even here in the US jews were HEAVILY discriminated against. In the middle east they were not. After israel declared itself its own nation...a Jewish nation...and started killing Arabs in the area (Palestinians) Middle eastern Muslims started hating the jews and zionists. Most of them STILL dont hate jews who do not live in israel...non zionist. Since Israel became a nation they have killed 90,785 Palestinians. The Palestinians have killed 3,722 Israelis. The Israelis literally seized Palestinian homes, herded them into refugee camps, then shelled the camps. That does not even include the casualties of wars of aggression that the Israelis have fought against their neighbors. If you include those the Israelis have outkilled the arabs/palestenians by over 600:1. So..yea...the Israelis are hated by pretty much everybody who has any concept of justice, not just muslims, and they are hated for the same reason that the Nazis were. When it comes to middle eastern arabs, that is 100% their own doing. Statistically speaking there is not a single family in the middle east who has not lost a family member to Israeli aggression. Today, in the middle east, most muslims hate israelis because they are a bunch of murdering scumbags. That does not necessarily translate into a hatred of jews in general, unless you are an ignorant bafoon who does not understand the difference. In fact, nearly 30% of terrorist attacks that have taken place in isreal in the last 2 decades have been aimed at NON JEWISH TARGETS. Also, most muslims do not even live in the middle east and simply do not care one way or another.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","08:20 PM","gay-rights-debates","345"
