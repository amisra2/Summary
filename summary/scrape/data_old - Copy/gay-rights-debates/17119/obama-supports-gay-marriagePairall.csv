Considering that the woman almost got stoned to death for adultery, telling her not to commit adultery again is common advice and not just moral advice. Telling someone to stop sinning, there will be consequences, is truthful talk. He is telling them that their actions will have consequences and they should stop. He isn't threatening them, he isn't ordering them. Jesus supped with tax collectors and with prostitutes, immoral people. He socialized and interacted with them, and he gave them a choice to follow him. Nowhere, nowhere does he hint at forcing people to follow his laws. There is a difference between something happening out of mutual consent, and something happening because someone was forced to do it. Jesus and God have always been about choice. It ones choice to follow God, it is ones choice to obey his laws. And that is why I believe gay marriage should be legal. I do not believe it is moral, I do not believe the church should be involved in it. But I do believe that we all should have the choice to follow Gods laws. Telling gay people they cannot get married will not solve anything.

Here's what they (and you) have ignored regarding the deity of Jesus: The Deity of Jesus Christ in Scripture The Righter Report He (Jesus) existed in the form of God before His incarnation and was equal with God the Father (Philippians 2:5-7) Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped , but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. Do they believe Jesus is their Lord and Savior for the remission of their sins? Heck no. Instead they're burning churches in Egypt and elsewhere.","daewoo","476967","Not according to Jesus. We have been over this, sleazy. I have provided multiple quotes from the bible from Jesus and God, every single one of them stating unequivocally that Jesus is not god.

Was Jesus a liar, easy? That is what you are saying here...that Jesus just flat out LIED and Paul, who never even met Jesus, knew the REAL truth. Also, are you aware that Philippians 2:5-7 properly reads: The passage was used heavily by the Cathars who believed that Jesus was not divine, but was the human form of an angel. They came to that conclusion because...welll....that is what the bible says in this instance. In the 1600s the church put the matter to rest....by changing the bible. When the king james translation was done, they changed the passage, despite the fact they knew it was wrong, to reflect official church dogma, even though it was in direct opposition to what the passage actually said. So much for ""infallible bible"". Oh, and so much for your silly argument. No. They sure dont. They believe that Jesus was the Christ.

You're full of cr*p. Jesus even calls himself Lord of the Sabbath and ""I AM."" Virtually every Christian denomination in America recognizes Jesus as God. Here's some more evidences you can try to ignore. Is Jesus God? What do the Scriptures say? John 1:23 quotes Isaiah 40:3 as saying John the Baptist was to prepare the way for the LORD (Jehovah). John prepared the way before Jesus so Jesus must be LORD (Jehovah). In Isaiah 44:8 God is the only Rock. Psalm 18:31 says, Who is the Rock except our God? I Corinthians 10:4, identifies Jesus as the Rock. Jesus must also then be God the Rock. Isaiah 44:24 says that God (Jehovah) is the one who has made all things. Colossians 1:16, speaking of Christ, says that all things were created by Him and for him. Jesus must therefore be Jehovah God. In Jeremiah 10:10 it says the LORD (Jehovah) is the true God. I John 5:20 states that Jesus is the true God. Jesus must be the true God. Isaiah 43:10,11 says that I, even I, am the LORD; and there is no savior besides Me. Jesus is the Savior (Matthew 1:21, Titus 2:13; 2 Peter 1:1, etc., etc.). Jesus must be God the Savior. Jehovah knows all things (Psalm 147:5). Jesus knows all things. (John 16:30). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah alone is the only one who knows the hearts of all men. (1 Kings 8:39; Jeremiah 17:9-10). Jesus knows the hearts of all men. (John 2:24-25; Rev. 2:18, 23). Jesus must be God. Jehovah is our sanctifier. (Exodus 31:13). Jesus sanctifies us (Hebrews 10:10). Only God is the sanctifier of men. Jesus must be God. Jehovah is our peace (Judges 6:23). Jesus is our peace (Ephesians 2:14). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah is our righteousness (Jeremiah 23:6). Jesus is our righteousness. (Romans 3:21-22; 1 Corinthians 1:30). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah is the giver of life who will not allow His people to be delivered / snatched out of His hand (Deuteronomy 32:39). Jesus is the giver of life who will not allow His people to be snatched out of His hand. (John 10:28). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovahs voice is like the roar of rushing waters (Ezekiel 43:2). Jesus voice was like the sound of rushing waters (Revelation 1:15). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah is present everywhere.(Proverbs 15:3; Jeremiah 23:24; I Kings 8:27); Jesus is omnipresent (John 1:48; Matthew 18:20; 28:20). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovahs nature does not change (Malachi 3:6). Jesus nature does not change. (Hebrews 13:8). Jehovah is the only God we are to serve(2 Kings 17:35); Jesus (identified as the Creator in Colossians 1:16-17) is to be served (Colossians 3:24). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah the Lord is to be set apart as holy (Isaiah 8:12b-13). Jesus, as Lord, is to be set apart as holy (1 Peter 3:14b-15a). Jehovahs glory is not to be given to another (Isaiah 42:8). Jesus shares Jehovahs glory (John 17:5). Jesus must be Jehovah. Gods name is Jehovah (or YahwehYHWH Isaiah 42:8). Jesus has Jehovahs name (John 17:11; John 16:14-15). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah is the mighty God (Jeremiah 32:17-18; Isaiah 10:20-21). Jesus is the mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) who is Almighty (Revelation 1:7-8). Jehovah is the first and the last (Isaiah 44:6; 48:12). Jesus is the first and the last (Revelation 1:17-18; 22:12-13, 20). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah is the Alpha and the Omega (Revelation 1:8; Revelation 21:6-7). Jesus is the Alpha and the Omega (Revelation 22:12-13, 20). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovahs title is the Holy One (Isaiah 47:4). Jesus is the Holy One (Acts 3:14; John 6:69). Jesus must be Jehovah, the Holy One. Jehovah is the stumbling stone of Israel (Isaiah 8:13-15). Jesus is the stumbling stone of Israel (1 Peter 2:6-8). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah is the great Judge who gives life to whom he wishes and who renders to each man according to his deeds (Psalm 98:9; Deuteronomy 32:39; Jeremiah 17:9-10). Jesus is the only judge who gives life to whom he wishes and renders to each man according to his deeds (John 5:21-22; Revelation 2:18, 23). Jesus must be Jehovah. Jehovah is the great shepherd who leads his people to the spring of the water of life (Psalm 23:1-2; Revelation 21:6-7). Jesus as the shepherd of His people, leads them to springs of the water of life (John 10:11-18; Revelation 7:17). THERE IS ONLY ONE SHEPHERD John 10:16. Jehovah is Lord of Lords (Deuteronomy 10:17). Jesus is Lord of Lords. (Revelation 17:14; 19:16). The Father is Lord of all (Matthew 11:25; Acts 17:24). Jesus is Lord of all. (Acts 10:36). THERE IS ONLY ONE LORD (Jude 4) . Jehovah created the universe (Psalm 102:25-27). Jesus created the universe (John 1:3; Colossians 1:15-19; Hebrews 1:10-12). THERE IS ONLY ONE CREATOR. (Isaiah 44:24). Jesus must be Jehovah.

"06-30-2013",15,"17119","265","Easyrider","475046","In 1987, Dr. Stephen Rubin of Whitman College conducted a ten-state study of sex abuse cases involving school teachers. He studied 199 cases. Of those, 122 male teachers had molested girls, while 14 female teachers had molested boys. He also discovered that 59 homosexual male teachers had molested boys and four female homosexual teachers had molested girls. In other words, 32 percent of those child molestation cases involved homosexuals. Nearly a third of these cases come from only 1-2% of the population. Dr. Judith Reisman, in her book, Kinsey, Crimes & Consequences, describes the research done by Dr. Gene Abel. This researcher compared the molestation rates of self-confessed homosexual and heterosexual child molesters. In a sample of 153 homosexual molesters, they confessed to a total of 22,981 molestations. This is equivalent to 150 children per molester. Self-admitted heterosexual molesters admitted to 4,435 molestations. This comes to 19.8 victims per molester. Dr. Abel concluded that homosexuals sexually molest young boys at an incidence that is occurring from five times greater than the molestation of girls. This high rate of molestations by homosexuals is consistent with other studies conducted during the past several decades. Here are just a few studies that show homosexuals molesting children at epidemic rates: In 1984, a Vermont survey of 161 adolescents who were sex offenders found that 35 of them were homosexuals (22%). (Wasserman, J., Adolescent Sex OffendersVermont, 1984 Journal American Medical Association, 1986; 255:181-2) In 1991, of the 100 child molesters at the Massachusetts Treatment Center for Sexually Dangerous Persons, a third were heterosexual, a third were bisexual, and a third were homosexual. (Dr. Raymond Knight, Differential Prevalence of Personality Disorders in Rapists and Child Molesters, Eastern Psychological Association Conference, New York, April 12, 1991) Drs. Freund and Heasman of the Clark Institute of Psychiatry in Toronto reviewed two studies on child molesters and calculated that 34% and 32% of the sex offenders were homosexual. In cases these doctors had handled, 36% of the molesters were homosexuals. (Freund, K.

Why should an insurance company cover a homosexual couple, when that couple can't define marriage; and thus can't claim to be married? My concern is that no benefits are awarded at the cost of stealing those benefits from the unwilling. This is the part of the show where you have nothing to retort and just go away, thank you.

The fact that by denying Gay people the right to marry you not only discriminate against them but you force your religious definition of marriage on them, which is also against the Constitution. But I don't concern myself arguing with fools such as you, because I have no doubt that eventually enough people in this country will wake up and set things right. Just like African Americans and Women eventually gained Equal protection under our Constitution Gay people will also see their Rights restored.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","02:24 PM","gay-rights-debates","284"

What a hypocrite . You won't drag me into another stupid debate about why taxes are necessary. You have been beaten down on this subject since I've been on this forum so either you're crazy or you're just too stupid to get it. Gay rights has nothing to do with your idiotic utopian dream world... and taxing is not stealing.","Freedom","455058","Answer the question. Beaten down? Like when you whipped me on evolution?

The only one on this forum who thinks you won said argument is You. You were proven wrong by more than one member here, over and over, just like you have been beaten down concerning your Utopian dream world. An idiot such as yourself doesn't know when to quit so you just keep posting the same lame points until the opposition gives up and moves on to something worthwhile.. then you claim victory... lol.. funny.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","09:51 AM","gay-rights-debates","89"

XXXXXX such as yourself realize the same lame points aren't going to make me give up; and they give up while declaring victory because they have nothing worthwhile to respond with... it's not funny is disturbing and intellectually dishonest. The only person who can 'beat me down' is the one who is willing to argue until they win, and a dozen failed attempts doesn't sum to one success.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:54 PM","gay-rights-debates","100"

It is no different than claiming individual A has strong preference for people of African descent while individual B has strong preference for people of Mediterranean descent. Homosexualism has not been scientifically proven to be anything other than a simple preference for a specific type of activity. It is no more worth consideration or legal protection than bird watching or wearing brown shoes as opposed to any other color. Human sexuality is regarded as fluidic in nature and subject to change. Homosexualism as well at heterosexualism are nothing more than temporary phases of development. As such there is no reason to cater to what is nothing more than a temporary trend.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","07:58 PM","gay-rights-debates","131"

It has not yet been scientifically proven to be anything more than a mere choice of preference. It is not something that should warrant constitutional protection anymore than someone's belief that women with red hair are superior to those with blond hair. Eleven million people in the United State believe that they have a right to citizenship and full constitutional benefits even though they are here illegally and engaging in larceny and tax evasion.

I wonder why you left that out, perhaps because it shows that its pure discrimination. Also, did you just compare gays to illegal immigrants??? Wow........ While your at it why dont we also get rid of dwarves and midgets... hell, people with mental retardation shouldnt marry either right? If we weed out enough of them we might bring down the tax bill. And iv never liked those gypsies... and while were here we might as well get rid of the Muslims... Perhaps we can make some camps in Arizona and Nevada to put them to works while we think of a Solution . The road to extremism starts with discrimination and Intolerance of lawful individuals due to personal belief, sexual orientation or societal standing.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:00 PM","gay-rights-debates","166"
