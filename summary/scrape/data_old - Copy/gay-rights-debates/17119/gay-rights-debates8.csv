Prop 8 is a constitutional case in front of the SCOTUS they could rule these state constitutional amendments unconstitutional, as they did in loving. We could also go state by state the old people can't live forever. It still amazes me that heteros , who have no skin in the game, want to decide the fate of gay families when they would be up in arms if gay people got to decide the fate of their families.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","05:33 AM","gay-rights-debates","109"

Obama has already ordered the justice department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage act which right now is the only thing keeping states from having to recognize gay marriages performed in other states. If the DOMA fails, even states with constitutional provisions against gay marriage will have to recognize gay marriages performed in other states. What they did with the DOMA was essentially try to amend the constitution (the full faith and credit clause) with a statue.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","08:23 AM","gay-rights-debates","110"

Individual states possess significant authority when it comes to either recognizing or not recognizing out of state standards as valid. For instance each state is fully authorized to determine which out of state permits they are willing to recognize when it comes to the matter of carrying a concealed firearm. And if a state constitution contains a provision against homosexual marriage there is little reason to believe this aspect of their constitution would be rendered null and void in a defacto manner.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:53 AM","gay-rights-debates","112"

If New York says it found Joe innocent of crime A you can't prosecute Joe for crime A in Texas. However, if New York doesn't consider B a crime but Texas does, Texas can still prosecute for B. The point is, as you said; not to undermine the law of other states but to prevent corruption that might occur if one state starts rejecting the legal works of other states just because they are other states. Another example: California has criteria A for open carry permit. Texas has criteria B for open carry permit. Texas open carry permit is not valid in California. Full faith and credit means California must recognize that the state of Texas looked into the matter and concluded Rick met the criteria for a Texas state open carry permit . That is all full faith and credit requires, it does not require California to recognize that Rick has met the criteria for California state open carry permit; which is good because that is not what Texas was claiming. If however the criteria are the same for both states, California would have to accept the open carry permit because they already accept that Texas confirmed that Rick meets their common criteria. So it is with marriage, the criteria is the same between states for heterosexual marriage is very similar such that it's common that one states criteria already establishes by full faith and credit that the people are married in many other states. If however the criteria changed, this one no longer be true. Such is the case with homosexual marriages. Every state must accept that a homosexual couple is legally married in a certain state, if that couple moved to another state that state would have to accept the documentation towards that effect from their previous state but if that documentation did not show them meeting the criteria for the new state they would not be married in the new state. Bottom line, full faith and credit does apply to homosexual marriage between two states that recognize homosexual marriages (on the same criteria).","obama-supports-gay-marriage","01:15 PM","gay-rights-debates","113"

If you are talking purely religious reasons....a law that said ""The Lord Almighty and Jesus Christ and Joseph Smith say marriage is between a man and a woman"", I think there would be a religious issue there. I wish people could get it through their heads that when we are talking about the legality of Gay marriage...or any marriage...it has nothing to do with religion. Legal marriage has nothing to do with religion. It is all a matter of contract law. If you beat your wife for being disobedient, or kill her for committing adultery, no court is going to set you free because the bible says that is part of marriage. If you wife files for divorce and you walk in to court with a bible and say it is not possible because the bible says so, you are going to end up divorced anyway. If you marry a woman against her will because her father says it is OK, it does not matter if the bible says it is OK, you are going to do 30 to life for kidnapping, most likely with another 15 tacked on for rape. Ironically enough, that is the same argument I used to use when I was opposed to legalizing gay marriage...mostly because I just didn't think it was worth the trouble and mess. I argued that the legal part of marriage was not the important part...it was the ""spiritual"" part that mattered....even if all the paperwork vanished tomorrow, nothing would change between me and my wife...it is not the paperwork that makes the marriage, it is the commitment. For all intents and purposes, that is the ""religious"" side of marriage. Sorry to say, the religious folks have already lost that battle...I know several gay couples who consider themselves married despite the lack of paperwork. As I thought about it more, when it comes to the legality of gay marriage, it is actually the spiritual or religious side of things that is irrelevant. The legal side of things actually is a big deal when I started thinking about it a little more. I have said before that marriage is, from a legal standpoint, basically a prepackaged civil contract that recognizes certain rights between 2 parties. For some people that might not matter....personally, though, I use my wife as my proxy all the time. It would cost a fortune in legal fees to draft all the power of attorney forms and joint ownership agreements, and health care proxys and liability contracts that are all automatic now because they are part of that pre packaged contract. That changed my opinion completely. I don't care if we call it ""marriage"" or not, but I see no reason that you should not be able to assign another individual, regardless of their sex or even their relationship to you, the same legal status as a spouse. If you want to assign somebody as your proxy, and commingle your financial and business interests with theirs without a hassle, you should be able to.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","11:12 AM","gay-rights-debates","120"
