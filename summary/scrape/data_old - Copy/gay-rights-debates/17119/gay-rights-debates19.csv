Whatever God does is justified by virtue of God having done it. Destroying those two cities, punishing the sinful, etc. But those are most certainly NOT guidelines for us mere humans to live our lives. God is the general, he can see the whole picture and thus can act. We are grunts, we can't see a fraction of what he can see. Our job is to follow orders. Jesus had given us our 'marching orders' as it is. And nowhere does he tell us to influence politics, make laws prohibiting this and that, etc. We are citizens of heaven, not of heaven. And out duty, our God-given duty, is to love others. To serve them in humility and kindness, to not judge them. To provide BOUNDLESS mercy and to walk in the light of Christ. Frankly, I've wondered if Christians should even be involved in laws. We're not primary citizens of this earth, so why should we really bother? Perhaps we should be neutral, a red cross like, helping people and treating them all equally. Our job, our duty is to follow the rules Jesus has given us. Our other duty is to walk with God and talk with him, so he may guide us in his plans. Condemning the gays and fighting their movement is not Christian. God has given us all -every last human being- a choice in how to live our lives. We wanted the freedom, we got it. And every last one of us has sinned, we do daily. So to condemn the gays -or anyone for that matter- is both utterly pointless and completely hypocritical. If anything, you should be even more loving and compassionate and friendly towards the gay community because they very much need the love of God in their lives. A sin is a sin in the end EZ, being gay is not some special, particularly horrible type of sin. It doesn't require any special treatment or any such nonsense. In the end, it is completely irrelevant how people have sinned or how much, because we're all in the same boat that way. It should have zero bearing on how you treat them, zero affect on how much Jesus calls us to love everyone.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","09:55 PM","gay-rights-debates","271"
"06-30-2013","17119",19,"Xenamnes","475052","None of which proves that homosexualism is a legitimate differentiation in nature. It has not yet been scientifically proven to be anything more than a mere choice of preference. It is not something that should warrant constitutional protection anymore than someone's belief that women with red hair are superior to those with blond hair. Eleven million people in the United State believe that they have a right to citizenship and full constitutional benefits even though they are here illegally and engaging in larceny and tax evasion. Something is not true simply because it is wanted to a significant degree.","Hdreams","475055","You skipped this point Xanamnes Men/Women who are attracted to African/Asian/Caribbean/European have the right to marry, Gay people dont. I wonder why you left that out, perhaps because it shows that its pure discrimination. Also, did you just compare gays to illegal immigrants??? Wow........ While your at it why dont we also get rid of dwarves and midgets... hell, people with mental retardation shouldnt marry either right? If we weed out enough of them we might bring down the tax bill. And iv never liked those gypsies... and while were here we might as well get rid of the Muslims... Perhaps we can make some camps in Arizona and Nevada to put them to works while we think of a Solution . The road to extremism starts with discrimination and Intolerance of lawful individuals due to personal belief, sexual orientation or societal standing.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:00 PM","gay-rights-debates","272"

Assuming then that you are a normal heterosexual man...do you think you could choose to be emotionally, romantically and sexually attracted to someone of the same sex? Do you think you could choose to fall in love with someone of the same sex and wanting to live your life with them? If not, then why do you think other people could choose to do so? Behaviour is certainly a choice, sexual orientation is not.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","01:23 AM","gay-rights-debates","274"
"07-01-2013","17119",19,"Hdreams","475053","Well you gave me a reason, i suppose thats what i asked for. A completely ridiculous reason that has no link to denying them the right to marry because they are gay but a reason nonetheless. Your tirade reads as a hatred, and i use the word hatred here specifically because you havent addressed the issue of gay marriage merely shown that you have no wish for gays to even exist. Most of your remarks would be equally applicable to a heterosexual couple or other denomination, here let me show you the extent of your biased religious agenda. Next, they push their illicit agenda into every corner of America. Suing the Boy Scouts and anyone else who disagrees with them. People suffer financial loss defending themselves from christian lawsuits. Evangelicals try and sometimes succeed in pushing their Christian agenda in elementary schools and elsewhere where it doesn't belong. Nine year old children shouldn't have to hear that Billy's daddy is doing another woman, or that it's ok to do it. They push their agenda in our faces until we're quite sick of it. We don't need to know which way people perform sex acts. You see what i did there, and the schools bit lines up perfectly... And the adulterous hetero as well. They call you a bigot because you are, you are intolerant toward them and expect them to be happy with being a second class citizen. Unfortunately reason has prevailed in the last 100 years EZ. First with womens rights, then racial rights and now it will be sexual rights. If they are an end unto themselves that should make you happy right? Not passing on their sinful genes... Your religions theocratic agenda clouds you to the issues of humanity and the rights that thou's god supposedly bestow unto his children. Discrimantion and intolerance is your message, the Taliban and Islamic Africa would find an ally in you.","Easyrider","475074","<Flush> That's the final refuge of the spiritually-challenged left-wing crowd - when you can't win the argument resort to ad hominems.

LOS ANGELES (Sept. 24, 2009) - Susan Atkins, a follower of cult leader Charles Manson whose remorseless witness stand confession to killing pregnant actress Sharon Tate in 1969 shocked the world, has died. She was 61 and had been suffering from brain cancer. The matronly, gray-haired Atkins who appeared before a parole board in 2000 cut a far different figure than that of the cocky young defendant some 30 years earlier. ""I don't have to just make amends to the victims and families,"" she said softly. ""I have to make amends to society. I sinned against God and everything this country stands for."" She said she had found redemption in Christianity. The last words she spoke in public at the September hearing were to say in unison with her husband: ""My God is an amazing God."" Breaking News and Opinion on The Huffington Post The Bishop of Rochester, Dr Michael Nazir-Ali, has defended traditional biblical teachings on homosexuality and said the Church should not be ""rolled over by culture"". ""The Bibles teaching shows that marriage is between a man and a woman. That is the way to express our sexual nature. ""We welcome homosexuals, we dont want to exclude people, but we want them to repent and be changed."" Change and repent, bishop tells gays - Telegraph Assuming Susan Atkins repentance and conversion in Christ was legitimate, she will get to heaven before the unrepentant gay pride practitioners. And that would include Matthew Shepard, were he one who refused to repent of any gay sex sin in his life.","obama-supports-gay-marriage","10:57 AM","gay-rights-debates","278"

Have you ever heard the old saying, ""The only thing required for evil to triumph is for good men to say and do nothing""? Have you ever read what Martin Luther wrote - ""Every institution in which men are not increasingly occupied with the Word of God must become corrupt.""
