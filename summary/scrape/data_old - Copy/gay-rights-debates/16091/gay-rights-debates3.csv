I would actually be ok if my company said the anyone with out of state marriage licenses could not put their spouse on their insurance. I would then be treated equally to others.","gay-marriage","05:37 AM","gay-rights-debates","31"

In fact you are treated the same as the hetero couple. You just want to expand legal marriage to accept hitheto illegal ones. Hence my argument that just making one form of illegal marriage legal is unfair without a complete review of marriage itself. I know that you dont care who got married as long as you can but that does not make gay marriage fair..not without a review..","gay-marriage","11:46 AM","gay-rights-debates","32"
