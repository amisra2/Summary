"02-03-2012","16091",2,"Matthew S","448364","In the west true but the west is not the world. World wide there are more heterosexuals infected with HIV then gays.","gansao","448519","There is a lot more heterosexual people in the world than gays. There is a far higher rate of HIV in homosexuals men per capita than straights...where records are kept...in the West. Homosexuals like you that call HIV a' heterosexual' disease are not doing their homosexual brothers any favours by being deliberately disegenuous. I suppose as the HIV rate is so high in Africa(22.9 million out of a total of 34 million worldwide) that we should call it an African disease and ignore it in the US and Europe","gay-marriage","06:53 AM","gay-rights-debates","17"

It's so much a gay-sex related issue that originally AIDS was even originally called GRID (Gay Related Immunity Deficiency). A lot of people don't even know that. Perhaps if it had kept that name, there would have been much better focused educational effort of prevention over the years. But for some, political correctness is more important than saving lives.","gay-marriage","10:39 AM","gay-rights-debates","18"

You take an entire class of people, remove the calming influence that ""settling down with the wife"" has, and it is no wonder you see venereal diseases going through that class like wildfire. I get the impression talking to some of the very ""religious"" folks on this forum about these issues that maybe your college years were not the alcohol fueled orgies that some of the rest of us engaged in. Granted if the words ""$hit....gonorrhea AGAIN "" have never passed your lips, maybe the relationship between promiscuity, venereal diseases, and marriage is more difficult to understand than for somebody who has sat looking at one of those stupid ""list your sex partners"" that they give you at the student health center concentrating furiously and thinking ""She had brown hair and I think her name started with a K....or maybe an L......"" So, you just write down the one you can remember (probably the one you are supposed to be dating) and move on.... The gay community shows higher levels of virtually ALL venereal diseases. It is not because god is punishing them, or because for some reason the gay gene makes you a VD magnet, it is because they never settle down and get married because people like YOU wont let them. Amazingly enough, since I got married I have suffered from exactly zero STDs. It isnt a coincidence. Today instead of going on on friday night, getting completely hammered, having sex with 2 women and ""sexual contact"" with a third, I spent last friday night online looking at track lighting and trying to decide whether antique bronze or stainless would look better in the kitchen. I went with the antique bronze because my cabinets are a darker cherry and I thought it would look better...lights should be here soon and we will see if I was right or not.","gay-marriage","01:39 PM","gay-rights-debates","20"
