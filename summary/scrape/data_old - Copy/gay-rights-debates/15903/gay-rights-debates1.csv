"11-17-2011","15903",1,"Easyrider","443077","Outstanding!","jyoshu","443080","In terms of it being a win for democracy and freedom, yes it is 'outstanding'. But it's not something I think should be gloated over culturally and religiously. Though I believe gay sex is wrong, some sensitivity is important--this is still a deeply personal issue for many of them, after all.","gay-marriage-opponents-win-california-high-court-victory","10:40 PM","gay-rights-debates","3"

Ruling on Prop 8 Standing: What it Means - YouTube One thing to keep in mind is that if the anti gay forces win this opens the door to putting all kinds of civil rights of various minority groups on the ballot. True as it has been argued to death that religious freedom can not be done away with altogether but the majority could put heavy restrictions on it. For example a ballot initiative could go on the ballot saying that catholics can only open their church buildings for use every 4 Thursday night. They would still be free to practice their religion on the lawn but hey could not use the building. How about a ballot initiative outlawing door to door proselytizing they can do it from the sidewalk and in public spaces but they will not bother people at home. The bible through ballot initiative could be viewed as society does other graphically sexual and violent material and restrict the bibles usage to adults. Make the sale and use of the bible by minors illegal and impose the same penalties on people that we would for showing children pornography. I can even see a ballot initiative restricting marriage to same religious groups. For instance a mormon can only marry a mormon or a catholic a catholic. Also religion could be viewed as a drug and regulated as we do other drugs.

I can not add my husband to my insurance, I can not take FMLA leave if he gets sick, just to name a few. The state of michigan is forcing me to live by the religious beliefs of the anti gay. I am sure you wouldn't like it if the state you lived in said you couldn't eat bacon, or could only eat fish on fridays.","gay-marriage-opponents-win-california-high-court-victory","07:09 AM","gay-rights-debates","6"

"11-18-2011","15903",1,"None","None","None","Accipiter","443097","There is no solid rational explanation or evidence of exactly how gay marriage is a danger to traditional marriage or to society. Last time this thing was in court the religious lost for that very reason. The religious have some vague ethereal reasons that can not be quantified and that's why they will eventually lose the battle.","gay-marriage-opponents-win-california-high-court-victory","07:37 AM","gay-rights-debates","8"
