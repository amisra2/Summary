These comments boggle my mind The CLEAREST recognition that the government recognizes gays as a truly unique class of people is seen in its earliest forms WHERE THE GOVERNMENT PASSED LAWS DISCRIMINATING AGAINST GAYS Duh! You cant argue that gays arent a truly unique class of people, while the government actively discriminates against that group. Its just an inherently losing argument! Furthermore, I think you need to brush up on your history. Try reading Lawrence v Texas. Romer v Evans also has a lot to say regarding discrimination against gays and how they still have 14th amendment protections.","gay-marriage-opponents-win-california-high-court-victory","06:49 PM","gay-rights-debates","50"
