They do enjoy equal protection, they just don't enjoy equal definition. Do you realize that tax brackets discriminate between people based on wealth? I thought all citizens were to be treated equal I want to marry my car, would you deny me equal protection under the law? From what you're implying that means you need to keep widening any definition the law uses every time I challenge it. Oh I would just have a field day with doc Jones on gun laws with that. Notice how the definition of 'law enforcement officer' and 'authorized personnel' discriminates against well non-law-enforcement personnel. What if instead of fighting for a definition they simply move the goalposts? Define marriage type A as marriage has always been defined and update every law they can to say marriage type A defined in X document? What if they don't define marriage at all? What if they say B benefits (which are identical to current marriage benefits) are now applied to any man and woman who have filed form 24C?Or are they not allowed to decide who gets the benefits they doll out? If that is the case by what right to they doll out social security, unemployment, food stamps, tax breaks for green energy, research grants, development grants, stimulus packages, massive construction projects.... all to specific states or people based on broad categorizations! That is obvious. Ignorance, hypocrisy, and the inevitable if minor immoralities you commit because of said ignorance. You're the one who's whining, I have been willing to argue for my conclusions, and yes that is better than both doing nothing and making a meaningless gesture that will land me in prison. If you have a better plan I am listening. You won't know unless you try. maybe someone else in Utopia will see it and join your cause... but then again......... No, but people can rarely strike at their true oppressors. I doubt Mr. Smit German GI blown away by the french resistance planned the final solution and aspired to global domination over the freedom and lives of the rest of humanity but he was the one who showed up to make it happen. Following orders is not an excuse. IRS agent is guilty, politicians are guilty, but none more so than the originators of the plan. None more so than all the 'yous' out there xcaliber. Democracies greatest advantage is also it's greatest curse, everyone takes responsibility, but no one is responsible. Being willing to argue isn't working on you, it doesn't work on most; but it is still the most effective use of my time. I'm sure you can guess by that that I am not the owner of some multinational corporation which can launch propaganda campaigns and fund liberation efforts around the world, but I am trying to expand my options. As for communication, arguing is all I can do without betraying the principles I am trying to communicate. Emotional rhetoric, feigning friendship or agreement with would be opponents to try to convince them that no disagreement exists (a despicable tactic I've seen more than once) and all other such manipulations are not only ultimately counter-productive (who trusts politicians anymore) but when discovered send one message, there is no truth to stand on. I don't believe you perceive my statements as whining, no one's that stupid. You're just trying to paint a caricature that will help you ignore me with a quieter conscious. The best you could intelligently make for is foolishly self-righteous with a hero complex and an air of arrogant nobility... I'd like to see you prove either of those statements. It would also be illogical to find something worthless because it is right. Do you think Obama wants to fix the economy? I'm sure he does, but he fails, and continues to fail. How incredibly funny Perhaps we should ask the prophet snakespit which of us is right. It's interesting how you phrased that, a principle of modern democracy is the consent of the governed. Which is also to say the consent of the people. Yet you dismiss the idea of requiring the consent of people. What's the difference? The word 'the', the people is a single abstraction, people alone is a aggregation. This is a uniquely clear illustration of the core fallacy behind collectivist thinking if you care to know. We can't trust people but we can trust the people, we can't rely on the willingness of people but we can rely on the willingness of the people. I don't care if you cure cancer, morality always takes the ribbon when it comes to the priorities of a proper healthy human being. Your strawmen do not concern me, but your right they do confuse me.","gay-marriage-opponents-win-california-high-court-victory","04:13 AM","gay-rights-debates","32"

This is where you are mixed up. Gay people DO NOT enjoy equal protection under the Law. Marriage is a STATE ISSUE, not a Federal one. The Federal Government is not supposed to pass FEDERAL laws that discriminate. Not only are they discriminating against Gay people but they also discriminate against STATES which allow Gay marriage. A married couple in Texas can file a joint FEDERAL TAX RETURN... to get certain tax credits for being married. A Legally married gay couple in the State of Vermont Cannot. That you can not see that this is blatant discrimination is beyond me, and leads me to believe that you simply do not want to admit it because of your personal view on Gay people. If your State passes a Law that allows you to marry your car then the Federal Government has no right to interfere . I personally don't care if you want to marry your sister, or your dog.. My point from the start is that the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT Doesn't have the right to interfere in STATE matters. Texas doesn't allow Gay Marriage.. I have no problem with that, even though I disagree with them on Principle , they are within their rights to pass a law banning gay marriage. The Federal Government does not have that right, and that is why DOMA should be repealed. Who's fighting for a definition? Before DOMA there was no legal definition in the Constitution. Before DOMA Marriage Laws were left up to the States to decide. The Federal Government under control of a republican majority forced their way into a State issue and re-defined Marriage to specifically discriminate... How am I whining..lol.. You're the one constantly crying about taxes being immoral. I don't like paying taxes either, in fact if someone says they do like it they are possibly insane. But I can look at the culture I live in and understand the need for taxes. I'm not going to refuse to pay my taxes any more than you are, but I'm also not going to worry myself sick over something which I can't control. I guess you could always find a place on this planet where you don't have to pay taxes and move there. That's your opinion, not a matter of fact. You're just as "" Guilty"" as anyone because you promote the system of taxes every time you pay. Whining and crying about having to pay taxes doesn't clear you of the guilt you own by willfully paying those taxes. because the argument is weak...","gay-marriage-opponents-win-california-high-court-victory","09:47 AM","gay-rights-debates","35"
"11-21-2011","15903",3,"Freedom","443248","So equal protection of two signers but not one? What is it about having two that makes you entitled to privilege?","Matthew S","443251","If I have to explain why it takes two sentient beings to initiate a contract then you are in bad shape. Also, I assume you are heterosexual, if you are married why did you get married? If you are married, I want the same respect for my marriage from you that you as a heterosexual demand from me. It is as simple as that. You see there is a problem that you do not see or seem to understand. Heterosexuals have a privilege in our society, being the majority. The problem with this privilege is that you have to be on the outside to see it. When our enemies argue that they are protecting marriage they are actually protecting their heterosexual privilege, much like southern whites in the 1950's were fighting to protect their white privilege.","gay-marriage-opponents-win-california-high-court-victory","04:32 AM","gay-rights-debates","37"
"11-21-2011","15903",3,"Freedom","443248","Ah so it's not an infringement of someones liberty to stop them from doing something they don't have a right to do? Yes they do. Marriage is an individual issue, both with respect to the agreement; and any possible support by others. In fact the only thing that is not ultimately an individual issue is morality. All states allow homosexual marriage. I know, and a minimum wage worker can be totally exempt from federal taxes when a millionaire cannot. The extent of the unfairness which you bring to me is that homosexuals are still stolen from at the usual rates and not given special shielding from that evil. It is an absolutely null point because the correct position is that no stealing should occur and therefore the correct position can admit no difference and recognize no 'unfairness'. I don't care if you call yourself the king of france if it will cut your taxes but don't expect me to see any special problem here when there isn't one. This is one of thousands of arbitrary discriminations by the government all founded on an act that is morally unjustifiable in the first place. If marriage is between me and the car I love, why do I need to wait for a law? If my liberty is being curtailed shouldn't we be talking about removing the law that is curtailing it? Find the law. Then you cannot believe it to be immoral to ban homosexual marriage (which they haven't done anymore than defining bread as edible is banning refrigerators which some insist are bread). They don't have the right to do a lot of things they do, but defining a word they use repeatedly in the law when it's meaning is being intentionally altered is not one of them. They did not redefine marriage, the affirmed it's definition as I have proved. That's been examined. It is both opinion and fact. There is no guilt in complying with extortion unless you are doing so out of cowardice. That is not in evidence.","Xcaliber","443252","You don't have the Liberty to Murder... Murder is not a right.. Your argument is ignorant. No, they actually don't. Wrong again, Marriage is a state issue. Lol.. I know you live in a bubble of delusion but please try to keep up won't you... Marriage is defined as the union of one man and one woman in 42 states. Currently, 30 states have added amendments banning same-sex unions to their constitutions. There are six states that recognize same-sex marriages,(plus the District of Columbia) that recognize some form of same-sex civil unions or domestic partnerships You're wrong yet again.... no a millionaire pays less taxes by the time all the subsidies and special tax cuts are applied by their friends in Congress.... Morally unjustified according to YOU... You don't have to wait for a Law to marry your car.. you have to wait for a law for your marriage to your car to be recognized as a legal marriage. The Anti-Gay Texas Marriage Amendment (HJR 6) Passed Nov 8th 2005, banning all gay marriages and civil unions in the state of Texas. This was just one of the 30 states to pass such an amendment in the wake of DOMA. Most have been challenged and found unconstitutional but they are making their way through the system, which is the purpose I suppose. I never said it was Immoral in the first place.. I said it was UNCONSTITUTIONAL. And they have banned it.. do they not have newspapers in Utopian dreamworld? That's why it was unconstitutional... No they didn't RE-define it.. they defined it period. Before DOMA there was no actual written definition in the Law. Not well enough evidently... Not fact, only your wrong opinion.... So you're a Coward?... that makes sense actually. Right before your eyes, but as usual you are blind to fact and reason....lol","gay-marriage-opponents-win-california-high-court-victory","04:48 AM","gay-rights-debates","38"
"11-21-2011","15903",3,"Freedom","443261","It's not merely an agreement (contract) that you are demanding the government recognize, that is something you are already given. You want special privileges that you can't get out of an agreement between two people and the only argument you have for your entitlement to those privileges is that a definition should be changed to include you.... and to fail to do so is discriminatory. Well I can say the same thing for just about anything including a car, claiming that some kind of agreement has to take place is just a redefinition of marriage (which didn't have definition don't you know) designed to discriminate against auto-marriage. I am not married and if I were I would make no promises nor demands of you except to respect your rights and respect my rights. Married people as recognized by the government by conforming to the traditional meaning of marriage have privilege but as I've said a dozen times they are one group among many that are being granted privilege at the expense of the rights of the populace. You can't kill a hydra by chopping off only one head and I place the blame for all of this on the principle which allows people to excuse the vehicle of these violations - which is the perception that a persons rights are subject to majority decision. Further it is clear that we do not agree by the fact that in an ideal volitional society people heterosexual marriage could still be a privileged class with far more benefits than homosexual marriage, the only difference would be that no one could force you or anyone else to pay for that privilege. However from the implications of your statements you seem to think you are entitled to equality regardless of the source of these privileges, this is not true. I see so I can never truly understand your plight? (extreme sarcasm) They are protecting their right to support what they want as best they can under a system so crippled in moral fund allocation. I will take that as a 'yes'. Therefore if one does not have a right to marriage benefits than telling someone they can't have them is no an infringement on their liberty. Show me the laws. No it is an individual issue. If it's illegal show me the homosexual couple arrested for marrying each other. I'm right once again. If they pay any taxes at all that is greater than no taxes. Yes. Exactly, and if was between me and my car alone I would not need the special help of others to form our marriage. It's not even state protection of your agreement, it's special protection beyond the authority of the parties forming the agreement. If it's a state issue why does DOMA help or facilitate individual states 'banning' homosexual marriage. I found the text of the proposal: Check out the bolded part, just as I suspected they cannot ban homosexual marriage they simply don't recognize it. If it's not immoral than there is no point to this discussion, I don't care if it's constitutional. Not many words are subject to change. That they preserving the definition constitutes a re-definition in your book only shows that you have already accepted the changed definition, but the laws were not written with the new re-definition in mind, they were written with the contemporary dictionary definition, and no law could survive it's key language changing from underneath it. It's essentially indirect legislation. Prove it. No.","Matthew S","443271","Well then in your ideal volitional society I wouldn't have to hire, serve fundies.
