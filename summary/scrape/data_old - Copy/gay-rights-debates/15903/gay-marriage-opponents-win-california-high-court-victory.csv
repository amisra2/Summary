In fear that other states would be required to recognize Gay Marriages due to the Full Faith and Credit Clause DOMA was passed, Applying a Definition to Marriage as being between one man and one woman. It also changed the wording of the Fair Faith and Credit Clause relieving the states from having to recognize Gay marriages from other states.

This is where you are mixed up. Gay people DO NOT enjoy equal protection under the Law. Marriage is a STATE ISSUE, not a Federal one. The Federal Government is not supposed to pass FEDERAL laws that discriminate. Not only are they discriminating against Gay people but they also discriminate against STATES which allow Gay marriage. A married couple in Texas can file a joint FEDERAL TAX RETURN... to get certain tax credits for being married. A Legally married gay couple in the State of Vermont Cannot. That you can not see that this is blatant discrimination is beyond me, and leads me to believe that you simply do not want to admit it because of your personal view on Gay people. If your State passes a Law that allows you to marry your car then the Federal Government has no right to interfere . I personally don't care if you want to marry your sister, or your dog.. My point from the start is that the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT Doesn't have the right to interfere in STATE matters. Texas doesn't allow Gay Marriage.. I have no problem with that, even though I disagree with them on Principle , they are within their rights to pass a law banning gay marriage. The Federal Government does not have that right, and that is why DOMA should be repealed. Who's fighting for a definition? Before DOMA there was no legal definition in the Constitution. Before DOMA Marriage Laws were left up to the States to decide.

Marriage is an individual issue, both with respect to the agreement; and any possible support by others. In fact the only thing that is not ultimately an individual issue is morality. All states allow homosexual marriage. I know, and a minimum wage worker can be totally exempt from federal taxes when a millionaire cannot. The extent of the unfairness which you bring to me is that homosexuals are still stolen from at the usual rates and not given special shielding from that evil. It is an absolutely null point because the correct position is that no stealing should occur and therefore the correct position can admit no difference and recognize no 'unfairness'. I don't care if you call yourself the king of france if it will cut your taxes but don't expect me to see any special problem here when there isn't one. This is one of thousands of arbitrary discriminations by the government all founded on an act that is morally unjustifiable in the first place. If marriage is between me and the car I love, why do I need to wait for a law? If my liberty is being curtailed shouldn't we be talking about removing the law that is curtailing it? Find the law. Then you cannot believe it to be immoral to ban homosexual marriage (which they haven't done anymore than defining bread as edible is banning refrigerators which some insist are bread). They don't have the right to do a lot of things they do, but defining a word they use repeatedly in the law when it's meaning is being intentionally altered is not one of them. They did not redefine marriage, the affirmed it's definition as I have proved. That's been examined. It is both opinion and fact.

Your argument is ignorant. No, they actually don't. Wrong again, Marriage is a state issue. Lol.. I know you live in a bubble of delusion but please try to keep up won't you...

The Anti-Gay Texas Marriage Amendment (HJR 6) Passed Nov 8th 2005, banning all gay marriages and civil unions in the state of Texas. This was just one of the 30 states to pass such an amendment in the wake of DOMA. Most have been challenged and found unconstitutional but they are making their way through the system, which is the purpose I suppose. I never said it was Immoral in the first place.. I said it was UNCONSTITUTIONAL. And they have banned it.. do they not have newspapers in Utopian dreamworld? That's why it was unconstitutional...

You want special privileges that you can't get out of an agreement between two people and the only argument you have for your entitlement to those privileges is that a definition should be changed to include you.... and to fail to do so is discriminatory. Well I can say the same thing for just about anything including a car, claiming that some kind of agreement has to take place is just a redefinition of marriage (which didn't have definition don't you know) designed to discriminate against auto-marriage. I am not married and if I were I would make no promises nor demands of you except to respect your rights and respect my rights. Married people as recognized by the government by conforming to the traditional meaning of marriage have privilege but as I've said a dozen times they are one group among many that are being granted privilege at the expense of the rights of the populace. You can't kill a hydra by chopping off only one head and I place the blame for all of this on the principle which allows people to excuse the vehicle of these violations - which is the perception that a persons rights are subject to majority decision. Further it is clear that we do not agree by the fact that in an ideal volitional society people heterosexual marriage could still be a privileged class with far more benefits than homosexual marriage, the only difference would be that no one could force you or anyone else to pay for that privilege. However from the implications of your statements you seem to think you are entitled to equality regardless of the source of these privileges, this is not true. I see so I can never truly understand your plight? (extreme sarcasm) They are protecting their right to support what they want as best they can under a system so crippled in moral fund allocation. I will take that as a 'yes'. Therefore if one does not have a right to marriage benefits than telling someone they can't have them is no an infringement on their liberty. Show me the laws.

Exactly, and if was between me and my car alone I would not need the special help of others to form our marriage.
