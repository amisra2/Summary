Ruling on Prop 8 Standing: What it Means - YouTube One thing to keep in mind is that if the anti gay forces win this opens the door to putting all kinds of civil rights of various minority groups on the ballot. True as it has been argued to death that religious freedom can not be done away with altogether but the majority could put heavy restrictions on it. For example a ballot initiative could go on the ballot saying that catholics can only open their church buildings for use every 4 Thursday night. They would still be free to practice their religion on the lawn but hey could not use the building. How about a ballot initiative outlawing door to door proselytizing they can do it from the sidewalk and in public spaces but they will not bother people at home. The bible through ballot initiative could be viewed as society does other graphically sexual and violent material and restrict the bibles usage to adults. Make the sale and use of the bible by minors illegal and impose the same penalties on people that we would for showing children pornography. I can even see a ballot initiative restricting marriage to same religious groups. For instance a mormon can only marry a mormon or a catholic a catholic. Also religion could be viewed as a drug and regulated as we do other drugs.

Go back and do some reading, you might learn something. A Gay Couple in Hawaii decided to get Married, they were denied a Marriage license, they filed a Lawsuit and the State Supreme Court granted them the license and said it was unconstitutional to discriminate on the basis that they were gay. In fear that other states would be required to recognize Gay Marriages due to the Full Faith and Credit Clause DOMA was passed, Applying a Definition to Marriage as being between one man and one woman. It also changed the wording of the Fair Faith and Credit Clause relieving the states from having to recognize Gay marriages from other states. DOMA is and always has been Unconstitutional and it's just a matter of time before the Supreme Court hears the case .

Emotional rhetoric, feigning friendship or agreement with would be opponents to try to convince them that no disagreement exists (a despicable tactic I've seen more than once) and all other such manipulations are not only ultimately counter-productive (who trusts politicians anymore) but when discovered send one message, there is no truth to stand on.

If you have a better plan I am listening. No, but people can rarely strike at their true oppressors. I doubt Mr. Smit German GI blown away by the french resistance planned the final solution and aspired to global domination over the freedom and lives of the rest of humanity but he was the one who showed up to make it happen. Following orders is not an excuse. IRS agent is guilty, politicians are guilty, but none more so than the originators of the plan. None more so than all the 'yous' out there xcaliber. Being willing to argue isn't working on you, it doesn't work on most; but it is still the most effective use of my time. I'm sure you can guess by that that I am not the owner of some multinational corporation which can launch propaganda campaigns and fund liberation efforts around the world, but I am trying to expand my options.","Xcaliber","443215","People don't have the Right to Murder, but they should have the right to choose whom they want to marry ... This is where you are mixed up. Gay people DO NOT enjoy equal protection under the Law. Marriage is a STATE ISSUE, not a Federal one. The Federal Government is not supposed to pass FEDERAL laws that discriminate. Not only are they discriminating against Gay people but they also discriminate against STATES which allow Gay marriage. A married couple in Texas can file a joint FEDERAL TAX RETURN... to get certain tax credits for being married. A Legally married gay couple in the State of Vermont Cannot. That you can not see that this is blatant discrimination is beyond me, and leads me to believe that you simply do not want to admit it because of your personal view on Gay people. If your State passes a Law that allows you to marry your car then the Federal Government has no right to interfere . I personally don't care if you want to marry your sister, or your dog.. My point from the start is that the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT Doesn't have the right to interfere in STATE matters. Texas doesn't allow Gay Marriage.. I have no problem with that, even though I disagree with them on Principle , they are within their rights to pass a law banning gay marriage. The Federal Government does not have that right, and that is why DOMA should be repealed. Who's fighting for a definition? Before DOMA there was no legal definition in the Constitution. Before DOMA Marriage Laws were left up to the States to decide. The Federal Government under control of a republican majority forced their way into a State issue and re-defined Marriage to specifically discriminate... How am I whining..lol.. You're the one constantly crying about taxes being immoral. I don't like paying taxes either, in fact if someone says they do like it they are possibly insane. But I can look at the culture I live in and understand the need for taxes. I'm not going to refuse to pay my taxes any more than you are, but I'm also not going to worry myself sick over something which I can't control. I guess you could always find a place on this planet where you don't have to pay taxes and move there. That's your opinion, not a matter of fact. You're just as "" Guilty"" as anyone because you promote the system of taxes every time you pay. Whining and crying about having to pay taxes doesn't clear you of the guilt you own by willfully paying those taxes. because the argument is weak...","gay-marriage-opponents-win-california-high-court-victory","09:47 AM","gay-rights-debates","486"
