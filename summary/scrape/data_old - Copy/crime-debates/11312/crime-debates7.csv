Is a criminal biased when he demands money, and when his demand is met he kills the victim anyhow. Is a gang member biased when he kills an innocent person just so he can enter a gang. Is a child petifiler biased when he sexually molests a child and then murders him or her. Criminals like these are stone cold killers and they deserve no mercy. You do not want to know what I think should be done to criminals like the ones mentioned in this posts. Part of the problem we have in America is people feel sympathy for criminals, even the violent ones. People say murderers should be rehabilitated instead of executed, but yet when one of their family members are raped, robbed, and or murdered, they have no mercy now for the criminal. I say when it comes to child rapist and murderers, kill em all and let God sort them out.","death-penalty","02:11 PM","crime-debates","92"
"10-07-2008","11312",7,"None","None","None","Ryuuichi","326673","Honestly I agree. Well mostly. If the person is proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt (none of that he-said she-said nonsense) well...they aren't needed in our society. They have lost their status as a human being and need to be exterminated because they are no longer beneficial to our society. Our countrys body, its womb should not have to harbor a parasite for the rest of its life. She will not allow it and we will carry out her wishes. Well as quickly as possible at the very least. We don't need to waste time having people twiddle their thumbs waiting to die. They willing chose to lost their status as a human being by taking anothers life and we then choose to exterminate them. Simple and clean. Too bad it doesn't happen more often.","death-penalty","02:25 PM","crime-debates","93"

"10-07-2008","11312",7,"iangb","326711","So, in short... it's OK for you to deal with them by a biased and unfair method because they killed people using a biased and unfair method? This makes very little sense.","grizzly6626","326737","Well the bible says if you live by the sword, you should die by the sword.

Be that as it may, the Master had a good number of positive things to say about the liberating quality of forgiveness. He also had some very negative things to say about judging others. Even those who talk about ""an eye for an eye"" never quote the entire verse which concludes with ""Vengeance is Mine, sayeth the Lord.""","death-penalty","11:12 PM","crime-debates","100"

It also states in the bible that if a person commits murder, that person is to be dispatched to God immediately for punishment, that means the murderer forfits his life at the hand of man so he can be eternally punished by God. And the bible has relevance to me in everything I do.","death-penalty","09:58 AM","crime-debates","102"
