"06-27-2008","11312",2,"Ethmi","314286","Then I guess I was wrong to assume that you think it's murder. There is a difference. Most gun owners have no violent history - criminals are incarcerated because they did something illegal - murder, rape, robbery, etc. Execute them fresh out of court, and less money is spent supporting them for fifteen years until the court stops procrastinating in killing them. Innocent inmates could be killed in prison - how is that different from being executed? There's plenty of them ""aryan nation"" freaks in jails. If you were a black guy who was thrown in jail, would you want to deal with these guys. I'll use your argument - once is too much. I'll use your argument - once is too much.","DrNo","314316","I was pointing out that I had made a mistake in my assertion that the death penalty was murder. You didn't read what I wrote. I didn't say anything about gun owners. I was talking about criminals. ""CRIMINALS might steal a gun and use it to commit a crime, so we should ban guns."" That is the argument gun control advocates make. You are making the same argument. CRIMINALS might commit another crime once they go to jail, so they should be executed. Once again, the point I am making is that we cannot begin to dish out punishments based on what somebody might do. If you disagree with this particular point, please explain why. Also, check out the movie Minority Report. I agree. It just doesn't happen like this. One is murder and one is an execution. I thought we went over this already. The states can't stop every murder from occurring, but they can stop every execution. Another Opinion addressed this already. I don't feel a need to repeat the obvious.","death-penalty","11:15 AM","crime-debates","16"

And how many prisoners have commited their first murder in prison? The chance of being killed in prison sounds to me like a better deterrent than capital punishment.","death-penalty","11:17 AM","crime-debates","17"

"06-30-2008","11312",2,"DrNo","314167","I'm confused. Are you saying you don't think there is such a thing as moral relativism? Do you believe every action is either always right or always wrong no matter what the circumstances?","iangb","314520","No, I am a moral relativist. I'm saying that it is at best hypocritical to punish someone for their actions by committing the same action against them. You can't say 'You killed someone, and killing is wrong, so I will kill you' without defying logic a little bit.","death-penalty","12:00 PM","crime-debates","23"

Following the rules of logic, the punishment can be cruel and usual, non-cruel and unusual, non-cruel and usual without breaking the rule against ""cruel and unusual"". Regarding the pre-emptive killing of someone about to become a killer, I say, ""Kill him!""...especially if I am to be his victim. I think I could kill in self-defense. I think I could kill someone trying to kill any one of my children. I think I could kill anyone trying to kill one of my good friends. I think I could kill anyone trying to kill an innocent stranger. I think I could kill any one of these people and never lose sleep over it. This business of holding out the olive branch while someone swings a sword at your neck equates to suicide.","death-penalty","01:55 PM","crime-debates","25"
