You do realise they RELIQUESHED their rights the second they killed someone right? Next thing you know you're going to say criminals should still be able to vote. Honestly why should we keep murders alive? What honestly are they living for? To live? So? Who cares? You're bleeding heart may go out to them but I don't give a hoot. Why should we waste money keeping scum alive? There's no point. Especially those who are never going to get out. Why waste the space? We need the room.","death-penalty","02:10 PM","crime-debates","107"

By their own admissions they believe that criminals should just be left alone because they have rights, and victims and their families should just have to plain old deal with it. You two are examples of why America is so screwed up right now. You two want people thrown in jail for defending themselves against criminals. Oh the poor criminal got killed by the big bad homeowner, and all the poor criminal was trying to do was rape, rob, and kill the homeowner. You two are twisted in your thinking, and I will tell both of you something, if someone harms my family, he is going to get a bullet right between the eyes. I aint going to feel a bit of sympathy for him when I pull the trigger, because if he would have obeyed the law in the first place, he would not be in that position. And if I dont have a gun handy, I will beat him to death with a bat, anyway it goes, hurt my family and you die. So go on and tell me how wrong this would be, call me hurtfull little names, I dont care. The fact will still remain the same.","death-penalty","02:37 PM","crime-debates","108"

"10-08-2008","11312",8,"iangb","326890","Someone's going to 'die by the sword'... With regards to the whole 'bleeding hearts' thing - this is true to some extent, but only on a conceptual level. For me, that a criminal is still a human being is only a minor point. Much more major, for me, is the hypocrisy of killing someone because they killed someone. How does this make the justice system any better than the criminal - who equally believed they were justified in carrying out their deed? The simple conclusion is that capital punishment immediately loses any moral high ground - the law is carried out on the basis that there are more police than murderers, and that's the end of it. Oh, and it still takes more money to kill a criminal than to keep him/her for life.","grizzly6626","326918","I would really like to know how you figure it is cheaper to house a criminal for life than to kill him. A dollar for a bullet, the minimal cost of the following police call, the minimal cost for the ambulance to haul the carcass off, the cost of an autopsy( it is unlikely one would be performed as a gun shot is already the known cause of death), the cost of the phone call to the deceased criminals family, and finally the cost of the criminals funeral. I would say all this could be done for around twenty thousand dollars, now how much is it going to cost to house a criminal for even twenty years, I dont know, but I do know it is a whole lot more than twenty thousand dollars. Plus you get a guarantee with a dead criminal, that guarantee is he wont be getting out after just a few of years and go right back to crime again, which costs society even more money. Its just better all the way around to kill them and be done with it, and no I am not saying we should kill all criminals, just the violent ones. Although if someone intrudes into my home at night, I have no way of knowing if he is just a simple thief or a violent criminal, I am probably going to shoot him.","death-penalty","05:09 PM","crime-debates","111"

Does it bring the victim back? NO! Is it vengeance instead of punishment? YES!! Is it more punishment to sit in prison till you die? YES! Is therr even a remote possibility that an innocent will be executed? YES!! If so, does the executioner differ from a hit man? NO!! Is that the value we want in our society? NO!! Are there other and better wyas of protecting society? YES!! YOUR TURN!!","death-penalty","05:11 PM","crime-debates","112"

Is there a chance for him to waste taxpayer money? OF COURSE HE CERTAINLY DOESN'T PAY FOR HIMSELF! Does he deserve to live? WELL HIS VICTIMS DID BUT THEY'RE KIND OF DEAD! Is his death going to impact society more than him living? NO! Is him living going to impact society? YES HE WASTES TAX MONEY THAT COULD BE GOING TO ACTUALLY HELP PEOPLE!

Seriously. How are you comparing death row to freaking political prisioners in other countries. Good freaking grief. Not only was that man 1. In another country he was also 2. Not a murderer *facepalms* Honestly you just redefined moronic.","death-penalty","06:41 PM","crime-debates","115"

Is there a special prison where they keep the murderers then, that prevents them from writing books? Or carrying out jobs that benefit society in other ways (as the book-writing isn't all that popular)? How about the murderers who are later found to be innocent? Do they stay locked in their cells? Do you always resort to bad ad homs when you feel threatened or confused?","death-penalty","08:11 PM","crime-debates","116"

If anyone used an ad hom it was you. Oh and so they wrote a book. So? How exactly do books written by death row inmates (that are guilty) benefit society? Seriously I'm dying to know. FYI I meant murders who were in no way innocent. You know DNA testing and video tape evidence rare, but still there. Ra forbid people you know pay for their actions >_> Maybe we should start buying little kids from other countries and giving them to pedophiles or letting thieves work in banks I mean they're still people aren't they? Or let them live in communities without warning parents. Or not punishing rapists because they just wanted to have sex. Its not there fault. >_> Weak just weak. With your lining of reasoning Hilter would have gotten life imprisonment with a TV, radio, good food and had a woman whenever he wanted.","death-penalty","05:04 PM","crime-debates","117"
