I honestly believe that if you commit an act such as cold blooded murder, then you deserve to be killed and taken out of the equation. It's not a sign of backward barbarianism that goes against a developmental society, that's just an excuse used by the bleeding hearts who are too wimpy to do anything but whine and cry. No, the death penalty is society as a whole voting that someone is far too dangerous to be allowed to remain in the country and deserves to be removed. That's what the death penalty is all about. In fact I'll go a step further and state that we're too lax with the death penalty, we need to make it more severe. I vote for massive reformation of the death penalty in areas of crime that relate to child rape. If you rape a child then you deserve more than anybody to be put down and eliminated forever. Hell, the only people that qualify as being worse than child rapists are genociders. If you rape a kid then you shouldn't be allowed to live. This is an offense that can't be defended or rationalized no matter what. Anybody that tries to defend a child rapist and say that they don't deserve to die needs a serious psychiatric evaluation.","death-penalty","03:38 PM","crime-debates","31"

"07-02-2008","11312",3,"None","None","None","iangb","314849","What you are suggesting isn't a penalty box, it's a permanent ban - and not just from the sport (human interaction, where laws come into play) but from spectating as well, with no chance of the ban being lifted should your foul be shown to be unsubstantiated. It strikes me as a little extreme.","death-penalty","08:43 PM","crime-debates","36"

These people are forbidden from ever having interactions of any sort, or even being anywhere near children for the rest of their lives. So why is death supposedly too extreme and out of the question?","death-penalty","08:51 PM","crime-debates","37"

One could argue that police shouldn't be armed with guns, because they sometimes wind up shooting people who were trying to get their wallet out to show them their identification, and the officer involved determined that instead they were reaching for a gun. Our justice system is based on the concept of ""innocent until proven guilty"", not ""innocent until proven guilty, unless new evidence proves innocence"".","death-penalty","09:01 PM","crime-debates","39"

So as long as only some innocent people are killed for crimes they didn't commit then the system must be sound. Okay! One could argue that, but one could also argue that when such accidents do happen then they should be thoroughly investigated to determine if proper procedure was followed. If not, then reparations should be made rather than the current situation that appears to think that one or too unnecessary deaths or beatings is just something that happens. But the problem is that the courts are not sufficiently careful enough to prove someone's guilt. If you can guarantee that all people convicted of crimes like child rape (with some exceptions), repeated 1st degree murder and such are absolutely, and without question, guilty then perhaps capital punishment should be allowed in some cases. But until you can say that your justice system doesn't make mistakes then you are walking a very dangerous line. To say that just a few innocent people are knocked off by your almost perfect system and that is just fine and dandy is very callous indeed. Smiley","death-penalty","09:14 PM","crime-debates","40"

What we have now is all that we've got, yes there's going to be human error involved, but that's always going to be the case. So just take the lumps and deal with it as best possible. Human error can't ever be eliminated. It's something that's just going to keep on existing, so we just have to accept that fact and work with it. Some exceptions? Are you saying some child rapists don't deserve to die? It's all we have. We have to accept the risks that're involved. That's what lawyers and appeals are for, to try and keep accidents to a minimum. As said before, it's all we've got, we have to accept the risks and limitations as just being something that can't be avoided.","death-penalty","09:35 PM","crime-debates","41"

Perhaps I'm wrong, but that is the impression you give. As for the some exceptions bit, yes that is exactly what I am saying. I can think of one case (I can't find the damn thing to quote) which pretty much fits the bill (though I will admit not quite). There was one of these paedophile 'name and shame' things where the names of paedophiles in a community were officially released and one 'good citizen' decided that it would be right and just to go round killing those named (I know it's not the same as official execution but bear with me). One of those named had had concentual sex with a girl of 15 (apparently looked old enough and claimed to be). The charge was rape (as she was not old enough to concent). He was murdered in his own home for a mistake he made that he regretted deeply when he found out what he'd done. As I say this case does not fit the bill completely, but I'm sure similar cases must arise and they should be an exception. All cases should be judged on their own merits. You can't just say everyone in this or that group should die. Smiley","death-penalty","09:51 PM","crime-debates","42"

Therefore we have to accept the limitations and accept them and work with them, there's no way around it. If it was his idea to have sex then he should've gone to better lengths to make sure she was of legal age. If it was her idea to have sex then she should be charged with seducing unwitting men and luring them into an illegal trap.","death-penalty","12:24 AM","crime-debates","44"

That may be so, but it does nothing to answer the problem. Did he deserve to die for his crime? Smiley","death-penalty","08:30 AM","crime-debates","45"
