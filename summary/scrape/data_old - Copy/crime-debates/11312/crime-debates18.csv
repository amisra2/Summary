He was GUILLOTINED. Do we need other reasons to refuse death penalty? I don't see how we could think of it as a viable way. I understand people whose family have been victim of murder, though I cannot take their place. Sometimes I think about the way I might react if I had to face such a situation, and I can imagine unexpected thoughts and pulses can come to mind. But even when a crime is obvious and there is no doubt about the guilt of one man or woman, we cannot kill people who kill people, it just doesn't make any sense to me. I may sound a little bit bigot but I'm not even a religious person. I just feel that it's BAD.","death-penalty","11:05 AM","crime-debates","256"

Innocent people die every day because of government neglect, malfeasance, corruption, etc. I'm also certain there are many innocent inmates who die, but aren't executed, while incarcerated. Such deaths don't vitiate the rectitude of punishment. You feel better sparing the life of a murderer than you feel when you kill him. Fair enough. That's a good reason to oppose executions. I feel better putting them down, however, because an execution is a fitting response to the crime of murder.","death-penalty","12:24 PM","crime-debates","257"

To know that other innocent people die for other reasons doesn't change the fact that a mistake is a mistake. Once the guy's dead, there's no way to correct the mistake. That's what's awful about death penalty; it's sometimes the right to kill innocent people, wether it happens often or not, and most of all, with the permission of the law itself. The amount of people dying for other reasons (like the ones you mentioned, rightfully so) cannot, by any mean, change this. At least, they can have a chance to survive, may it be very little. If they're executed, there is no question about it, it's too late. I understand this, and that's what I meant when I mentioned the ""bad thoughts"". I understand the eye-for-an-eye mechanism.

Would you accept this risk if the innocent victim was your child or your parent? Not only do I think otherwise, but reality always shows that violence begets violence, pain begets pain. I don't think it's only a pretty formula. That's what was meant in the ""comic"" strip I've joined to my last post, if you were able to see it. It seems that all the people in history who have been sentenced to death didn't constitute a strong deterrent enough. Nothing has changed, people still kill other people. Besides being horrific, this is teaching violence instead of reasoning. It has been clearly understood that such a thing must not be done to the children.

You will harden as you get older. Or after you get mugged. Whichever comes first. Yes, of course. We all do. Nonviolence also begets violence. I am not opposed to violence. I simply want citizens to obey the law. I don't read French very well, but I got the gist of it. What goes around comes around. Oui. Vraiment. I got it. Left out of the cartoon is any mention of capital punishment's benefits to the commonweal. This is a tired and discredited argument. The purpose of punishment isn't to deter all crime. It's to deter at least one person from committing a crime. If you've deterred only one, the punishment for the crime is effective. Most people would commit murder if there was no law against it. IF most people were incapable of murder, we would not need murder laws. That people do commit murder, notwitstanding the law, is all the more reason to punish them as harshly as possible. It's the ultimate crime begging for the ultimate punishment. Those with violent tendencies, including children, aren't open to reason. They do, however, respond to palpable threats to their own survival.","death-penalty","10:30 AM","crime-debates","261"
"03-19-2010","11312",18,"olivortex","395375","I don't understand how you can accept the risk of having a child or a parent killed for no reason. We don't all accept this because I don't. you'd like to have public executions to deter other potential murderers that would pass by? (by the way, even in the case the sentenced person is innocent?) Come on. We don't have death penalty no more in France, so are we killing each other? Murders are pretty rare here if you look at the population figures. Yes they are. since when giving public execution is a better way than reason when it comes to deal with... violence? TV violence and sex has a bad influence on children Children reproduce everything. Beat your child hard and he will likely do the same to his own offspring. Reproducing a reasoned reaction to a violent situation is better than reproducing violent acts, wether motivated by ""justice"" or not.","josephdphillips","395379","But there is a reason -- justice. There is little difference between executing someone and putting him in prison for the rest of his life with no chance of parole. You think about the unfortunate soul who is truly innocent of murder and executed anyway. For that one who shouldn't be executed there are hundreds or thousands who should be. As for the likelihood that either of my two children is wrongly accused, tried, convicted of murder and denied every opportunity to exculpate him/herself -- that likelihood is negligible, as it is for most people. That low risk is one we all accept here in the United States, or at least in those states that have the death penalty. One does not have to witness an execution to be aware one took place. The point is to demonstrate social resolve against murder, something Americans do not currently do. Your rate of murder isn't low because you abolished capital punishment. The French feel the death penalty is no longer necessary. More power to you. I'm a Californian. I defend the death penalty here only. It doesn't matter to me whether other states, or other countries, have or don't have the death penalty. That said, however, there is no conclusive evidence demonstrating the deterrent effect of capital punishment. There are death penalty countries with a very low murder rate (China, Japan, Singapore, et al ) just as there are countries with no death penalty with similar murder rates. I do feel, however, it is safe to assume that at least one person is deterred from committing murder, because of the death penalty, who would otherwise commit murder without it. One person deterred is sufficient to justify a penalty of death, for murder, to me. You may have been mugged, and you have my condolences, but you do not live in Los Angeles, as I do. There are elementary school children here who commit murder. They have weapons more powerful than are used by the local police, and know how to use them. These monsters are not amenable to reason. They have already concluded that they're above the law. They are convinced that society lacks the will to stand up to them, and for the most part, they're right. Thugs only respect bigger thugs, Olivortex. The biggest thug has to be the state. That's nonsense. The gentlest people in the United States play the most violent video games. There's no association between fantasy games and violent behavior. I was beaten but never beat my children. I made a point of that. Why? If only your theory had any basis in fact. The fact is that violence and non-violence both beget violence. Antisocial behavior isn't learned. It's the end-result of a decision, the creation of an attitude. It is not the byproduct of too much self-esteem, not too little.","death-penalty","07:18 PM","crime-debates","263"
"03-19-2010","11312",18,"chester","326919","Why DO we kill people to teach peole that killing people is wrong? Can anyone answer? What purpose does executing them serve? Does it bring the victim back? NO! Is it vengeance instead of punishment? YES!! Is it more punishment to sit in prison till you die? YES! Is therr even a remote possibility that an innocent will be executed? YES!! If so, does the executioner differ from a hit man? NO!! Is that the value we want in our society? NO!! Are there other and better wyas of protecting society? YES!! YOUR TURN!!","Archangel","395383","That isn't why we execute murderers. We execute murderers in order to prevent them from murdering other innocents again. Some human beings have proven they have forfeited the right to continue to breathe the same air as civilized people, PERIOD!!! How many thousands of examples could we dig up from just the American Penal system when convicted killers served part of their sentence and were released early or on good behavior, or because of over crowded Prisons, and proceeded to murder someone else, yet again! It happens all of the time with all kinds of serious criminals from killers to rapists to child molesters. Recidivism is not some theoretical concept which requires a lengthy study to confirm; it is a known reality with every type of crime committed and is the reason murderers and those who commit serious crimes against people deserve the death penalty before they can slip through a broken legal system and recommit.","death-penalty","10:11 PM","crime-debates","264"

You asked yourself a question... and then avoided your own question ? That's... phenomenal. ...see Mandela. You've also ignored most of the questions posed to you.","Archangel","395385","For you to even bring Mandela up in this debate proves how incredibly dishonest you are iangb. Mandela wasn't a convicted murderer or a violent man at all. He was a political prisoner who stood against a tyrannical and oppressive Government. So what does he have to do with a debate like this about murderers and the death penalty? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!","death-penalty","10:19 PM","crime-debates","265"
"03-21-2010","11312",18,"iangb","395415","Please come back when you know a little more about the relevant history. Nelson Mandela - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia might be a good place to start.","Archangel","395464","You act as if because he was accused and convicted of crimes by the oppressive Government which was persecuting blacks, that he was deserving of such harsh treatment. But even those sources don't say he was guilty of violence against any persons. The South African courts convicted him on charges of sabotage, as well as other crimes committed while he led the movement against apartheid. In accordance with his conviction's sentence, Mandela served 27 years in prison, spending many of these years on Robben Island. I marvel that you who would defend against murderers being executed by a Government would support a non violent activist receiving 27 years in Prison by an oppressive Government regime which was racist according to the rest of the civilized world? Where is the consistency of your world view as you now defend the policies of Apartheid when you claim Mandela deserved the punishment he received for standing against the injustices that Government subjected its black african citizens to? Fellow ANC member Wolfie Kadesh explains the bombing campaign led by Mandela: ""When we knew that we [sic] going to start on 16 December 1961, to blast the symbolic places of apartheid, like pass offices, native magistrates courts, and things like that ... post offices and ... the government offices. But we were to do it in such a way that nobody would be hurt, nobody would get killed.","death-penalty","06:42 AM","crime-debates","267"

But Mandela's tactics were to 'make South Africa ungovernable' through terrorist acts. You can call them 'freedom fighters' if you'd like, but that doesn't change the violence that was used. As for the source I quoted... have the quote that you must have missed the first time around. Mandela became leader of the ANC's armed wing , Umkhonto we Sizwe (translated Spear of the Nation, and also abbreviated MK), which he co-founded .[32] He coordinated sabotage campaigns against military and government targets, making plans for a possible guerrilla war if the sabotage failed to end apartheid Mandela described the move to armed struggle as a last resort; years of increasing repression and violence from the state convinced [Mandela] that many years of non-violent protest against apartheid had not and could not achieve any progress. He did it with some of the best reasons there are for turning to violence. But that doesn't change the fact that he did it. All of this, incidentally, is becoming rapidly off-topic. Mandela proves that someone imprisoned for violent acts (even if that's mainly for political purposes) can still be a positive contributor to society. Yes, there are some people who will never contribute to society again - some of those people may even be murderers.

If he had been a murderer or could have been convicted of it, the Government would have gladly executed him as a killer. But since they couldn't justify that action, they attempted to lock him up and throw away the key until the public outcry for his release became an international cause celeb. Those are the facts pertaining to Nelson Mandela so implying that he was a convicted murderer yet a positive social force is fallacious since the real criminal was the Government and its policies which he opposed with the ANC.","death-penalty","12:30 PM","crime-debates","269"

By the way, in some prison, there are people who learn things, and can develop a sort of life, though it's not comparable to a regular one. No matter what kind of life it is, if it's bearable, it's always better than death. That is what I cannot understand, I mean the relation you make between the innocent and the murderers (those who should be executed and those who are not). Innocent people have nothing to do with the guilty, therefore they should not pay, in any way, the price for others. Of course I wish you not to face such a situation ever. I still wonder how this risk can be accepted. Justice is not perfect, as you said, since it's a human enterprise, I got it, but its goal is to propose the best system possible. If you start from the principle that mistakes leading to death of innocent people can be made, even at a very low percentage, it's letting entrance to some random factor, an unbearable thing when it comes to life and death. That makes me think about the competitive examination you can do to get a job, which puts most people on a quite equal ground; but some propose a fistful of jobs for some thousands candidates. The system still works, but there are some external factors that come into account when the jury has to choose eventually among the best ones. Sometimes there is no way to distinct them except chosing the one who has the best tie or the most beautiful legs. Even in this case, I find random factors quite acceptable, because if you don't get this job, you can try to get another one. When the ""bad luck"" factor takes care of you when you're judged for a murder you did not commit, I still don't see how you can accept it. Well, I know I'm a little redundant here, but you talk about the probability of this happening to your children as if it were a normal thing, and that's beyond me. I get your point. I didn't say that. We're on Internet and I just thought it's a good thing to think worldwide but it's ok. I never visited the states. Here (and you threw me the line of course) we have come to a connected topic that allows me (not too heavily) to say that the absence of weapons in my country is a powerful way to avoid a higher murder rate. Violent agressions still happen, but do not lead to death as often as they do in, say, your state of California. Here we see and you already knew that before the means to solve a problem we can think of the means to avoid them. It sounds a little too easy to say, but what gave birth to the monsters, actually? You gave a bit of the answer. Caution, I don't support any violence on the pretext of poverty, segregation , etc, but I can understand how it happens. You nailed it In a way, I can't contradict you, because it's a known fact that power makes you a thug, generally. But it would be smarter to act in a wise way and not as a thug, because, yes, what goes around comes around. I agree for the first part, but the second is more discutable. I can see how people in general, and more importantly the children get used to violence through its representation. Just like some people view sexual practice through extreme movies, when it's totally remote from what people need and want. I know of course that I can distinguish a movie or a game and reality, but I have observed how some images leave marks on a child's mind. There are, also, the famous videos displaying children going literally mad because of a failure at a video game. There is an association in that sense, not all the people have a a resistant mind enough not to be influenced at all by these media. Because you have been smart enough to make your own personnality and to find your own way of raising them. For this you have my congratulations but we are not all the same. You seem to interpret a more reasoned sentence (that is, not death penalty) as a sign of weakness. Violence and non-violence are not equals. Education is supposed to give people the tools to live together in peace when the conditions allow them to. Education is the first thing. Death penalty is at the end. I didn't get that one.","death-penalty","06:03 AM","crime-debates","270"
