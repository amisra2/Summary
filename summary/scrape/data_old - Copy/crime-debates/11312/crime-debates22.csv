They should get rid of it, as a thing of the past.","NATO 556","416227","Japan and China still embrace the death penalty. They have absolutely no problem using it. If you're in Japan they'll hang you. If you're in China, they've got their own mobile death chamber on wheels that'll come to you and deliver a lethal injection. Are you going to tell them to do away with it as well? Or are you going to claim that it's wrong to try and tell other countries that they should change their practices? You can have a peaceful society and the death penalty at the same time. It's not an impossibility.","death-penalty","10:48 PM","crime-debates","316"
"11-08-2010","11312",22,"smiley","314869","You seem all to willing to accept what we have and not even try to improve it. Perhaps I'm wrong, but that is the impression you give. As for the some exceptions bit, yes that is exactly what I am saying. I can think of one case (I can't find the damn thing to quote) which pretty much fits the bill (though I will admit not quite). There was one of these paedophile 'name and shame' things where the names of paedophiles in a community were officially released and one 'good citizen' decided that it would be right and just to go round killing those named (I know it's not the same as official execution but bear with me). One of those named had had concentual sex with a girl of 15 (apparently looked old enough and claimed to be). The charge was rape (as she was not old enough to concent). He was murdered in his own home for a mistake he made that he regretted deeply when he found out what he'd done. As I say this case does not fit the bill completely, but I'm sure similar cases must arise and they should be an exception. All cases should be judged on their own merits. You can't just say everyone in this or that group should die. Smiley","stephena","416595","What about Al-Quadia? They should all die! And the victims will know that their attacker will never hurt them again now that they are dead. I rest my case. P.S. Hi NATO!!","death-penalty","05:41 PM","crime-debates","317"

There's not a thing in the world that can be done to make the system perfect and foolproof, and guarantee that the innocent will never suffer wrongly in the pursuit of justice. We have to accept this as a simple fact of reality and deal with it. But that doesn't mean we should let the fear of an innocent being punished, be sufficient enough to stagnate the entire justice system and undo hundreds of years of set precedent. There's no justification for it.","death-penalty","09:18 AM","crime-debates","319"

That said, this is a seriously a disturbing statement. What if the innocent is YOU? The idea is that if there is reasonable doubt, you are not proven guilty. If we can't be absolutely sure, there are options besides the death penalty. Are we really this blood-thirsty? That the side of JUSTICE is willing to sacrifice the innocent to kill? Justice is not vengence.","death-penalty","11:00 PM","crime-debates","325"

I would not invade other countries and topple governments in order to do so, however. The death penalty is not peaceful.
