Like I said, certain factors are what determine the usage of the death penalty. Our justice system might be flawed to some degree, but for the most part it works well.

The people who qualify for the death penalty are charged with committing some considerably heinous crime(s) that society has deemed unacceptable.

So I have a solution, how would you feel about a convicted rapist being casterated along with his prison sentence, then upon release he is not likely to repeat the crime. How would you feel about a convicted murderer having his hands removed along with his sentence, and upon his release he can no longer use deadly weapons such as guns or knives to murder again, although a knife is questionable due to modern prosthetics. And how would you feel about a child rapist having to be casterated, plus undergo very painful mental conditioning that will keep him from repeating his crime, plus his sentence in prison, plus the mental conditioning will continue for the duration of his life after release. And drug dealers who give or sell to children, how would you feel about making them do so much of their own poison, that it scrambles their brains, basically turning them into a vegetable, and no longer able to repeat their crime, and although society would have to care for them, would it be anymore costly than if they were in prison.

How can you possibly view this as justice, you can not. You seem to advocate criminal rights while opposing rights for the victim. A child who is raped, should that child survive the attack, will suffer emotionally and mentally for the rest of their life, and in some cases, if the child is a female, she can not have children as a result of the attack. So then why shouldnt the criminal who caused this also be made to suffer greatly as well, and since our judicial system is not going to do this, then somebody else should.
