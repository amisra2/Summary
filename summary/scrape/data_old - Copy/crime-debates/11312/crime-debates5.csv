More murders are committed by black-on-black violence. And more people who are on death row are white! Uhhh yes it is and it should!! You mean that we all should be coddling prisoners?? What about the crime victims??","jitobear","315465","Actually, it isn't. I agree, technology is helping - but there are still errors happening. I am not talking about the race of the perps, but the race of the victims - nor do you discuss my point about inequities in representation. I disagree. Where did I say that? There are options in between coddling and death. They are not served in any way by the death penalty (outside of vengeance, which I already stated I do not feel should be the business of government). I have been a victim of rape and if I were a victim of murder I would not desire the death penalty for the perpetrator.","death-penalty","11:48 AM","crime-debates","62"

"09-29-2008","11312",5,"Omegamon_X","314863","I refuse to believe that a perfect justice system, where only the truly guilty are punished, will ever exist, and I refuse to hold out for such a concept and reserve all cases for something that'll never happen. What we have now is all that we've got, yes there's going to be human error involved, but that's always going to be the case. So just take the lumps and deal with it as best possible.","chester","325564","You would hold out if the wrongly accused and convicted individual were a member of your family, I'm sure. Why is it that the same ones who hold to the, ""Fry 'em"" mantra in the abstract suddenly change their tune when it's a family member on the line?","death-penalty","08:25 AM","crime-debates","64"

I think he was trying to say that there are some inherent and intrinsic fundamentals of the justice system that are natural and unchangeable. I do agree that reform needs to be obtained in our justice system, but that does not include scrapping a viable form of punishment for crimes and criminals that are both found unacceptable to societies base standards. If that involves a few statistical errors, so be it. Yes, I could perhaps ""change my tune"" if I believed that my family member was innocent. However, if I thought they were guilty of such crimes...""fry 'em"". That is what intelligent and civlized people who believe in the death penalty do. We seek to understand the truth, and may or may not like the reality that it deals, but we accept it as the most noble search for justice that man may seek. I am willing to accept that some innocent people will fall victim, even potentially a family member. I might never be able to forgive those who failed to bring find the truth in the case of the innocent, but I accept the system just the same.","death-penalty","10:07 AM","crime-debates","65"

The execution/judicial murder of a single innocent party makes my government complicit in that murder. That's why I seek to change the system instead of merely accepting it.","death-penalty","04:14 PM","crime-debates","66"
"10-03-2008","11312",5,"None","None","None","Ethmi","326145","A great error is where people assume that the intention of execution is to send the message ""Murder is wrong"". I personally believe that execution can keep a violent criminal from harming inmates who committed a less serious crime. If they have a history of killing other inmates, do we just let the killing continue, or do we stop them?","death-penalty","10:18 AM","crime-debates","67"

Joliet and Florence are good examples. From the day he arrived to the day he died, John Gotti did not kill another person. To date, the Unibomber has not killed another person.","death-penalty","10:45 AM","crime-debates","68"
"10-04-2008","11312",5,"None","None","None","grizzly6626","326345","Well I have wished for years that upon the conviction of a violent criminal, and after all appeals have failed, that the convicted violent criminal be handed over to the victims next of kin, and the punisnment and type of punishment be decided and carried out by the victims next of kin. In other words, if a man raped and killed my wife, once the man was tried and convicted, and after all of his appeals have failed, the state should hand him over to me to do with him as I see fit. Dont ask me what I would do if this happened, because you might not like my answer. I just think the family of victoms would get more closure, and more of a sense of justice if this were allowed. If the victim lives through the ordeal, then the victim decides the criminals fate.","death-penalty","06:16 PM","crime-debates","69"

Do you deny that there are thousands of criminals who kill other inmates in prison? Often, it's inmates who committed crimes that aren't considered to be worthy of death. I'd rather see a murderer die than a person killed because he was carrying a gun without a CCW.","death-penalty","09:30 PM","crime-debates","72"

You want to return to the days of the Germanic Weregeld .(You kill one of mine, then I'll kill one of yours.)

My point was that there are ways of dealing with violent criminals, murderers even, without executing them.

"10-04-2008","11312",5,"Archangel","326349","You two truly make me sick. Here you are boldly arguing against executing convicted murderers as you argue just as fervently to insure the right to murder perfectly innocent unborn children who have never hurt a soul. And you're so twisted, you believe it is the mothers right to kill her own child.","chester","326354","As though one had anything to do with the other.","death-penalty","09:41 PM","crime-debates","75"
