Obviously, this is an undesirable outcome. There have been cases of convicted murderers who have been released from prison for one reason or another and went on to kill again. This arises from a failure in the justice system or a moronic judge who thinks he is being humanitarian by seeing past the violent history of a convicted felon.

"06-26-2008","11312",1,"None","None","None","Another opinion","314256","Though I would not call the death penalty murder, I am personally against it. I see it mainly as state sanctioned and state administered vengeance. Though I admit that, if a loved one would be brutally killed, my anger and grief would probably drive me to want such vengeance as well, I don't think we should set social policy based on our most instinctive emotions but on rational reasons. So, what are some of the reasons why we impose various types of punishments on criminal offenders? 1) Protecting the public. This, I think, is the most important. A serious violent offender that runs a high risk of offending again should be kept locked away from the public for however long such risk exists. The justice system too often fails us in this. It may not be an easy job to judge which criminals will continue to be high risks, but I think the justice system could do a better job than it is currently doing. Often enough, a life sentence needs to really be just that - a LIFE sentence with no opportunity for release. Where the death penalty is concerned, as long as high risk prisoners are truly kept to a life sentence, then the requirement for protecting the public is kept and there is no need to kill them. 2) Punishment to rehabilitate the prisoner to be capable of reentering society safely . This has always led to mixed results. For some prisoners, punishment will deter them from ever committing another major crime. For others, it is irrelevant. Either way, even if it is not 100% effective, it is worth the effort to try to rehabilitate prisoners just for the sake of the majority that will not become repeat offenders. Where the death penalty is concerned, it is irrelevant to speak of rehabilitation since any lessons the criminal learns from that sentence will be moot since he will never re-enter society - he will be dead. This is partly true for life sentences as well. 3) Deterrence. The statistics about the effectiveness of the death penalty in deterring crimes are very mixed and seem inconclusive. Statistical studies made by various groups often show opposite conclusions. Unless there can be solid uncontestable evidence shown that the death penalty is significant in deterring crime, this cannot be used as an argument for the death penalty. 4) Restoration - i.e. righting the wrong For example, a vandal might be made to clean up the mess he has made. Though this happens to some degree for minor offenses, it doesn't seem to be followed too much for higher level offenses. Either way, this is irrelevant for the death penalty. What, really, does the death of the perpetrator give to the grieving family besides a sense of satisfaction of vengeance?","death-penalty","10:34 AM","crime-debates","11"

According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, murder is defined as the crime of unlawfully killing a person especially with malice aforethought. Executing somebody is not an unlawful killing so therefore it is not murder. As far as your second point goes, we cannot begin to dish out punishments based on what people might do. This is the same argument people in favor of gun control use: ""Criminals might steal a gun and use it in a crime so we should ban guns."" It's impossible to say for sure that a person sentenced to life in prison is going to ""kill several other inmates who committed less serious crimes."" That is not a valid argument in favor of executing them. They shouldn't, but they do. The current incarnation of the death penalty allows this to occur. While I am not against execution, I would rather see tax dollars go to something a bit more useful than trying to execute one person. Once is too much. Although, personally, I would rather be executed if I was innocent than sit in a cell for life. That is not a provable statement. You are simply speculating on what might occur based on the fact that some prisoners have killed each other in the past. You are acting like this is a regular occurrence. Can you link me 1 story where a person thrown in prison for carrying a gun illegally was murdered in prison? People are killed in prisons, but you are acting like the inmates just run around offing one another because they don't have anything better to do.

You seem to forget that there are many ways to isolate the most dangerous criminals - from solitary confinement in regular prisons to supermax prisons that place very stringent controls on their prisoners. Killing them is not the only option for exercising final control on their actions. Also, the prisoners who might otherwise qualify for the death penalty are not the only ones that commit crimes while in prison. Criminals who have been convicted of lesser crimes, such as theft, also often show brutality, even murder, in prison. Would you execute them all? Instead, the prison systems should do a better job of identifying the worse inner-prison troublemakers to begin with and isolating them or controling them more.","death-penalty","10:04 AM","crime-debates","15"

That is the argument gun control advocates make. You are making the same argument. CRIMINALS might commit another crime once they go to jail, so they should be executed. Once again, the point I am making is that we cannot begin to dish out punishments based on what somebody might do. If you disagree with this particular point, please explain why. Also, check out the movie Minority Report. I agree. It just doesn't happen like this. One is murder and one is an execution. I thought we went over this already. The states can't stop every murder from occurring, but they can stop every execution. Another Opinion addressed this already.

No, the death penalty is society as a whole voting that someone is far too dangerous to be allowed to remain in the country and deserves to be removed. That's what the death penalty is all about. In fact I'll go a step further and state that we're too lax with the death penalty, we need to make it more severe. I vote for massive reformation of the death penalty in areas of crime that relate to child rape. If you rape a child then you deserve more than anybody to be put down and eliminated forever. Hell, the only people that qualify as being worse than child rapists are genociders. If you rape a kid then you shouldn't be allowed to live.

And as far as thinking about this a lot, that is a false assumption on your part, but how does one not have feelings on this as I see it on the news almost daily. So what is one supposed to do if a criminal violently attacks a member of his family, just sit idly back and watch a soft judicial system set the criminal free after a short stay in prison, or get off on a technicality because the arresting officer didnt use proper punctuation in the report. How can you possibly view this as justice, you can not. You seem to advocate criminal rights while opposing rights for the victim. A child who is raped, should that child survive the attack, will suffer emotionally and mentally for the rest of their life, and in some cases, if the child is a female, she can not have children as a result of the attack. So then why shouldnt the criminal who caused this also be made to suffer greatly as well, and since our judicial system is not going to do this, then somebody else should.

You all seem to think that everyone who has a gun is the same, but that is not true. People who have guns or knives can either be good or evil, but not both. I have had an assault rifle pulled on me in the past by a violent criminal, that is one reason I am so keen on the idea of arming as many lawfull people as possible. Let me ask you this, has putting criminals in prison slowed the rate of crime down. Do you feel safe knowing that if you are facing a guy with a gun, and he is going to possibly kill you, that his going to jail is going to save your life. Do you believe a violent criminal is somehow going to stop what he is intending on doing to you so you can call the police, he is going to kill you graveyard dead, no questions asked. People should and do have the legal and moral right to defend their lives with lethal force if neccessary. One last question, if you were in a convienience store getting gas or a coke, and a violent criminal came in and shot the clerk, and before the criminal could eliminate you as a witness to the crime, one of the other customers in the store shoots the criminal dead, and you learn the guy who just made sure you lived was an NRA member with a carry concealed licsense, would you tell that man that you dont think he should have a gun, or preach to him about how bad guns are in anybodys hands.

It's not a sign of backward barbarianism that goes against a developmental society, that's just an excuse used by the bleeding hearts who are too wimpy to do anything but whine and cry. No, the death penalty is society as a whole voting that someone is far too dangerous to be allowed to remain in the country and deserves to be removed. That's what the death penalty is all about. In fact I'll go a step further and state that we're too lax with the death penalty, we need to make it more severe. I vote for massive reformation of the death penalty in areas of crime that relate to child rape. If you rape a child then you deserve more than anybody to be put down and eliminated forever. Hell, the only people that qualify as being worse than child rapists are genociders. If you rape a kid then you shouldn't be allowed to live.

If you start from the principle that mistakes leading to death of innocent people can be made, even at a very low percentage, it's letting entrance to some random factor, an unbearable thing when it comes to life and death. That makes me think about the competitive examination you can do to get a job, which puts most people on a quite equal ground; but some propose a fistful of jobs for some thousands candidates. The system still works, but there are some external factors that come into account when the jury has to choose eventually among the best ones. Sometimes there is no way to distinct them except chosing the one who has the best tie or the most beautiful legs. Even in this case, I find random factors quite acceptable, because if you don't get this job, you can try to get another one. When the ""bad luck"" factor takes care of you when you're judged for a murder you did not commit, I still don't see how you can accept it. Well, I know I'm a little redundant here, but you talk about the probability of this happening to your children as if it were a normal thing, and that's beyond me. I get your point.

Here (and you threw me the line of course) we have come to a connected topic that allows me (not too heavily) to say that the absence of weapons in my country is a powerful way to avoid a higher murder rate. Violent agressions still happen, but do not lead to death as often as they do in, say, your state of California. Here we see and you already knew that before the means to solve a problem we can think of the means to avoid them. It sounds a little too easy to say, but what gave birth to the monsters, actually? You gave a bit of the answer. Caution, I don't support any violence on the pretext of poverty, segregation , etc, but I can understand how it happens. You nailed it In a way, I can't contradict you, because it's a known fact that power makes you a thug, generally. But it would be smarter to act in a wise way and not as a thug, because, yes, what goes around comes around. I agree for the first part, but the second is more discutable. I can see how people in general, and more importantly the children get used to violence through its representation. Just like some people view sexual practice through extreme movies, when it's totally remote from what people need and want. I know of course that I can distinguish a movie or a game and reality, but I have observed how some images leave marks on a child's mind. There are, also, the famous videos displaying children going literally mad because of a failure at a video game. There is an association in that sense, not all the people have a a resistant mind enough not to be influenced at all by these media. Because you have been smart enough to make your own personnality and to find your own way of raising them. For this you have my congratulations but we are not all the same. You seem to interpret a more reasoned sentence (that is, not death penalty) as a sign of weakness. Violence and non-violence are not equals.

If you start from the principle that mistakes leading to death of innocent people can be made, even at a very low percentage, it's letting entrance to some random factor, an unbearable thing when it comes to life and death. That makes me think about the competitive examination you can do to get a job, which puts most people on a quite equal ground; but some propose a fistful of jobs for some thousands candidates. The system still works, but there are some external factors that come into account when the jury has to choose eventually among the best ones. Sometimes there is no way to distinct them except chosing the one who has the best tie or the most beautiful legs. When the ""bad luck"" factor takes care of you when you're judged for a murder you did not commit, I still don't see how you can accept it. Well, I know I'm a little redundant here, but you talk about the probability of this happening to your children as if it were a normal thing, and that's beyond me. the absence of weapons in my country is a powerful way to avoid a higher murder rate. Violent agressions still happen, but do not lead to death as often as they do in, say, your state of California. Here we see and you already knew that before the means to solve a problem we can think of the means to avoid them. what gave birth to the monsters, actually? You gave a bit of the answer. I don't support any violence on the pretext of poverty, segregation , etc, but I can understand how it happens. it's a known fact that power makes you a thug, generally. But it would be smarter to act in a wise way and not as a thug, because, yes, what goes around comes around. children get used to violence through its representation. some people view sexual practice through extreme movies, when it's totally remote from what people need and want. I can distinguish a movie or a game and reality, but I have observed how some images leave marks on a child's mind. There are, also, the famous videos displaying children going literally mad because of a failure at a video game. There is an association in that sense, not all the people have a a resistant mind enough not to be influenced at all by these media. Because you have been smart enough to make your own personnality and to find your own way of raising them. For this you have my congratulations but we are not all the same. You seem to interpret a more reasoned sentence (that is, not death penalty) as a sign of weakness. Violence and non-violence are not equals. Education is supposed to give people the tools to live together in peace when the conditions allow them to. Education is the first thing. Death penalty is at the end. I didn't get that one.","josephdphillips","395580","I don't want to rehabilitate murderers. I want to kill them. In a perfect world, yes, but I don't live in a perfect world. If one unintended result of capital punishment is an errant execution now and then, that's the price society, at least in California, is willing to pay. I live in an active earthquake zone. I accept the risk of dying every day. Actually, no, it's not. The goal is to achieve something that works. Perfect justice is neither attainable or desirable. It's quite bearable, thank you. The execution of innocents does not bother me. You're not making much sense here. It could be a lot worse. I accept the risk because it's too small to be worth considering. The chance of being wrongly executed by the state is negligible. I'd have to hit the royal in Las Vegas five times consecutively before I start worrying about one of my children being falsely accused of murder, wrongly convicted for the crime and mistakenly executed. Guns are part of American culture and always will be. There's a good reason for that. You French will give up wine and cheese before we give up firearms. What causes antisocial behavior is no big secret. It's the antisocial person himself. As I stated before, it's not upbringing or environment. It's simply a matter of attitude. You obviously didn't grow up poor. That argument can be used against all forms of law enforcement. By your logic we should not have any police, prisons, courts, etc. My problem isn't with thugs. It's with murderers. I'm not against violence. I am against malicious, premeditated homicide. That children are inured to violence isn't a bad thing. They should have an appreciation of violence and its consequences as early as possible. People don't need pornography to fantasize about sexual practices. They've been doing that for thousands of years, long before the advent of porn. Those are children that require more vigorous discipline. It's not the video games that are the problem. The children themselves are the problem. The media are not the problem. The children are the problem. I'm not that smart, and yes, we are the same. We each make choices. We each are responsible for our individual actions. That I accepted my responsibilities has to do with attitude, not intelligence. Yep. The death penalty educates the best. Of course, we do not exploit the educational value of capital punishment, as we should. The uneducated are mostly law-abiding and extremely few of them commit acts of murder. Education is not the answer. Harsh, unyielding and merciless punishment is the answer. It is often said that low self-esteem makes one angry and can make one violent. That may be true for people who act out, using their fists or who grab stacks of dishes and throw them to the floor. That is not true about people who murder. The extremely violent are sociopaths, in love with themselves, and hold themselves to be above the law.","death-penalty","12:40 PM","crime-debates","272"

What I say is that guns are a fast and easy way to kill people (even when you don't intend to, by the way). Bombings don't happen very often, on a large time scale. Gun murders are frequent. Yes. No. It seems Jack the Ripper was a serial killer, a psychopath. I don't see the point you're making here. They seem to be saying that assault weapons' chance to be restricted are higher because of their looks. I assume you're telling the truth, though I can't find a document to confirm it online. Here I join you to say we live in a world of contradiction and hypocrisy. I didn't found the Violence Policy Center. Anyway I don't see why they would cheat on figures, even less if they are an organisation that sells guns. France makes lots of weapons and sells it to other countries, but Jacques Chirac was against war in Iraq and had a generally peaceful discourse. In my country we have a quite easy access to some vaccins and all kinds of medecine that are not available in other countries of the third world. So yeah, if you can remove the cause, you won't have the effect. How come there is no way? Who says cars will last as long as man exists? I know the car market is strong and impossible to ignore today but it doesn't mean it will last forever. Forever is a long time, and nothing prevents us from making some effort to start the change. How come guns are not available in France the same way they are in a considerable number of states in the States? I have understood guns are part of american culture, but it's not a reason to think they can't be removed. Things change. Who's whining and crying? I'm just sharing my point of view on the topic. And to be more on topic, I consider death penalty as legal murder.","NATO 556","395917","So what would you suggest a ban on next? Then don't use them unless you're fully prepared to kill if its necessary. These aren't toys you know. They happen often enough. And death by AIDS are more frequent and common than both. Ignorance. First you admitted it was the people who did the killing, now you're saying that the people aren't a problem but instead their hardware is. I'm really glad you said this. Now we've established (and you've admitted) that there are people in the world who would kill even if you took away their tools. Now that we've got this point established, what exactly is your answer to them being in the general public? And how do we as citizens protect ourselves against them? You said you don't believe that the VPC would cheat, that they'd be honest about their agenda and not use trickery. And here we've got the head guy saying that because of a weapon's appearance, the public's interest can be exploited into support for a useless law. https://www.atfonline.gov/fflezcheck...5Pp7ftolbGmkTy Right from the mouth of the ATF. Your attitude suggests naivety about the world and how it works. Theirs is an organization founded on fear and political agenda. They support gun bans, not gun ownership. The facts of the real world don't support their message of fear, so they have to come up with a load of BS to shape the figures into what they say they are. Take for example how they said 95% of all guns in Mexico came from the United States. What they'll never tell you is that 95% of the fraction that Mexico turned over for the ATF to trace came from the United States. But they refused to turn over most of the confiscated weapons for tracing purposes. There's a difference between the Violence Policy Center and France. The VPC is actively calling for a ban on guns and using fear and trickery to try and further their message. And on the flipside they have an FFL license, which only applies to businesses that intend to sell guns. So why would they have a business license to deal in the buying and selling of guns, when they're calling for public support of more and more weapons restrictions? That would be like Obama wanting to see segregation brought back against black people. Except for the fact that such isn't realistic or possible. If you've even got France in the business of the arms trade, playing an active role, then you're gonna be hard pressed to get any country to stop making and selling weapons. Even if you could, you'd never be able to find, confiscate and destroy them all. There's always going to be enough left that somebody will be able to make more based on existing specimens. Guns have been around since at least the 1500s and in continuous production, made by the millions since their creation by people in all manner of shops and locations either with or without regulation. And that's just the ones the governments know about. Let's see the car industry compare to that. That's like the city of Chicago implementing their gun ban in hopes that other cities would follow their example. It simply doesn't work and it's pointless to make the attempt. It's a waste of time and resources that could be better spent focusing on dealing with the people most likely to offend. Because France chose to surrender. Just because things can change, doesn't mean that they should change. There's no reason to believe that we need to look for ways to implement a general gun ban of any sort. You qualify as the crier of the discussion since you still support the mentality of ""If guns didn't exist."" There's no such thing as legal murder, since murder is illegal by nature.

This raises questions, it doesn't provide answers. a) Does the death penalty encourage murders? b) Does the presence of large numbers of murderers encourage use of the death penalty? c) Does a third factor encourage both murder and death penalties (e.g. a culture which places little value on human life? poor quality of education? high immigration?). It takes either a dishonest person or a fool to state the correlation as if it proved a point. Usually a dishonest person to state it first, and then fools to repeat it ad nauseum.","death-penalty","05:36 AM","crime-debates","308"

I hope I don't look like a fool or a dishonest person, since I didn't state any causation from use of death penalty to higher murder rates. My point was to show that states with death penalties can have, as observed, higher murder rates. Of course, thinking the cause of these higher rates is death penalty is / would be a mistake.

It's purpose is punishment of a crime so heinous in nature that no developed nation would ever consider keeping the perpetrator around. It speaks very poorly for a nation if they refuse to kill the worst of the worst, and instead choose to house them and shelter them for the rest of their natural lives. Anybody who would abolish the death penalty isn't looking at the bigger picture; they're too hung up on forgiveness and impotence to do the right thing.","death-penalty","10:24 PM","crime-debates","310"

It's not necessarily a matter of forgiveness; there are some acts I wouldn't be able to forgive. And also, what if somebody kills for revenge? Is he/she going to be considered as the worst of the worst? People sometimes take revenge themselves without waiting for official justice decisions. I don't say it's a good thing, but it happens. You might say that if justice applies death penalty properly, this won't happen, but we know it would anyway, because murderers are not always caught. So, people seeking revenge could be seen as legitimate. But if you kill the murderer by your own means, it makes you a murderer to the eyes of justice. I don't want to be too heavy on that point but you see what I mean. The famous vicious circle. Mmm, I think I've already mentioned revenge in an earlier post, so I'll try not to repeat myself too much.","death-penalty","03:15 AM","crime-debates","311"

But if the revenge killing is in the style done by gang bangers who feel the need to murder someone because they showed them disrespect, then that might put them in the worst category. If you're willing to XXXX somebody away because they dissed you in front of your homies and made you lose your street cred, that's a very poor excuse for murdering somebody, their friends, their family, etc. Wouldn't you agree? Such disregard for life doesn't speak highly for the individual in question, and I personally wouldn't want to think that the courts have seen fit to keep such a monster around so they could possibly do it again. And then there are the people who commit cold blooded murder, but get off with nothing more than probation because the prosecutor offered them a sweet plea deal for something minor in comparison, just for the sake of saying they made a conviction in the case. Back to the original point though. There are simply some people who are unfit to be left in a civilized society. If we caught somebody who intentionally massacred an entire school's worth of children, could you seriously say that anything less than the death penalty would be sufficient punishment for such a heinous act?","death-penalty","09:21 AM","crime-debates","312"

As for the some exceptions bit, yes that is exactly what I am saying. I can think of one case (I can't find the damn thing to quote) which pretty much fits the bill (though I will admit not quite). There was one of these paedophile 'name and shame' things where the names of paedophiles in a community were officially released and one 'good citizen' decided that it would be right and just to go round killing those named (I know it's not the same as official execution but bear with me). One of those named had had concentual sex with a girl of 15 (apparently looked old enough and claimed to be). The charge was rape (as she was not old enough to concent). He was murdered in his own home for a mistake he made that he regretted deeply when he found out what he'd done. As I say this case does not fit the bill completely, but I'm sure similar cases must arise and they should be an exception. All cases should be judged on their own merits.
