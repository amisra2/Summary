Its not supposed to be moral or ethical its supposed to stop crimes from being committed! You people seem to have forgotten that!","Penfold","328354","You do not believe that state killing is not the ultimate sanction available? What is? You people just want to be godlike and kill as many as possible. Justice is not about morality or ethics? Please explain that one for we rational people.","death-penalty","07:52 AM","crime-debates","166"
"10-16-2008","11312",12,"grizzly6626","328209","Ok, so what would you say we do to criminals, since you oppose everything so far. If a man rapes a child, I guess your idea would be to tell the rapist "" oh its ok, people just dont understand you, so try a little harder to be good in the future"" and then let him be on his way. Then would you look that child in the face and then tell him/her that its their fault this happened, because they dressed wrong or that they shouldnt have been there in the first place. Is this your idea of criminal justice, because thats the way it sounds to me. Im going to be honest, if a man raped my daughter, he would die, but he would pray to die before I got through with him and gave him the answer to his prayer, and if I got caught, the police wouldnt even know where to start filling out the report. The rapist would experience pain he could not have even imagined possible. So you can say what you want, call it what you want, but it wont change a thing as far as I am concearned.","Penfold","328356","Do you lapse into these bloodthirsty fantasies often?

They're not talking about justice at all; for them, it's all about revenge and acting as, they and Jauvert believed, agents of God.","death-penalty","09:04 AM","crime-debates","168"

Your god claimed veangance is his, not yours.","grizzly6626","328368","Well first off, Gods vengence is eternal judgement, God is not saying that he is going to extract vengence on a criminal while the criminal is sitting in jail, or walking free due to some technicality. And as far as thinking about this a lot, that is a false assumption on your part, but how does one not have feelings on this as I see it on the news almost daily. So what is one supposed to do if a criminal violently attacks a member of his family, just sit idly back and watch a soft judicial system set the criminal free after a short stay in prison, or get off on a technicality because the arresting officer didnt use proper punctuation in the report. How can you possibly view this as justice, you can not. You seem to advocate criminal rights while opposing rights for the victim. A child who is raped, should that child survive the attack, will suffer emotionally and mentally for the rest of their life, and in some cases, if the child is a female, she can not have children as a result of the attack. So then why shouldnt the criminal who caused this also be made to suffer greatly as well, and since our judicial system is not going to do this, then somebody else should. Your bleeding heart isnt going to stop a criminal from repeating his crime once he is released, but I will should he violently attack a member of my family.","death-penalty","09:30 AM","crime-debates","169"

You call it what you will, but there is justice, and there is injustice, and both you and the judicial system both seem to fall into the latter.","death-penalty","09:34 AM","crime-debates","170"

"10-16-2008","11312",12,"iangb","328383","The ironic thing is that Archangel and his ilk are for forcing that rape victim to bear any children she might have had inflicted on her. Is that really 'looking after the rights of the victim'? If you choose to carry out your vigilantism, I suspect you will receive full force the consequences of the justice system. Would you then welcome the death penalty for yourself, as a violent killer (and worse, by the sound of it...)?","Ethmi","328407","Look at this garbage. An evasion if ever there was one. Justice system? Are you refering to that thing that procrastinates for eleventy years before you get a ""yes"" or ""no"" out of them; normally a no? Are you refering to that thing that can't stop crimes from happening? That thing that won't be there to protect you when your home is invaded? The Justice System might work for intimidation, it might send the message ""You're going to get caught and punished"", but if somebody is willing to commit a crime, the so-called Justice System won't stop them.","death-penalty","11:14 AM","crime-debates","173"

If it meant loosing my life to make sure that criminal never again raped another child, then yes I would gladly lay my life. I wouldnt even deny it in a court of law. I would rather be judged by twelve than for a child to be carried by six.","death-penalty","11:21 AM","crime-debates","174"

But if they believe in killing a man who has without provocation, savagely attacked a family member, then they are my kind of people, you dont by chance have any of their phone numbers do you. All jokes aside, you deal with crime your way, and I will deal with it my way. I will even do something for you that I bet you are not willing to do for me, I am not going to rag on you anymore for your beliefs in how a violent criminal should be dealt with, after all you are entitled to your beliefs and the right to express your beliefs, doesnt mean that I dont think you are wrong though.","death-penalty","05:20 PM","crime-debates","180"
