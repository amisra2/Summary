I'm just saying legal definitions differ from state to state and from country to country.","death-penalty","06:40 PM","crime-debates","301"
"03-31-2010","11312",21,"Montanae","396512","I must, sadly, admit that I stopped listening as soon as you agreed with me. Or, at least, it sounded as if you agreed with me. Murder is: kill intentionally and with premeditation; ""The mafia boss ordered his enemies murdered"" mangle: alter so as to make unrecognizable; ""The tourists murdered the French language"" unlawful premeditated killing of a human being by a human being So, I can't see where I'm wrong. Trust me, you don't kill someone without thinking about it first. Even if you think about it a second before you do it, you thought about it, and, then, it classifies it as murder. As long as your eyes and brain register what you are doing, you're thinking about it. To me thinking = premeditated. Correct me if my equation is wrong. Didn't I say I was a mass of contradictions? I don't care about trials by jury or specific qualifying and disqualifying criteria for the use of the dp. I don't like it, but, what I'm saying is that death should be given without a trial. Perhaps I should have made that clear the first go around?","snakespit","396573","Unlawful. Since the death penalty is lawful, it cannot be considered murder. You are wrong. Premeditated: characterized by fully conscious willful intent and a measure of forethought and planning <premeditated murder> Are you suggesting that criminals who are to receive the DP don't deserve due process?","death-penalty","12:20 PM","crime-debates","302"

So you call it lawful. Why is it lawful that the state should be able to kill us, yet we are going to be killed when we kill another person? Forethought = A thinking or planning out in advance Thinking in advance... Hm. Premeditated, no? I thought we just went over this. Yes! You Get It! Or, rather, what I'm saying is that if we use the common sense that the good Lord gave us, and we can see that there is no evidence that is coming up, they should go bye-bye! Now, with those cases that I gave as an example, you didn't need a brain to know what they were doing. THOSE are the cases that I am taking about. Those are the ones that don't deserve due process. It was obvious what they were doing. If you can see that they were doing it, and that they admitted to it in some way, then, yes, the DP needs to be served immediately.","death-penalty","08:59 PM","crime-debates","303"
"06-25-2010","11312",21,"None","None","None","Dr Ovid","405511","I favor the death penalty in theory for murder. I abhor the fairly high risk that innocent persons will be executed. I think that the death penalty should only be used when there can be nearly zero chance of a mistake being made. Maybe make a professional board of intelligent people to review cases and overthrow any death penalty when it is not about 100% certain. This would also line up well with the system apparently described by the City of Refuge section of the Pentateuch if my memory serves me today.","death-penalty","07:20 PM","crime-debates","304"
"10-27-2010","11312",21,"None","None","None","NATO 556","415729","Some people claim that the death penalty is a sign of backwards thinking and not indicative of a developed nation. Japan not only has and uses the death penalty, they do it the old fashioned way; by hanging the guilty with a noose and trap door. Nearly 80 percent of the population supports the death penalty. Is anybody going to claim that Japan isn't a developed nation? Is anybody going to tell them that they're wrong for hanging people, or are they going to take the position that it's wrong to get involved in the politics of other nations no matter what they might do?","death-penalty","12:03 AM","crime-debates","306"

The Death Penalty and Deterrence A September 2000 New York Times survey found that during the last 20 years, the homicide rate in states with the death penalty has been 48 to 101 percent higher than in states without the death penalty. FBI data shows that all 14 states without capital punishment in 2008 had homicide rates at or below the national rate. The first established death penalty laws date as far back as the Eighteenth Century B.C. in the Code of King Hammaurabi of Babylon","olivortex","415733","Hello, and thank you for being here again. I personnally never claimed that japan is not a developed country, though the criteria for determining what a developed country is can be blurry sometimes. But japan has obviously a state-of-the-art industry, a great cultural activity, and despite the recent growth slowing down, has one of the first economies in the world. Like many people, I'm fascinated by this county and I'd like to visit it some day. Nevertheless, being a developed country in many regards doesn't mean that the favoured death penalty policy is the best one, or good. In 1940, germany was not in bad shape. The least we can say is that Hitler didn't bring any real progress to humanity. Any government can make bad choices. I don't remember who exactly but one forum member here on this thread talked about death penalty (like hanging people in front of children...) having a deterrent effect on potential criminals. The Death Penalty and Deterrence These figures seem to show the opposite of a deterrence effect. Part I: History of the Death Penalty | Death Penalty Information Center Death penalty is quite ancient, as we see. It might have always been in man's customs.I cannot come to any particular conclusion like saying it is backwards thinking to apply it, but developed countries, in europe and in other regions of the world bring alternatives.","death-penalty","04:59 AM","crime-debates","307"

States with death penalties have higher murder rates. This raises questions, it doesn't provide answers. a) Does the death penalty encourage murders? b) Does the presence of large numbers of murderers encourage use of the death penalty? c) Does a third factor encourage both murder and death penalties (e.g. a culture which places little value on human life? poor quality of education? high immigration?). It takes either a dishonest person or a fool to state the correlation as if it proved a point. Usually a dishonest person to state it first, and then fools to repeat it ad nauseum.","death-penalty","05:36 AM","crime-debates","308"

I hope I don't look like a fool or a dishonest person, since I didn't state any causation from use of death penalty to higher murder rates. My point was to show that states with death penalties can have, as observed, higher murder rates. Of course, thinking the cause of these higher rates is death penalty is / would be a mistake. Writing this I didn't mean ""blood thirst effect"", of course Just showing that the opposite of an expected result can happen.","death-penalty","07:06 AM","crime-debates","309"
"10-27-2010","11312",21,"None","None","None","NATO 556","415801","The death penalty doesn't need to serve as a deterrent to crime. It's purpose is punishment of a crime so heinous in nature that no developed nation would ever consider keeping the perpetrator around. It speaks very poorly for a nation if they refuse to kill the worst of the worst, and instead choose to house them and shelter them for the rest of their natural lives. Anybody who would abolish the death penalty isn't looking at the bigger picture; they're too hung up on forgiveness and impotence to do the right thing.","death-penalty","10:24 PM","crime-debates","310"
"10-28-2010","11312",21,"None","None","None","olivortex","415812","I understand, but to me eliminating a problem is not really fixing it. It's not necessarily a matter of forgiveness; there are some acts I wouldn't be able to forgive. And also, what if somebody kills for revenge? Is he/she going to be considered as the worst of the worst? People sometimes take revenge themselves without waiting for official justice decisions. I don't say it's a good thing, but it happens. You might say that if justice applies death penalty properly, this won't happen, but we know it would anyway, because murderers are not always caught. So, people seeking revenge could be seen as legitimate. But if you kill the murderer by your own means, it makes you a murderer to the eyes of justice. I don't want to be too heavy on that point but you see what I mean. The famous vicious circle. Mmm, I think I've already mentioned revenge in an earlier post, so I'll try not to repeat myself too much.","death-penalty","03:15 AM","crime-debates","311"

But if the revenge killing is in the style done by gang bangers who feel the need to murder someone because they showed them disrespect, then that might put them in the worst category. If you're willing to XXXX somebody away because they dissed you in front of your homies and made you lose your street cred, that's a very poor excuse for murdering somebody, their friends, their family, etc. Wouldn't you agree? Such disregard for life doesn't speak highly for the individual in question, and I personally wouldn't want to think that the courts have seen fit to keep such a monster around so they could possibly do it again. And then there are the people who commit cold blooded murder, but get off with nothing more than probation because the prosecutor offered them a sweet plea deal for something minor in comparison, just for the sake of saying they made a conviction in the case. Back to the original point though. There are simply some people who are unfit to be left in a civilized society. If we caught somebody who intentionally massacred an entire school's worth of children, could you seriously say that anything less than the death penalty would be sufficient punishment for such a heinous act?","death-penalty","09:21 AM","crime-debates","312"
