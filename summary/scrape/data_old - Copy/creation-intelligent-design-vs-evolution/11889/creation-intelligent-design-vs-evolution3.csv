Obviously, it's easier to pretend that your claims are right rather then backing them up?","CashBurnRate","331861","What thread? Nowhere did I state that I in any way, shape or form believed in any part of literal creationism. Labelling people and making assumptions when they disagree with you is one of the most pathetic, asinine and childish things you can do in a debate.","why-creationists","11:13 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","31"
"11-08-2008","11889",3,"CashBurnRate","331860","I did not change the subject. I was responding to your opening post. So you admit that you lied? I never said that. You said I stated something in which I clearly did not.","obvious_child","331862","By changing the subject. Just because you reply doesn't mean you don't change the subject. I could reply with gibberish. You apparently missed the post where you claimed that creationwiki had refuted talkorigins. As Talkorigins supports the TOH, and since you think that that TO is incorrect, well, you do the math. Do you know what a question is? In the English Langauge, a question is meant to gain clarification. My question clearly did not accuse you of saying such, only requesting clarification to whether or not you believed creationists used dishonest tactics. Perhaps you should enroll in a English Comprehension course at your local college? See above. Google is a good tool for finding such classes. Keep insulting me. Not only will it get you warnings, but it keeps proving my point. You have no argument. Only insults.","why-creationists","11:16 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","32"

Or did you forget that? Besides, if you didn't believe in Literal Creationism, then you wouldn't have a problem agreeing that they use dishonest tactics. And you'd admit that literal creationism is bad science which cannot produce anything of commercial value outside of publications. So which is it? See above for why you are wrong.","why-creationists","11:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","33"

The ""i'm right cuz i say so"" argument is getting old. Because if I support a theory, I've got to agree with everyone else who supports the theory, right? No matter how asinine their arguments are? I have yet to see a single thing you've posted that would be indicative of any intelligence. Just because someone agrees with you on an issue doesn't mean they have to agree with every asinine thing you say Your question implied it. ""So basically you're an #####?"" is not asking for clarification, it's an implied statement. You resorted to insults when all I did was disagree with you. don't use insults if you can't take it","why-creationists","11:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","34"

You refuse to do so despite being asked several times. besides, I already know you are a biblist.","why-creationists","08:32 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","36"

You still haven't disputed the fact that you're a liar. All you can do is insult and run. You ASSUME I'm a Yankees fan and you assume that I'm a literal creationist.

He is calling you ""Yankeefan"", stating that you go by that user name on another board. At least I hope you are being deliberately obtuse, as the alternative does not speak well as to your intelligence.","why-creationists","03:03 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","38"

Proponents of ID usually don't argue religiosity or scripture, they let the empirical evidence prove it, funny... that is what true science has always done. Verify the obvious, not ignore it in favor of some mindless postulations [oddly] convenient to how someone wants to live their life; amazing how that works out...","why-creationists","04:27 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","42"

There happens to be no scientist who is taken serious who discards the the global flood, why? [pray tell] Because their is ample evidence to for the flood. So even the secular world has to start there... The same fossil tables here, are the same in Russia, Israel.... and are Sumatra. Secondly... the [just to throw this in] the pyramids of Giza, Egyptologists tried to suppress find the skeleton of a manatee in the upper chambers one of the larger pyramids, because they are Muslim... and what would that finding lend credibility to?
