When you don't have an argument, resort to insults.","obvious_child","331821","Argument from position of sheer ignorance. If you happened to bother to research anything instead of first opening your creationist mouth, you would have noticed there are literally thousands of arguments for evolution and against creationism. At this very moment I have several posts about why creationism is wrong in the informal debate thread. Instead of doing research, educating yourself and not arguing from positions of sheer ignorance, you choose to pretend what you wish to be true rather then look at what actually is true. If you believe that to be true, Take a shot: http://www.4forums.com/political/for...-new-post.html","why-creationists","10:07 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","17"

You stated that creationists cannot argue without resorting to fallacies, generalities are clearly false. I've never seen such an idiotic comment. All you've done is resort to personal attacks. You're an embarrassment, but I assume you already know that.","why-creationists","10:13 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","20"

You claim that my statement about the dishonesty of creationists is wrong., specifically you argue that creationists don't use fallacies Then you go and use a fallacy of changing the subject.

"11-08-2008","11889",2,"obvious_child","331844","Outline of the future discussion with Cashburn. This is how our relationship with Cashburnrate will happen. Cashburn will argue foolishly, ignorantly and without any facts that evolution is wrong and creationism is right. He will provide no actual substantial arguments, rely on numerous insults as well as huge numbers of fallacies. He will be destroyed on all claims, resort to conspiracy and threats of hell and then we will leave. He will accomplish nothing other then reinforcing the notions that creationists are uneducated, stupid, ignorant and cowardly.","CashBurnRate","331848","You ignorant fool.

You however, have done the rest in very small number of posts. Btw, thanks again for proving my point; I predicted this: ""rely on numerous insults as well as huge numbers of fallacies"" There are at least 4 insults in that post to me, none of which actually address my thread.","why-creationists","10:59 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","26"
