That said, creationists are not the enemy. Many people hold beliefs of dubious merit with great passion. Many martial arts students believe in some variation of eastern mysticism which is scientifically baseless. Many people believe in astrology or crystal healing or some other placebo. Even in businesss, the psychometric tests employed to predict who will make the best employee are often groundless. Even on this board, many people hold a similar faith in global warming. The only reason creationism is even an issue is because the public school system makes it impossible for these kinds of beliefs to be resolved in a voluntary manner. It is public schooling, not creationism per se that needs to be dealt with.","why-creationists","10:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","2"

The only way to do this is to never follow any point through to it's ultimate conclusion, as it will be shown as false. Instead, the best tactic is to attempt to bury opponents under an ever-shifting, ever-repeating argument in an attempt to persuade them that because you have so many arguments, you must be right - and because you never stay on-topic, none of your points are ever completely wiped of the map, so you can revisit them and force them to be debated from the start again. This is why the Index to Creationist Claims is so handy, because it allows most arguments to be wiped out from stage one. Hence my personal Creationist Challenge - if someone can come up with an argument for creationism that I cannot answer with a single link to the Index, I will take that person seriously.

Some theories have been put forward that the belief in animism among early humans were the basis for the later evolution of religions. In this theory, initially put forward by Dr. E. B. Tylor, early humans initially worshipped local deities of nature, in a form of animism. These eventually grew into larger, polytheistic deities, such as gods of the sun and moon. Eventually these evolved into a belief in one, monotheistic God.","obvious_child","334701","Rich coming from you: http://www.4forums.com/political/308894-post5.html Not to mention you can't tell the difference between elements, molecules and compounds. You really shouldn't be talking. Nice take on superficiality. Look up the earliest form of Animism. Look what I can do, I can read your article too! The principle fundamental basis of Animism is to explain things unexplainable now by crediting supernatural beings/things. Early human Animism explained the seasons and rains by crediting them to a Rain God. We see this even today in the native American's cultural rain dances to appease and worship the specific God to bring rain to their crops.
