Nothing you've posted addresses the principle basis of a religion that credits Gods with things that they cannot explain. Just because Christanity is not labeled Animism does not change the fact that Intelligent Design is fundamentally the same principle as Animism. And I never said that Christians were Animists. Not all Christians accept intelligent design. I fully realize you have no idea what you are talking about. After all, you still can't figure out the role oxygen plays in cell growth or what the differences are between elements, compounds and molecules.","why-creationists","08:33 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","61"

Intelligent design - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Animism (from Latin anima (soul, life)[1][2]) commonly refers to a religious belief that souls or spirits exist in animals, plants and other entities, in addition to humans Animism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia That is clearly a lie.","why-creationists","05:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","62"

All you did was regurgitate superficial definitions without any understanding of the underlying principles of either Intelligent Design nor Animism. Come back when you understand what both mean beyond the superficial. Besides, if you had bothered to read what I had written, I already cited from the wikipedia link a deeper discussion about what Animism is. That backs my argument up. Furthermore, Intelligent Design is essentially nothing more then God of the Gaps. Something you have been destroyed on in the past Yank. And the definition of lie doesn't mean anything you don't like.","why-creationists","07:15 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","63"
