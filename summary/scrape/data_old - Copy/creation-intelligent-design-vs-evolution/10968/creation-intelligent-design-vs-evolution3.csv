The accusation of lying is not dependent upon opinion, however, so as soon as you can show where I've lied, you go ahead with that, too.","Archangel","303666","Thanks for proving for all to see how you will take a statement that is attributed to you and apply the words to me. As if I was calling you those things when your response to me had no actual content but was making those assertions about me. [Archangel] Great arguments lyte. As you scream at me, I'M RIGHT AND YOU'RE WRONG AND THAT SETTLES IT, SO THERE!!! AND YOU'RE LYING AND STUPID TOO, SO THERE. You can insist as rudely as you like that you're right but my argument stands on its own merits.","regarding-assumptions","07:56 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","31"
"02-27-2008","10968",3,"marc9000","303626","It says ~an~ ethical or moral (or scientific) code - not plural. So a double standard would be the same methodology, applied with different strictness , to different problems. Claims of the flood, claims of design, theyre both from the past, and they should be compared with an identical strictness, concerning testablilty. Historical writings should mean something, science shouldnt be so arrogant that it can call for anything historical to be put on our present day table, all written history thrown out, and allow nothing but present day experimentation to determine if its true or false. There seem to be a few claims out there that the WW2 holocaust never happened. Should we let nothing but present day scientific experimentation determine whether it did or didnt, and completely disregard what was written about it? No, different methodology to two very related problems, since they both happened in the past, and we cant go back and observe either one. Why is it that we cant test the claims of evolution the same way? If weve made advances in fluid dynamics and geology that allows us to more critically examine the possibility of a worldwide flood, why cant we use the recently discovered complexities of the simplest forms of life, complete with all their associated probabilistic complexities, conditionally independent patterns, specified complexities, and mathematical odds, to more critically examine the possibility of purposelessness, godless evolution? I know the reason we dont because atheists dont WANT to! Is that a good enough reason? Equally, all possible observations can be explicable via mindless natural selection and random chance, Yet if we go to talkorigins, you know, that neutral mainstream scientific site, and search those two names, why cant we find them both referred to somewhat equally, praised somewhat equally, attacked somewhat equally? Heres what we find, 8 references to Stenger (8 lovefests with Stenger, maybe?) to 154 references to Behe. Do you think all 154 references to Behe were lovefests? Do you think ONE of them was? Or were most of them personal put-downs? Ruling out a designer is also overkill, But all thats not really what your OP was about. It was about the innocence of science, how it does not address, or rule out the supernatural. Why is there NO conflict between naturalistic science & atheism? Explain that one to me. You limit him more when you say he didnt do what the Bible says.","Peeling","303700","Ok, I can go along with that. It's pretty much what I was aiming at anyway. Ye-esss... but one tenuous and very general similarity regarding the period of time to which they speak does not make them equivalent logical claims. I prefer the term old to historical But seriously, biblical descriptions of the flood do mean something and they are on the table; they're the only reason anyone's even bothering to investigate the possibility. And they don't remotely tally with any physical evidence. So now we have a choice: is the biblical story accurate and all our carefully-checked and laboriously-constructed scientific understanding about what ought to happen in a global flood wrong, or is the biblical story over-egging the pudding a bit? An emotive but irrelevant question. Since there are no scientific tests I'm aware of that could even in principle evaluate the truth of the matter one way or the other, what are your grounds for suggesting such a contretemps might come to pass? And there, from a logical perspective, the similarity ends. It's very, very simple: one statement is positive (a flood happened) while the other is negative (evolution can't have happened via natural processes) You are, understandably, going to protest that we can phrase both claims positively: ""life was designed"". However, if you go back and read my little discourse on design further up, you can see that to claim life was designed is effectively to assert that some of the selection process occurred in the abstract rather than via natural processes. And since our definition of 'natural processes' includes anything testable, anything amenable to science, it follows that this 'abstract' or 'god' cannot be directly tested. We cannot check to see if god exists (positive claim) we can only test to see whether naturalistic explanations are insufficient (negative claim). That, we are already doing. All creation science does is jog alongside yelling ""We still don't know everything!"" It can't, by its own definition, contribute anything positive. We can and do, because we're interested in understanding what's really going on. Look at it this way for a moment: science looks for naturalistic explanations for phenomena, right? And it has peer review and a requirement for reproducible results to ensure those explanations aren't just made up, right? So if the creation hypothesis is correct, we'll hit something we can't find an explanation for, no matter how hard we try, right? Ok, now let's see what Creation Science buys us. Here we have some guys dilligently trying not to find naturalistic explanations for phenomena. They can be right, or they can be wrong. If they're right, then regular science won't find an answer even if we aren't listening to them. If they're wrong and we do listen to them, we won't find an answer even though one exists. The only way we can lose is to listen to them. It seems to be good enough for you No, they can't. Any number of observations could falsify evolutionary theory, and we haven't seen any of them yet. I still don't understand the relevance of this book by Stenger - describing his conclusions - in a thread concerning assumptions. You can't rule out a designer, that's the whole point. All you can do is show that one isn't necessary. It doesn't. If something is amenable to science, it's natural. Like I said, any phenomenon could in reality be directly divine - so long as god's consistent, the phenomenon is classed as natural. Same reason there's no conflict beween naturalistic science and theism - they don't overlap. What you're confusing, Marc - what every theistic opponent of what science has to say regarding evolution confuses - is the existence of god with you being right . God can exist and you can still be wrong about all the little details you believe are tied up with him. Here, let me show you what I mean: I'm an atheist. Still, I'm prepared to admit I might be completely wrong about the existence of a god, a supreme being. You're a Christian. Are you prepared to admit that you might be right about the existence of god, but wrong about evolution? See? The existence or non-existence of god isn't the issue at all. What you care about is being right. That's both the strength and weakness of religious dogma: it's strong and durable because it proclaims itself to be the word of god, but it's also vulnerable because once you've made that claim, you're exposed on a lot of fronts concerning which ancient people were pretty ignorant. You find yourself having to defend something preposterous like six day creation because you've bet the farm on everything being true. More than that, you constantly compound your own inflexibility by vocally deriding science for changing its mind so much in the light of new evidence - so now you can't backpedal and do the same. You end up trying to swim with millstones around your neck. You think? How many possibilities for god's actions in the past do you eliminate if you insist the bible is true? And how many do you eliminate if you show it to be false? If I say I went out for a meal last night and then to the cinema, do I limit my historical actions more or less than if I say I didn't go out for a meal and then to the cinema? Think about that for a bit.","regarding-assumptions","12:48 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","32"

Try not breaking my post up line by line but just respond to it as a single thought which I'm attempting to get through to you. The issue isn't what science can prove or disprove but is what it claims by its very definition. Here is the FACT of what the ToE claims to represent in REALITY. It is undeniable that the very definition, shown here: What is it about THE PROCESS OF NATURAL SELECTION THROUGH RANDOM MUTATION THAT PROMOTES, OR ALLOWS FOR THE BELIEF OF AN INTELLIGENT CREATOR AT ALL IN YOUR OPINION? It denies the participation of a SUPREME BEING in any way of being responsible for the existence of any life on Earth at all, be it plant or animal. So the question isn't about proving or disproving God exists, Which science admits it cannot do, but simply acknowledging the part He played in the Creation of life on Earth which the Biological Theory of Evolution rejects out of hand. Now can you deny that what I'm saying is true and accurate? If so refute it with facts rather than just continuing to insist that I am wrong and you are right. And start with defining the NATURAL in selection and the RANDOM in mutation in regards to the existence of life on Earth and then tell me how my understanding is in error in any way. [QUOTE=Archangel;303918] NOTE THE BOLDED IN BOTH POSTS LYTE : And if you reread my post you will see that I never claimed that science even tried to PROVE or DISPROVE Gods existence in any way. But I explain very accurately that by the very definition of the terms that describe the process of Biological Evolution, the existence of Gods part in our existence is denied. If you will reread your response S to me, you said nothing at all to actually refute my arguments, but simply reverted to name calling and again claiming my ignorance of the ToE. But tell me lyte; how much does one have to know about the ToE to DEFINE NATURAL SELECTION AND RANDOM MUTATION?","regarding-assumptions","11:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","36"

Why must yiou misrepresent it like you do? What is it to you where you have to misrepresent science in order to make your point? Frankly, that can't be satisfying, having to invent strawmen and sophistry in order to be able to make a point? And actually, your claim is then wrong regardless of how much you repeat it. Science is not able to make statements as to what it has not been able to find. As such, unless there is actual evidence of God not existing, Science will NOT be saying what you falsely claim it says. YOUR ignorance is not the fault of Science or Evolution, only of you remaining ignorant. Anywhere outside of what there is evidence for or against.","regarding-assumptions","01:33 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","41"
