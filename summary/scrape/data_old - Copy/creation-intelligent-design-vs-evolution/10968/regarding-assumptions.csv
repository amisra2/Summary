"02-20-2008","10968",1,"None","None","None","Peeling","302708","The word assumption gets hurled around a lot in evolution/creation debates, rarely justifiably. First of all, it is not an assumption to interpret new evidence that correlates with a well-established theory as if it were explained by that theory. Example: the ongoing recovery and classification of hominid fossil remains. Common descent has proved itself beyond any reasonable doubt as far as pretty much all contemporary scientists are concerned. So when a new fossil is found which - yet again - correlates with the ToE by virtue of its appearance, geographical location and date, it is not an assumption to interpret that fossil as being explained by the ToE - eg, interpreting it as being related in some fashion to other extinct hominids. It is a well-founded conclusion . Analogy: There's a convicted serial killer whose MO was to bury the bodies of his victims in his garden, wrapped in newspaper. Years later the police track down some more previous addresses of his, dig up the gardens and find more bodies, each wrapped in newspapers bearing dates that correlate with the killer's residence in that domicile. Despite the lack of any forensic evidence directly linking the killer to those bodies, the authorities announce that he was responsible for their deaths. Is that an assumption, or a well-founded conclusion? What if all the bodies had been found in the communal gardens of shared accommodation, where the killer's was the only name that appeared on every tenant agreement? Would it be an assumption to pin the deaths on him, or a well-founded conclusion based on the extreme unlikelihood of an innocent man happening to share a series of houses with a series of killers who each independently employed the same MO and who each, without fail, began and ended their killing sprees to coincide with his arrival and departure? It doesn't matter if you disbelieve evolution, and it doesn't even matter if you're right: scientists are not making an assumption when they classify fossils. For them to be doing that, they would have to be arbitrarily choosing one interpretation from a range of interpretations that are equally likely given their understanding of the accumulated evidence . They aren't. Secondly, the pursuit of naturalistic explanations for phenomena does not require an assumption of the non-existence of god. Take the following equation: E = N + S Any (E)xplanation consists of (N)aturalistic and (S)upernatural components. N consists of anything that is amenable to the scientific method: testable, repeatable etc. Note that it is nothing to do with tangibility (eg gravity, inertia, statistics) nothing to do with how complete our understanding is, and nothing to do with its origin. Nothing explicitly excludes god from N. He might, for instance, be personally responsible for moving all matter in the universe as if it was subject to the force we perceive as gravity. It is the testability and consistency of observed gravitational phenomena which makes it part of N, not an assumption of non-divine origin. S contains explanations or part-explanations that are untestable. By definition, we cannot verify an explanation in S; we cannot ever know if we are right to employ it. Miraculous explanations fall into S. N is therefore the interesting part of any given explanation. If we can show that the contents of N are sufficient to explain a phenomenon to a high degree of plausibility, we have shown S to be empty, without ever, at any point, assuming it to be empty. Nor have we excluded the divine; we have merely shown that if god exists and is involved he is being consistent.","regarding-assumptions","12:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","1"

We are explaining natural phenomena by natural means. We do so simply because we can test natural explanations while we cannot test the supernatural. We use methodological naturalism (not, by any means, philosophical naturalism) to observe, test and explain the natural. This is not a denial of god or an assumption about the existance of a god. It is a recognition of the fact that we cannot investigate the supernatural by natural means. Even methodological naturalists can be theists - Kenneth R.

So I'll do it once more, bookmark this post, and then link you to it every time you pretend to be so terribly persecuted again. Science is incapable of testing the supernatural. Period. By the very mechanism of science -- methodological naturalism -- no conclusions about the supernatural can be drawn. However, when claims of the supernatural overlap into the natural realm, then those claims can be tested. Science tells us that there was no global flood a la Noah, not that there is no God. Now, if you choose to interpret that as a reasonable person and realize that science shows that ""a Noah's flood-causing God"" does not exist, then kudos. This does not mean that there is no God whatsoever. The error you are making is that you are equating creationism with God. We've disproved special creation. Handily. So one might say that there's good evidence that a God represented by a literal interpretation of the Bible does not exist. But that doesn't mean that no God exists, or that a Christian God doesn't exist. Then again, if you've pigeonholed God into a constrictive box based on your own understanding, but you insist that God exists, perhaps you should rethink why you felt the need to cram your God into a tiny box. Science can only disprove a God to whom some human attributes a limitation.","regarding-assumptions","09:43 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","7"

The 'jewish/christian/islamic' god concept, reading literally, makes some very specific claims.. Those claims are falsified. He can not counter (by his own admission btw), the concept of 'God' in general. He can only counter when religion makes specific physical claims, such as in the origin of the world, the origin of man, or a being with the traditional attributes of the judeo-christian god (from a literal reading of the Bible).

After all, creationists have made plenty of the claims in the vein of ""God did this, but it is hidden to us so we can't see it"" nonsense and then claiming it scientific. Also irrelevant. Show it consensus from the scientific community rather than a book written but not peer-reviewed, and you would have an argument. As it is not actual science, why would anybody care? Outright false, as Science doesn't deal with God at all. CREATIONIST claims about God, limiting God to be based on evidence rather than Faith, THAT limits God.

What you're questioning is the application of the same methodology to two different problems. We can test claims of a global flood because we can use our understanding of fluid dynamics, geology and so forth to make positive predictions about what we ought to see if there had been a global flood, and compare that with what we actually see - which is that there's no way a global flood could have occurred. So what about design? What positive predictions and comparisons can we make? Answer: none. This is because all possible observations could be explicable via design, especially once you factor in the 'unknowable mind of god'. Imagine a pile of sand. Is the position and shape of each grain a result of design? It could be. We can't exclude the possibility, particularly if we posit an omnipotent entity to whom such a feat would be negligable. Design is, in the end, selection from within a pool of alternatives. Whether those options all have physical presence, or some are mental abstractions with only the chosen option being realised, whether the design is evaluated as a whole or via its components or iteratively, in the end a design is just a selection of one option from many. It therefore doesn't make sense to ask whether any given thing was designed. It only makes sense to ask what was involved in its selection. At that point, it's always possible to suggest 'god', because 'god' is the catch-all. God could have been responsible for the pile of sand. Of course, that's overkill: there are simpler, more specific explanations involving wind and gravity. But what about (sigh) a pocket-watch? Paley almost had a point. We infer a watchmaker from seeing a watch not because the watch 'looks designed' but because there's no evidence that alternatives from which the watch was selected ever existed in reality to be discriminated between by non-intelligent agents. Volcanos don't spew out prototype watches; hydrodynamic sorting doesn't bring the most accurate timepieces to the surface. I realise that's a bit of a headful, but stay with it; it's important. If most of the selection process occurs in the abstract, with only the final result being reified, then we won't see evidence of 'natural' processes generating and filtering alternatives. That's why the watchmaker analogy is wrong: there's no evidence of natural processes producing alternative watch configurations and selecting between them, so we're justified in inferring that much of the process must have occurred in the abstract - hence a designer. But there's ample evidence of natural processes producing and discriminating between alternative 'designs' of living creatures. Bolting on a designer is overkill.

Most non-scientists seem to be quite confused about precise definitions of biological evolution. Such confusion is due in large part to the inability of scientists to communicate effectively to the general public and also to confusion among scientists themselves about how to define such an important term. When discussing evolution it is important to distinguish between the existence of evolution and various theories about the mechanism of evolution. And when referring to the existence of evolution it is important to have a clear definition in mind. What exactly do biologists mean when they say that they have observed evolution or that humans and chimps have evolved from a common ancestor? One of the most respected evolutionary biologists has defined biological evolution as follows: ""In the broadest sense, evolution is merely change, and so is all-pervasive; galaxies, languages, and political systems all evolve. Biological evolution ... is change in the properties of populations of organisms that transcend the lifetime of a single individual. The ontogeny of an individual is not considered evolution; individual organisms do not evolve. The changes in populations that are considered evolutionary are those that are inheritable via the genetic material from one generation to the next. Biological evolution may be slight or substantial; it embraces everything from slight changes in the proportion of different alleles within a population (such as those determining blood types) to the successive alterations that led from the earliest protoorganism to snails, bees, giraffes, and dandelions."" - Douglas J.

Dictionary.com says this about a double standard; It says ~an~ ethical or moral (or scientific) code - not plural. So a double standard would be the same methodology, applied with different strictness , to different problems. Claims of the flood, claims of design, theyre both from the past, and they should be compared with an identical strictness, concerning testablilty. Historical writings should mean something, science shouldnt be so arrogant that it can call for anything historical to be put on our present day table, all written history thrown out, and allow nothing but present day experimentation to determine if its true or false. There seem to be a few claims out there that the WW2 holocaust never happened. Should we let nothing but present day scientific experimentation determine whether it did or didnt, and completely disregard what was written about it? Has science assumed a position of divinity, standing alone, and disregarding everything else? No, different methodology to two very related problems, since they both happened in the past, and we cant go back and observe either one. Why is it that we cant test the claims of evolution the same way? If weve made advances in fluid dynamics and geology that allows us to more critically examine the possibility of a worldwide flood, why cant we use the recently discovered complexities of the simplest forms of life, complete with all their associated probabilistic complexities, conditionally independent patterns, specified complexities, and mathematical odds, to more critically examine the possibility of purposelessness, godless evolution? I know the reason we dont because atheists dont WANT to! Is that a good enough reason? Equally, all possible observations can be explicable via mindless natural selection and random chance, especially once you factor in the atheist worldview. Theyre not kept on equal terms, as they should be. You and the others here imply that science is independent of God. That people like Stenger on the one side, and.Michael Behe for example, on the other side both include their personal opinions in their work, with actual science falling somewhere in the middle. Yet if we go to talkorigins, you know, that neutral mainstream scientific site, and search those two names, why cant we find them both referred to somewhat equally, praised somewhat equally, attacked somewhat equally? Heres what we find, 8 references to Stenger (8 lovefests with Stenger, maybe?) to 154 references to Behe. Do you think all 154 references to Behe were lovefests? Do you think ONE of them was? Or were most of them personal put-downs? Ruling out a designer is also overkill, but it seems like youre drifting off the topic a little. I agree that the watchmaker analogy, as well as the tornado building a 747 from a junkyard are not good analogies non living matter behaves differently than does living matter, when it comes to random processes. But when it comes to complexity, to several units working together to perform one function, there are similarities between living and non living complex units, those that are made up of a series of simpler units. But all thats not really what your OP was about. It was about the innocence of science, how it does not address, or rule out the supernatural. I want to know why the MANY best selling books like Stengers dont anger you, or anyone else in science, enough to make you or someone take a serious, detailed exception to them? Why do posters like Electrolyte get mad at ME, when I point out the title of Stengers book? Shouldnt he be getting mad at Stenger? Why is there NO conflict between naturalistic science & atheism?

"02-27-2008","10968",3,"marc9000","303626","It says ~an~ ethical or moral (or scientific) code - not plural. So a double standard would be the same methodology, applied with different strictness , to different problems. Claims of the flood, claims of design, theyre both from the past, and they should be compared with an identical strictness, concerning testablilty. Historical writings should mean something, science shouldnt be so arrogant that it can call for anything historical to be put on our present day table, all written history thrown out, and allow nothing but present day experimentation to determine if its true or false. There seem to be a few claims out there that the WW2 holocaust never happened. Should we let nothing but present day scientific experimentation determine whether it did or didnt, and completely disregard what was written about it? No, different methodology to two very related problems, since they both happened in the past, and we cant go back and observe either one. Why is it that we cant test the claims of evolution the same way? If weve made advances in fluid dynamics and geology that allows us to more critically examine the possibility of a worldwide flood, why cant we use the recently discovered complexities of the simplest forms of life, complete with all their associated probabilistic complexities, conditionally independent patterns, specified complexities, and mathematical odds, to more critically examine the possibility of purposelessness, godless evolution? I know the reason we dont because atheists dont WANT to! Is that a good enough reason? Equally, all possible observations can be explicable via mindless natural selection and random chance, Yet if we go to talkorigins, you know, that neutral mainstream scientific site, and search those two names, why cant we find them both referred to somewhat equally, praised somewhat equally, attacked somewhat equally? Heres what we find, 8 references to Stenger (8 lovefests with Stenger, maybe?) to 154 references to Behe. Do you think all 154 references to Behe were lovefests? Do you think ONE of them was? Or were most of them personal put-downs? Ruling out a designer is also overkill, But all thats not really what your OP was about. It was about the innocence of science, how it does not address, or rule out the supernatural. Why is there NO conflict between naturalistic science & atheism? Explain that one to me. You limit him more when you say he didnt do what the Bible says.","Peeling","303700","Ok, I can go along with that. It's pretty much what I was aiming at anyway. Ye-esss... but one tenuous and very general similarity regarding the period of time to which they speak does not make them equivalent logical claims. I prefer the term old to historical But seriously, biblical descriptions of the flood do mean something and they are on the table; they're the only reason anyone's even bothering to investigate the possibility. And they don't remotely tally with any physical evidence. So now we have a choice: is the biblical story accurate and all our carefully-checked and laboriously-constructed scientific understanding about what ought to happen in a global flood wrong, or is the biblical story over-egging the pudding a bit? An emotive but irrelevant question. Since there are no scientific tests I'm aware of that could even in principle evaluate the truth of the matter one way or the other, what are your grounds for suggesting such a contretemps might come to pass? And there, from a logical perspective, the similarity ends. It's very, very simple: one statement is positive (a flood happened) while the other is negative (evolution can't have happened via natural processes) You are, understandably, going to protest that we can phrase both claims positively: ""life was designed"". However, if you go back and read my little discourse on design further up, you can see that to claim life was designed is effectively to assert that some of the selection process occurred in the abstract rather than via natural processes. And since our definition of 'natural processes' includes anything testable, anything amenable to science, it follows that this 'abstract' or 'god' cannot be directly tested. We cannot check to see if god exists (positive claim) we can only test to see whether naturalistic explanations are insufficient (negative claim). That, we are already doing. All creation science does is jog alongside yelling ""We still don't know everything!"" It can't, by its own definition, contribute anything positive. We can and do, because we're interested in understanding what's really going on. Look at it this way for a moment: science looks for naturalistic explanations for phenomena, right? And it has peer review and a requirement for reproducible results to ensure those explanations aren't just made up, right? So if the creation hypothesis is correct, we'll hit something we can't find an explanation for, no matter how hard we try, right? Ok, now let's see what Creation Science buys us. Here we have some guys dilligently trying not to find naturalistic explanations for phenomena. They can be right, or they can be wrong. If they're right, then regular science won't find an answer even if we aren't listening to them. If they're wrong and we do listen to them, we won't find an answer even though one exists. The only way we can lose is to listen to them. It seems to be good enough for you No, they can't. Any number of observations could falsify evolutionary theory, and we haven't seen any of them yet. I still don't understand the relevance of this book by Stenger - describing his conclusions - in a thread concerning assumptions. You can't rule out a designer, that's the whole point. All you can do is show that one isn't necessary. It doesn't. If something is amenable to science, it's natural. Like I said, any phenomenon could in reality be directly divine - so long as god's consistent, the phenomenon is classed as natural. Same reason there's no conflict beween naturalistic science and theism - they don't overlap. What you're confusing, Marc - what every theistic opponent of what science has to say regarding evolution confuses - is the existence of god with you being right . God can exist and you can still be wrong about all the little details you believe are tied up with him. Here, let me show you what I mean: I'm an atheist. Still, I'm prepared to admit I might be completely wrong about the existence of a god, a supreme being. You're a Christian. Are you prepared to admit that you might be right about the existence of god, but wrong about evolution? See? The existence or non-existence of god isn't the issue at all. What you care about is being right. That's both the strength and weakness of religious dogma: it's strong and durable because it proclaims itself to be the word of god, but it's also vulnerable because once you've made that claim, you're exposed on a lot of fronts concerning which ancient people were pretty ignorant. You find yourself having to defend something preposterous like six day creation because you've bet the farm on everything being true. More than that, you constantly compound your own inflexibility by vocally deriding science for changing its mind so much in the light of new evidence - so now you can't backpedal and do the same. You end up trying to swim with millstones around your neck. You think? How many possibilities for god's actions in the past do you eliminate if you insist the bible is true? And how many do you eliminate if you show it to be false? If I say I went out for a meal last night and then to the cinema, do I limit my historical actions more or less than if I say I didn't go out for a meal and then to the cinema?

Here is the FACT of what the ToE claims to represent in REALITY. It is undeniable that the very definition, shown here: What is it about THE PROCESS OF NATURAL SELECTION THROUGH RANDOM MUTATION THAT PROMOTES, OR ALLOWS FOR THE BELIEF OF AN INTELLIGENT CREATOR AT ALL IN YOUR OPINION? It denies the participation of a SUPREME BEING in any way of being responsible for the existence of any life on Earth at all, be it plant or animal. So the question isn't about proving or disproving God exists, Which science admits it cannot do, but simply acknowledging the part He played in the Creation of life on Earth which the Biological Theory of Evolution rejects out of hand. Now can you deny that what I'm saying is true and accurate? If so refute it with facts rather than just continuing to insist that I am wrong and you are right. And start with defining the NATURAL in selection and the RANDOM in mutation in regards to the existence of life on Earth and then tell me how my understanding is in error in any way.

But foundit, if christianity insisted we condemn cannibalism yet every time we took communion, you saw a pastor or priest cutting bits of flesh off of a sacrificed baby and the parishioners eating them, then i would have a hard time convincing you that my denials were true, wouldn't I? Well that's the problem I have with your claims that evolution doesn't deny the existence of God. You say that; yet the very definition of it bellies your claim. And rather than ramble on and repeat myself, I will let my earlier post above explain my position and ask you to objectively read that post and then explain to me what is wrong or inaccurate about it. I agree that it never vocally EXCLUDES God from existing. But it does imply that our existence came about by completely Natural forces that don't allow for a Creator God in any way.

"02-29-2008","10968",5,"Peeling","303700","An emotive but irrelevant question. Since there are no scientific tests I'm aware of that could even in principle evaluate the truth of the matter one way or the other, what are your grounds for suggesting such a contretemps might come to pass? And there, from a logical perspective, the similarity ends. It's very, very simple: one statement is positive (a flood happened) while the other is negative (evolution can't have happened via natural processes) You are, understandably, going to protest that we can phrase both claims positively: ""life was designed"". However, if you go back and read my little discourse on design further up, you can see that to claim life was designed is effectively to assert that some of the selection process occurred in the abstract rather than via natural processes. And since our definition of 'natural processes' includes anything testable, anything amenable to science, it follows that this 'abstract' or 'god' cannot be directly tested. We cannot check to see if god exists (positive claim) we can only test to see whether naturalistic explanations are insufficient (negative claim). That, we are already doing. All creation science does is jog alongside yelling ""We still don't know everything!"" It can't, by its own definition, contribute anything positive. We can and do, because we're interested in understanding what's really going on. Look at it this way for a moment: science looks for naturalistic explanations for phenomena, right? And it has peer review and a requirement for reproducible results to ensure those explanations aren't just made up, right?[ So if the creation hypothesis is correct, we'll hit something we can't find an explanation for, no matter how hard we try, right? Ok, now let's see what Creation Science buys us. Here we have some guys dilligently trying not to find naturalistic explanations for phenomena. They can be right, or they can be wrong. If they're right, then regular science won't find an answer even if we aren't listening to them. If they're wrong and we do listen to them, we won't find an answer even though one exists. I still don't understand the relevance of this book by Stenger - describing his conclusions - in a thread concerning assumptions. You can't rule out a designer, that's the whole point. All you can do is show that one isn't necessary. Same reason there's no conflict beween naturalistic science and theism - they don't overlap. What you're confusing, Marc - what every theistic opponent of what science has to say regarding evolution confuses - is the existence of god with you being right . God can exist and you can still be wrong about all the little details you believe are tied up with him. Here, let me show you what I mean: I'm an atheist. Still, I'm prepared to admit I might be completely wrong about the existence of a god, a supreme being. You're a Christian. Are you prepared to admit that you might be right about the existence of god, but wrong about evolution? See? The existence or non-existence of god isn't the issue at all. What you care about is being right. That's both the strength and weakness of religious dogma: it's strong and durable because it proclaims itself to be the word of god, but it's also vulnerable because once you've made that claim, you're exposed on a lot of fronts concerning which ancient people were pretty ignorant. You find yourself having to defend something preposterous like six day creation because you've bet the farm on everything being true. More than that, you constantly compound your own inflexibility by vocally deriding science for changing its mind so much in the light of new evidence - so now you can't backpedal and do the same. You end up trying to swim with millstones around your neck. You think? How many possibilities for god's actions in the past do you eliminate if you insist the bible is true? And how many do you eliminate if you show it to be false? If I say I went out for a meal last night and then to the cinema, do I limit my historical actions more or less than if I say I didn't go out for a meal and then to the cinema? Think about that for a bit.","marc9000","304047","There are all kinds of tests that could be performed to present evidence, both for and against claims of the holocaust, archeological testing in the areas where it was described to have taken place, genealogical testing of the people involved, etc. If there is no scientific way to test that, there certainly couldn't be any scientific way to test if there was a flood thousands of years ago. My grounds for suggesting that coming to pass is that it would have political and philosophical applications, just like the Biblical flood or other Biblical events. But since naturalism can't fill all the gaps, it does what it you're accusing ID of - it makes abstract assumptions, that life arose from non-living substances naturally. It does exactly what you accuse creation science of doing, it yells ""We still don't know everything"". The contributions are equal, from both worldviews. Searching for LACK of desigh contributes equally to a society as does searching FOR design. Yes, and you have, you can't find an explanation for the beginning of life. It's not fair to classify them that way. They are trying to study, with natural human limitations, how naturalism and the supernatural can be seen together. When it comes to guys dilligently trying NOT to find something, that designation goes to evolutionists, who refuse to consider ID. ID is not a designer search, it is a design search. There is a big difference. Check, so far that ones paning out pretty predictibly. Listening to them doesn't mean abandoning other ideas. It doesn't mean that godless evolution studies will be forbidden by the courts, in the public arena concerning funding and education. His conclusions are a result of his assumptions. He's shouting his very opinionated conclusions from the rooftops, and millions of impressionable minds are listening. Mainstream science winks and nods - it doesn't take exception to THIS side of scientific assumption, but it takes strong exception to the OTHER SIDE of scientific assumption, that there may be evidence for design. Why is there a desire to show that one isn't necessary? Not according to Stenger and Dawkins. If there's no conflict between naturalistic science and theism, then there should be plenty of conflict between naturalistic science and Stenger/Dawkins. We don't see it. We just see winks and nods. Those were two different questions. But I'm not as concerned about being right myself as I am with people in authority being wrong, and falsely teaching future generations to be wrong. I know you'll say that goes both ways. The difference is, mainstream science seeks to block ID legally. Representatives of ID don't indicate that they intend to legally block mainstream scientific evolution studies. Future generations should have a choice. Science changes it's mind in small ways, but its millstones, its inflexibility always shows up in its constant adoration of Darwin. You may have a point if all we were concerned with were God's actions of the past . But Christianity is largely about the present, and the future. The Bible says that God is eternal, unchangeable, omnipresent, omniscient, perfect, incomprehensible, holy, and good. If that's true, then the possiblities for his actions in the future would be pretty impressive, wouldn't they? Yet if what he said about his creation is false, maybe it would imply that his other attributes I referred to above could also be called into question.","regarding-assumptions","09:00 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","67"

You don't start explaining things to people who don't understand at a complex level. You are proof of this. We have failed because we tried to discuss evolution and science with you, who can't even figure out what theory actually means. In the same fashion, trying to explain an old Earth to nomads is idiotic and futile. Not a problem. Your logical skills are bad and hence you didn't think I already had an answer. Unfortunately I already had the answer to this problem at least two years ago, maybe longer. God is assumed and believed to exist out side of time. Therefore God knows what will be and what has happened before it created matter. Therefore, God knows what species will arise. Furthermore, since God is inherently incorporeal and has the ability to assume any form it so wishes, having the mechanism it created to produce species that it could fathom before creation doesn't result in any contradiction. Which Creation account? Literal? Figurative? Which story? If you take them figuratively, I don't see any problems. Literal you start running into a huge problems, and not just with evolution. Basic hydrology that is used by the Army Corp of Engineers and local water municipalities in managing water aquifers for use must be thrown out despite it being proven to be true for at least a hundred years. While it is true that some of radiology is based on assumptions, and these assumptions are based on a very old Earth and Universe, the same radiology is used to power nuclear reactors. If such assumptions were indeed false, that creates a problem of how such a field of study could have such massive problems yet use the same problem riddled methods to produce practical, tangible results. Pragmatism and commercial application largely prove much of the science based on old earth assumptions to be true. One of the major failings of creationists claims in my opinion is that there are no practical applications based on the so called 'science' of creation. If something was indeed true, one would be able to apply it to real world settings. Old Earth Geology is used by the oil industry. Old Earth hydrology by local municipalities. Evolutionary biology by big pharmaceuticals. The same methods used by biologists studying evolution are the same used in criminal forensics cases. As opposed to nothing by YEC 'science.' Evolution and the old Earth, (which are not dependent by the way) has relatively little to do with literal Creationism on its own. The existence of creation has no impact upon the actual truth of evolution. Evolution is never argued to be true on the basis of Creationism's wrongness, where Creationism is rarely argued to be true on the basis of its merits. I don't speak for God and neither should you. However, it is possible that evolution is merely a tool of God. Deism actually requires evolution (or something similar) as the Deistic set of Gods are not present and do not interfere.","regarding-assumptions","11:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","72"

Quite frankly, I think THIS is part of the problem that some Christians really have with science. If you take the ENTIRE bible literally, and it's an ""all or nothing"" deal where all of the bible has to be true or there is no god, then science has destroyed those specific religions. 1) Those religions make explicit claims regarding the age of the earth and life upon it, which are definitively (and incontrovertibly to anybody who doesn't act blind and deaf) wrong. 2) Those religions make explicit claims regarding some historic events, like the flood or god ""stopping the sun in the sky"". Also proven wrong by science. (And amusingly enough, the issue came up when religion attempted to USE science to prove them right...) And instead of addressing the ISSUES INVOLVED, typically what we see is a pointless attempt to attack science itself. ================================================== ======= Furthermore Archie, I noticed that you completely dropped discussion on my points showing evolution does not preclude the existence of A god. You tried to misrepresent other people's positions, but in the end you were left with nothing. But you're STILL going to run around claiming that evolution precludes the existence of God, aren't you...","regarding-assumptions","04:44 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","80"

"03-01-2008","10968",6,"electrolyte","304124","You know, Archie, I always wondered if you literally had trouble reading. I don't have to wonder anymore. Right on the front flap, found in the link you posted yourself to try to show that your buddy marc was right, is the proof that he is wrong. It can't be much more clear. A reviewer who read the book says that it only addresses the Judeo-Christian God. trebor pointed out that it doesn't aim to disprove an all-inclusive concept of a deity. The book jacket itself explains that it addresses only the Judeo-Christian God.","Archangel","304181","Before even responding to the meat of your response electrolyte, can I ask why you must insult my intelligence in every single response to me? Did I insult your intelligence in my response to you? Here it is: http://www.4forums.com/political/sho...9&postcount=77 And here is your response to mine. http://www.4forums.com/political/sho...4&postcount=78 So the question is; why so defensive lyte? Why the attacks and insults, the attempt at degradation and mockery when I posted my argument in such a non aggressive, low key way? What deep intellectual insecurity are you over compensating for? Maybe it's time for some serious introspection on your part. And are you so insecure in your own intelligence that you must attempt to intimidate the opposition by trying to make them feel inadequate? Well let me tell you; it doesn't work with me. It just perpetuates the bad blood that you so consistently nurture with your hateful and denigrating responses. Just 2 points to make in response to this drivel. 1) It isn't a reviewer who writes what's on the inside flaps of the book jacket, it's the Publisher outlining what the book promises to deliver. I would expect a College Graduate and an alleged school teacher to know such an obvious thing. And 2) In your debate with marc about your denial that this book attempted to disprove the existence of God, your claim that the concept of the Judeo Christian God being the sole focus of Stengler was wrong, as was Trebors claim. Only now that I have proven you wrong are you getting picky as to any particular God being referenced. In other words moving the goal posts and redefining the debate in order to try to save yourself. And beside that, this statement in the book flap which I posted in my last post refers to any creator, not just the Judeo Christian God, see? Stenger's book description say's, and I quote: Human endeavors fail to demonstrate the existence of a divine creator. He convincingly shows that not only is there no evidence for God, but scientific observations actually point to His nonexistence. So your claim that the Judeo Christian God is his only target is fallacious. Because right here where the statement is made, http://www.amazon.com/gp/sitbv3/read...sin=1591024811 he say's, and I quote: or, at least, some being with supernatural powers. So could his intentions be any more generic as to his belief in no supreme being of any name at all? So you go on and keep boasting and proclaiming victory as you redefine the debate to try to disguise your errors. I just have to post the truth and the links that support it and those who read these debates can make up their own minds. No matter how many times you try to cover your personal insecurities by implying my ignorance. FRONT FLAP: http://www.amazon.com/gp/sitbv3/read...sin=1591024811 BACK FLAP: http://www.amazon.com/gp/sitbv3/read...sin=1591024811 Now for electrolytes original claim which he is now redefining which some would call totally dishonest. [electrolyte post #74] Stenger and Dawkins use science to argue against specific conceptualizations of gods. You know what else is very interesting electrolyte? My front and back flap links work perfectly in my original post that I used them in; and we all know that when one uses the quote button to forward a post to respond to, that all links also forward perfectly. Yet, if anyone clicks on this link of your post which quoted my links to the front and back flaps of Stenglers book, strangely enough, the links don't work. http://www.4forums.com/political/sho...4&postcount=78 Why is that, electrolyte? If you trust what you contend to be true with such confidence, why would you disable, yet post the links so they appear to be available as evidence but are actually useless for the readers confirmation of what you claim? I will leave it up to the readers to decide what makes more sense, what you say, or what you do.","regarding-assumptions","05:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","82"

No, but your complete emotional breakdown is proof of two things; 1)Your position is weak, and 2)you would have a hard time as a lone poster against 10 or 20 creationists. The bottom line is, the book is a scientific atheist promotion. While it does sometimes single out the Judeo Christian God, because atheism is politically challanged by Judeo Christianity far more than any other religion, it is not friendly towards ANY supernatural entity in any way. Chapter 7, entitled; Do Our Values Come From God? begins; The religions of the world have laid claim to the role of arbiters of human behavior. And goes on to lament how the opinions of atheists, freethinkers, and humanists are rarely solicited. His view is clearly godless-, vs. The religions of the world ALL of them. Chapter 10 is entitled LIVING IN THE GODLESS UNIVERSE. The second to last paragraph of this chapter reads like this; [snip] Completely godless it tosses away any religion as it comes up, usually if not always using ""science"". In addition to taking one of your fellow non-believer's advice above, maybe you could show more tolerance for free speech?","electrolyte","304313","Not nearly as good as my advice for you and Archie (mostly Archie) to get real. Then attack my position. Go ahead. Refute my arguments, and do it with evidence instead of bald assertions that you've come to know and love so dearly. You're awfully bold to tell me that I need to relax when you've had to strain so hard to keep your head buried between your cheeks. Oh FFS. When will you give this persecution nonsense a rest? I use evidence. You and Archie don't, and you ignore the evidence I give you. You just repeat the same tripe over again. Scroll up. Can you deny that it explicitly aims at the Judeo-Christian God and not at every single imaginable version of a deity? Can you, marc? Answer the question. Use evidence if necessary. So what? You're not friendly toward Vishnu's existence, so does that take anything away from your arguments? Hell no. A view espoused here on this very forum, challenged by yours truly, and evaded like the plague by people on this very thread. Go figure. It's true, according to the history of this forum. ChristAscended and Archie went on the offense, I took them to town on their bigotry, and -- rather than discuss the topic or back up their numbskullery -- they ran. That is: even the loudmouths who pretend they want to talk about it won't listen. Funny, because many Buddhists are atheists. You'd rather we still explained lightning with Zeus? No, this is a serious question. Is science controversial only when it competes with your conceptualization of God? Because that certainly seems to be the case. It's not intolerance for free speech, it's intolerance for willful ignorance and willful stupidity. I just thought you might take the advice to stop arguing a point that is clearly and indisputably false. You somewhat have, in part at least because I made it so painfully clear to you. Now if only you'd quit squirming to defend the general assertion that doesn't matter anyway...","regarding-assumptions","11:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","86"
"03-04-2008","10968",7,"marc9000","304417","When I mentioned the title of chapter ""Living in the GODLESS universe"" did you consider it a ""bald assertion"" or was it evidence? You accept getting roasted to a crisp with about as much grace as your lil buddy obvious_child. The words ""Judeo Christianity"" appear nowhere on the cover of the book. The book is dishonest of course - it meanders back and fourth between any god and the Judeo Christian God just enough so that your claim can be argueably made, especially with lots of needling fallacies, coupled with a gang. At the top of page 234, under the heading of ""What gods remain"", it says this in the first paragraph, which sums it pretty well; Now, a believer is certainly free to argue that ""none of these Gods is my god."" I have nowhere claimed that I can rule out every conceivable god, just those with the selected empirically detectable attributes. If a believer's god does not have any of those attributes, then I have no quarrel with her. Now, a believer is certainly free to argue that ""none of these Gods is my god."" I have nowhere claimed that I can rule out every conceivable god, just those with the selected empirically detectable attributes. If a believer's god does not have any of those attributes, then I have no quarrel with her. One thing that stands out to me, is that he referred to God as a ""her"". Wonder if that was a fallacy, or just a militant atheist taunt? Would the scientific community that loves him give him an equal break if he'd have referred to God as black, or oriental? But mainly, he doesn't have a problem with any god that has NO ATTRIBUTES. To question it, results in RAGE from those who represent evolution.","electrolyte","304436","When I mentioned the boatloads of specific (Judeo-Christian) characteristics attributed to ""God"" in this book, was it bald assertion or was it evidence? I'll give you a hint: you can still go back and read the links. I don't know how I can possibly make this any clearer: the text makes it clear from the get-go that the main target is the Judeo-Christian-Islamic God. It stands to reason that this is the meaning of ""God"" that he uses throughout the book, and that view is supported by reading page 22. Swing and a miss. You see, marc, in order to get roasted, one has to be wrong. If you'd just read , you'd see that I'm not. Yes, folks, this is literally marc judging a book entirely by its cover. In marc's fantasyland, there's no need for actual text; we just read a title and we instantaneously know what we've for years foolishly required multiple, sometimes hundreds, sometimes thousands of pages to explain. Dear God ... can people really be this absolutely disconnected from reality, or is it all just an act? Right: the book is dishonest because it looks exactly like it's not arguing against all conceptualizations of god. Clearly, this is because it is trying to disprove all conceptualizations of god. Your evidence for this is that it looks exactly like it's not arguing against all conceptualizations of god. Therefore, the book is arguing against all conceptualizations of god. And this excerpt that explicitly shows that Stenger acknowledges that he hasn't disproved all conceptualizations of gods is proof that Stenger is trying to disprove all conceptualizations of God. F***ing hell, it's like slamming my head against a wall. Again, how the hell can I not expose your reading comprehension when you make these bonehead comprehension mistakes. When Stenger says ""her,"" he is referring to the believer. Frankly, I wonder why it's such a huge deal, unless the bigotry is based on the clear anti-female sentiment in the Bible. In fact, I don't see why the Christian God would have a sex at all (you know, except for the part about fabricating it all for humans' selfish reasons). Science can't disprove a deity that doesn't have testable effects. Period. Keep your religion out of the realm of science, and you keep your religion out of the line of fire. Frankly, you can't fault science for stepping on its toes. That's like my saying that I have every right to spend time in your foyer without having to follow your house rules, accomodate your living in the house, or acknowledge your existence in any way whatsoever. No, marc, what is aggravating is that you and Archie apparently don't know how to read, or think, or come to grips with reality. The book says exactly what I've said it does, and you even post excerpts to that fact, and yet here you are saying that I'm wrong. I'm sorry, I just can't fix that kind of willful stupidity.","regarding-assumptions","12:13 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","92"
