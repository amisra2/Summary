Seriously, if I was on the same forum with someone who agreed with me on everything, who used identical slang terms as myself, such as bah, bub, wha, demanded apologies from the same people, who, just before I had a chance, posted exactly the same thing I was going to say, Id genuinely want to check on meeting that person. Couldnt you set aside just one weekend, and meet at some halfway point, just to make absolutely sure this isnt some miraculous coincidence of two relatives coming together at exactly the same time on the same message board? You could meet at.a restaurant, surely you would both be familiar with some of the same restaurant names! It would be easy to recognize each other in the parking lot surely you drive the same kind and color of cars!! If one of you was late..the other could order for him!!! The possibilities would be endless!! It would be a miraculous as evolution!!!!!!!!!!!! As Tiikalik rosea crawling out of the ocean and gulping for air!!!! And then sprouting into a person!!!!!!!!","regarding-assumptions","09:04 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","76"

He convincingly shows that not only is there no evidence for God, but scientific observations actually point to His nonexistence.","Dane","304126","Yes? And the Scientific Evidence? What is the evidence for his portrayal of the function of Science? ""Pointing"" to anything is a bit vague, and certainly the Scientific Method itself seems to contradict this. Have you read up on and reviewed the Scientific Method lately? http://teacher.nsrl.rochester.edu/ph...AppendixE.html http://phyun5.ucr.edu/~wudka/Physics...www/node5.html http://wilstar.com/theories.htm Not that this should be necessary, as this is what you learn about Science in school. Really, it shouldn't be more than kind of a review for you. Maybe just a refresher, just to check out the things you didn't know about Science. Such as what the Scientific Method is, and other such apparent insignificances.","regarding-assumptions","01:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","79"
"03-01-2008","10968",6,"None","None","None","foundit66","304176","Originally Posted by Stenger's book's front flap In God: The Failed Hypothesis, Stenger argues that science has advanced sufficiently to make a definitive statement on the existence -- or nonexistence -- of the traditional Judeo-Christian-Islamic God . Quite frankly, I think THIS is part of the problem that some Christians really have with science. If you take the ENTIRE bible literally, and it's an ""all or nothing"" deal where all of the bible has to be true or there is no god, then science has destroyed those specific religions. 1) Those religions make explicit claims regarding the age of the earth and life upon it, which are definitively (and incontrovertibly to anybody who doesn't act blind and deaf) wrong. 2) Those religions make explicit claims regarding some historic events, like the flood or god ""stopping the sun in the sky"". Also proven wrong by science. (And amusingly enough, the issue came up when religion attempted to USE science to prove them right...) And instead of addressing the ISSUES INVOLVED, typically what we see is a pointless attempt to attack science itself. ================================================== ======= Furthermore Archie, I noticed that you completely dropped discussion on my points showing evolution does not preclude the existence of A god. You tried to misrepresent other people's positions, but in the end you were left with nothing. But you're STILL going to run around claiming that evolution precludes the existence of God, aren't you...","regarding-assumptions","04:44 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","80"

"03-01-2008","10968",6,"electrolyte","304124","You know, Archie, I always wondered if you literally had trouble reading. I don't have to wonder anymore. Right on the front flap, found in the link you posted yourself to try to show that your buddy marc was right, is the proof that he is wrong. It can't be much more clear. A reviewer who read the book says that it only addresses the Judeo-Christian God. trebor pointed out that it doesn't aim to disprove an all-inclusive concept of a deity. The book jacket itself explains that it addresses only the Judeo-Christian God.","Archangel","304181","Before even responding to the meat of your response electrolyte, can I ask why you must insult my intelligence in every single response to me? Did I insult your intelligence in my response to you? Here it is: http://www.4forums.com/political/sho...9&postcount=77 And here is your response to mine. http://www.4forums.com/political/sho...4&postcount=78 So the question is; why so defensive lyte? Why the attacks and insults, the attempt at degradation and mockery when I posted my argument in such a non aggressive, low key way? What deep intellectual insecurity are you over compensating for? Maybe it's time for some serious introspection on your part. And are you so insecure in your own intelligence that you must attempt to intimidate the opposition by trying to make them feel inadequate? Well let me tell you; it doesn't work with me. It just perpetuates the bad blood that you so consistently nurture with your hateful and denigrating responses. Just 2 points to make in response to this drivel. 1) It isn't a reviewer who writes what's on the inside flaps of the book jacket, it's the Publisher outlining what the book promises to deliver. I would expect a College Graduate and an alleged school teacher to know such an obvious thing. And 2) In your debate with marc about your denial that this book attempted to disprove the existence of God, your claim that the concept of the Judeo Christian God being the sole focus of Stengler was wrong, as was Trebors claim. Only now that I have proven you wrong are you getting picky as to any particular God being referenced. In other words moving the goal posts and redefining the debate in order to try to save yourself. And beside that, this statement in the book flap which I posted in my last post refers to any creator, not just the Judeo Christian God, see? Stenger's book description say's, and I quote: Human endeavors fail to demonstrate the existence of a divine creator. He convincingly shows that not only is there no evidence for God, but scientific observations actually point to His nonexistence. So your claim that the Judeo Christian God is his only target is fallacious. Because right here where the statement is made, http://www.amazon.com/gp/sitbv3/read...sin=1591024811 he say's, and I quote: or, at least, some being with supernatural powers. So could his intentions be any more generic as to his belief in no supreme being of any name at all? So you go on and keep boasting and proclaiming victory as you redefine the debate to try to disguise your errors. I just have to post the truth and the links that support it and those who read these debates can make up their own minds. No matter how many times you try to cover your personal insecurities by implying my ignorance. FRONT FLAP: http://www.amazon.com/gp/sitbv3/read...sin=1591024811 BACK FLAP: http://www.amazon.com/gp/sitbv3/read...sin=1591024811 Now for electrolytes original claim which he is now redefining which some would call totally dishonest. [electrolyte post #74] Stenger and Dawkins use science to argue against specific conceptualizations of gods. You know what else is very interesting electrolyte? My front and back flap links work perfectly in my original post that I used them in; and we all know that when one uses the quote button to forward a post to respond to, that all links also forward perfectly. Yet, if anyone clicks on this link of your post which quoted my links to the front and back flaps of Stenglers book, strangely enough, the links don't work. http://www.4forums.com/political/sho...4&postcount=78 Why is that, electrolyte? If you trust what you contend to be true with such confidence, why would you disable, yet post the links so they appear to be available as evidence but are actually useless for the readers confirmation of what you claim? I will leave it up to the readers to decide what makes more sense, what you say, or what you do.","regarding-assumptions","05:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","82"

"03-02-2008","10968",6,"marc9000","304192","Might that not be good advice for you? No, but your complete emotional breakdown is proof of two things; 1)Your position is weak, and 2)you would have a hard time as a lone poster against 10 or 20 creationists. The bottom line is, the book is a scientific atheist promotion. While it does sometimes single out the Judeo Christian God, because atheism is politically challanged by Judeo Christianity far more than any other religion, it is not friendly towards ANY supernatural entity in any way. Chapter 7, entitled; Do Our Values Come From God? begins; The religions of the world have laid claim to the role of arbiters of human behavior. And goes on to lament how the opinions of atheists, freethinkers, and humanists are rarely solicited. His view is clearly godless-, vs. The religions of the world ALL of them. Chapter 10 is entitled LIVING IN THE GODLESS UNIVERSE. The second to last paragraph of this chapter reads like this; [snip] Completely godless it tosses away any religion as it comes up, usually if not always using ""science"". In addition to taking one of your fellow non-believer's advice above, maybe you could show more tolerance for free speech?","electrolyte","304313","Not nearly as good as my advice for you and Archie (mostly Archie) to get real. Then attack my position. Go ahead. Refute my arguments, and do it with evidence instead of bald assertions that you've come to know and love so dearly. You're awfully bold to tell me that I need to relax when you've had to strain so hard to keep your head buried between your cheeks. Oh FFS. When will you give this persecution nonsense a rest? I use evidence. You and Archie don't, and you ignore the evidence I give you. You just repeat the same tripe over again. Scroll up. Can you deny that it explicitly aims at the Judeo-Christian God and not at every single imaginable version of a deity? Can you, marc? Answer the question. Use evidence if necessary. So what? You're not friendly toward Vishnu's existence, so does that take anything away from your arguments? Hell no. A view espoused here on this very forum, challenged by yours truly, and evaded like the plague by people on this very thread. Go figure. It's true, according to the history of this forum. ChristAscended and Archie went on the offense, I took them to town on their bigotry, and -- rather than discuss the topic or back up their numbskullery -- they ran. That is: even the loudmouths who pretend they want to talk about it won't listen. Funny, because many Buddhists are atheists. You'd rather we still explained lightning with Zeus? No, this is a serious question. Is science controversial only when it competes with your conceptualization of God? Because that certainly seems to be the case. It's not intolerance for free speech, it's intolerance for willful ignorance and willful stupidity. I just thought you might take the advice to stop arguing a point that is clearly and indisputably false. You somewhat have, in part at least because I made it so painfully clear to you. Now if only you'd quit squirming to defend the general assertion that doesn't matter anyway...","regarding-assumptions","11:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","86"
