"09-03-2010","14586",1,"None","None","None","Iuris","411455","The same point as gravity: it doesn't need one. Evolution happens, and provides its own purpose. Things that are better at surviving survive, and that's it, at the core. It is an observable natural phenomenon in the present. Traces in the material world also indicate that it has been going on for quite a while. As for why bother with it, mostly, because it's useful. Understanding the world around us gives us the ability to control it or adapt to it better, and that understanding also applies to the past history of the world and its inhabitants and to the processes and where they might lead in the future. Lastly, why bother if death is the end? Well, for one thing, there's this thing called life before it, and it sure matters. For another, one may recognize that even if they themselves die, they may leave a legacy, the same way that we have inherited, or rather, ARE, the legacy of our ancestors. As for religion, religions are applying restrictions on us. Whether it be a global thing like disallowing certain research and medical procedures I could benefit from or local, like my petty gripe with every village in the area deciding they just HAVE to buy a new set of church bells, out of sheer prestige, and me personally knowing that I HAD to contribute money to our own new set of bells or be ostracized - money that could well have, at the time, been spent on things like finally finishing the canalization that had been waiting for further funds.","there-point-evolution","04:15 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","3"

"09-03-2010","14586",1,"None","None","None","unkerpaulie","411485","Luris pretty much covered it already. Evolution is a theory that attempts to explain how a certain observed phenomenon works. Just like any other theory. If an explanation that better explains what is observed comes up, the theory is revised. And evolution doesn't teach anything about what happens after you die. In fact, there aren't even theories of what happens after you die, because there is no observed phenomenon. There is only creative speculation.","there-point-evolution","07:42 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","6"

His whole point was about how life would be better. Medical science is not held back by a few Jehovah's Witnesses refusing blood transfusion. If all people believed evolution then obvious problems would arise. The ""eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we die"" attitude would be rampant. There would be absolutely no point in helping your fellow man because this life (wich you have wasted far too much of arguing for evolution) is all that there is and you must make the most of it. There would be no sense of morals left in life because, heck, everything is relative right? Say that after someone steals your wallet.","there-point-evolution","03:21 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","9"

You idiotic religious people think that since you have faith in god that you automatically understand everything and you clearly do not understand anything. Your a joke.","there-point-evolution","04:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","10"
"09-04-2010","14586",1,"fartingle","411536","And yet you can already see it anywhere you go. All you must do is imagine it intensified. Again... Ad hominem attacks are not arguements, in fact they show that you have come to an end of reasoning and must resort to insults.","Accipiter","411538","What I see everywhere I go is the result of religion. You people have had 4,000 years to get it right but we continuous to have poverty, war, strife, inequality at a rampant level, why is that? Why doesn't your way work? Do people just not listen to your message and do what you want them to do, is that the problem?","there-point-evolution","04:37 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","12"

I compare crime statistics of Japan vs. the U.S., and I see AT LEAST a five-fold difference in violent crimes and property crimes. I look at statistics and I see a marked difference in teenage pregnancies, STDs, etc. Japan has much less crime, much less teenage pregnancies and STDs, a smaller mortality rate and a higher life expectancy. I also noticed that Japan has over a 90% acceptance of evolution and is less than 5% Christian. Nope, I don't ""see it anywhere you go"", what I see is a typical creationist strawman depicting evolutionary biology as some sort of moral code rather than what it actually is: an explanation for some biological mechanisms in nature.","there-point-evolution","04:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","13"

The truth is that there are christians who believe in God and afterlife, and acknowledge evolution as fact. Besides that, you may not believe this, but in many ways theists, with all their morals, display more disregard for their fellow humans than atheists. Religious followers have a history of violence and oppressive dogma that they put into practice whenever they get the opportunity. There are probably more wars initiated by religious dogma than secular reasons. Plus, because religious followers are programmed to believe that death is their ticket to an existence much better than their life on earth, they are willing to die in sacrifice for their religious cause, getting to go to heaven, and leaving a legacy of martyrdom for their follow religious followers. But we are talking about evolution, not atheism, aren't we?","there-point-evolution","07:03 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","14"

I could be wrong so bear with me. It appears to me that you are suggesting that for the non theist ToE fulfils the same conceptual space as religion does for the religious. I subscribe to ToE in the same way I subscribe to Germ Theory or Thermodynamics. It has no bearing on how I approach life or people, but nor does the fact I also subscribe to the Fundamental Attribution Error being real. Further down you post something along the lines that by subscribing to ToE as a theory for allele change over time that one has to throw out morality. I subscribe to ToE and to be fair, I think I'm a pretty decent person. I'm a therapist and I'v spent the last 6 years helping other people through traumatic times in their life. All that and still subscribing to ToE. This alone voids your point, I hope you can see. As you can see by some of the other posts there is no point to ToE any more than there is a point to Boyle's Law. ToE is not a reason or cause for organisms evolving it is a description of natural history; very much like Boyle's Law describes volume and pressure of gases. Basically when organisms change over myriad generations ToE tells us how. It does not pertain to origins or morality or religion: it describes a phenomena as best as we can at this point in time. And yes, it is subject to change because scientist acknowledge that we could be wrong. Best wishes, Larni.","there-point-evolution","11:11 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","15"
