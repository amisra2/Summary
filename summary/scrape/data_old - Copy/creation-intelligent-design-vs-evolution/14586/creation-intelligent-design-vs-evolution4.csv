"09-10-2010","14586",4,"unkerpaulie","411847","Therefore no rule was absolute, even for Jesus. Therefore even though the bible is supposed to be inerrant, when we find errors we call them parables or allegory, to continue the delusion that the bible is inerrant. Therefore killing in cold blood is ok if the person you're killing is really evil. Therefore its ok to kill people for chasing you and teasing you. Our good friend Onan (gen 38) was killed because he practiced pulling out as birth control. Now Onan was the second son of Judah, and was given his brothers wife because his brother (Judah's first born) was killed for being wicked. After Onan was also killed, the wife was supposed to be saved for his 3rd son, who wasn't old enough yet. Now, if that wasn't enough drama, after Judah's wife died, Judah went to hang out with his buddies and picked up a hooker, got her pregnant, and later caught her and planned to have her killed for being a whore. The whore in question ended up being his very daughter-in-law (who he had promised for his son) in disguise. And the clever woman kept his personal belongings as a bargaining chip, just in case Judah tried to have her killed, which is exactly what he did, and it saved her life. So let's see.... Murder your kids, fornicate with your in-law, lie to your son, sleep with a whore. And none of this displeased God. Therefore, anything you do is ok, as long as you tell yourself God told you to do it. Therefore its ok to kill people for a made up reason if you estimate that hardly anybody (relatively, I suppose) is gonna do it. Therefore its ok to kill people that worship a different God than yours. Therefore its ok to kill people, even family members, if some guy says God said to do it Read exodus 12:35-36 again. They were instructed by moses to ask for gold and silver jewelry and clothes from the egyptians, and that was before the final plague. Moses knew fully that he was instructing them to ask for items they had no intention of returning. This was how they plundered egypt on their way out. So therefore its ok to steal if a guy tells you that God said to do it. You mean Abraham, and yes that's what happened. The act of adultery wasn't what God punished him for, but the lack of faith that his old wife would bear him a son. The adultery itself apparently God really didn't have a problem with. From what I know, adultery is being married and sleeping with somebody else. Abraham wasn't married to his wife's maid. If the commandments are absolute, then wouldn't the sabbath commandment, which instructs us to do no work on the sabbath, be still in force? Or is it ok to not observe the sabbath? Maybe I'm still a little confused about this absolute morality thing....","fartingle","412010","It is an absolute rule. The situation it is used in is what changes. No, when Jesus said it was a parable, then it was a parable. What errors are you talking about? We have the death penalty in America which is for killing 2+ people. This man had killed thousands and was on the run from justice. ""Cold blood"" is not just about whether or not a person is attacking you. More like attacking. People back then were not the non-violent protest type. Having an heir was one of the most important things in life for them. It was the law that the next brother must help produce an heir for a dead brother. You say it was condoned but the son was killed. She blackmailed Judah because he had lied to her. Instances like this, the descendants always become a thorn in the side of Israel. Breaking the law always has consequences. When those gods cause you to sacrifice children and the prophets bleed themselves as worship, and it is a viral pagan religion that immediately infects Israel unless the evil is destroyed. You think those who get the death penalty are never the family of anybody? If someone is evil, it does not matter who they are. It still never says ""borrow"", and they were very much willing to give it to the Isrealites to get them out of Egypt. Yes I meant Abraham. Also the 10 commandments were given long after Abraham. Actually he was. They did not have elaborate ceremonies back then. Do not most people get the day off work on Sundays? There are absolute morals and laws that lead to the absolute standard: perfection. They were created in the knowledge that no man can ever be perfect. That is why we need God to save us, and why we cannot save ourselves. It is not a ""that guy broke a commandment so they must not be absolute"" kind of thing.","there-point-evolution","03:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","47"

I'm here if you have questions","fartingle","412012","It is more like this: Joe kills Bob, rapes his wife, steals his money, and sacrifices Bob's children to a pagan god then says God told him to... then Joe is executed for his crimes.","there-point-evolution","03:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","48"
"09-10-2010","14586",4,"Penfold","411850","The Roman Catholic Church represents more than one billion Christians in total, as opposed to the 600m Protestant minority. Africa is not a country. It is a continent, comprising 54 countries.","fartingle","412015","Catholicism and Christianity could not be farther apart. There are not Christians in the Catholic church, there are Catholics; if there are Christians then it is in spite of their teachings. It is not the entire continent that has those problems. The arguement still holds. How is the Catholic church supposed to stop 1 country from getting them, much less that many?","there-point-evolution","03:59 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","49"
"09-10-2010","14586",4,"Freedom","411858","It is apparent that such a discussion will ultimately end in 'can you prove that the catholic church knows the will of God'","fartingle","412016","If it leads to that particularly, I think I have made clear we would agree that the answer is ""no they do not"".","there-point-evolution","04:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","50"
