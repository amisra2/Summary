Their belief is that death is the end. If that is end for everyone regardless of religion then why waste your breath (or key-strokes as is the case here)?","pandion","411643","Where on earth did you find the idea that evolution is a church? What an bizarre and ignorant idea. Further, the study of biological evolution doesn't attempt to teach that there is nothing more than the material. You, apparently, haven't bothered to learn the difference between philosophical materialism and methodological materialism. Philosophical materialism is a philosophic view of the world. Methodological materialism is a method of investigation that proposed natural explanations for natural events. To whom are you referring? Certainly not scientists. There are many theistic scientists who believe in an afterlife. Moreover, such concepts have no application in science, at least until the day that you can offer some non-supernatural evidence for such afterlife.","there-point-evolution","01:44 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","16"

Third, I did not say that ALL people are evil just because they do not have religion (though technically I believe that all people, myself included, are depraved and vile which is why we need a Savior), and alot of people who ""have religion"" are evil. What I am saying is that there would start to be an attitude of ""every man for himself"". To go deeper, this would soon result in majority induced ""equality"" a.k.a. Communism, Socialism, and in some places Fascism. These have always come after a country adopts ""reason"" as their only belief.

"09-06-2010","14586",2,"None","None","None","unkerpaulie","411706","Fartingdale, if you stop and think about it, theistic morality is no different from atheistic morality. The underlying roots are the same, even though it may seem that the motivation is different on the surface. From an evolutionary perspective, man is a social animal that seeks survival and reproduction just like any other animal. However, we have highly complex social orders. It is in the best interest of humans to be ""kind"" and ""love your neighboors"" because it cultivates a safe and comfortable social environment. However, there are individuals that would think to seek their own interest at the detriment of the group. You might call them sins, but really they are actions that cause legitimate threats to social order and harmony. So laws are put in place. In religion, violating these laws could send you to hell, so people are convicted by self-induced guilt or by their local peers, and possibly ostracized from their church group. Its a damn good system, though not perfect, it saves a lot of overhead. In the secular arena, violators also face public rejection and go through the self-induced guilt of knowing they've done something wrong. However the consequences are faced while you are alive, for serious offences, rather than after you die. Like I said, on the surface, the motivation seem different. Rather than doing what is socially beneficial because you fear unimaginable eternal suffering in hell, the non-religious do what is right because they appreciate the natural benefits of a peacful and orderly living environment. Fartingdale, you are saying that somehow religious morality is above that of atheistic morality because the threat of hell (which is the only difference) makes your system better. In fact, you seem to think that if people are not programmed to believe in a supernatural judgement hanging over their heads in the afterlife, they are incapable of self-directed moral action. The reality is, believing that you are doing what is right in the hope of getting a grand reward for yourself eventually does not in any form make you morality superior to the person that does what is right because the welfare of himself and his social community depends on it.","there-point-evolution","06:48 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","21"

"09-07-2010","14586",2,"Freedom","411723","They are fundamentally different, theistic morality is absolute. atheistic morality (as you mean it) is not absolute, it has exceptions because as long as morality is a means to an end it is only valid so long as a person believes a specific case will lead to that end. If Joe thinks that his creator and ruler of heaven and earth commands him not to kill bob, there is no circumstance nor case nor argument he could make to himself to defy that. If Joe thinks that the general gene frequencies of his species typically benefit from cooperation he will not kill bob so long as he doesn't convince himself bob is no longer beneficial to the race provided he even cares about the race. and those who truly believe this will act as animals. You say they will not and point to the fact that they do not but I say that is only because we yet have laws that recognize no exception except the slow process of democratic change.","unkerpaulie","411730","Thank you for illustrating the point I was going to make to counter what you said about absolute morality. God's commandments are absolute and unchanging, unless God decides to change his mind, which God reserves the right to do at anytime without notice or explanation. Theistic morality is directly given by God (as long as you are totally convinced that God told you so), and always absolute, except when God tells you to do the opposite, which is also absolute. In the bible every one of the commandments, which are all absolute, had exceptions. God commanded his people to kill numerous times, encouraged the Israelites to steal just before they left Egypt, and never penalized Abraham or commiting adultery. And we don't even have to talk about keeping the sabbath. So you're right, there is a fundamental difference. In your example, Joe doesn't need to rationalize why he should kill Bob, he only needs to be convinced in his mind that God told him to kill Bob. And that's why theistic morality is far superior to atheistic morality, because obeying God's orders (that you tell yourself is God's orders) is much better than using your own reasoning. I don't say we won't act as animals. We do. We act as highly socialized animals instinctively motivated by survival and reproduction. And we pursue these motivations by very complex methods. Part of the method is the establishment of legal, judicial and government systems. And yes, its complcated, slow, and basically imperfect. Maybe you're not aware of this, but religion is also one of the systems established to attempt to control our natural behavior. It is an ancient version of our legal, judicial and government system, and in some places is still followed. Its simpler, quite inaccurate, and basically imperfect as well. If you think that your system of behavioral control is superior to mine, I'd like to know why.","there-point-evolution","09:47 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","24"

Yet, there is so very little agreement about what that absolute is. There is so much variation among the people who claim morality is an absolute, the only conclusion is that the theist is projecting their own concepts on to God, rather than admitting it is relative to them.

The concept of God and the bible are not objectivly inseparable. 2.

The only time it changes is when it says not to purposely offend other people because different people are offended by different things. I said before not to throw all ""religions"" into a group. I would never consider Islam a standard for anything. They are if you are a Christian. The Bible claims to be inerrant so it must either be truth or lies, not parables (except those that Jesus specifically used). Yes on multiple levels. I would also call them liars for having a pope, teaching extra-Biblical ideas (infant baptism, confession to a priest, Mary worship, rosary beads, ""holy artifacts"", works based salvation, ...the pope), and all such things. Are you saying self-contradiction can be correct? Actually, you just come to hate your own evil. It is not out of fear. I also hate the evil of others. Not the person, but only their sin. I think it has been Easyrider's mistake to promote the ""turn or die"" idea (though I do agree with it) in this way. To make an anecdote (or parable, if you will), it is like having the cure for cancer. Imagine you have the cure and you see someone dying that you could save. Now when you bring it to him, he smacks it out of your hand saying ""I don't have cancer"". Now Easy's approach has been ""YES YOU DO!"" while the correct way to go is to do your best to convince him of his sickness. (slightly off topic because of the ""fearing hell"" comment, but now you understand our position a bit more). When you play a game that is free-for-all only one person wins, right? Now put it on a much grander scale. You now have far more losers with how few winners you have. Eventually the people who say, ""Well that's not fair!"" will come together and appoint someone to enforce ""equality"". Yet it never happened in the Bible. The commandment says not to ""murder"" which is killing people in cold-blood. The Israelites were attacked by most of the people, and the rest were nations of people who worshipped idols that demanded warfare and child sacrifice (ex. Baal, Molech, and Ashera) The Egyptians willingly gave silver and gold so the Israelites would hurry up and leave. It was common back then to have a wife and concubines to produce an heir. It was not adultery (his wife even gave him her servant). No, we don't. The Sabbath was never about doing no work until the pharisees and saducees made it so.

Well in that case, we have good grounds to throw all religions into a group [Quote]They are if you are a Christian. Except, of course, when the inerrant account of the bible has been found to be errant, such as the creation account. In that case, it becomes obvious that such account was also written as a parable. Hmmm..... And that's because driving a tent stake through a sleeping man's head, calling bears to maul kids, or executing a man for not impregnating his sister-in-law are all legit acts of war. And we're not even talking about corporal punishment for things like disobeying your parents or cheating on your husband. And let's look at the wars themselves. When moses sent the armies into war, he commanded the soldiers (well, he told them God said, of course) to kill everybody and everything. Not just defeat the soldiers on the battle field, but to the residences to kill the women, kids, animals and even crops and property (often they spared the virgins and kept them as captives, apparently they were the exceptions to the exceptions). The passage in exodus 32: 25-29 is particularly interesting. Moses tells the israelites to choose if they wanted to follow him or not. Some chose to follow, some chose not to. Then Moses tells the following side to arm themselves and kill the non-followers, even if they were family to the following side. He even blessed the men that slaughtered their family members for the cause. So if you ask someone to borrow their stuff, and have no intention of returning it, its ok, as long as they willingly gave their stuff to you at the time. Well you must have a different definition of adultery than me then. It was precisely about not doing work. After the order God established with the creation week, God rested on the sabbath, did no work, and made it a special day. Read exodus 20: 8-11 again. That's fine.
