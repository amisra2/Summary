I am pretty sure at this point you are just amusing yourself by refusing to communicate reasonably and that you have no alternative, that you think it is a yes or no question and that you are simply wasting time as some kind of sick play with the freedom game. You have answered every question with a foggy near mystic answer even ones where that could not possibly be sublime.","there-point-evolution","08:08 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","94"
"09-13-2010","14586",7,"fartingle","412010","It is an absolute rule. The situation it is used in is what changes. No, when Jesus said it was a parable, then it was a parable. What errors are you talking about? We have the death penalty in America which is for killing 2+ people. This man had killed thousands and was on the run from justice. ""Cold blood"" is not just about whether or not a person is attacking you. More like attacking. People back then were not the non-violent protest type. Having an heir was one of the most important things in life for them. It was the law that the next brother must help produce an heir for a dead brother. You say it was condoned but the son was killed. She blackmailed Judah because he had lied to her. Instances like this, the descendants always become a thorn in the side of Israel. Breaking the law always has consequences. When those gods cause you to sacrifice children and the prophets bleed themselves as worship, and it is a viral pagan religion that immediately infects Israel unless the evil is destroyed. You think those who get the death penalty are never the family of anybody? If someone is evil, it does not matter who they are. It still never says ""borrow"", and they were very much willing to give it to the Isrealites to get them out of Egypt. Yes I meant Abraham. Also the 10 commandments were given long after Abraham. Actually he was. They did not have elaborate ceremonies back then. Do not most people get the day off work on Sundays? There are absolute morals and laws that lead to the absolute standard: perfection. They were created in the knowledge that no man can ever be perfect. That is why we need God to save us, and why we cannot save ourselves. It is not a ""that guy broke a commandment so they must not be absolute"" kind of thing.","unkerpaulie","412239","Perfect, no argument here. You've just justified every instance of God's people breaking his absolute laws. like I said, NOTHING about the absolute laws in the bible are absolute. They are all broken at will, and anytime you want to break them, and you have a justification you're personally happy with, then its ok to break them.","there-point-evolution","05:33 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","95"

It only goes against what you have decided it means. They are absolute. Those who break them are punished.
