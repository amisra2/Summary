In other words, you don't know. Contrasting that, evolution explains all kinds of stuff that helps us. Not only that but the benefit to us is instantaneously recognizable. Darwin knew going in that evolution would be of benefit to us and could explain many things we see in the world around us, otherwise I think he would have seen it as a waste of time and probably not pursued it.

Benedict I'm still waiting for your previous post as categorical propositions. You've got a very bad strain of pragmatism there, people do not pursue scientific truth because the individual idea is helpful but because truth is helpful, and by the same token the non-true no matter how helpful it might be if true is always useless. (which is essentially what Benedict just said but in general form) Irrational evolution hasn't helped anyone anywhere, it's just deluded a large portion of the populace. Finally, I did not say I don't know; my position benefits us because it saves us from the harm of believing a false-hood.

I think modern biology would be totally fine without rational evolution much less irrational evolution. A machine works as it does regardless of it's origin. We only know to expect homology when we see homology but to exult evolution supporters will wire that through common descent to give the impression that common descent gave some useful insight. Those who literally think evolution has some kind of practical use need to be told that you can wake up in the morning without calling the ceiling evolution. They have to say insane things like inheritance is evolution and since we need to understand inheritance we must understand evolution. In fact the best example someone could possibly give to that point would be researchers considering the adaptation of bacteria to anti-biotics. To explain that they would need rational evolution, but why do they need to explain it? As everyone keeps telling me it makes no predictions, all they can do is say that the thing might change again in the future.... so much for the foundation of all biology.

That would be a better situation than the reality, the 'theory' is so enshrouded by mystical allusions and fawning awe that to call the irrational parts theory at all is unfair to all theories. You can see in this back and forth with bennedict the nature of the issue, he alternates between saying I don't understand the evolutionary theory and saying evolutionary theory is not contradicted by what I say. He says things like 'no real scientist thinks otherwise'. So I using IC analysis am arguing that evolutionary theory does not explain/predict all that it is claimed to, how do I know that it's being claimed? The two questions I just asked of bennedict testify to the fact that some do believe it is an operational theory of life. You can say no evolutionary biologist would make the mistakes I argue against, but you can't have it both ways. The mistakes I argue against are the fallacies IC exposes, if they didn't make them then IC would be nothing new or incorrect and all opposition to behe would take the form of attacking the false dichotomy he presents. That does not occur, and the simplest explanation is that they do make those mistakes and they accept the false dichotomy. Bottom line the most accurate way to describe the conclusion of my argument is that evolution is not what many want/believe/hope it to be. It does not explain advancement (the addition of biotechnology i.e. novel systems). Life has advanced and thus it does not explain life before the first cell, after the first cell, even up till the most recent addition. Now the confusion about what the theory is, is again entirely the fault of this intellectual fog that people cover it with. The word evolution is used in a multitude of senses and equivocated when necessary. Sometimes it is merely a term defined as a species changing over time (the only way species can change over time gene frequencies). There is nothing bad or incorrect about a description like that but it doesn't explain anything anymore than calling a bolt metal explains how to cast one. It is used to mean the event in which any mutation is selected, which does explain something; why the mutation was spread and endured, but it does not explain the change the mutation made itself, or any number of those changes. The 'theory' as a whole relies on the human ability to scale a pattern for it's explicative power, in this case scaling the process of mutation and natural selection produces a 'sense' that things will keep getting better because 'bad' is being filtered out. Such an effect over a long time will accumulate into a lot of good it seems and this 'reasonability' by all evidence is the substance of the layman's understanding. That however is a vague and imprecise understanding. The IC analysis is more formal and precise essentially by categorizing and defining what exactly good means in evolution, and examining what accumulates and why. To explain the final result you need to explain both the change and why it's still around. You can't do the former with one random occurrence likelihood irrelevant. You need to show that it is non-random occurrence or an accumulation of non-random occurrences and that can only be accomplished by natural selection. Thus to actually explain any change (we aren't sub-specifying types right now) you need to show that it is the result of a series of non-random selections. Thus you can't have explanation for a single mutation selection pair. Second it means that whether or not the final product is explained is dependent on selection events, specifically whether those selection events do non-randomly explain it's formation. IC is all this plus the observation that while some series of selections can explain the end products others cannot. Now given that evolution is used constantly to explain structures and changes of all sorts it can be reasonably stated that the prior two usages of the word are irrelevant and confusing, used only for their value in equivocating. The ignorant amateur who's going to hurl blind insults to defend what he doesn't understand.

Turn No: 2: Accipiter:
No body who agrees with evolution wants, believes and hopes it to be true, they agree with it because it makes sense and agrees with observations. You make it sound as if there is some kind of conspiracy to get people to accept evolution. My question is what would be the point of that, what would their motivation be?
Turn No:3
Freedom:
Irrational evolution does agree with observations but it does not make sense following the pattern of thousands of incorrect theories and explanations before it. As I said in the scientific conspiracy thread, an unconscious one yes. The kind that forms when any group of associated people believe firmly in something. The same kind that formed around Rand & her novels during her life. You've got to understand that it's not sinister to make plans if you don't believe what you're doing is wrong. It's like saying a school board meeting is a conspiracy to educate children. Yet I would characterize the behavior of religious education as a concerted effort to condition faith into students, borderline brainwashing but I couldn't very well accuse them of malice unless I were to doubt their own belief in the worth of faith. That's a bit of a silly question as you addressed the answer at the top, their motivation is that they want and hope it to be true so that they can have a supposedly working theory of life. For anyone who believes in the false dichotomy between ID and evolution, it's a philosophical requirement to replace a creation myth with a scientific theory before they can abandon belief in the supernatural. The motivation is the age old temptation of explaining something you aren't actually able to via intellectual shortcuts. I think we both agree that the origin of religion is essentially a mental short-circuit in which people simply (and probably unconsciously) became frustrated with their ignorance, especially about the truth value of morality and concatenated stories that 'explained' the world around them and most importantly explained themselves. Why would someone say god may the heaven's and the earth? What was their motivation? Why is sickness caused by an imbalance of the elements? Why would someone draw a map of a flat planet when they've never seen the edges?

It is not the revival of an ancient system which also accomplishes the function.

Yet we know that since all systems have not always existed they must have come into existence and thus had a formation event.

The scale involved is unimportant except to the odds of spontaneous generation. Dog breeding may have produced a great deal of diversity but as of yet no one's tried to construct novel systems with it. That is conceivable for people to do because we can have a final system in mind and select for something that is not naturally beneficial merely because it moves towards the system we are trying to build.

Let me clarify, no money is being offered to tell lies; no scientist think of themselves as liars. I should not have said lying, I should have said many scientist are breaking with the scientific method in part because of the political and economic forces surrounding AGCC. The effect is produced because money is offered into researching mans effect on global climate change. This attracts scientist who expect a correlation, or who more specifically consider 'no clear correlation' as a failure of their research. I know the philosophical forces behind the hope that AGCC is correct but many cannot as they are mired in the same currents to some degree. It has gotten to a point where many colleges and universities offer specific courses on 'environmental science', which simply assumes the assertions of AGCC to say the least. I know you understand this affect because you see it in people like easyrider, if you go to school with people who all assume something is true beyond doubt; and study subjects like theology which would have no meaning without these assumptions, you are likely going to be irrevocably biased if asked to conduct research based on the skills you learned at school. Now biased people can be good scientist, because science doesn't operate off of personal authority; it operates off of objective evidence and sound reasoning. I am not saying it is appropriate to dismiss anything AGCC scientist say. It is appropriate to dismiss 'expert' opinions, not arguments or the data (premises) for those arguments.
Turn No:6
Accipiter:
So it's a subconscious bias then?
Turn No:7
Freedom:
The line between conscious and subconscious is paradoxically often within the power of the will of the individual. The bias is in the form of strong belief based on trust in authority, namely their professors and professional colleagues. It's a self-supporting structure, individually they draw their confidence from the confidence of the whole, and their personal confidence contributes to the confidence of others. That's one of the reasons appeals to authority are so insidious. It's one of the main reasons religions get big and powerful. It's why otherwise rational people can get caught up in communist or fascist parties. The proper attitude of a scientist or in fact anyone following the correct epistemology is to have confidence only in good arguments.

Turn No:11
Freedom:
I offer you this dichotomy. If a person believes the scientific establishment on something but do not know why it is true themselves, they rely on trusting the scientific establishment. If they believe the scientific establishment on something, and they know why it is true themselves; they can still have trust but they are not relying on it. A person who relies on trust will not be able to argue that this thing is true beyond an appeal to authority. A person who does not rely on trust will be able to argue using the reasons that have them convinced. A quick note on the difference between faith and trust. Faith is belief regardless of reason, trust is belief based on a high regard for someone's authority. They overlap when it is irrational to hold an authority in high regard, and it isn't for most scientist on most issues, while it certainly is for a God which can only be accessed through personal hallucination. Now what is the measure of authority? One might be tempted to say "how often it is right", but that could be a matter of luck or manipulation when the only check of whether they are right is them. A rational person (by definition) holds that reason is the only proper way to acquire knowledge, thus to told an authority in high regard is to consider it competent to carry out sound and cogent reasoning and to accurately report conclusions. There is a need for trust every day of our lives, and given to many people; but one of the places trust does not belong is debate. Debates occur when a disagreement makes it apparent that the reasoning of both sides needs to be evaluated for one or both are wrong. It makes no difference whether the reasoning used is from the individual or from some authority he/she trusts but it is the reasoning which must be evaluated. Attempting to debate by evaluating the quality of an authority (appeal to authority) is superfluous and circular because of the above mentioned fact about what constitutes the quality of an authority. i.e. the quality of the authority is it's ability to reason correctly, to determine whether it reasoned correctly one needs to evaluate it's reasoning. Now if people agree on the mechanics and by implication understand the mechanics to some degree, they will be able to argue in favor of their beliefs based on that understanding. When I see appeals to authority and nothing else I infer that the individual does not posses any understanding (correct or otherwise) and is simply relaying that they believe this or that because they trust an authority. When I argue I do not appeal to authorities, as a consequence I have had to deal with the extreme irony of being accused of having no authorities to appeal to as if that were a negative point against my argument. (ex. "and who else thinks that?...") Getting back to the original subject, the mechanics of AGCC aren't just wrong; they are too vague to evaluate. It doesn't even qualify as a hypothesis because crucial links between postulates are simply missing or so abstract that the number of assumptions divorces the result from any hope of accuracy. This is very similar to the fallacies implied by irrational evolution, there is a great amount of equivocation between observation, analysis, and explanation. Every little part of both AGCC and irrational evolution is on it's own valid and provable, the parts simply don't fit together to the whole that they are claimed to. This is very dangerous because scientist are highly specialized today compared to the polymaths of as little as a 100 years ago. As long as the part each scientist understands from his/her field is internally consistent no red flags will go up, that does not mean they poured over the whole body of assertion and confirmed it's validity. If everyone who agrees with AGCC could explain the whole thing consistently and clearly, and then present the repeatable experiments which prove it; it would obviously not be false. That is not the case, the junk science that goes flying around on politically charged websites, high-school text-books, and TV documentaries is the substance of this hoax and not a veneer over some properly executed scientific investigation. The actual reasoning is a very simplistic piece of circular logic. The predictions the result of a surprisingly few scientist using computer models based on their circular reasoning. Defensible argument about what? I think we've been over this, in fact I have been over this with just about 85% of the people who disagree with me. If you are unwilling to argue you should not say that you are right, and someone else is wrong no matter what you think about their beliefs personally. Obviously they think they are right and you are wrong, and if they would not argue with you; you would have no defense because there would be no attack. I endure dismissals only in hopes that one day those who issue them (wink nudge) might realize this.

In most cases, yes. A claim or argument made regarding the nature of anything in the universe is considered a scientific claim or argument. Your argument along with the arguments made by evolutionists, and the arguments made by creationists and even religion in general, focus on the nature of something in the universe, thus making them scientific arguments or claims. Now you can begin to see why evidence is significant, with literally an infinite number of hypotheses about the nature of the universe. Without evidence, your argument holds as much weight as a creationist's, which is none in the scientific sector. So, a philosophical argument for example does not require evidence, because philosophy often deals with intangibles, and thus all arguments are equally valid. In science, an argument is only valid if it is supported. Which in turn means to say, either produce some evidence or don't expect to be taken seriously by any scientific intellect. Judging by your "tone" (if I am able to judge such a thing over the internet), being taken seriously is something you would like very much, otherwise you wouldn't spend so much time explaining your position over and over.

Perhaps I mean it when I say that debate is important to advance human knowledge and cooperation. As for explaining myself over and over again, it's either that or ignore people. If you wish to be ignored please inform me. You roll your eyes because you are ignorant, you do not even know what the nature of logic is to think it can be decoupled from evidence.

False. Not all arguments are scientific arguments, because not all arguments deal with the nature of the universe. Abortion, drug war and gun control debates deal with human practices; politic debates deal with societal structures; an argument with your wife about how to spend your year's bonus is not pertinent to how items in the universe work. Scientific debates work differently than any other for a number of reasons. For one thing, you need hard, empirical evidence to support your arguments. Without any, you have a scientific assertion when attempting to put forth your idea as a viable argument. Logic is used in a scientific argument to piece evidentiary evidence together to make some sort of inference, and an interpretation which would support your argument. Saying you base your scientific argument on logic alone without evidence is like saying you build your cabinets using carpenter's glue alone, without wood. Get yourself a Google and find it.

Science is very much objective, so there are good and bad interpretations of evidence. Once again, I can see you are no scientist, and being an engineer does not make you one (lol). You have a misunderstanding of what scientific evidence is. Of course, I won't be able to convince you of this due to your inherent stubbernness.

The overthrow of the conclusions has been presented albeit with some extra baggage by Behe. I understand both logic and the scientific method.

As for the psycho-analysis I have no defense, I cannot prove to you that I am not a stubborn arrogant little know it all; I would comment that unless you are confident enough to present and defend your ideas you shouldn't be debating so if you're expecting mock humility from debaters online it's an ill placed expectation.

Find that dictionary.com link for me, would you?

A scientific argument would have you produce research, experiments, lab reports, peer reviewed articles and the like to suffice as evidence. Premises are not enough. I as well do not agree with this, it being a logical fallacy and also for being untrue. I have not seen it yet. I have seen Behe's "evidence", riddled with quote-mining, strawmen and various other falsehoods; not forgetting the fact that research is used out of context which is meant to support his argument, but upon a closer inspection (and even those who actually conducted the research will testify), actually refute the argument. Yep, everyone is wrong if they all disagree with you... Typical Freedom behavior. Logic is not the problem with your argument. The problem lies with the premise of your argument. I'm afraid you do, in fact have a misunderstanding of the scientific method (maybe the dozens of people who keep telling you this are correct, and aren't bone-headed XXXXXX, hmm?), as you'll find logic is not to be the basis for forming a scientific argument. That's the job of evidence. Is there more to truth than logic? In a scientific argument, yes there is. I think you can hazard a guess at what that is. If you were to propose your argument as a thesis to the scientific community, it would be binned for the reasons mentioned. This is something you should be concerned about, if you are serious about your idea. This is a case of misinterpreted evidence. Technology advances, more evidence is acquired, the theory along with the conclusion is refined. At this point, this conclusion can be discredited.

I repeat the challenge in which you failed and simultaneously showed that you don't know what an argument is. Find a sound or cogent argument which fails to meet the definition you stated in 1. True premises are, I still do not recognize the significance of that qualifier. Then you dispute the evidence. Which one? Because I care about truth I must care only for the soundness or cogency of an argument, others who care about truth will do the same; I cannot bend or alter the truth for those who will not. The reasons you mentioned are mute, and as far as I am concerned you may as well be easyrider telling me that if I want Christians to take me seriously I have to find support in the bible. I like your answer, but it was not an answer to my question. Can you, and how?

Bennedict:
I am not concerned with the term "dealing" relating to "pertaining"; I am interested in how "nature" used in this context is synonymous with these two terms, as you've claimed. Find me the dictionary.com link which shows that. At base level, all things are dealt with scientifically. Politics involves the soft sciences of psychology, social sciences, etc. but a political debate does not deal with these things. Political debates are subjective confrontations. Politicians do not debate scientifically, using evidence, breaking down the nature of another politician's platform using scientific research. I wish they would conduct debates that way, but watch any political debate and you'll know this doesn't happen, yet each party retains a subjective validation for their arguments. Okay. So Easyrider walks into the offices of Nature scientific journals and proposes that creationism is true, and evolution is false. He actually has a pretty decent proposal, which makes logical sense. Would you accept this as a scientific proposal, if you worked at Nature, despite the fact that he produces no evidence whatsoever? If an argument dealing with a scientific field does not provide evidence (as is the case with yours), it shouldn't be considered a scientific argument. The evidence is okay - Behe misinterprets this evidence, takes it out of context and misuses it to support his argument. I am talking about the work of David DeRosier. Well, if you did want Christians to take you seriously for a theocratic interpretation, lets say, you would need to reference the bible to convince them! Good analogy, Freedom. You wouldn't be able to convince a priest that Jesus condoned homosexual behavior without referencing the bible, using only logic, in the same way you wouldn't be able to convince the scientific community of your argument without referencing evidence, using only logic. This is because the priest and the scientific community will want to see support for your idea. The Sun, being the source of all energy on Earth, must have existed before 20 million years ago, as fossil evidence shows that energy was being accessed far earlier than that, as can be seen with the dating of dinosaur remains, which predate the proposed 20 million year lifespan of the the Sun. Why are we talking about this?

Freedom:
Pertaining, dealing with are synonymous to regarding. The is no difference between reference to the nature of and a direct reference because you used the term regarding in the context of argument, indicating a conclusion and thus a subject. This does not meet the challenge. So you walk into the most fundamentalist church you can find with any scientific theory. Do you think they care about evidence or logic? There is no arbiter of truth but reason. It is not my responsibility or anyone's responsibility alter their idea to conform to any demands but those reason. I do not need to deal with what Nature or any other article or community may require to accept an idea, I need only establish it's truth. Evidence is automatically dealt with via premises. Irrational evolution is a misinterpretation at best. The support is the premises. You hand-picked that example, the bible is one of the few sources on Jesus. What if I wanted to prove to Christians that the earth was round? You don't have radioisotope dating yet.

Bennedict:
This is a red herring and semantics. You understand that "...the nature of..." differs from "...pertaining to..." which concludes that I had not made a contradiction, contrary to your claim that I have: "given that 'regarding the nature of', 'dealing with', and 'pertaining to' are all closely synonymous (as attested to by dictionary.com)". But don't worry! I won't refuse to talk to you until you've apologized, lol. You are proposing your scientific idea here to a group of a number of scientifically educated people, confronting a heavily supported scientific fact, to establish what you consider to be the truth, without evidence? Some call this trolling. Others call this a waste of time on your part. In logic and other types of arguments, yes. In science, no. I don't care. This is another red herring. Stop it. It's an analogy. A priest would expect you to support an idea regarding something in the bible; this is easily seen. The scientific community would expect the same of your idea. This is the significance of the qualifier, and the significance of evidence in science.

http://www.merriam-webster.com/thesa...0&t=1323312082 synonym listed 'being' which is identical to 'is' or any direct reference to existence. Regarding something's being is regarding something unless the intrinsic properties which compose it's being (it's nature) are not things. If they are different then you could find an example which fits one but not the other while retaining the conditions of my original statement. Do so. I have evidence, it is integral to reason. You are claiming that the baker doesn't have the flour he needs to sell bread yet you admit he has bread in his hand. The laws of logic do not change because you delusionaly believe science is beyond them. There are no special requirements. What is the relevance of this?: "The evidence is okay - Behe misinterprets this evidence, takes it out of context and misuses it to support his argument. I am talking about the work of David DeRosier."
Turn No:8
Bennedict:
This is another equivocation. You are using "being" in the wrong context. Nature: the quality or qualities that make a thing what it is <some artists maintain that color, light, and shadow are the very nature of painting> Synonyms: being, essentiality, nature, quiddity, quintessence, soul, stuff, substance. Being: the qualities that constitute an existent thing : essence; especially : personality "Being" in the appropriate context for this discussion, is not synonymous to "thing". Indeed, something's nature or being are not "things" in the traditional sense (meaning they are not objects), as they are not necessarily tangible. I will not find an example which fits one but not the other, as you still owe me a link which defines "...the nature of..." as being synonymous with "...pertaining to...", which would prove a contradiction on my part. I think I have a pretty good case for calling myself contradiction-free at this time. Scientific evidence is more discriminitory than logical evidence. I'm not claiming that a scientific argument is exempt from logic. You mentioned that you would use Behe's evidence as a support for your own idea, as your idea is a modified version of his. I would not credit the evidence that Behe uses to be supportive of his theory, let alone yours. What is the relevance of bringing up "irrational evolution?" This is the first time in this discussion that it's been mentioned, and it is out of order. I call red herring.
Turn No:9
Freedom:
You are using nature in the wrong context. So concepts are not things in the universe? You cannot. No I don't, I never claimed that. You use terms of which you have no inclining of their meaning. What is logical evidence. That is an issue with the validity of the argument not with the premises. You have said you found no issue with 'making logical sense'. It is not out of order, you brought up the supposed need to publish my arguments; behe became a subject at that time, if my latest response was a red herring yours attacking behe's evidence is certainly one. We weren't talking about the quality of his evidence or his logic right?
Turn No:10
Bennedict:
I chose the context, as I was the one who initially made the statement. Not necessarily physical things. Just for reference - you are now stating that you've never claimed that "...the nature of..." and "...pertaining to..." are synonymous. From post #177: "Now given that 'regarding the nature of', 'dealing with', and 'pertaining to' are all closely synonymous (as attested to by dictionary.com)..." Yes, you have claimed that. "...as attested to by dictionary.com..." Surely you can show me where dictionary.com attests to this. Incorrect; I never said that. In fact, this entire discussion is about how I do have an issue with a scientific argument making logical sense if it doesn't provide any support in the form of evidence. ...and now you've avoided the fact that you've brought up 'irrational evolution'! What the heck? A red herring within a red herring. I won't complain though, as it was a red herring to begin with. Again, a straw man. I never suggested that you should publish your argument; I issued a warning that if you did, it would be vehemently rejected, and gave reasons why. If you state that the evidence Behe uses to support his argument can be used to support yours, me stating that said evidence does not support his argument and thus won't support yours is perfectly relevant.
Turn No:11
Freedom:
The previous and surrounding words and statements define the context not your intention. You used it in an 'of' relationship with 'anything'. You did not say physical things, you said any thing. Any allows it to be physical or non-physical. Correct. I have. All arguments have the same four states based on the same criteria. The qualifier is a fallacious tac-on included in hopes of smuggling the assertion that there exists some special truth that is only accessible through some special method. Since you have not provided a meaningful differentiation between general arguments and scientific ones, and in fact have both contradicted yourself and misidentified statements as arguments in the attempt I will until such time as that has been repaired consider a scientific argument exactly the same as any argument with regard to truth value of premises, conclusions, and validity. Have you avoided the fact that you brought up the imaginary need to address Nature and other such organizations? I see. By such logic if it was not his evidence but it's implications you denied than it is also not my evidence but it's implications you deny.
Turn No:12
Bennedict:
Semantics. You've committed an equivocation, thus I have made no contradiction. Than what say you about #177? A direct quote which puts YOU in a contradiction. You have not. You have shown a link between "pertaining" and "dealing" as well as "nature" and "being", yet not "pertaining" and "nature" which is what you have claimed in post #177. You may do what you like with my suggestions; if you are serious about your idea, you will be the laughing stock of the scientific community if it remains in this state. You are deviating dramatically from the norm for a scientific idea. If you use the same evidence with the same implications, than yes, I will deny the credibility of that evidence as support for your argument.
Turn No:13
Freedom:
What equivocation? It does not. However in post 151 and 177 your contradiction is detailed. On a global scope regarding the nature of X and regarding the existence and quality of X equivalent because nature in the context is synonymous with being. There is nothing else to regard, nature implies all. Thus nature is synonymous to a direct reference (which does not sub-specify allowing the general whole of all qualities and properties including existence), pertaining to is synonymous to regarding. Better to be right than respected. What connects evidence (premises) to implications (conclusions)?

Bennedict:
What?! You said this: "Now given that 'regarding the nature of', 'dealing with', and 'pertaining to' are all closely synonymous (as attested to by dictionary.com)..." And then you claim to have never said this at all. Explain yourself. You said one thing, then you've claimed to have never said it, in almost the exact wording. And how do you know you are right? You have very little (I would argue that you have none at all) and very weak support for your argument, and you are in contrast to something which is heavily supported. Is it just your assertions which give you such faith in your argument?

Freedom:
I did say "Now given that 'regarding the nature of', 'dealing with', and 'pertaining to' are all closely synonymous (as attested to by dictionary.com)...", and more. You know, I can see how it would seem quite pathetic to do something like that A sound argument has concluded it. If you would argue that the argument is not sound then do so, your assertions will garner no faith with me. What connects evidence (premises) to implications (conclusions)? I put to you this scenario, you are in the 1870's; you attend the address "Of Geological Dynamics" to 'learn' that the sun has been burning for no more than 20 million years. Can you discredit this idea? Can you do it within the constraints you would so quickly place on me? You may not use future technologies or research.
Turn No:16
Bennedict:
Than why did you do it? Interpretations of that evidence. However, scientific evidence requires an in depth exploration of the subject, using and collecting laboratory and field data. My guess would be that you will not be able to find any evidence to support your argument, because your argument violates many principles that make up a scientific theory, as is outlined by the scientific method. I would not be able to refute it without future research and technology, but I can make the argument that there isn't enough evidence to support such a claim, which would discredit it. In our situation, I am saying exactly that. You haven't got enough scientific evidence to make this claim as a scientific truth. Now, these two situations are not equivalent. You may be right, you may be wrong, but you are neither until you can provide a falsifiable hypothesis - and you need to accept it when your hypothesis is falsified, something I think you would have quite some trouble with. The number of people who tried to discredit Darwin was extensive, however Darwin garnered so much evidence to support his theory, that it stands as the strongest explanation for natural phenomena today, by far. To have a scientific theory which stands up to over 150 years, it needs a massive amount of evidence. That's why Darwin's theory has stood up for that long, and that's why the 20 mya Sun theory has not.

That question only reveals your ignorance of science and how it works. In science, theories do not grow up to become facts. They are not proven. In science, a theory is as good as it gets. Gravity, electro-magnitism, and plate tectonics are theories. They each explain the observations of gravity, electro-magnitism, and plate tectonics. Evolutionary theory explains the observations of evolution. More ignorance and an unwillingness to learn. The macro-evolution of bacteria has been frequently observed. There is a bacteria that lives in the waste ponds from factories that produce nylon. They can't live anywhere else. They live by metabolizing waste products from the production of nylon. Nylon was first produced in 1935 and the bacteria were first observed in 1975.

I assumed that when I said that the theory of gravity explains the observations of gravity I had been clear enough. The observations are the facts. The theories explain the facts. Why don't you try to educate yourself about science before you speak.

Not really. It was a gene duplication and an alternative long open reading frame of an internally repetitious coding sequence. There does not appear to have been a point mutation. However, this is macro evolution since it created a new species (Flavobacterium Sp. K172). The actual new gene is located on the pOAD2 plasmid. It produces a 392-amino acid-long-residue bacterial enzyme. The original reading of the sequence produced a 472-residue-long protein sequence. I believe that the original gene still produces this protein sequence.

Then give me 'the theory' of gravity. Interesting, so you are saying that this thing lost 240 base pairs of data and then it could metabolize a byproduct of nylon which has like a three functional group similarity with lysine.
