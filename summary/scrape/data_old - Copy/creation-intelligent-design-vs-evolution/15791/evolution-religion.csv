I continue to think you're using terms very incautiously. But regardless, the kicker is: you don't have to regard evidence as accurate or scientists as unbiased! What you have to do is look at the evidence that they present and the reasoning that they base upon it. If it turns out that there are problems with the evidence or their reasoning (inaccuracy and bias being two potential problems), then eventually, those problems will be found out. In such cases, previously accepted hypotheses need to be revised or even discarded. And therein lies the beauty of science: it relies on healthy skepticism and critical scrutiny directed at ideas themselves, not trust in the authority of those advancing the ideas. You say you have a degree in molecular biology, so here are a couple questions. Is the structure of DNA a matter of faith? Do we need to trust Watson and Crick, at this point? I submit that the answer to both is a resounding ""no."" Regardless of Watson's character or Crick's motives, the structure of DNA is what they said it was. We know this not because they were the ones who said it, but because what they said fits the evidence. Moreover, supposing (contrary to the above) that it were a matter of trust, then shouldn't we turn the charge right back on religion? Don't religious believers trust their clergy? Don't you have to trust that the interpretations of theologians are unbiased? Don't you have to trust that the statements of preachers are well-founded? I daresay the answer is yes. So if reliance on trust were a problem, religion would be in at least as much trouble as science. Where evolution is concerned, that deferential trust in clergy results in serious trouble, indeed. Because the criticisms of evolution that I have heard preached from church pulpits or seen written in religious publications are truly horrendous -- everything from erroneous claims about bombardier beetles to the failed tornado-in-a-junkyard analogy. And what makes these so blandly terrible is not only that they're factually and logically incorrect, but that nearly every such argument was shown to be incorrect decades ago! And yet, various anti-evolutionary clergymen still proffer their discredited criticisms time and again. Their congregants don't know evolution themselves, and they trust their clergy. It's the downside of trust: at best, those leaders are intellectually lazy about evolution; at worst... well, I'd rather not presume the worst. Where conservative Christianity is concerned, I actually think that the trust problem goes even deeper. In these traditions, God tends to come off as quite the tyrant: he does what he wants, without any need to explain himself to anyone, and we're all just supposed to obey. (In this regard, I find your tagline quite apropos.) Confused about things? Accept the confusion. Certainly, don't ask tough questions -- how dare we! That's arrogant and presumptive. God's refusal to offer any clear answers isn't arrogant, of course; he owes us nothing. If we were to ask questions, that would be arrogant. For we're just supposed to trust and obey (as the song says). Back to science for a moment. Scientists are still human, of course. But science, as an institution, rests on far more than the attributes of any individual scientists. If the evidence and logic behind evolution didn't withstand ongoing critical scrutiny, the theory would be scrapped. But in fact, there are reams of evidence supporting evolution at this point, and the reasoning is impeccable. It has withstood every criticism thrown at it, and that's why it's accepted, not because of any ""faith"" or ""trust."" No differently than the double helix.","evolution-religion","07:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","13"

"10-22-2011","15791",2,"Theophilus","441372","I'm talking about Macroevolution. Should have clarified. Microevolution aka Adaptation is not the question here. The term ""macroevolution"" frequently arises within the context of the evolution/creation debate, usually used by creationists alleging a significant difference between the evolutionary changes observed in field and laboratory studies and the larger scale macroevolutionary changes that scientists believe to have taken thousands or millions of years to occur. They may accept that evolutionary change is possible within species (""microevolution""), but deny that one species can evolve into another (""macroevolution"").[1] Contrary to this belief among the anti-evolution movement proponents, evolution of life forms beyond the species level (""macroevolution"", i.e. speciation in a specific case) has indeed been observed multiple times under both controlled laboratory conditions and in nature.[12] The claim that macroevolution does not occur, or is impossible, is thus demonstrably false and without support in the scientific community.","Accipiter","441379","Yeah we played that game already, care to try something else?

A St. Bernard doesn't reproduce with a weiner dog (because a weiner dog is small and a St. Bernard is big; biologically they could, but they don't naturally), and under the description of speciation, that makes them different species. Here's the thing about those who believe in micro but not macroevolution - there is no ""glass ceiling"" as I call it. If you recognize that an organism can change genetically even a little bit, there's nothing stopping it from changing so much over a large period of time, so that it can no longer reproduce with other organisms it's related to. There is no line separating micro and macroevolution; enough micro changes adds up to a macro change.","evolution-religion","11:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","20"

And a very common misuse: accepting microevolution while denying macroevolution is a standard rhetorical strategy of creationists. But it's not hard to answer, along essentially the same lines as in the Wikipedia article already cited by others. Microevolution is hardly opposed to macroevolution; indeed, macroevolution is just microevolution over time. When a single population is divided, and each adapts separately to its distinct conditions, this adaptive divergence is macroevolution -- more specifically, it is speciation. After a larger or smaller number of generations, the one lineage becomes two. It is also possible for a single population to adapt to changed conditions over time so much that it no longer resembles its own ancestor sufficiently to have been able to reproduce with it. This adaptive change is macroevolution -- specifically, it is phyletic evolution. As conditions change, so does the species. While each generation can reproduce effectively with some generations before and after it, there is some number of generations before or after each generation at which point reproduction would be impossible. So we have one lineage that is different species at different times. The Lenski experiment is a perfect illustration of both speciation and phyletic evolution. All the different populations have diverged, and are not ""the same"" any longer, any more than are a mastiff and a chihuahua. And each lineage has changed relative to its own earlier generations (especially the lineage that evolved the ability to use citrate as food, which significantly differs from its earlier attributes, and from the other lineages, too). So using the microevolution/macroevolution distinction against evolutionary theory just won't fly. Indeed, like most creationist arguments against evolution, this has been much used, even though the flaw was pointed out a looooong time ago. Remember when I discussed trust in the post before the one you quoted here? Please: trust creationist authors and thinkers much less than you evidently do. Perhaps they mean well; not being able to read minds, I will decline to speculate on their motives and presume that they are sincere. But the arguments they use are incorrect, and have been known to be incorrect for some while. And yet they still repeat these arguments, as if they'd never been answered. Don't fall for it, Theophilus! Whether intentionally deceptive or not, their arguments work only to the extent that their audiences don't know evolution and trust their characterization of it -- their mis characterization of it -- instead.","evolution-religion","01:30 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","22"

Nor is this brand of scholarship restricted to Rand herself. Her closest followers embrace it as well. Consider Peikoffs article, The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy. This article, said to have been published first in 1967, contains the sweeping claim (p. 89) that It [the analytic-synthetic dichotomy] is accepted, in some form, by virtually every influential contemporary philosopher pragmatist, logical positivist, analyst, and extentialist alike. Well, consider please the following: But, for all its a priori reasonableness, a boundary between analytic and synthetic statements simply has not been drawn. That there is such a distinction to be drawn at all is an unempirical dogma of empiricists, a metaphysical article of faith. (W. V. Quine, Two Dogmas of Empiricism). My copy of From a Logical Point of View has an initial copyright date of 1953. The original paper appeared in The Philosophical Review in 1951. Look folks, it simply is not possible for anyone who was aware of what was happening in Anglo-American philosophy in the 50s and early 60s to claim with any honesty what Peikoff does in the quote above. So was Peikoff dishonest or ignorant? Take your pick. He had to be one or the other. If one were forced to select a single paper of Quines that had the most impact on contemporary philosophy it would have to be Two Dogmas. But Peikoff appears ignorant of both it and its impact on the field. Further, it appears that Peikoffs article appears only in the second edition of IOE, published in 1990. Certainly by this time someone should have noticed Two Dogmas and at least conceded in a footnote that Peikoffs claim was unsupportable both now and when it originally was made. Peikoff, like Rand, goes to great lengths to claim (I would say make a case, but no genuine evidence is ever introduced) that he is proposing a novel approach where all other philosophers have failed. In the case of the analytic/ synthetic dichotomy Ive got news for Peikoff: It was done 15 years earlier, and it was done better. But, for all its a priori reasonableness, a boundary between analytic and synthetic statements simply has not been drawn. That there is such a distinction to be drawn at all is an unempirical dogma of empiricists, a metaphysical article of faith. (W. V. Quine, Two Dogmas of Empiricism).","Matthew","441469","""Randian"" is indeed a ""made up term."" It was made denote the followers of Rand's bad ideas. ""Objectivist"" is also a made up term. It was made by said followers to make it sound like the gave a damn about objectivity. Consider, for example, Leonard Peikoff his article on the analytic-synthetic distinction is one of the most incompetent things I've ever had the misfortune to read. Gary Merrill offered some excellent thoughts on the complete scholarly incompetence of Randians at Merrill on ITOE , from which I cite: It could also be noted that Quine was merely the most famous critic of the distinction. There were many people criticizing the distinction. Some, like Quine, had pragmatist roots -- oops! did Peikoff describe critics of the distinction as adherents to it? nuts. Others came from existentialist backgrounds, like Nietzsche -- oops! again. Well, Peikoff never claimed to be an expert -- oops!... Anyway, if Randians were so interested in correcting themselves, then surely by now, this incompetent essay would have been removed. But nope. Read the whole link for further examples. Rand and Randians are really convincing about philosophy -- if, and only if, you don't know philosophy except through the lens of Randian thinking. If you know what philosophers from Aristotle to Kant and beyond actually say, Randians are the opposite of impressive. And their claims that everybody else is wrong, while they're the real experts, ring utterly hollow. -- Which, come to think of it, is exactly like the situation of creationists with respect to biology: compelling only to those who don't know any better.

In addition tot the link already provided, see The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy - Objectivist Living , where poster ""dragonfly"" provides some excellent criticisms and gives some great responses to someone defending Peikoff's view. See also http://objectivism-criticism.blogspo...dichotomy.html , which is not very good, except that it does correctly make the hilarious point that the analytic-synthetic distinction is utilized within Rand's own work all the time. Personally, I feel no need to lend credibility to a work that is so historically ill-informed and argumentatively sloppy. It would be like debating a young-earth creationist about the age of the earth, as if that view of the earth deserved any hearing at this point. The article is terrible on every level. Quine's ""Two Dogmas of Empricism"" already showed how the distinction didn't work two decades before Peikoff tried to. And it did so very effectively, because it was historically well-informed about the nature of the problem, and then logically rigorous in developing both the argument criticizing the distinction (and also the other ""dogma,"" reductionism) and the argument about the implications of letting go of the dogmas. Real philosophy at its finest. If you want to discuss that , well then hey, let's go over to the philosophy forum and examine the essay, section by section.

If you are looking for a pattern, here it is; critics of objectivism are more than willing to dismiss it publicly, to claim it's hypocritical and irrational, but they never want to argue; or when they do, do so for only a short time claiming their objectivist opponent won't see reason even though they have been proven wrong. Do you seriously think that matters to us? The assurance that if we were actually capable of understanding the so called logic used against it we would see how wrong we are? To claim something is irrational but not be wiling to argue the point, to claim one's opponents are unable to meet your attacks, while refusing to provide attacks is the height of hypocrisy . You spoke of 'validating' objectivism by arguing against it. You sound like you've had experience with objectivist so you should know quite well that these beliefs will stand without your input quite well enough. There are three possible scenarios for your input: 1. You don't say anything. 2. You dismiss objectivism but will not argue 3. You dismiss objectivism and will argue (with bad logic) 4. You dismiss objectivism and will argue (with good logic) 1. will produce no change, 4. will reduce validation; 2 and three will only increase it. By choosing anything but 1 and 4 you are sending the message that all you have is 2 and 3. Which only makes us more confident, the only thing you could do more to validate objectivist is to imply that you are familiar or expert in philosophy at the same time as 2 and 3.","evolution-religion","02:55 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","40"

The fact is, I consider Objectivism to be an already defeated position. With regard to the specific essay in question: When Peikoff claims in ""The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy"" that ""virtually every influential contemporary philosopher"" accepts the distinction, this claim is (to speak in objective if not Objectivist terms) entirely false. The most influential philosophical paper of the twenty years prior to Peikoff's essay (Quine's ""Two Dogmas"") criticized that very distinction. And in fact such criticism was quite widespread at that time, especially among mid-20th-century thinkers of pragmatist (e.g. Quine himself) or existentialist derivation, whom Peikoff inexplicably includes among his brief rogues gallery of people who support the distinction. How seriously am I really supposed to take such staggering ignorance of the field in which the man claimed expertise? I feel no need to discuss the essay any further at this time. I've done so in the past, and others have done so before and after me. Much of the criticism is available on the web for anyone inclined to look. I've linked to some of it, and there's plenty more out there. So all in all, I have better things to do. Charges of hypocrisy don't bother me, not where Objectivism is concerned.

Here's the thing about those who believe in micro but not macroevolution - there is no ""glass ceiling"" as I call it. If you recognize that an organism can change genetically even a little bit, there's nothing stopping it from changing so much over a large period of time, so that it can no longer reproduce with other organisms it's related to.

Nothing's too complex to evolve, it's too complex to reasonably accept the explanation that it randomly appeared. Not even the simplest novel function evolves. Adaptation does not imply novelty, a system which is already functional can increase in functionality in a non-random explained manner in response to external changes or simply the removing of an internal block to the increase. This has been the case with all examples you have brought, which is not to say that I don't believe that any novel system couldn't arise by chance, we just haven't seen it which strengthens immensely the estimation that the odds are beyond even the vast number of trials being conducted. Since you obviously forgot or never understood our previous engagements on the subject I will remind you that it is no point in the favor of evolutionist at all that the perception of the odds is an estimation, for as I have pointed out many many times just because one finds something likely does not make it true. Further while we do not the odds for specific occurrences we can infer a general landscape which I have done for you and others. Scale is irrelevant. Never, adaptation is evolution. Spontaneous formation of functional systems is not. First off ignorance is no more a barrier to acceptance of objective truth than an unexplained phenomenon in nature undermines the scientific method. (those are in fact the same situation) You've no doubt heard such thinking from anti-science people. What could you prove about the soul that would cast doubt on the idea that truth is based on reality as accessed by rational investigation when the very concept 'prove' relies on the premise of rationalism? There are many many words that are used with fuzzy meanings and no real definition besides soul. You are not detecting some fundamental failure of human knowledge but only an insignificant failure of human language. The more definition you give to soul, the more objective the concepts used in it's meaning the more you could describe it objectively. What is psychology? Now don't get me wrong I don't have the greatest respect for psychologist they seem to do an awful lot with very little evidence but I don't believe the field itself is inherently doomed. What makes you think you are an illusion? What makes anyone think that? Drugged mystics sitting under trees seeking enlightenment substituting starvation for thought is who. I think therefore I am.

So by ""we,"" you are saying that you are a molecular biologist engaged in research? Or do you mean that you, as a scientific illiterate, accept on faith the findings of research biologists? Again with the ""we."" But the statement is fundamentally nonsense. Of course scientists recognize that life is complex. Actually, it doesn't. When one considers that the genetic code is universal to all living beings, it isn't difficult, at all, to accept that all life had a common source.

It's like the saying that the statue is already in there you are just removing the unwanted stone. I've seen many a design that 'wrests' it's function through the brute force of linear implementation of known design. It is not harmonious, these machines break faster, are hard to repair and modify, and are more easily disabled by unseen variables. Simplicity is not actually on the same axis as these other measures, to our brains order is easier to understand than chaos and given two systems of equal complexity the more ordered one will seem the simpler. Complexity occurs in nature quite often in chaotic systems, and order appears quite often as the result of 'simple' laws; what is unusual and unique to life is ordered complexity/complex order. A crystal is more ordered than life but is merely a geometric imperative that can be understood by understanding the forces surrounding a single particle.

"11-28-2011","15791",7,"Freedom","443638","That would be a better situation than the reality, the 'theory' is so enshrouded by mystical allusions and fawning awe that to call the irrational parts theory at all is unfair to all theories. You can see in this back and forth with bennedict the nature of the issue, he alternates between saying I don't understand the evolutionary theory and saying evolutionary theory is not contradicted by what I say. He says things like 'no real scientist thinks otherwise'. So I using IC analysis am arguing that evolutionary theory does not explain/predict all that it is claimed to, how do I know that it's being claimed? The two questions I just asked of bennedict testify to the fact that some do believe it is an operational theory of life. You can say no evolutionary biologist would make the mistakes I argue against, but you can't have it both ways. The mistakes I argue against are the fallacies IC exposes, if they didn't make them then IC would be nothing new or incorrect and all opposition to behe would take the form of attacking the false dichotomy he presents. That does not occur, and the simplest explanation is that they do make those mistakes and they accept the false dichotomy. Bottom line the most accurate way to describe the conclusion of my argument is that evolution is not what many want/believe/hope it to be. It does not explain advancement (the addition of biotechnology i.e. novel systems). Life has advanced and thus it does not explain life before the first cell, after the first cell, even up till the most recent addition. Now the confusion about what the theory is, is again entirely the fault of this intellectual fog that people cover it with. The word evolution is used in a multitude of senses and equivocated when necessary. Sometimes it is merely a term defined as a species changing over time (the only way species can change over time gene frequencies). There is nothing bad or incorrect about a description like that but it doesn't explain anything anymore than calling a bolt metal explains how to cast one. It is used to mean the event in which any mutation is selected, which does explain something; why the mutation was spread and endured, but it does not explain the change the mutation made itself, or any number of those changes. The 'theory' as a whole relies on the human ability to scale a pattern for it's explicative power, in this case scaling the process of mutation and natural selection produces a 'sense' that things will keep getting better because 'bad' is being filtered out. Such an effect over a long time will accumulate into a lot of good it seems and this 'reasonability' by all evidence is the substance of the layman's understanding. That however is a vague and imprecise understanding. The IC analysis is more formal and precise essentially by categorizing and defining what exactly good means in evolution, and examining what accumulates and why. To explain the final result you need to explain both the change and why it's still around. You can't do the former with one random occurrence likelihood irrelevant. You need to show that it is non-random occurrence or an accumulation of non-random occurrences and that can only be accomplished by natural selection. Thus to actually explain any change (we aren't sub-specifying types right now) you need to show that it is the result of a series of non-random selections. Thus you can't have explanation for a single mutation selection pair. Second it means that whether or not the final product is explained is dependent on selection events, specifically whether those selection events do non-randomly explain it's formation. IC is all this plus the observation that while some series of selections can explain the end products others cannot. Now given that evolution is used constantly to explain structures and changes of all sorts it can be reasonably stated that the prior two usages of the word are irrelevant and confusing, used only for their value in equivocating.

Machines which accomplish various tasks by taking advantage of physical laws. Systems and technology produced and used by living things. If you don't know what the hec I'm talking about how could you identify evidence for it? sigh... anytime a creationist talks about species turning into each other there is a march down main-street of all the evolutionist eager to correct them, that at the point of divergence almost no differences exist they build up over time in isolation. I have long sense abandoned the species oriented way of talking about life it's simply ill-defined and not very useful. When you name a specific species that of course implies exactly the number and type of systems it possesses but it's still just an arbitrary grouping. The closest thing we have to a hard definition of species is no inter-breeding but even that has not been perfectly observed in taxonomy. Talking about speciation we are essentially talking about the measure of one variable. Genetic divergence between two reproducing populations. It is the exact same phenomenon as different breeds and sub-breeds just on a larger scale. What a breed is to a species a species is to an order (or other higher taxonomic classification). Divergence is an associated by not proportional measurement to novelty. Two species could break off from an ancestor, become genetically very different; enough so that they cannot reproduce, and still not advance. While on the other hand a species could remain a unified gene pool and yet advance greatly with no new species or observable divergence (except to ancestral forms). What is a dinosaur and what is a bird that I can guarantee that a bird is more advanced? I cannot name you a single system in a bird that we are sure did not exist in theropods to some degree.

I do not care about 'punishing' him for his mistake but I certainly can't go on when this contradiction stands because any further argument would require me to actually know what he's claiming is special about scientific arguments and evidence.

It usually takes the form of suggesting that atheists and/or scientists are just as irrational in what they hold to be Truth as religionists are, and therefore their worldview is no more valid than religion's. On this forum you also see it used to portray gays as being ""no worse in their way"" as their homophobic oppressors, Obama as being as unconcerned with the middle class as Gingrich, etc. On science and religion-based forums, this most commonly takes the form of semantic manipulation of the word ""belief,"" or sometimes of the word ""religion"" itself. A mathematician ""believing"" that 2+2 = 4 or a physicist ""believing"" that e=MC^2 are supposedly no different from a Christian ""believing"" that the world was created by a supernatural being in 7 days. (The more complex or non-intuitive the scientific formula or procedure involved, the more likely the fallacist is to pounce on it, because HE probably can't wrap his mind around it--and as Arthur C. Clarke once said, ""any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" For many, the sufficiently advanced technologies are those used by evolutionary biologists (genetics, etc.) and geologists (carbon-dating, etc.). With atheism, the attempt is always to prove that non-belief in God is a belief in itself, therefore people who believe in not believing in God are just as irrational/fanatical/unscientiific/whatever as those who do believe in God. This redefines the word ""atheist"" to the point of meaninglessness.

It would be stupid and without thought. One does not ""believe"" in evolution any more than one ""believes"" in gravity. Both are scientific theories that explain observation. Further, the theories of evolution do not speak to the existence or non-existence of any mythological divine being. That problem arises from you inability to reconcile your mythology with reality. That is thoughtless nonsense. What an atheist is saying is that there is no evidence for any god represented in any mythology. The only difference between you and an atheist is that an atheist believes in one less god than you. (do you believe in Thor, Odin, Zeus, Mars, Apollo, Jupiter, etc.?) Not quite. A scientific theory is an hypothesis that has been supported by repeated testing. That question only reveals your ignorance of science and how it works. In science, theories do not grow up to become facts. They are not proven. In science, a theory is as good as it gets. Gravity, electro-magnitism, and plate tectonics are theories. They each explain the observations of gravity, electro-magnitism, and plate tectonics. Evolutionary theory explains the observations of evolution. False. Have you ever heard of paleontology? Then you admit that macroevolution is a fact. Why do creationists always seem to try to reduce science to the level of creationism? Creationism is blind faith in mythology. Creationists always attempt to reduce science to the logical weakness of their faith. No we don't. Again you demonstrate your ignorance of science. You don't know the difference between a scientific hypothesis, theory, or law. Again, ignorance. Scientific laws aren't laws because we can test them. The are laws because they are simple statements of observations that have never been observed to have been violated. Scientific laws are part of the evidence that makes up scientific theories. That's pure gibborish. Why don't you apply that to your faith in mythology. On what level is it true? None. More ignorance and an unwillingness to learn. The macro-evolution of bacteria has been frequently observed. There is a bacteria that lives in the waste ponds from factories that produce nylon. They can't live anywhere else. They live by metabolizing waste products from the production of nylon. Nylon was first produced in 1935 and the bacteria were first observed in 1975.

"05-03-2012","15791",18,"charlemagne","453825","Yes; Evolution is a religion, an atheistic religion. I think it would be fair to say that people who hold to the belief of evolution affirm the non-existence of a divine being. Though it's interesting to point out, the illogical view of atheism. What the atheist is really saying is: ""there is no being with omniscience in the universe and I know it to be true by virtue of my own omniscience."" A scientific theory summarizes a hypothesis or group of hypotheses that have been supported with repeated testing. Why is evolution still just theory? Because it can only be tested at the microevolutionary scale. It isn't observable at the macroevolutionary level because it's to slow. This is where evolutionists go wrong and put down all their proofs and evidences, and take up faith (as defined as, assurance of things hoped for and conviction of things not seen). So we treat evolution as if it were a law, because we can test it at one level. Since it is true on that one level we have faith that it is true on the next level. I think it's interesting to point out that in the thousands of years of written history there is no proof of any macroevolution. Especially in today's day and age with bacteria. "" For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power, and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse. Romans 1:20""","pandion","454236","Idiotic. Evolution is scientific theory based on observations of events that conform to a scientific definition. It has nothing to do with religion or any sort of religious mythology. I think it would be fair to say that you are ignorant of science in general and evolutionary biology in particular. In general, evolutionary biologists neither affirm nor deny the existence of a magical being. But atheists deny only one more god than you. Atheists don't believe in Zeus, Odin, Thor, Athena, Jupiter, Mars, Apollo, Eros, Cupid, Isis, Quetzalcoatl, Wakan Tanka, or endless others. But you believe in a god without evidence. Instead, you believe in a mythology of bronze age, nomadic herdsmen that is quite similar to the mythology of all of the other gods mentioned. You believe without evidence and yet claim that disbelief in your mythology is illogical. WOW! That's just plain stupid. Only a fool would claim that an atheist claims omniscience. Exactly! Because evolutionary theories (there are many) summarize and explain observations of phenomena that conform to the biological definition of evolution and have been supported by repeated testing. Only the ignorant believe that scientific theories grow up to be facts. Anyone who understands science and how it works understands that the facts are the observations and the theories explain the facts. What does that mean? Was that an actual English sentence? Actual observations of macroevolutionary events aside, have you ever heard of paleontology? In what science class were you taught that science was defined as the assurence [ sic ] of things hoped for and conviction of things not seen? That is, indeed, the definition of faith. But science is based on observations of reality. In science, it doesn't matter what is hoped for, if an idea isn't supported by evidence, it is rejected. Don't be so ignorant. Evolution is a scientific definition, observations of events that conform to the definition, and explanations (theories) of the events. Scientific laws are observations that make up part of scientific hypotheses and theories. Right! In the level of observable reality. That's meaningless gibberish. It isn't even a complete English sentence. You only display your ignorance. I think that it is interesting to point out that there has never been presented any proof of a god, especially in this age of science. Look into the nylon eating bacteria - obvious (even to the most stupid) of macroevolution.

If a person believes the scientific establishment on something but do not know why it is true themselves, they rely on trusting the scientific establishment. If they believe the scientific establishment on something, and they know why it is true themselves; they can still have trust but they are not relying on it. A person who relies on trust will not be able to argue that this thing is true beyond an appeal to authority. A person who does not rely on trust will be able to argue using the reasons that have them convinced. A quick note on the difference between faith and trust. Faith is belief regardless of reason, trust is belief based on a high regard for someone's authority. They overlap when it is irrational to hold an authority in high regard, and it isn't for most scientist on most issues, while it certainly is for a God which can only be accessed through personal hallucination. Now what is the measure of authority? One might be tempted to say ""how often it is right"", but that could be a matter of luck or manipulation when the only check of whether they are right is them. A rational person (by definition) holds that reason is the only proper way to acquire knowledge, thus to told an authority in high regard is to consider it competent to carry out sound and cogent reasoning and to accurately report conclusions. There is a need for trust every day of our lives, and given to many people; but one of the places trust does not belong is debate. Debates occur when a disagreement makes it apparent that the reasoning of both sides needs to be evaluated for one or both are wrong. It makes no difference whether the reasoning used is from the individual or from some authority he/she trusts but it is the reasoning which must be evaluated. Attempting to debate by evaluating the quality of an authority (appeal to authority) is superfluous and circular because of the above mentioned fact about what constitutes the quality of an authority. i.e. the quality of the authority is it's ability to reason correctly, to determine whether it reasoned correctly one needs to evaluate it's reasoning. Now if people agree on the mechanics and by implication understand the mechanics to some degree, they will be able to argue in favor of their beliefs based on that understanding. When I see appeals to authority and nothing else I infer that the individual does not posses any understanding (correct or otherwise) and is simply relaying that they believe this or that because they trust an authority. When I argue I do not appeal to authorities, as a consequence I have had to deal with the extreme irony of being accused of having no authorities to appeal to as if that were a negative point against my argument. (ex. ""and who else thinks that?..."") Getting back to the original subject, the mechanics of AGCC aren't just wrong; they are too vague to evaluate. It doesn't even qualify as a hypothesis because crucial links between postulates are simply missing or so abstract that the number of assumptions divorces the result from any hope of accuracy. This is very similar to the fallacies implied by irrational evolution, there is a great amount of equivocation between observation, analysis, and explanation. Every little part of both AGCC and irrational evolution is on it's own valid and provable, the parts simply don't fit together to the whole that they are claimed to. This is very dangerous because scientist are highly specialized today compared to the polymaths of as little as a 100 years ago. As long as the part each scientist understands from his/her field is internally consistent no red flags will go up, that does not mean they poured over the whole body of assertion and confirmed it's validity. If everyone who agrees with AGCC could explain the whole thing consistently and clearly, and then present the repeatable experiments which prove it; it would obviously not be false. That is not the case, the junk science that goes flying around on politically charged websites, high-school text-books, and TV documentaries is the substance of this hoax and not a veneer over some properly executed scientific investigation.

And that phrase belies your further assertions. Indeed true. But it does not mean that the majority of Americans were, in fact, christians. History shows that they weren't. If you actually made the effort to read some books by real historians rather than religious zealots, you would be more informed. But, of course, history isn't what you want to hear. You want to hear that your faith in mythology is valid (it isn't). In fact, it does exactly that. The Senate of the United States in 1796 stated that the United States was not founded on christian principles. Read it again, follow with your finger and move your lips if it helps. But it wasn't meant as a description of America. It was meant as an assertion of the founding principles of this nation. Actually, what it means is that was not founded on christian principles. It doesn't mention the Bible. But it does state that the United States are not, in any sense, founded on the christian religion. Yet another Republican lie. The treaty presented to the Senate and the President did include Article 11. That is the language that was passed by the Senate and signed by the President. For the purposes of this discussion, all other versions and erroneous representations are irrelevant. But that's a moot point. It doesn't matter what the Arabic text says. What matters is the text that was presented to the Senate and then signed by the President. Why exactly do you think that the Muslim understanding of this treaty is more meaningful than the actual wording of the treaty that was passed without dissent by the Senate, and signed by the President? I'm not sure of the motivation of whoever wrote that Yale Law School nonsense, but the issue here is what language was passed by the Senate and signed by the President. All irrelevant because of the actual language of the treaty that was approved by the Senate and signed by the President.

It doesn't matter what any other version of the treaty says in any other language. The fact is that the version that was approved by the Senate and signed by the President did, in fact, include an Article 11 that stated that ""the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion.""

Americas God and Country Whatever America has evolved into today is a separate issue from what America was in the days of the American Revolution. Where did Americas great strength lie then? And what were the moral foundations of America at its inception? The evidence is overwhelming: the founding fathers tell us that our nation was conceived on the principles of the Biblical God and Christianity. Not on Hinduism, not on Humanism, nor Buddhism, nor the writings of Confucius or Islam, or even Deism, but founded on Biblical and Christian principles. Here are just some of the facts that are seldom taught in Americas public school classrooms: The most frequently recognized source for political inspiration for the founding fathers was the Bible, which was referenced in some 34% of the founding fathers quotations. The first reference to God as the foundation of an American colony was noted in the Mayflower Compact, dated November 11, 1620: .Having undertaken for the Glory of God, and advancement of the Christian faith, and the honour of our king and country, a voyage to plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia; Do by these presents, solemnly and mutually in the presence of God and one another, covenant and combine ourselves together into a Civil Body. Many of the founding fathers recognized that the principles of civil law were inseparably linked to Biblical truths. James Wilson, one of the original Supreme Court Justices, and a signer of the Constitution, explained, Human law must rest its authority ultimately upon the authority of that law which is divineFar from being rivals or enemies, religion and law are twin sisters, friends, and mutual assistants Additionally, the United States Supreme Court specifically recognized America as a Christian nation. In the case Church of the Holy Trinity vs. the United States (Feb. 29, 1892, US457-458), Justice Josiah Brewer, following a lengthy and exhaustive search of early American historical literature, commented, We find everywhere a clear recognition of the same truth.that we are a Christian nation. In another Supreme Court Case, Zorach vs. Clauson (1952, US306 307 313), Justice William O. Douglas categorically stated, We are a religious people and our institutions presuppose a Supreme Being. Further, in United States vs. Macintosh (1931, 283 US 605, 625), Justice George Sutherland affirmed, We are a Christian people.affording to one another the equal right of religious freedom, and acknowledge with reverence the duty of obedience to the will of God. Historical revisionists contend the founding fathers were predominately deists. The facts say otherwise. According to Dr. M.E. Bradford of the University of Dallas, of the 55 framers, 28 were Episcopalians, 8 were Presbyterians, 7 were Congregationalists, and there were two each of Lutherans, Dutch Reformed, Methodists and Roman Catholics. That left, by Bradfords counting, three deists and one founder whose religious views cannot be determined definitively. At the Constitutional Convention on June 28, 1787, Benjamin Franklin noted: The longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the Sacred Writings, that except the Lord build the House, they labor in vain that build it. There are many today who believe Franklin was a strict deist, but Franklin here is not only referencing the Bible, but is alluding in part to a teaching by Jesus Christ from Matthew 10:29. Concerning the outcome of the American Revolution, John Quincy Adams noted, The highest glory won from the American Revolution was this: it connected, in one indissoluble bond, the principles of civil government with the principles of Christianity. In a letter to Thomas Jefferson dated June 28, 1813, John Adams wrote: The general principles on which the (founding) fathers achieved independence werethe general principles of Christianity. Founding father Noah Webster proclaimed much the same message when he said, The religion which has introduced civil liberty is the religion of Christ and His ApostlesThis is genuine Christianity and to this we owe our free constitutions of government. Time after time, the founding fathers declared similar beliefs. From the archives of Patrick Henrys personal notes (handwritten on the back of his copy of the Stamp Act Resolutions, made public after his death) we read: Whether this (new government) will prove a blessing or a curse will depend upon the use our people make of the blessings which a gracious God hath bestowed on us. If they are wise they will be great and happy. If they are of a contrary character, they will be miserable. Righteousness alone can exalt them as a nation. Thomas Jefferson was hardly speaking from a strict deist standpoint when he said: Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice cannot sleep forever. (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781) I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who lead our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessities and comforts of life. (Monday, March 4, 1805, in his 2nd Inaugural Address) Remember, a strict deist was one who believed God was like a watchmaker, who wound up the universe and thereafter did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. Jefferson obviously believed otherwise. Speaking of Godly principles, Jefferson stated: A more beautiful or precious morsel of ethics I have never seen; it is a document in proof that I am a real Christian, that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus. (Jan. 9, 1816 In a letter to Charles Thomson) George Washington, the Father of our Country, likewise recognized God as supremely important in the American dream. In his first inaugural address on April 30, 1789, Washington remarked: It would be improper to omit, in this first official act, my fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the universe. On Saturday, October 3, 1789, President Washington said this in proclaiming a day of national thanksgiving: It is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the Providence of Almighty God. Today, our public schools are in a moral crisis. Washington once noted, If you remove religious principles from the schools you are going to lose national morality. How prophetic he was! Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence who was also known as the Father of Public Schools, once had this to offer: The only foundation for a republic isreligion. Without it there can be no virtue, and without virtue there can be no liberty. Dont miss the significance of that last statement: ..without virtue there can be no liberty. The principle is clear a lack of virtue engenders bondage. As one writer noted, Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their fetters (bindings). The more liberties a godless people achieve, the more enslaved they ultimately become in their worldly obsessions. Still another founding father, the Reverend John Witherspoon, mirrored Benjamin Rush when he declared, Civil liberty cannot long be preserved without virtue. And finally, lets not forget James Madison, known as the Chief Architect of U.S. Constitution, who once had this to say: Cursed be all that learning that is contrary to the Cross of Christ. This is just a very short list of thousands of such examples that clearly speak of the Biblical and Christian foundations of our Founding Fathers and early America. Along with these there were the church services in government buildings up to and shortly after the civil war; paid chaplains, government authorized missionaries, reliefs of Moses and the Ten Commandments in the Supreme Court building, and so on and so forth. Whatever moral foundations apart from Christian and Biblical principles one may argue was second, was not even a close second. The record on that is clear. And so today, the debate over the moral foundations of America continues, but not in this quarter. America is in a moral and spiritual decline due to the ungodly secularization of this country. Thou shalt not has been replaced with, If it feels good do it. The wisdom of God has been replaced with the tenets of men; absolute truths replaced with moral relativism, and Father God has been replaced with Mother Earth. America is now paying the price for this ill-conceived venture. The remedy: A return to Godly values and principles, upon which this nation of the people, by the people, and for the people, was clearly founded.

Nature's selection has been going on for hundreds of millions of years [Creation is continuous], flowering in Humanity, which is still on the threshold between feral animals and realized beings. People have been selectively breeding their crops and livestock since agriculture began - it's even in the Bible - at Exodus 30:37-43 Jacob ""stimulates certain sheep"" to his advantage, becoming ""very successful."" Selective breeding of chickens has created factory-farm chickens now who's breasts are bred to be so large they now they cannot walk.

Scientists frequently do genetic experimentation by breeding hundreds of generations of fruit flies, who reproduce within hours of birth, because within a few days they are able to evolve mutations that help to resolve whatever DNA riddle they're working on. ""Inbreeding"" is the common term for another sort of human meddling in evolution, in societies that for one reason or another have lots of ""Uncle Dads"" and ""Aunt Moms,"" resulting in all sorts of birth defects, Downs Syndrome, lantern jaws and jug ears. Evolution is like gravity, we don't fully understand it, but it happens. People who try to read Genesis as a literal, documentary report on actual events miss a huge part of the story and of life. Try reading it in Hebrew, its original language, without tendentious English translation and Greek-Pagan-Christian biases, and new horizons of metaphoric possibilities will open up before you. Creation-Evolution is ""God's"" fractal mind at play - beyond the ability of any human mind to grasp, and certainly not limited to or 'incarnated in"" any particular individual, living or dead.","evolution-religion","11:11 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","358"

Goodwin gives no reference for his claim, and it is actually quite false: no such inscription exists. The real fact behind the falsehood is that Franz Cumont, the founder of Mithraic Studies, in an article mentioned a Garshuni manuscript that attributed this saying to Zoroaster. The manuscript is Mingana ms. 142, and is a medieval Arabic Christian text. I had the work translated, so you can find it online (I can't post a link). Another manuscript of the same kind, quoted but not referenced by Cumont in a posthumous article, is Mingana 481. Again I had this translated, and it is here (ditto): The ""quotations"" are all fictional, and the works belong to the genre of medieval sacro-profane sayings literature, where quotations from pagan figures predicting Christ are assembled as a counterpart to the Old Testament. It would be better not to: for I'm not sure what you would hope to achieve by pasting rubbish off the web (without giving your real source, I notice, since you did not mine Goodwin for that material yourself).

It is the same mistake that Atlantis cultists make, when they argue that pyramids in Mexico and pyramids in Egypt prove the existence of Atlantis.

But I believe it exists in a few rare individuals. Far more dangerous is the many who hold it as an ideal. I think you're reading the benefits wrong, reading the selfish gene too much. The benefits of social interaction manifest in ones life and people will be friends with others for no other reason than to make their lives better. Two completely separate line of descendant genes can ally because the alliance helps them succeed, it is not necessary for them to select for each other; but in any case they are selecting for social sophistication. Take domestication of dogs for example, obviously no evolutionary benefit to helping another species in life but dogs help people and people help dogs because being more successful in life is crucial to being more successful in reproduction. Another assumption you make is that systems for distinguishing genes are pre-packaged. They aren't, for instance a well-documented instinct in humans is to protect young; this extends beyond family, race, and species boundaries well into the irrational. It doesn't matter that some of the behavior the instinct causes is useless to selection because most of it gets focused on local human young, usually from the family or tribe. Unless people let farther removed instincts override closer ones there will be no appreciable selection pressure against them. I disagree we are more inclined to want to help those of the same race etc... I think we are inclined to help those whom we admire and who help us. Admiration from a evolutionary prospective has only one reasonable interpretation. Traits which one human finds positive, regardless of whether they are related to his own genome are selected for. That is why I say humans in acquiring reason have transcended the traditional perception of natural selection. We select for what we think is best, often regardless of the success of our own genes. The desire to help others who help us is nothing more than the trader principle; if someone can help you succeed there is no genealogy requirement. This by the way plays perfectly into objectivist philosophy which holds the trader principle as the basis of society and virtue as the basis of love. As an objectivist I have the peculiar luxury of finding no contradiction in human nature, evolutionary theory, and ethics. If you're here to help others; others are here to help you, make it fair, make it consensual and you have nothing to feel guilty for. Racism I believe (like all collectivism) is a transient disease which we as a race become vulnerable to when we began to think conceptually and rationally (remember logic is not the lack of inference but consistent inference). Maybe there are some instincts behind it, but I haven't encountered them so I doubt their existence. You may have grown out of that form of collectivism but the fallacious conceptions that caused it remain. You will never escape prejudice until you stop thinking of people in terms of what collective you think they belong to.","evolution-religion","12:46 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","383"

I give to charity for no personal gain, I don't crow about it, you might argue that the gain is my own sense of contribution but I feel that I do it to help others and thats it. Look at people who donate bone marrow to strangers or other body parts. IT exists.","evolution-religion","08:14 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","384"
"05-28-2013","15791",26,"Theophilus","441302","Many Christians, such as myself, will often argue that Evolution in itself is a religion. One of the definitions from Merriam-Webster of religion is, ""a cause, principle, or held to with ardor and faith."" I would argue that in order to believe the theory of evolution it takes ardor and faith. You must have faith that intelligent design did not cause the origin of life. You must also have faith that species have evolved, etc. I am interested to know what everyone else thinks.","BarryDesborough","473722","Faith is holding something to be true despite the lack of evidence for it. There is more than enough evidence for evolution such that it qualifies as a rational conclusion, rather than a faith. Anyway, why is religion a dirty word? And even if evolution was a religion, that would not make it false, would it?","evolution-religion","10:44 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","385"
