If you wish to help ripskar in his task you may but you will have to do the work yourself. Links are for supporting factual premises that are in doubt; nothing more. You have a tendency of throwing articles at me hoping they will help your case when in fact they have nothing to do with it, and you all but admit it that is so because when asked how it matters you 'stick your fingers in your ears'.","Bennedict","443648","Logic is a tool used to form scientific arguments. You can't base a scientific argument on logic alone; you need evidence. Indeed you sometimes have logical assertions, but without evidence, they remain assertions, not arguments. You asked Ripskar to show you when evolution is utilized in certain fields, and I issued a number of resources documenting such events. You then refuse to read these resources. With that, you've effectively created a logical contradiction. Jerry: ""Show me a photograph of Obama with Hillary Clinton to prove that they've met."" Tim: ""Okay, here.

"11-28-2011","15791",7,"Freedom","443638","That would be a better situation than the reality, the 'theory' is so enshrouded by mystical allusions and fawning awe that to call the irrational parts theory at all is unfair to all theories. You can see in this back and forth with bennedict the nature of the issue, he alternates between saying I don't understand the evolutionary theory and saying evolutionary theory is not contradicted by what I say. He says things like 'no real scientist thinks otherwise'. So I using IC analysis am arguing that evolutionary theory does not explain/predict all that it is claimed to, how do I know that it's being claimed? The two questions I just asked of bennedict testify to the fact that some do believe it is an operational theory of life. You can say no evolutionary biologist would make the mistakes I argue against, but you can't have it both ways. The mistakes I argue against are the fallacies IC exposes, if they didn't make them then IC would be nothing new or incorrect and all opposition to behe would take the form of attacking the false dichotomy he presents. That does not occur, and the simplest explanation is that they do make those mistakes and they accept the false dichotomy. Bottom line the most accurate way to describe the conclusion of my argument is that evolution is not what many want/believe/hope it to be. It does not explain advancement (the addition of biotechnology i.e. novel systems). Life has advanced and thus it does not explain life before the first cell, after the first cell, even up till the most recent addition. Now the confusion about what the theory is, is again entirely the fault of this intellectual fog that people cover it with. The word evolution is used in a multitude of senses and equivocated when necessary. Sometimes it is merely a term defined as a species changing over time (the only way species can change over time gene frequencies). There is nothing bad or incorrect about a description like that but it doesn't explain anything anymore than calling a bolt metal explains how to cast one. It is used to mean the event in which any mutation is selected, which does explain something; why the mutation was spread and endured, but it does not explain the change the mutation made itself, or any number of those changes. The 'theory' as a whole relies on the human ability to scale a pattern for it's explicative power, in this case scaling the process of mutation and natural selection produces a 'sense' that things will keep getting better because 'bad' is being filtered out. Such an effect over a long time will accumulate into a lot of good it seems and this 'reasonability' by all evidence is the substance of the layman's understanding. That however is a vague and imprecise understanding. The IC analysis is more formal and precise essentially by categorizing and defining what exactly good means in evolution, and examining what accumulates and why. To explain the final result you need to explain both the change and why it's still around. You can't do the former with one random occurrence likelihood irrelevant. You need to show that it is non-random occurrence or an accumulation of non-random occurrences and that can only be accomplished by natural selection. Thus to actually explain any change (we aren't sub-specifying types right now) you need to show that it is the result of a series of non-random selections. Thus you can't have explanation for a single mutation selection pair. Second it means that whether or not the final product is explained is dependent on selection events, specifically whether those selection events do non-randomly explain it's formation. IC is all this plus the observation that while some series of selections can explain the end products others cannot. Now given that evolution is used constantly to explain structures and changes of all sorts it can be reasonably stated that the prior two usages of the word are irrelevant and confusing, used only for their value in equivocating. The ignorant amateur who's going to hurl blind insults to defend what he doesn't understand.","Accipiter","443667","No body who agrees with evolution wants, believes and hopes it to be true, they agree with it because it makes sense and agrees with observations. You make it sound as if there is some kind of conspiracy to get people to accept evolution. My question is what would be the point of that, what would their motivation be?","evolution-religion","08:50 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","101"

As I said in the scientific conspiracy thread, an unconscious one yes. The kind that forms when any group of associated people believe firmly in something. The same kind that formed around Rand & her novels during her life. You've got to understand that it's not sinister to make plans if you don't believe what you're doing is wrong. It's like saying a school board meeting is a conspiracy to educate children. Yet I would characterize the behavior of religious education as a concerted effort to condition faith into students, borderline brainwashing but I couldn't very well accuse them of malice unless I were to doubt their own belief in the worth of faith. That's a bit of a silly question as you addressed the answer at the top, their motivation is that they want and hope it to be true so that they can have a supposedly working theory of life. For anyone who believes in the false dichotomy between ID and evolution, it's a philosophical requirement to replace a creation myth with a scientific theory before they can abandon belief in the supernatural. The motivation is the age old temptation of explaining something you aren't actually able to via intellectual shortcuts. I think we both agree that the origin of religion is essentially a mental short-circuit in which people simply (and probably unconsciously) became frustrated with their ignorance, especially about the truth value of morality and concatenated stories that 'explained' the world around them and most importantly explained themselves. Why would someone say god may the heaven's and the earth? What was their motivation? Why is sickness caused by an imbalance of the elements? Why would someone draw a map of a flat planet when they've never seen the edges?","evolution-religion","11:16 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","102"

You asked to be shown evolution being utilized in certain fields, I posted resources which would show you this, if you had bothered to read a bit, you refuse to read them. Logically, this is absurd, and equivalent to my Obama and Hillary illustration. You haven't asked Ripskar to show you evidence of an urban legend (whether you believe evolution is one or not), you asked him to show you when evolution is used in the fields that he listed. Yes, you aren't entire bought over by the theory, but that isn't what you've asked for. Evolution is being used in agriculture, immunization, etc. whether you accept it or not, and there are numerous resources documenting that. If I asked someone to show me people's reactions to climate change and someone posted a statistic showing the increase in recycling in western cultures, and then I refused to view it on the basis that I can logically assert that people don't care for the environment at all, I would have failed at proposing an argument, countering any argument, and my doing so would be a display of my ignorance and arrogance. Some people are up in the air about the validity of the climate change rumors, but I never asked someone to show me evidence for climate change.","evolution-religion","12:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","103"
