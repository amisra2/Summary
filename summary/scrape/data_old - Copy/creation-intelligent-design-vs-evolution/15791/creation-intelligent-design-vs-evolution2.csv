Selection and speciation have both been observed, you can also observed selection and speciation in the fossil record. Evolution is observable taking place all around us every day.","evolution-religion","07:51 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","16"
"10-22-2011","15791",2,"Theophilus","441348","Have you observed evolution?","thelmoose","441378","Have I personally? What sort of question is that? It has been observed in the field and experimentally by those who study this. thousands of times. You have yet to support your original premise, that belief in evolution is a religion - that it requires faith, i.e. acceptance of ideas without evidence. That actually is a rather paltry and narrow definition of religion. But even using that contrived definition, you have yet to support your case. And numerous posters have refuted it. You started by saying, ""I am interested to know what everyone else thinks."" You have not really acted like that thus far.","evolution-religion","07:56 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","17"
"10-22-2011","15791",2,"Theophilus","441372","I'm talking about Macroevolution. Should have clarified. Microevolution aka Adaptation is not the question here. The term ""macroevolution"" frequently arises within the context of the evolution/creation debate, usually used by creationists alleging a significant difference between the evolutionary changes observed in field and laboratory studies and the larger scale macroevolutionary changes that scientists believe to have taken thousands or millions of years to occur. They may accept that evolutionary change is possible within species (""microevolution""), but deny that one species can evolve into another (""macroevolution"").[1] Contrary to this belief among the anti-evolution movement proponents, evolution of life forms beyond the species level (""macroevolution"", i.e. speciation in a specific case) has indeed been observed multiple times under both controlled laboratory conditions and in nature.[12] The claim that macroevolution does not occur, or is impossible, is thus demonstrably false and without support in the scientific community.","Accipiter","441379","Yeah we played that game already, care to try something else?

"10-22-2011","15791",2,"None","None","None","Bennedict","441386","Do you have a dog, Theo? You wouldn't if macroevolution were false, because dogs were created by selection. A St. Bernard doesn't reproduce with a weiner dog (because a weiner dog is small and a St. Bernard is big; biologically they could, but they don't naturally), and under the description of speciation, that makes them different species. Here's the thing about those who believe in micro but not macroevolution - there is no ""glass ceiling"" as I call it. If you recognize that an organism can change genetically even a little bit, there's nothing stopping it from changing so much over a large period of time, so that it can no longer reproduce with other organisms it's related to. There is no line separating micro and macroevolution; enough micro changes adds up to a macro change.","evolution-religion","11:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","20"

"10-23-2011","15791",2,"Theophilus","441372","I'm talking about Macroevolution. Should have clarified. Microevolution aka Adaptation is not the question here.","Matthew","441392","A misuse of terms. And a very common misuse: accepting microevolution while denying macroevolution is a standard rhetorical strategy of creationists. But it's not hard to answer, along essentially the same lines as in the Wikipedia article already cited by others. Microevolution is hardly opposed to macroevolution; indeed, macroevolution is just microevolution over time. When a single population is divided, and each adapts separately to its distinct conditions, this adaptive divergence is macroevolution -- more specifically, it is speciation. After a larger or smaller number of generations, the one lineage becomes two. It is also possible for a single population to adapt to changed conditions over time so much that it no longer resembles its own ancestor sufficiently to have been able to reproduce with it. This adaptive change is macroevolution -- specifically, it is phyletic evolution. As conditions change, so does the species. While each generation can reproduce effectively with some generations before and after it, there is some number of generations before or after each generation at which point reproduction would be impossible. So we have one lineage that is different species at different times. The Lenski experiment is a perfect illustration of both speciation and phyletic evolution. All the different populations have diverged, and are not ""the same"" any longer, any more than are a mastiff and a chihuahua. And each lineage has changed relative to its own earlier generations (especially the lineage that evolved the ability to use citrate as food, which significantly differs from its earlier attributes, and from the other lineages, too). So using the microevolution/macroevolution distinction against evolutionary theory just won't fly. Indeed, like most creationist arguments against evolution, this has been much used, even though the flaw was pointed out a looooong time ago. Remember when I discussed trust in the post before the one you quoted here? Please: trust creationist authors and thinkers much less than you evidently do. Perhaps they mean well; not being able to read minds, I will decline to speculate on their motives and presume that they are sincere. But the arguments they use are incorrect, and have been known to be incorrect for some while. And yet they still repeat these arguments, as if they'd never been answered. Don't fall for it, Theophilus! Whether intentionally deceptive or not, their arguments work only to the extent that their audiences don't know evolution and trust their characterization of it -- their mis characterization of it -- instead.","evolution-religion","01:30 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","22"
