If everyone has better things to do than debate with a member then it does not get debated","evolution-religion","10:22 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","303"
"06-20-2012","15791",21,"Freedom","457359","You're pathetic, you assert that somethings shouldn't be argued; now whether some things shouldn't be argued shouldn't be argued. I am going to take that (with little to no surprise) as a dodge. Next time you flunk out of debating evolution, morality, politics, law, physics, sex, or just about anything else of any consequence I'll remember why: ""It's flaky because it's a waste of time because it's stupid, because you would actually argue it""","Accipiter","457401","OK so you are telling me that debating the existence of Bigfoot is not stupid?","evolution-religion","08:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","304"
"06-20-2012","15791",21,"Freedom","457404","Every debate is an honest attempt to find the truth if neither party intentionally issues fallacies. And if it is indeed ones decision not to debate something, the polite, honorable, and respectable thing to say is ""I do not wish to argue this"". Many of the members of this forum have provided an excellent example of what not to do: 1. Do not dismiss that which you are not willing to argue, calling a waste of time to argue it yet continuously assert you were right. 2. Do not refuse to argue by giving excuses like ""my opponents so stupid"" or ""If he doesn't get it he never will"". You have your own reasons for not debating, it is absurd to be willing to argue about the character and quality of your opponent but not the subject over which you disagree. 3. Do continue to challenge what you refused to debate, if you don't think it's worth it live with your decision. Using the conclusion of an argument you never made is like trying to eat a cake you never baked. Yes. The more unusual or 'out there' a belief is the more important it is to find the truth. If I only argued against what I found plausible already I might end up sounding like you (i.e. running for the hills anytime I encountered any position more than a few degrees off of mine).","Accipiter","457405","You do know that Bigfoot is not real, don't you?","evolution-religion","10:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","306"
"06-20-2012","15791",21,"Accipiter","457405","You do know that Bigfoot is not real, don't you?","Freedom","457407","Actually I don't, I doubt there is a big foot, just as I doubt there are alien space ships flying around. I am sure the Apollo missions went to the moon. Shall we have a little test, what is the epistemological difference that caused that pattern of belief? More importantly though, your assertion one way or another means nothing; you would have to debate it.","evolution-religion","10:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","307"

Shall we have a little test, what is the epistemological difference that caused that pattern of belief?","Accipiter","457409","Why is it so difficult for you to admit that some things are just common sense? You have put your self in a box in which nothing can be known, I say step out and learn about the world and stop worrying about conspiracies. Critical thinking is a completely different thing from faith. Your insisting that the way we believe things is mechanically all the same is as ridiculous as Bigfoot.","evolution-religion","11:13 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","308"
"06-20-2012","15791",21,"Freedom","457404","Every debate is an honest attempt to find the truth if neither party intentionally issues fallacies.","Karl","457410","Nothing about changing your position when you are shown to be incorrect?","evolution-religion","11:42 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","309"
"06-21-2012","15791",21,"Freedom","457411","It's not, but if there is disagreement; that sense isn't common is it? I could not, with a decade; have imagined a more ironic statement in the context of what you have said in this thread. The box in which nothing can be known, has walls built out of the unwillingness to rationally consider. Which of us was it that advocated the intentionally dismissal and ignorance of any subject based on what? Whether one thinks it's ""stupid""? Critical thinking is a completely different thing from faith. What does that mean? Are you trying to dismiss debate itself now instead of just the subjects you don't like? Ridicule is the hallmark of uncommon ideas, not the hallmark of false hood. It is a given that one abandons falsified arguments and accepts sound ones. Fallacies are what occur most often when one is not willing to change their position despite being shown to be incorrect. Occasionally they were also the original reason the belief was taken up as well.","Accipiter","457429","Common sense by its very nature is dead simple, most fools understand it. You don't touch hot things, you don't jump off buildings without a parachute and rocks are hard, stuff like that. Do you understand?","evolution-religion","09:34 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","311"

I understand that, OK?","evolution-religion","09:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","312"

Will it hurt your feelings or something?","Freedom","457492","Because I do not ridicule in place of debate. The context in which you introduced big foot was a hypothetical disagreement, specifically whether it was 'worth' debating. It doesn't matter if I think it's ridiculous, at the end of a proper debate there is no question left as to whether a conclusion is wrong. I will use terms like absurd, ridiculous, or silly but only to convey how much I disagree with something, never as an argument. I can't remember the last time I saw you do anything more than ridicule another's opinion. No I don't think it's ridiculous by the way.","evolution-religion","09:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","314"
"06-24-2012","15791",21,"Freedom","456811","Exactly, everything is open to debate if two people are willing to debate it. All three of those things are more probable than the existence of a monotheistic God, yet half the world believes in that. The limit to what you debate is what you want to debate, but the limit to what should be debated is the limit to what can be believed. the limit to what should be debated is the limit to what can be believed","Winston Smith","457598","so according to you the existence of Big Foot is more probable than the existence of God, how did you figure that out ? how do you assign probabilty? according to you what do you mean by 'believed' ? how do you set a limit to what can be 'believed' ?","evolution-religion","04:24 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","315"
