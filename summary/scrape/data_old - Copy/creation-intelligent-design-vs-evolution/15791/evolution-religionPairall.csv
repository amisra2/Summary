A machine works as it does regardless of it's origin. We only know to expect homology when we see homology but to exult evolution supporters will wire that through common descent to give the impression that common descent gave some useful insight. Those who literally think evolution has some kind of practical use need to be told that you can wake up in the morning without calling the ceiling evolution. They have to say insane things like inheritance is evolution and since we need to understand inheritance we must understand evolution. In fact the best example someone could possibly give to that point would be researchers considering the adaptation of bacteria to anti-biotics.

"11-28-2011",2,"15791","101","Freedom","443638","That would be a better situation than the reality, the 'theory' is so enshrouded by mystical allusions and fawning awe that to call the irrational parts theory at all is unfair to all theories. You can see in this back and forth with bennedict the nature of the issue, he alternates between saying I don't understand the evolutionary theory and saying evolutionary theory is not contradicted by what I say. He says things like 'no real scientist thinks otherwise'. So I using IC analysis am arguing that evolutionary theory does not explain/predict all that it is claimed to, how do I know that it's being claimed? The two questions I just asked of bennedict testify to the fact that some do believe it is an operational theory of life. You can say no evolutionary biologist would make the mistakes I argue against, but you can't have it both ways. The mistakes I argue against are the fallacies IC exposes, if they didn't make them then IC would be nothing new or incorrect and all opposition to behe would take the form of attacking the false dichotomy he presents. That does not occur, and the simplest explanation is that they do make those mistakes and they accept the false dichotomy. Bottom line the most accurate way to describe the conclusion of my argument is that evolution is not what many want/believe/hope it to be. It does not explain advancement (the addition of biotechnology i.e. novel systems). Life has advanced and thus it does not explain life before the first cell, after the first cell, even up till the most recent addition. Now the confusion about what the theory is, is again entirely the fault of this intellectual fog that people cover it with. The word evolution is used in a multitude of senses and equivocated when necessary. Sometimes it is merely a term defined as a species changing over time (the only way species can change over time gene frequencies). There is nothing bad or incorrect about a description like that but it doesn't explain anything anymore than calling a bolt metal explains how to cast one. It is used to mean the event in which any mutation is selected, which does explain something; why the mutation was spread and endured, but it does not explain the change the mutation made itself, or any number of those changes. The 'theory' as a whole relies on the human ability to scale a pattern for it's explicative power, in this case scaling the process of mutation and natural selection produces a 'sense' that things will keep getting better because 'bad' is being filtered out. Such an effect over a long time will accumulate into a lot of good it seems and this 'reasonability' by all evidence is the substance of the layman's understanding. That however is a vague and imprecise understanding. The IC analysis is more formal and precise essentially by categorizing and defining what exactly good means in evolution, and examining what accumulates and why. To explain the final result you need to explain both the change and why it's still around. You can't do the former with one random occurrence likelihood irrelevant. You need to show that it is non-random occurrence or an accumulation of non-random occurrences and that can only be accomplished by natural selection. Thus to actually explain any change (we aren't sub-specifying types right now) you need to show that it is the result of a series of non-random selections. Thus you can't have explanation for a single mutation selection pair. Second it means that whether or not the final product is explained is dependent on selection events, specifically whether those selection events do non-randomly explain it's formation. IC is all this plus the observation that while some series of selections can explain the end products others cannot. Now given that evolution is used constantly to explain structures and changes of all sorts it can be reasonably stated that the prior two usages of the word are irrelevant and confusing, used only for their value in equivocating. The ignorant amateur who's going to hurl blind insults to defend what he doesn't understand.","Accipiter","443667","No body who agrees with evolution wants, believes and hopes it to be true, they agree with it because it makes sense and agrees with observations.

It has gotten to a point where many colleges and universities offer specific courses on 'environmental science', which simply assumes the assertions of AGCC to say the least. I know you understand this affect because you see it in people like easyrider, if you go to school with people who all assume something is true beyond doubt; and study subjects like theology which would have no meaning without these assumptions, you are likely going to be irrevocably biased if asked to conduct research based on the skills you learned at school. Now biased people can be good scientist, because science doesn't operate off of personal authority; it operates off of objective evidence and sound reasoning.

If a person believes the scientific establishment on something but do not know why it is true themselves, they rely on trusting the scientific establishment. If they believe the scientific establishment on something, and they know why it is true themselves; they can still have trust but they are not relying on it. A person who relies on trust will not be able to argue that this thing is true beyond an appeal to authority. A person who does not rely on trust will be able to argue using the reasons that have them convinced. A quick note on the difference between faith and trust. Faith is belief regardless of reason, trust is belief based on a high regard for someone's authority. They overlap when it is irrational to hold an authority in high regard, and it isn't for most scientist on most issues, while it certainly is for a God which can only be accessed through personal hallucination. Now what is the measure of authority? One might be tempted to say ""how often it is right"", but that could be a matter of luck or manipulation when the only check of whether they are right is them. A rational person (by definition) holds that reason is the only proper way to acquire knowledge, thus to told an authority in high regard is to consider it competent to carry out sound and cogent reasoning and to accurately report conclusions. There is a need for trust every day of our lives, and given to many people; but one of the places trust does not belong is debate. Debates occur when a disagreement makes it apparent that the reasoning of both sides needs to be evaluated for one or both are wrong. It makes no difference whether the reasoning used is from the individual or from some authority he/she trusts but it is the reasoning which must be evaluated. Attempting to debate by evaluating the quality of an authority (appeal to authority) is superfluous and circular because of the above mentioned fact about what constitutes the quality of an authority. i.e. the quality of the authority is it's ability to reason correctly, to determine whether it reasoned correctly one needs to evaluate it's reasoning. Now if people agree on the mechanics and by implication understand the mechanics to some degree, they will be able to argue in favor of their beliefs based on that understanding. When I see appeals to authority and nothing else I infer that the individual does not posses any understanding (correct or otherwise) and is simply relaying that they believe this or that because they trust an authority. When I argue I do not appeal to authorities, as a consequence I have had to deal with the extreme irony of being accused of having no authorities to appeal to as if that were a negative point against my argument. (ex. ""and who else thinks that?..."") Getting back to the original subject, the mechanics of AGCC aren't just wrong; they are too vague to evaluate. It doesn't even qualify as a hypothesis because crucial links between postulates are simply missing or so abstract that the number of assumptions divorces the result from any hope of accuracy. This is very similar to the fallacies implied by irrational evolution, there is a great amount of equivocation between observation, analysis, and explanation. Every little part of both AGCC and irrational evolution is on it's own valid and provable, the parts simply don't fit together to the whole that they are claimed to. This is very dangerous because scientist are highly specialized today compared to the polymaths of as little as a 100 years ago. As long as the part each scientist understands from his/her field is internally consistent no red flags will go up, that does not mean they poured over the whole body of assertion and confirmed it's validity.

"06-10-2012",4,"15791","289","Freedom","456728","I offer you this dichotomy. If a person believes the scientific establishment on something but do not know why it is true themselves, they rely on trusting the scientific establishment. If they believe the scientific establishment on something, and they know why it is true themselves; they can still have trust but they are not relying on it. A person who relies on trust will not be able to argue that this thing is true beyond an appeal to authority. A person who does not rely on trust will be able to argue using the reasons that have them convinced. A quick note on the difference between faith and trust. Faith is belief regardless of reason, trust is belief based on a high regard for someone's authority. They overlap when it is irrational to hold an authority in high regard, and it isn't for most scientist on most issues, while it certainly is for a God which can only be accessed through personal hallucination. Now what is the measure of authority? One might be tempted to say ""how often it is right"", but that could be a matter of luck or manipulation when the only check of whether they are right is them. A rational person (by definition) holds that reason is the only proper way to acquire knowledge, thus to told an authority in high regard is to consider it competent to carry out sound and cogent reasoning and to accurately report conclusions. There is a need for trust every day of our lives, and given to many people; but one of the places trust does not belong is debate. Debates occur when a disagreement makes it apparent that the reasoning of both sides needs to be evaluated for one or both are wrong. It makes no difference whether the reasoning used is from the individual or from some authority he/she trusts but it is the reasoning which must be evaluated. Attempting to debate by evaluating the quality of an authority (appeal to authority) is superfluous and circular because of the above mentioned fact about what constitutes the quality of an authority. i.e. the quality of the authority is it's ability to reason correctly, to determine whether it reasoned correctly one needs to evaluate it's reasoning.
