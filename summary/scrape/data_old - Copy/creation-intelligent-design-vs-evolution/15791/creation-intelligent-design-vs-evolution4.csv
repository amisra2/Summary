Should there be a limit on how complex a system can naturally be? At what point do we say, ""Now wait a minute, this system is naturally adapting too complex, something is at work here?"" My point is that there is no limit. Its like me saying, the sun has emitted way too much light to be natural, it can't merely be the result of the accretion of hydrogen gas. It must have been created because of all this light.","evolution-religion","07:59 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","47"

"11-17-2011","15791",4,"Freedom","443035","You're conflating concepts again, adaptation does not necessitate an increase in complexity and an increase in information does not necessitate an increase in functional complexity. It's not a matter of scale which is why micro vs macro is an improper conceptualization. By logic it can't be by definition, as for non-logical attacks and subsequent 'defeats' objectivism can neither address nor recognize them. Lol what does a soul have to do with anything?","Databed","443058","Who cares if it necessitates it or not? The fact is, we have a structure that is termed too complex to have evolved. Yet, adaptations, which we can clearly observe, are acceptable. So we have two terms, adaptation and evolution, one a smaller scale version of the other. So at what point do we say that adaptation must cease to progress because it is getting too close to evolution? Because a soul is the only thing we can directly observe that cannot be described objectively. Can you think of anything else? If soul, or self, is an illusion and we can figure out why, then an objective reasoning into its existence or lack thereof is possible. Sometimes, when people have a hard time grasping this, I suspect they are not truly self aware.","evolution-religion","09:18 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","52"

Nothing's too complex to evolve, it's too complex to reasonably accept the explanation that it randomly appeared. Not even the simplest novel function evolves. Adaptation does not imply novelty, a system which is already functional can increase in functionality in a non-random explained manner in response to external changes or simply the removing of an internal block to the increase. This has been the case with all examples you have brought, which is not to say that I don't believe that any novel system couldn't arise by chance, we just haven't seen it which strengthens immensely the estimation that the odds are beyond even the vast number of trials being conducted. Since you obviously forgot or never understood our previous engagements on the subject I will remind you that it is no point in the favor of evolutionist at all that the perception of the odds is an estimation, for as I have pointed out many many times just because one finds something likely does not make it true. Further while we do not the odds for specific occurrences we can infer a general landscape which I have done for you and others. Scale is irrelevant. Never, adaptation is evolution. Spontaneous formation of functional systems is not. First off ignorance is no more a barrier to acceptance of objective truth than an unexplained phenomenon in nature undermines the scientific method. (those are in fact the same situation) You've no doubt heard such thinking from anti-science people. What could you prove about the soul that would cast doubt on the idea that truth is based on reality as accessed by rational investigation when the very concept 'prove' relies on the premise of rationalism? There are many many words that are used with fuzzy meanings and no real definition besides soul. You are not detecting some fundamental failure of human knowledge but only an insignificant failure of human language. The more definition you give to soul, the more objective the concepts used in it's meaning the more you could describe it objectively. What is psychology? Now don't get me wrong I don't have the greatest respect for psychologist they seem to do an awful lot with very little evidence but I don't believe the field itself is inherently doomed. What makes you think you are an illusion? What makes anyone think that? Drugged mystics sitting under trees seeking enlightenment substituting starvation for thought is who. I think therefore I am. An illusion cannot reflect on it's unreal state. Indeed they must be zombies to think they are real.","evolution-religion","02:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","53"

By means of the evolutionary process of natural selection it has adapted to the environment. What, exactly, do you think that Darwin meant? You're going to have to define in specific terms what you mean by adaptation that somehow separates it from the process of evolution by natural selection. Adaptation is a consequence of evolution by natural selection. I did. OK. But I knew that. I learned that in my studies of genetics and molecular biology. So by ""we,"" you are saying that you are a molecular biologist engaged in research? Or do you mean that you, as a scientific illiterate, accept on faith the findings of research biologists? Again with the ""we."" But the statement is fundamentally nonsense. Of course scientists recognize that life is complex. Actually, it doesn't. When one considers that the genetic code is universal to all living beings, it isn't difficult, at all, to accept that all life had a common source. And when the evidence of common descent presented by the fossil record, morphology, anatomy, and DNA analysis is considered, it is the most reasonable to conclude that all life is descended from a single source.","evolution-religion","01:57 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","54"

Complexity arises due to a lack of design or forethought.","Freedom","443249","I can see you are no engineer. Complexity arises out of quality of function, order out of quality of design. A good machine is not 'simple' it merely avoids unnecessary complexity and is thus the 'simplest' that it can be while accomplishing it's function. Machines have beauty and elegance, like a piece of art and the epitome of that art is the ability to identify the core principle of it's purpose and/or the mechanics behind it's function and devise operation which embodies and thus seems to almost spring from that principle. It's like the saying that the statue is already in there you are just removing the unwanted stone. I've seen many a design that 'wrests' it's function through the brute force of linear implementation of known design. It is not harmonious, these machines break faster, are hard to repair and modify, and are more easily disabled by unseen variables. Simplicity is not actually on the same axis as these other measures, to our brains order is easier to understand than chaos and given two systems of equal complexity the more ordered one will seem the simpler. Complexity occurs in nature quite often in chaotic systems, and order appears quite often as the result of 'simple' laws; what is unusual and unique to life is ordered complexity/complex order. A crystal is more ordered than life but is merely a geometric imperative that can be understood by understanding the forces surrounding a single particle. A nebula is possibly several times more complex than anything we have ever studied but it is so because of a lack of order.","evolution-religion","03:07 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","57"

Machines that are either poorly designed or poorly built either do not function as efficiently as possible, or get broken easily. Every biological system in every organism has some sort of flaw, sometimes fundamental flaws, because they don't function as efficiently as possible, and they do get broken easily and sometimes permanently. This then leads the belief that biological systems are not designed, due to the many flaws. With evolution, these flaws make sense. But, in the case of the retina and optic nerve being backwards for example, if the design folk are correct - God help us - this is such an obvious design flaw that it must be intentional. It makes no sense.","evolution-religion","12:07 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","58"

I've studied the function of ecosystems in the field and what I see is equivalent to kids playing on a busy road. Failure is inevitable individuals simply survive for as long as they can before they are eaten.

I just got through reading an 8 page article on Stuxnet and in this case, complexity was what made it so successful (and advanced, Freedom ). However, it ultimately failed and so its complexity just meant more wasted time.","evolution-religion","07:58 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","60"
