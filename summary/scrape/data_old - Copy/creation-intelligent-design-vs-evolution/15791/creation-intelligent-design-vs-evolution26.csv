Of course evolutionary theory isn't a religion, if it were then it would have it's set beliefs and that would be that. But the fact is, evolutionary theory is changing all of the time as our understanding of the mechanics improves and our ability to study things in different ways develops. We have super computers which can run evolving computer programs and this helps us understand how seemingly random mutations can achieve high complexity by using a few simple rules. Religions try their hardest to remain the same whilst the world has changed around them, evolved if you will. The hiararchy of many religions encourages those at the top to move the goalposts to sustain the validity of their dogma and therefore sustain the wealth and power that comes with the job. We are spiritual beings in the sense that we have these non substantial feelings such as love, fear, anger and hope. This does not mean we need to look elsewhere for moral guidance. I have a profound love for the human race and if I see a person in need I will help them. I know that hurting others is wrong, I know that stealing another's belongings is wrong, just as I know that discriminating against someone for the colour of their skin or sexuality is WRONG. I don't need a god to tell me this or teach me this, my mother taught me. Religion died a long time ago where I am from, but the world still turns. People still live in a community and that community hasn't broken down into a morally confused mess, we know inside ourselves once we reach a point in our lives where we can comprehend these ideas, we know wrong from right. I think that is a beautiful aspect of evolution.","evolution-religion","09:02 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","376"

That's true but I think religious institutions have tend to hang on for dear life and have more to lose. Yes evolutionary developments they may be, but what I meant was the spiritual concepts of love for mankind, altruism and a sense of right and wrong allowing us do evolve in a psycological sense into an animal which stands above all others. And that person would likely be racist and homophobic, but how would that child feel if they grew up to be gay? As far as racism is concerned I think once that person grew up and gained some life experience they may just ""evolve"". I haven't had some kind of amazing life where I've skipped through the dafodills singing Somewhere Over The Rainbow, I was born and raised in a deprived area in one of the most deprived cities in the UK. The majority of my peers are racists, professional criminals, multi generational unemployed or in low paid menial work. I have been brutalised to an extent, obviously not the same as an abusive family, but by being bullied at school and on the streets of my own town. I have developed my world view using my experiences in a positive way. Mind you I do suffer from Bipolar Disorder so if you ask me in a week or two I might have a whole different outlook. I agree.","evolution-religion","04:48 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","378"

Why do you confuse learning with evolving? Racist and homophobic are your labels that some societies deem to be the correct attitude. My opinion has nothing to do with the topic. You are the one that tells us that you know better than others. Many people gain life experience and still are homophobic and racist. Why do you confuse experience with evolution?

I think altruism is a contributing factor, just because the whole species doesn't display it, without it the species as a whole would be worse off. When I say that we stand above all other species, I don't just mean that love, hope and altruism got us there. I also trust in our ability to reason, I use reason to decide not to be a racist. I use it to not be homophobic. I use it to trust in the scientific method. I don't see being spiritual or reasonable as being mutually exclusive.

Can you think of any human behavior that at some level could not be attributed to some gain achieved by the one supposedly being altruistic? You do see people being kind, helping others, and even complete strangers...but this behavior is more likely to result in return favors than anything else. In addition, from an evolutionary point of view, you should be more inclined to want to help those who are more closely related to you: those in your family, those in the same tribe, those who speak your language, those of the same race, those of the same species... I think it could be argued this inclination is observed in human behavior. You are right that reason can overcome these natural inclinations. When I was young, I was somewhat racist, but I have grown out of that. My instinct was to be annoyed by certain people from another race and I envisioned the perfect world as one where there was only one race. Being spiritual and being reasonable is not mutually exclusive - being religious and reasonable certainly is.","evolution-religion","08:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","382"

But I believe it exists in a few rare individuals. Far more dangerous is the many who hold it as an ideal. I think you're reading the benefits wrong, reading the selfish gene too much. The benefits of social interaction manifest in ones life and people will be friends with others for no other reason than to make their lives better. Two completely separate line of descendant genes can ally because the alliance helps them succeed, it is not necessary for them to select for each other; but in any case they are selecting for social sophistication. Take domestication of dogs for example, obviously no evolutionary benefit to helping another species in life but dogs help people and people help dogs because being more successful in life is crucial to being more successful in reproduction. Another assumption you make is that systems for distinguishing genes are pre-packaged. They aren't, for instance a well-documented instinct in humans is to protect young; this extends beyond family, race, and species boundaries well into the irrational. It doesn't matter that some of the behavior the instinct causes is useless to selection because most of it gets focused on local human young, usually from the family or tribe. Unless people let farther removed instincts override closer ones there will be no appreciable selection pressure against them. I disagree we are more inclined to want to help those of the same race etc... I think we are inclined to help those whom we admire and who help us. Admiration from a evolutionary prospective has only one reasonable interpretation. Traits which one human finds positive, regardless of whether they are related to his own genome are selected for. That is why I say humans in acquiring reason have transcended the traditional perception of natural selection. We select for what we think is best, often regardless of the success of our own genes. The desire to help others who help us is nothing more than the trader principle; if someone can help you succeed there is no genealogy requirement. This by the way plays perfectly into objectivist philosophy which holds the trader principle as the basis of society and virtue as the basis of love. As an objectivist I have the peculiar luxury of finding no contradiction in human nature, evolutionary theory, and ethics. If you're here to help others; others are here to help you, make it fair, make it consensual and you have nothing to feel guilty for. Racism I believe (like all collectivism) is a transient disease which we as a race become vulnerable to when we began to think conceptually and rationally (remember logic is not the lack of inference but consistent inference). Maybe there are some instincts behind it, but I haven't encountered them so I doubt their existence. You may have grown out of that form of collectivism but the fallacious conceptions that caused it remain. You will never escape prejudice until you stop thinking of people in terms of what collective you think they belong to.","evolution-religion","12:46 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","383"

I give to charity for no personal gain, I don't crow about it, you might argue that the gain is my own sense of contribution but I feel that I do it to help others and thats it. Look at people who donate bone marrow to strangers or other body parts. IT exists.","evolution-religion","08:14 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","384"
"05-28-2013","15791",26,"Theophilus","441302","Many Christians, such as myself, will often argue that Evolution in itself is a religion. One of the definitions from Merriam-Webster of religion is, ""a cause, principle, or held to with ardor and faith."" I would argue that in order to believe the theory of evolution it takes ardor and faith. You must have faith that intelligent design did not cause the origin of life. You must also have faith that species have evolved, etc. I am interested to know what everyone else thinks.","BarryDesborough","473722","Faith is holding something to be true despite the lack of evidence for it. There is more than enough evidence for evolution such that it qualifies as a rational conclusion, rather than a faith. Anyway, why is religion a dirty word?
