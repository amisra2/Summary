However, scientific evidence requires an in depth exploration of the subject, using and collecting laboratory and field data. My guess would be that you will not be able to find any evidence to support your argument, because your argument violates many principles that make up a scientific theory, as is outlined by the scientific method. I would not be able to refute it without future research and technology, but I can make the argument that there isn't enough evidence to support such a claim, which would discredit it.","Freedom","444954","I didn't why did you? Deal with your contradiction now. You really don't know do you? If you've having an education as a 'scientist' you're proof that 'science' has lost it's way. Rofl, you have no idea what you're talking about. Arguments, theories, statements it's all the same to you. Where's your evidence that there isn't enough evidence?","evolution-religion","01:20 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","196"

Why is it that creationist arguments always boil down to only two. One is that the mythology of creationism is scientific. A really transparent attempt to raise blind faith to the level of reality. The second is that evolution is a religion. This is another transparent attempt to lower science to the level of religious superstition.","evolution-religion","01:31 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","209"
