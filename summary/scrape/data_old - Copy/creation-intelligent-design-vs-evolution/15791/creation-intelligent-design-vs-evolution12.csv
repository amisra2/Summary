Either support your claim with evidence or admit that you have no scientific argument.","evolution-religion","04:23 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","168"
"12-05-2011","15791",12,"Freedom","444357","Hardly, we simply cannot proceed on about the nature of arguments and truth when you don't understand what an argument is much less deal with your contradiction on scientific vs non-scientific. Read up, admit your mistake and we can continue.","Bennedict","444383","There has been no mistake. You willed one, yet it does not exist. How does: ""...the nature of..."" =/= ""...contained within..."" equate to a contradiction? It doesn't. You so beggingly want to invalidate my stance that you'll pull anything to make it so. I've seen you attempt this before; as soon as you begin to lose a debate, you instantly revert to stating that I've made a contradiction, and that you won't continue until I've admitted it. How childish! How stuck up! You are the one who needs to adjust your tactics, as you still haven't provided any evidence to support your argument. Once that is done, an actual debate can take place.","evolution-religion","07:16 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","170"
"12-05-2011","15791",12,"Freedom","444388","The contradiction is this: I've seen this before too: http://www.4forums.com/political/cre...tml#post415187 So you're either going to give up or try to worm out of it by saying when you said scientific argument means pertaining to things in the universe you didn't mean the 'other' meaning of scientific argument.","Bennedict","444403","Do you see the word ""not"" in that second quote? A) This is a red herring. You're bringing up a 1/2 year old post to do what? Prove that I've made a mistake in the past? B) In this situation (in the 'Benefit' thread), you have committed an equivocation. C) In the current situation, you've committed a strawman. I've been trying for the past 4 or 5 posts to show you that I've made the distinction between ""...the nature of..."" and ""...contained within..."" (or ""...pertaining to...""). You have accused me of saying ""scientific argument means pertaining to things in the universe"" which I have not said. I shall ask again: Do you have evidence to support your claim? If not, you do not have a scientific argument. Any response which is not pertinent to this is a red herring.","evolution-religion","09:46 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","172"

A chair, the bad dream you had last night, Costco, the Twilight movies, gay rights, politics, Rupert Murdoch... everything. You can argue about them, make assertions about them, and generally never have to present concrete evidence to back you up. But when the argument is ABOUT the universe--how it works, what it's made of, how it got that way, its rules, astrophysics, gravity, evolution... that's ""science."" And if you're going to argue science, you need to present more than just your personal opinion. You need FACTS, empirical evidence, which is what science is made up of. It's not a matter of ""Well, my gut instinct is that ... yada, yada, yada..."" Countless biologists the world over have accepted the basic tenets of evolution and natural selection for decades , because its hypotheses and data have been studied, tested, and peer-reviewed over and over again down through the years, not as a matter of slavish devotion to some irrational ""faith in science."" They may not have been happy with those conclusions, but they accepted them anyway because, well, facts is facts. Now, If you feel you have empirical evidence that you feel overthrows the conclusions those countless professional biologists have reached regarding natural selection in the century and a half since Darwin, you need to present it to the media as fast as you can, because--believe me--youre guaranteed to make the cover of Scientific American, and probably Time and Newsweek as well. If you don't, you should probably just admit it, becaus as it stands, you're coming across as a stubborn, arrogant little know-it-all who's unable to comprehend the rules of basic logic, much less the scientific method.","evolution-religion","12:47 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","173"

Every time I hear Freedom try to explain his position, the conclusion is based off of the fact that it makes sense logically. Indeed it does to an extent, but that isn't good enough to promote it as a scientific argument. Many arguments have tried this and have been binned because they aren't based on anything concrete; just loose ideas floating around. A serious scientist would accept this fate and either find evidence and adjust the hypothesis accordingly, or scrap it all together and start fresh, with this time basing the argument on evidence. An argument means nothing without evidence in science.","evolution-religion","12:44 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","176"
"12-06-2011","15791",12,"Freedom","444529","Now given that 'regarding the nature of', 'dealing with', and 'pertaining to' are all closely synonymous (as attested to by dictionary.com) you are in contradiction with yourself and it is not a strawman to say that B = pertaining to A is equivalent to 1. Thus you did say ~4. and not 4. meaning that you are either mistaken or lying now. Yes, as I've told you many times the need for evidence is automatically handled by premises. Are you meaning to say that what separates a scientific argument from an non-scientific argument is whether it's premises are fact(s)? Are you saying that evolution (assuming irrational) is a fact because it's defining precepts have been peer reviewed and accepted for decades? I do have such evidence and it is not in controversy. The overthrow of the conclusions has been presented albeit with some extra baggage by Behe. I understand both logic and the scientific method. Bennedict either doesn't understand logic or has made a mistake he is not willing to admit to as evidenced by recent posts. If you support his denials the same is true about you. As for the psycho-analysis I have no defense, I cannot prove to you that I am not a stubborn arrogant little know it all; I would comment that unless you are confident enough to present and defend your ideas you shouldn't be debating so if you're expecting mock humility from debaters online it's an ill placed expectation. Are you saying you found no errors in my logic and but just kept denying the conclusions because of some misguided notion that there is more to truth than logic? That's border line Aquinas thinking. I don't care whats binned or not. If you find me a sound argument you have found me a true conclusion. If anything meets that description it is irrational evolution, but since all truth conforms to logic (or vice verse if you prefer). I see. I put to you this scenario, you are in the 1870's; you attend the address ""Of Geological Dynamics"" to 'learn' that the sun has been burning for no more than 20 million years. Can you discredit this idea? Can you do it within the constraints you would so quickly place on me?","Bennedict","444551","Find that dictionary.com link for me, would you? ""...the nature of..."", from all the references I've seen ( Chapter 1: The Nature of Science which involves a Coles notes synopsis of how science works ; Nature | Define Nature at Dictionary.com from dictionary.com, ironically, stating that ""in the nature of , of the nature of essentially the same as; by way of "") define the use of this term as being synonymous to ""how things work"", or ""what things are composed of"", or ""why things are how they are""... dealing with the intricacies of ""things"", as opposed to the other two statements, which are simple mentionings and outlining premises of ""things"". A scientific argument would have you produce research, experiments, lab reports, peer reviewed articles and the like to suffice as evidence. Premises are not enough. I as well do not agree with this, it being a logical fallacy and also for being untrue. I have not seen it yet. I have seen Behe's ""evidence"", riddled with quote-mining, strawmen and various other falsehoods; not forgetting the fact that research is used out of context which is meant to support his argument, but upon a closer inspection (and even those who actually conducted the research will testify), actually refute the argument. Yep, everyone is wrong if they all disagree with you... Typical Freedom behavior. Logic is not the problem with your argument. The problem lies with the premise of your argument. I'm afraid you do, in fact have a misunderstanding of the scientific method (maybe the dozens of people who keep telling you this are correct, and aren't bone-headed XXXXXX, hmm?), as you'll find logic is not to be the basis for forming a scientific argument. That's the job of evidence. Is there more to truth than logic? In a scientific argument, yes there is. I think you can hazard a guess at what that is. If you were to propose your argument as a thesis to the scientific community, it would be binned for the reasons mentioned. This is something you should be concerned about, if you are serious about your idea. This is a case of misinterpreted evidence. Technology advances, more evidence is acquired, the theory along with the conclusion is refined. At this point, this conclusion can be discredited.","evolution-religion","11:32 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","178"

Can you, and how?","Bennedict","444598","I am not concerned with the term ""dealing"" relating to ""pertaining""; I am interested in how ""nature"" used in this context is synonymous with these two terms, as you've claimed. Find me the dictionary.com link which shows that. At base level, all things are dealt with scientifically. Politics involves the soft sciences of psychology, social sciences, etc. but a political debate does not deal with these things. Political debates are subjective confrontations. Politicians do not debate scientifically, using evidence, breaking down the nature of another politician's platform using scientific research. I wish they would conduct debates that way, but watch any political debate and you'll know this doesn't happen, yet each party retains a subjective validation for their arguments. Okay. So Easyrider walks into the offices of Nature scientific journals and proposes that creationism is true, and evolution is false. He actually has a pretty decent proposal, which makes logical sense. Would you accept this as a scientific proposal, if you worked at Nature, despite the fact that he produces no evidence whatsoever? If an argument dealing with a scientific field does not provide evidence (as is the case with yours), it shouldn't be considered a scientific argument. The evidence is okay - Behe misinterprets this evidence, takes it out of context and misuses it to support his argument. I am talking about the work of David DeRosier. Well, if you did want Christians to take you seriously for a theocratic interpretation, lets say, you would need to reference the bible to convince them! Good analogy, Freedom. You wouldn't be able to convince a priest that Jesus condoned homosexual behavior without referencing the bible, using only logic, in the same way you wouldn't be able to convince the scientific community of your argument without referencing evidence, using only logic. This is because the priest and the scientific community will want to see support for your idea. The Sun, being the source of all energy on Earth, must have existed before 20 million years ago, as fossil evidence shows that energy was being accessed far earlier than that, as can be seen with the dating of dinosaur remains, which predate the proposed 20 million year lifespan of the the Sun. Why are we talking about this?","evolution-religion","12:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","180"
