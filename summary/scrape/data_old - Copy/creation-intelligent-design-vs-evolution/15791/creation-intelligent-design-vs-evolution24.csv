It says that ""the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion."" But you omit the phrase ""in any sense."" And that phrase belies your further assertions. Indeed true. But it does not mean that the majority of Americans were, in fact, christians. History shows that they weren't. If you actually made the effort to read some books by real historians rather than religious zealots, you would be more informed. But, of course, history isn't what you want to hear. You want to hear that your faith in mythology is valid (it isn't). In fact, it does exactly that. The Senate of the United States in 1796 stated that the United States was not founded on christian principles. Read it again, follow with your finger and move your lips if it helps. But it wasn't meant as a description of America. It was meant as an assertion of the founding principles of this nation. Actually, what it means is that was not founded on christian principles. It doesn't mention the Bible. But it does state that the United States are not, in any sense, founded on the christian religion. Yet another Republican lie. The treaty presented to the Senate and the President did include Article 11. That is the language that was passed by the Senate and signed by the President. For the purposes of this discussion, all other versions and erroneous representations are irrelevant. But that's a moot point. It doesn't matter what the Arabic text says. What matters is the text that was presented to the Senate and then signed by the President. Why exactly do you think that the Muslim understanding of this treaty is more meaningful than the actual wording of the treaty that was passed without dissent by the Senate, and signed by the President? I'm not sure of the motivation of whoever wrote that Yale Law School nonsense, but the issue here is what language was passed by the Senate and signed by the President. All irrelevant because of the actual language of the treaty that was approved by the Senate and signed by the President. It's a pretty wimpy effort at deception to claim that the Arabic version of the treaty is more meaningful than that passed by the Senate and signed by the President. It doesn't matter what any other version of the treaty says in any other language. The fact is that the version that was approved by the Senate and signed by the President did, in fact, include an Article 11 that stated that ""the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion."" You can lie to yourself all you want. That doesn't make your mythology true.","evolution-religion","02:29 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","352"

Americas God and Country Whatever America has evolved into today is a separate issue from what America was in the days of the American Revolution. Where did Americas great strength lie then? And what were the moral foundations of America at its inception? The evidence is overwhelming: the founding fathers tell us that our nation was conceived on the principles of the Biblical God and Christianity. Not on Hinduism, not on Humanism, nor Buddhism, nor the writings of Confucius or Islam, or even Deism, but founded on Biblical and Christian principles. Here are just some of the facts that are seldom taught in Americas public school classrooms: The most frequently recognized source for political inspiration for the founding fathers was the Bible, which was referenced in some 34% of the founding fathers quotations. The first reference to God as the foundation of an American colony was noted in the Mayflower Compact, dated November 11, 1620: .Having undertaken for the Glory of God, and advancement of the Christian faith, and the honour of our king and country, a voyage to plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia; Do by these presents, solemnly and mutually in the presence of God and one another, covenant and combine ourselves together into a Civil Body. Many of the founding fathers recognized that the principles of civil law were inseparably linked to Biblical truths. James Wilson, one of the original Supreme Court Justices, and a signer of the Constitution, explained, Human law must rest its authority ultimately upon the authority of that law which is divineFar from being rivals or enemies, religion and law are twin sisters, friends, and mutual assistants Additionally, the United States Supreme Court specifically recognized America as a Christian nation. In the case Church of the Holy Trinity vs. the United States (Feb. 29, 1892, US457-458), Justice Josiah Brewer, following a lengthy and exhaustive search of early American historical literature, commented, We find everywhere a clear recognition of the same truth.that we are a Christian nation. In another Supreme Court Case, Zorach vs. Clauson (1952, US306 307 313), Justice William O. Douglas categorically stated, We are a religious people and our institutions presuppose a Supreme Being. Further, in United States vs. Macintosh (1931, 283 US 605, 625), Justice George Sutherland affirmed, We are a Christian people.affording to one another the equal right of religious freedom, and acknowledge with reverence the duty of obedience to the will of God. Historical revisionists contend the founding fathers were predominately deists. The facts say otherwise. According to Dr. M.E. Bradford of the University of Dallas, of the 55 framers, 28 were Episcopalians, 8 were Presbyterians, 7 were Congregationalists, and there were two each of Lutherans, Dutch Reformed, Methodists and Roman Catholics. That left, by Bradfords counting, three deists and one founder whose religious views cannot be determined definitively. At the Constitutional Convention on June 28, 1787, Benjamin Franklin noted: The longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the Sacred Writings, that except the Lord build the House, they labor in vain that build it. There are many today who believe Franklin was a strict deist, but Franklin here is not only referencing the Bible, but is alluding in part to a teaching by Jesus Christ from Matthew 10:29. Concerning the outcome of the American Revolution, John Quincy Adams noted, The highest glory won from the American Revolution was this: it connected, in one indissoluble bond, the principles of civil government with the principles of Christianity. In a letter to Thomas Jefferson dated June 28, 1813, John Adams wrote: The general principles on which the (founding) fathers achieved independence werethe general principles of Christianity. Founding father Noah Webster proclaimed much the same message when he said, The religion which has introduced civil liberty is the religion of Christ and His ApostlesThis is genuine Christianity and to this we owe our free constitutions of government. Time after time, the founding fathers declared similar beliefs. From the archives of Patrick Henrys personal notes (handwritten on the back of his copy of the Stamp Act Resolutions, made public after his death) we read: Whether this (new government) will prove a blessing or a curse will depend upon the use our people make of the blessings which a gracious God hath bestowed on us. If they are wise they will be great and happy. If they are of a contrary character, they will be miserable. Righteousness alone can exalt them as a nation. Thomas Jefferson was hardly speaking from a strict deist standpoint when he said: Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice cannot sleep forever. (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781) I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who lead our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessities and comforts of life. (Monday, March 4, 1805, in his 2nd Inaugural Address) Remember, a strict deist was one who believed God was like a watchmaker, who wound up the universe and thereafter did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. Jefferson obviously believed otherwise. Speaking of Godly principles, Jefferson stated: A more beautiful or precious morsel of ethics I have never seen; it is a document in proof that I am a real Christian, that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus. (Jan. 9, 1816 In a letter to Charles Thomson) George Washington, the Father of our Country, likewise recognized God as supremely important in the American dream. In his first inaugural address on April 30, 1789, Washington remarked: It would be improper to omit, in this first official act, my fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the universe. On Saturday, October 3, 1789, President Washington said this in proclaiming a day of national thanksgiving: It is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the Providence of Almighty God. Today, our public schools are in a moral crisis. Washington once noted, If you remove religious principles from the schools you are going to lose national morality. How prophetic he was! Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence who was also known as the Father of Public Schools, once had this to offer: The only foundation for a republic isreligion. Without it there can be no virtue, and without virtue there can be no liberty. Dont miss the significance of that last statement: ..without virtue there can be no liberty. The principle is clear a lack of virtue engenders bondage. As one writer noted, Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their fetters (bindings). The more liberties a godless people achieve, the more enslaved they ultimately become in their worldly obsessions. Still another founding father, the Reverend John Witherspoon, mirrored Benjamin Rush when he declared, Civil liberty cannot long be preserved without virtue. And finally, lets not forget James Madison, known as the Chief Architect of U.S. Constitution, who once had this to say: Cursed be all that learning that is contrary to the Cross of Christ. This is just a very short list of thousands of such examples that clearly speak of the Biblical and Christian foundations of our Founding Fathers and early America. Along with these there were the church services in government buildings up to and shortly after the civil war; paid chaplains, government authorized missionaries, reliefs of Moses and the Ten Commandments in the Supreme Court building, and so on and so forth. Whatever moral foundations apart from Christian and Biblical principles one may argue was second, was not even a close second. The record on that is clear. And so today, the debate over the moral foundations of America continues, but not in this quarter. America is in a moral and spiritual decline due to the ungodly secularization of this country. Thou shalt not has been replaced with, If it feels good do it. The wisdom of God has been replaced with the tenets of men; absolute truths replaced with moral relativism, and Father God has been replaced with Mother Earth. America is now paying the price for this ill-conceived venture. The remedy: A return to Godly values and principles, upon which this nation of the people, by the people, and for the people, was clearly founded.

""Evolution"" is simply another word for selective breeding - there is natural selection , and artificial selection . ""Selection"" is the decision of who mates with who. Nature's selection has been going on for hundreds of millions of years [Creation is continuous], flowering in Humanity, which is still on the threshold between feral animals and realized beings. People have been selectively breeding their crops and livestock since agriculture began - it's even in the Bible - at Exodus 30:37-43 Jacob ""stimulates certain sheep"" to his advantage, becoming ""very successful."" Selective breeding of chickens has created factory-farm chickens now who's breasts are bred to be so large they now they cannot walk. Inbreeding of collies has started to create a situation where their heads are so narrow that their brains are shrinking. As others have mentioned, human meddling with antibiotics have evolved incurable strains of Tuberculosis, staff infections and other sorts of superbugs that have evolved to resist our attempts to kill them. Scientists frequently do genetic experimentation by breeding hundreds of generations of fruit flies, who reproduce within hours of birth, because within a few days they are able to evolve mutations that help to resolve whatever DNA riddle they're working on. ""Inbreeding"" is the common term for another sort of human meddling in evolution, in societies that for one reason or another have lots of ""Uncle Dads"" and ""Aunt Moms,"" resulting in all sorts of birth defects, Downs Syndrome, lantern jaws and jug ears. Evolution is like gravity, we don't fully understand it, but it happens. People who try to read Genesis as a literal, documentary report on actual events miss a huge part of the story and of life. Try reading it in Hebrew, its original language, without tendentious English translation and Greek-Pagan-Christian biases, and new horizons of metaphoric possibilities will open up before you. Creation-Evolution is ""God's"" fractal mind at play - beyond the ability of any human mind to grasp, and certainly not limited to or 'incarnated in"" any particular individual, living or dead.","evolution-religion","11:11 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","358"
