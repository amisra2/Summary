Now when I say yes I mean I think it's possible, it could also have been genetic drift allowed to destroy a currently vestigial eye. @MrWriteLA the modification of the limb to be better at swimming is not the loss of a limb.","evolution-religion","09:33 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","124"
"12-01-2011","15791",9,"Freedom","443898","So since isolation allows divergence we're just cutting to the chase and defining species by isolation? That removes it even further from any underlying genetic pattern. It obviously happened but it did not evolve (the process).","Bennedict","443912","Yes. A large number of commonly understood ""species"" can potentially reproduce, but they do not. In fact, it's even speculated that humans and chimpanzees can reproduce. Our gene pools differ by enough to consider us different species, and the reason for that is because we don't reproduce with each other. It makes perfect logical sense. Tautology or not, this is a scientific claim which requires scientific evidence. If no evidence is provided, you have nothing but a laughable assertion.","evolution-religion","11:12 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","125"

They did not interbreed with the genreral gene pool for a long time. Or is it divergence itself, how much? Why does it require evidence it is the default.","evolution-religion","01:08 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","126"

They do interbreed and reproduce with other populations, which makes us the same species. Seriously not hard to understand. You can refute a claim with evidence. It's apparent that your argument is one which contrasts another. To support your argument, you need evidence, just like every other argument. The default in the scientific community is that everything in biology has be subject to evolution. If you would like to refute this, you need evidence.","evolution-religion","02:46 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","128"
"12-02-2011","15791",9,"None","None","None","Bennedict","443968","Actually, you are right to question the validity of human biological classification; it is slightly more difficult to explain and understand, because we are influenced by culture, and previously racism in choosing partners for reproduction. Also, travel made things difficult in the past, so various populations weren't given access to other populations, and some were isolated as a result. Some did, racistly classify other races as different species. However, as a whole, humans are all genetically very similar, so that will explain it. With plants and other animals, genetic differences don't fully cut it, because of the nature of genetic variability, so that's where the reproduction laws come into play.","evolution-religion","03:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","129"
"12-02-2011","15791",9,"Freedom","443974","But were they a different species before contact? Are polar bears and brown bears the same species now that we have confirmed a hybrid? Every diploid organism is genetically diverse from each other. If you're saying divergence constitutes a new species how much? Arguments need premises, and I have them.","Bennedict","443977","They were not different before contact, as I've explained, humans are the complicated example of taxonomy. You can really only compare genetics and morphological similarities in relation to other organisms when classifying humans. Polar bears and brown bears don't reproduce in the wild. I speak of interbreeding in taxonomy as meaning random, wild mating. Scientific arguments need evidence. Do you have any?","evolution-religion","04:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","131"

Because you can cross breed a great number of the members of a given genus in a laboratory. ...So you admit to not be making a scientific argument?","evolution-religion","05:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","133"

That is circular, 'it matters that it does not happen in the wild because it could happen out of the wild'. Scientific arguments are a subset of arguments, and I fail to see the significance of that qualifier.","evolution-religion","05:23 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","134"
"12-02-2011","15791",9,"Theophilus","441302","Many Christians, such as myself, will often argue that Evolution in itself is a religion. One of the definitions from Merriam-Webster of religion is, ""a cause, principle, or held to with ardor and faith."" I would argue that in order to believe the theory of evolution it takes ardor and faith. You must have faith that intelligent design did not cause the origin of life. You must also have faith that species have evolved, etc. I am interested to know what everyone else thinks.","foundit66","444013","The key word in your definition is ""faith"". In order to be classified as a religion, one must have faith. The relevant portions of the definition of faith (as in relevant to religion) are as follows a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion b (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof (2): complete trust The first part references God. Easily and logically excluded as applicable. The second part clearly demonstrates that the concept must not have proof. Also, logically excluded as evolution is about involving proof. Your usage of faith here would be improper, IMO. One could use a similar approach to declare virtually ANYTHING as a religion, by stating that a competing idea not being adhered to constitutes faith Evolution is not a religion because it requires proof and evidence to justify its existence as a scientific theory. Religion and faith are about the adherence to a belief without proof.","evolution-religion","08:21 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","135"
