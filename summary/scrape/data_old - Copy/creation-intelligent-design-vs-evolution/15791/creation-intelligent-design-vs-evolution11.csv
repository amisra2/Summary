Their intelligence has no doubt taken a unique path since divergence and is superior to most land mammals.","Accipiter","444239","So you are saying the sonic system and the intelligence of dolphins can not be explained by evolution?","evolution-religion","05:31 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","154"

Dog breeding may have produced a great deal of diversity but as of yet no one's tried to construct novel systems with it. That is conceivable for people to do because we can have a final system in mind and select for something that is not naturally beneficial merely because it moves towards the system we are trying to build. I know no example in any animal breeding of this occurring, even our genetic engineering usually just tampers with existing systems to suite our tastes or we just copy useful proteins from other organisms and paste them onto crops and such.","evolution-religion","10:50 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","157"

You do not lead this debate. Aside from that, I have not made any contradiction, as I've pointed out twice already. If you can convince me of this, then, red herring or not, I'll reconsider. I retract my statement in assuming you are intelligent enough to make the said distinction. You have made a scientific claim which requires scientific evidence to support it. You have not provided any evidence whatsoever, so your claim shall be binned until you produce some. This is how to conduct a scientific argument, and if you wish to deviate from this trend, you have no scientific argument. Instead of having me chase you around with YOUR red herrings, presumably because you've been cornered, focus on the reason why we are both here.","evolution-religion","12:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","161"
