"12-18-2011","15791",15,"Databed","445817","Is there is even a real argument here aside from the one on who said what?","Freedom","445824","This particular strain was initiated when bennedict attempted to imply that there was some special requirement about scientific knowledge/argument that I was ignorant and deficient in. He seemed to imply that normal reasoning didn't require evidence but science did (well scientific evidence ). The truth is of course that all arguments require evidence to succeed and that as I keep telling him premises are the conceptual place-mark for that evidence. All of this who said what stuff is due to the fact that when asked to define what prefixing scientific to argument, principle, and evidence was supposed to limit it to he contradicted himself. I do not care about 'punishing' him for his mistake but I certainly can't go on when this contradiction stands because any further argument would require me to actually know what he's claiming is special about scientific arguments and evidence. If he wasn't so incensed by the idea of making a mistake he would just think it out and post a more vetted definition instead of spending four pages complaining about the nature of logic (which I apparently made up).","evolution-religion","10:26 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","216"
"12-18-2011","15791",15,"None","None","None","MrWriteLA","445826","The OP is yet another sample of the equivalence fallacy, which gets trotted out by religionists in particular with boring regularity. It usually takes the form of suggesting that atheists and/or scientists are just as irrational in what they hold to be Truth as religionists are, and therefore their worldview is no more valid than religion's. On this forum you also see it used to portray gays as being ""no worse in their way"" as their homophobic oppressors, Obama as being as unconcerned with the middle class as Gingrich, etc. On science and religion-based forums, this most commonly takes the form of semantic manipulation of the word ""belief,"" or sometimes of the word ""religion"" itself. A mathematician ""believing"" that 2+2 = 4 or a physicist ""believing"" that e=MC^2 are supposedly no different from a Christian ""believing"" that the world was created by a supernatural being in 7 days. (The more complex or non-intuitive the scientific formula or procedure involved, the more likely the fallacist is to pounce on it, because HE probably can't wrap his mind around it--and as Arthur C. Clarke once said, ""any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" For many, the sufficiently advanced technologies are those used by evolutionary biologists (genetics, etc.) and geologists (carbon-dating, etc.). With atheism, the attempt is always to prove that non-belief in God is a belief in itself, therefore people who believe in not believing in God are just as irrational/fanatical/unscientiific/whatever as those who do believe in God. This redefines the word ""atheist"" to the point of meaninglessness.

He submitted his reasoning once more [#98] and I challenged him for not having evidence, and the importance of evidence in a scientific context to support an idea [#119], something he later concedes in a PM. He then uses ""Freedom logic"" (remember that term?) to justify how he can use only logical premises, almost all of which are assertions, as evidence. Nitpicking and red herring ensue to get to where we are now... I'm sick of it myself. I am waiting patiently to discuss science, but I cannot when the opponent presents only assertions.","evolution-religion","12:06 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","218"

You said statement A, then you claimed not to have said it.

"12-19-2011","15791",15,"Freedom","445859","That I later 'concede' in a PM? You mean despite the fact that probably coming up on a dozen times now I have told you premises represent evidence and you decided that the last time I told you this was a concession.... What do you think a 'logical premise' is? Show me denying that I said A.","Bennedict","445939","If a premise is true, it can be used as evidence. How does one determine a premise to be true? You said in the PM: ""With evidence. It will take quite a lot of research to get to that premise. That premise is the conclusion of the research."" I call this research ""scientific evidence"", as it exists in a scientific context. Upon being asked to provide the dictionary.com link which states ""nature"" as being synonymous to ""pertaining"", you said this: ""I never claimed that."" [#185] I then put the record straight by saying ""Just for reference - you are now stating that you've never claimed that ""...the nature of..."" and ""...pertaining to..."" are synonymous."" [#186] You have replied with ""Correct."" [#187]","evolution-religion","04:42 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","222"

I also stated the method by which research was connected to a higher premise, an argument concluding that higher premise.

Premises are not useful unless proven true, yes? A true premise can be used as evidence towards an argument. A premise is understood to be true if evidence supports it, so in a formally laid out argument, a true premise is just a statement supported by evidence. ""...'regarding the nature of', 'dealing with', and 'pertaining to' are all closely synonymous (as attested to by dictionary.com)..."" [#177] That is a denial of you saying statement A.
