However the kernel as expounded in Origin of Species is merely the description of an inevitable process whose operation cannot be denied and whose results are rather predictable. You do not need faith to 'not' believe something, you need faith to believe in something without reason. If you believe in something because of evidence or logic you do not have faith.","evolution-religion","01:11 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","2"

"10-22-2011","15791",1,"None","None","None","Bennedict","441339","Our beliefs are not based on faith, in contradiction to both descriptions of the word ""religion"" given so far. Evidence leads us to accept the scientific truths that we accept. As Freedom put it, in it's basic principles, evolution by natural selection is absolutely undeniable. It's rooted in fundamental observations that are obvious to anyone. If explained correctly, you or even Easyrider would be unable to counter claims made by evolution. Natural selection is far more basic than people make it out to be, but it's implications are more complex, and that's where people have trouble.","evolution-religion","01:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","7"

You must have faith that the evidence presented is accurate. You have to believe that the scientists are unbiased, etc.","Matthew","441368","Actually, I'd call this ""trust,"" not ""faith."" I continue to think you're using terms very incautiously. But regardless, the kicker is: you don't have to regard evidence as accurate or scientists as unbiased! What you have to do is look at the evidence that they present and the reasoning that they base upon it. If it turns out that there are problems with the evidence or their reasoning (inaccuracy and bias being two potential problems), then eventually, those problems will be found out. In such cases, previously accepted hypotheses need to be revised or even discarded. And therein lies the beauty of science: it relies on healthy skepticism and critical scrutiny directed at ideas themselves, not trust in the authority of those advancing the ideas. You say you have a degree in molecular biology, so here are a couple questions. Is the structure of DNA a matter of faith? Do we need to trust Watson and Crick, at this point? I submit that the answer to both is a resounding ""no."" Regardless of Watson's character or Crick's motives, the structure of DNA is what they said it was. We know this not because they were the ones who said it, but because what they said fits the evidence. Moreover, supposing (contrary to the above) that it were a matter of trust, then shouldn't we turn the charge right back on religion? Don't religious believers trust their clergy? Don't you have to trust that the interpretations of theologians are unbiased? Don't you have to trust that the statements of preachers are well-founded? I daresay the answer is yes. So if reliance on trust were a problem, religion would be in at least as much trouble as science. Where evolution is concerned, that deferential trust in clergy results in serious trouble, indeed. Because the criticisms of evolution that I have heard preached from church pulpits or seen written in religious publications are truly horrendous -- everything from erroneous claims about bombardier beetles to the failed tornado-in-a-junkyard analogy. And what makes these so blandly terrible is not only that they're factually and logically incorrect, but that nearly every such argument was shown to be incorrect decades ago! And yet, various anti-evolutionary clergymen still proffer their discredited criticisms time and again. Their congregants don't know evolution themselves, and they trust their clergy. It's the downside of trust: at best, those leaders are intellectually lazy about evolution; at worst... well, I'd rather not presume the worst. Where conservative Christianity is concerned, I actually think that the trust problem goes even deeper. In these traditions, God tends to come off as quite the tyrant: he does what he wants, without any need to explain himself to anyone, and we're all just supposed to obey. (In this regard, I find your tagline quite apropos.) Confused about things? Accept the confusion. Certainly, don't ask tough questions -- how dare we! That's arrogant and presumptive. God's refusal to offer any clear answers isn't arrogant, of course; he owes us nothing. If we were to ask questions, that would be arrogant. For we're just supposed to trust and obey (as the song says). Back to science for a moment. Scientists are still human, of course. But science, as an institution, rests on far more than the attributes of any individual scientists. If the evidence and logic behind evolution didn't withstand ongoing critical scrutiny, the theory would be scrapped. But in fact, there are reams of evidence supporting evolution at this point, and the reasoning is impeccable. It has withstood every criticism thrown at it, and that's why it's accepted, not because of any ""faith"" or ""trust."" No differently than the double helix.","evolution-religion","07:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","13"
