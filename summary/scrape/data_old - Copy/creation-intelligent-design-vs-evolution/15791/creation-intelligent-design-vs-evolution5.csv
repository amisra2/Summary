"11-23-2011","15791",5,"Freedom","443385","I think you're using chaos in multiple senses here. I didn't argue there is no chaos in life, but the complexity of the engineering in life, the biology that makes it works is certainly what ID people are talking about.","Ripskar","443412","ID was a con-trick, complexity was used to bamboozle the gullible. Like stuxnet, it failed.","evolution-religion","08:00 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","63"

"11-24-2011","15791",5,"Freedom","443385","No comment besides poor design does not mean no design, it excludes a perfect designer of course but not any designer.","Bennedict","443443","If evolution hadn't been thought up, you'd be right. But we have a much, much better explanation for the apparent design in nature, and that's a reason to exclude the possibility of a designer, based on poor ""design"".","evolution-religion","12:38 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","65"

"11-24-2011","15791",5,"Freedom","443462","Well the truth about the universe is that the truth doesn't depend on what we need or want. If we don't understand that we will be harmed by our own ignorance in the long run. (and yes I see the ironic twists in that response)","Accipiter","443466","In other words, you don't know. Contrasting that, evolution explains all kinds of stuff that helps us. Not only that but the benefit to us is instantaneously recognizable. Darwin knew going in that evolution would be of benefit to us and could explain many things we see in the world around us, otherwise I think he would have seen it as a waste of time and probably not pursued it.","evolution-religion","10:19 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","68"
"11-24-2011","15791",5,"None","None","None","Bennedict","443482","Evolution is not true based on how much we require it, we are able to utilize methods such as immunization, efficient food production etc. because evolution happens. That's more evidence than required to prove its existence, I think.","evolution-religion","02:45 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","69"

You've got a very bad strain of pragmatism there, people do not pursue scientific truth because the individual idea is helpful but because truth is helpful, and by the same token the non-true no matter how helpful it might be if true is always useless. (which is essentially what Benedict just said but in general form) Irrational evolution hasn't helped anyone anywhere, it's just deluded a large portion of the populace. Finally, I did not say I don't know; my position benefits us because it saves us from the harm of believing a false-hood.","evolution-religion","07:28 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","70"

My comment was not essential to any sort of conversation... I was just rambling, not at you, but general rambling. Anyway, you call it irrational evolution, I call it evolution-for-people-who-don't-quite-understand-how-evolution-works. A decent understanding of the theory will warrent a belief in it. Those who do not simply have a misunderstanding of it. That's where you and I differ. You are under the impression that evolutionists are the one's who don't understand evolution; I propose that rarely this is true. Mostly it's creationists and ID supporters who believe evolution is what you call irrational evolution.","evolution-religion","08:55 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","73"
"11-24-2011","15791",5,"Ripskar","443291","I'm a Zoologist with a bias towards ecology. I've studied the function of ecosystems in the field and what I see is equivalent to kids playing on a busy road. Failure is inevitable individuals simply survive for as long as they can before they are eaten. That's as good an example of chaos as any.","Bennedict","443492","Why would a child playing on a busy road get eaten?","evolution-religion","09:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","74"
