A premise is understood to be true if evidence supports it, so in a formally laid out argument, a true premise is just a statement supported by evidence. That is a denial of you saying statement A. What would you expect to see for this?","Freedom","446131","'A true premise supported by evidence' in the context of that support the true premise is the conclusion. You're talking about a lower level argument that's all. A statement is understood to be true if a sound or cogent argument supports it, or for all practical purposes both parties agree it's true. All statements can be used as premises. Only true premises will render the argument sound or cogent (useful). Not all statements are supported by an earlier argument, some are self-evident. Such as observations. I would expect to see me denying statement A.","evolution-religion","02:04 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","226"

"04-29-2012","15791",16,"Theophilus","441302","Many Christians, such as myself, will often argue that Evolution in itself is a religion. One of the definitions from Merriam-Webster of religion is, ""a cause, principle, or held to with ardor and faith."" I would argue that in order to believe the theory of evolution it takes ardor and faith. You must have faith that intelligent design did not cause the origin of life. You must also have faith that species have evolved, etc. I am interested to know what everyone else thinks.","charlemagne","453825","Yes; Evolution is a religion, an atheistic religion. I think it would be fair to say that people who hold to the belief of evolution affirm the non-existence of a divine being. Though it's interesting to point out, the illogical view of atheism. What the atheist is really saying is: ""there is no being with omniscience in the universe and I know it to be true by virtue of my own omniscience."" A scientific theory summarizes a hypothesis or group of hypotheses that have been supported with repeated testing. Why is evolution still just theory? Because it can only be tested at the microevolutionary scale. It isn't observable at the macroevolutionary level because it's to slow. This is where evolutionists go wrong and put down all their proofs and evidences, and take up faith (as defined as, assurance of things hoped for and conviction of things not seen). So we treat evolution as if it were a law, because we can test it at one level. Since it is true on that one level we have faith that it is true on the next level. I think it's interesting to point out that in the thousands of years of written history there is no proof of any macroevolution. Especially in today's day and age with bacteria.

It would be stupid and without thought. One does not ""believe"" in evolution any more than one ""believes"" in gravity. Both are scientific theories that explain observation. Further, the theories of evolution do not speak to the existence or non-existence of any mythological divine being. That problem arises from you inability to reconcile your mythology with reality. That is thoughtless nonsense. What an atheist is saying is that there is no evidence for any god represented in any mythology. The only difference between you and an atheist is that an atheist believes in one less god than you. (do you believe in Thor, Odin, Zeus, Mars, Apollo, Jupiter, etc.?) Not quite. A scientific theory is an hypothesis that has been supported by repeated testing. That question only reveals your ignorance of science and how it works. In science, theories do not grow up to become facts. They are not proven. In science, a theory is as good as it gets. Gravity, electro-magnitism, and plate tectonics are theories. They each explain the observations of gravity, electro-magnitism, and plate tectonics. Evolutionary theory explains the observations of evolution. False. Have you ever heard of paleontology? Then you admit that macroevolution is a fact. Why do creationists always seem to try to reduce science to the level of creationism? Creationism is blind faith in mythology. Creationists always attempt to reduce science to the logical weakness of their faith. No we don't. Again you demonstrate your ignorance of science. You don't know the difference between a scientific hypothesis, theory, or law. Again, ignorance. Scientific laws aren't laws because we can test them. The are laws because they are simple statements of observations that have never been observed to have been violated. Scientific laws are part of the evidence that makes up scientific theories. That's pure gibborish. Why don't you apply that to your faith in mythology. On what level is it true? None. More ignorance and an unwillingness to learn. The macro-evolution of bacteria has been frequently observed. There is a bacteria that lives in the waste ponds from factories that produce nylon. They can't live anywhere else. They live by metabolizing waste products from the production of nylon. Nylon was first produced in 1935 and the bacteria were first observed in 1975. Quotes from mythology don't actually provide evidence. They aren't reality. So why is it that you refuse to believe science based on observation of reality, and yet accept without question the silly mythology of bronze age, nomadic herdsmen?","evolution-religion","03:29 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","236"
