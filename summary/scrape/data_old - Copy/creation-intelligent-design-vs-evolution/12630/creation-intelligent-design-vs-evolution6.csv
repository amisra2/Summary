"05-02-2009","12630",6,"obvious_child","352247","You'd probably be the first one. This is accurate. Arch believes anyone who disagrees with his exceedingly narrow views on religion to be a Christian basher and an atheist. Which is based on his contradictions. He SAYS he doesn't believe the two are the same and then uses the terms interchangeably. If someone did not think two terms mean the same thing, why would they use the terms to mean the same thing over and over and over again? You still have not answered any form of that question. Actually there are numerous examples. It appears you are deliberately ignoring them. Especially in the other thread where I gave you a link and you simply pretend I never gave it. Sure you could. I just haven't contradicted myself. I haven't said I don't believe that and then go and show I do believe that. And you know this how?","Roesgen08","352256","Well if you want to be dishonest, you can believe that. There are several conservatives on this site who probably respect Arch's opinion, just like there are probably several liberals on this site who don't believe what you say. Too bad you misrepresented it then. I said Arch could believe you are a Christian basher, not everyone who disagrees. I completely disagree with Arch on creationism and he does not consider me a Christian basher. Actually, you're lying here. I disagree with your characterization of Arch's word choice as using the terms ""interchangeably"" and I also showed how even from your perspective you unfairly rejected other reasons for Arch's word choice. You are lying again. You provided 3 or 4 examples that I am aware of (with some repetition in them). I addressed them all. Demonstrate where I supposedly ""pretend"" I never gave you a link. You cannot show that Arch has contradicted himself. All you can do is assume the worst and unreasonably reject alternative explanations for your opinion. By reading what people post. You should try it sometime.","yec-oil-fields","11:11 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","76"

"05-02-2009","12630",6,"obvious_child","352249","I gotta admit Roesgen08, you did a good job at changing the argument away from how YEC cannot function in oil exploration. I take it you're a creationist eh? Not even symbiote who does what you do here on occasion will deliberately change the subject away permanent like you did. Regardless of what Arch believes, YEC cannot function well in oil and gas exploration.","Roesgen08","352259","Too bad you cannot admit that your comments are mostly lies. That's where you should steer your admission towards. You persist in pushing this falsehood that Arch believes YEC = Christianity. You're being dishonest again. I've stated that I'm a secular humanist. I believe in evolution and I'm not a Christian. Again you lie. You turned the discussion towards the false claim that Arch believes YEC = Christianity in post #18 on this thread. You continue to persist in this despite Arch saying that he does not believe YEC = Christianity.","yec-oil-fields","11:15 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","78"
"05-02-2009","12630",6,"obvious_child","352255","What a hoot. Apparently whatever he says after his statement doesn't count for you. Because... Reasonably conclude? or just conclude? There are anti-Christians. But attacking a view that is inherently anti-scientific while stating that christianity is not inherently the problem removes reasonable from your argument. Come again? He just said that the evidence does not support a Young Earth. Can you read? How does disagreeing with that question mean he supports a Young Earth? Oh my. No wonder you don't get this thread. How is proof of the author stating that the scientific evidence for YEC does not exist not proof of not being YEC? Again, can you read? Hi yankee fan. I thought I recognized you. I have provided several direct quotes from the source which you are again denying to exist. Do you ever tell the truth? Do you remember how many people here laughed at Arch? Ripskar made fun of Arch right off the bat Post #3 Trebor agreed with me in post #5 TQ in post #9 agreed with me Waxy in post #15 agreed with me Penfold in his general short statements laughed at Arch in post #20 TQ again backed up my assertion that Arch is doing exactly what I stated in post #31 Tester in post #39 again agreed with me T.Q in post #41 laughed at YOU Need I go on? Is 6 = 2? So much for your lie about reporting. You don't know. You just made it up and hoped I wouldn't catch you lying. Given how you lied here, I don't trust you. Cite the source. You mean you? And arch? Tell me, where is the person who agrees with my politics? Furthermore, how do you know which threads are reported? You don't. And you are lying. And it's damn obvious.","Roesgen08","352264","That's your dishonest statement on that matter. What Arch says after his statement counts, but it does not count in the jaundiced way that you view his comments, as I explained. It's your argument. You tell me ""because....."" What post # did you state that Christianity is not inherently the problem? I can, obviously you cannot read or comprehend what few words you can read. He says that the scientific evidence does not support a Young Earth AND THEN GOES ON TO SAY that that's OK because science is not 100% accurate. I guess your failure of not reading, while criticizing others of failing to read will be lost on your inferior reasoning. You just lied. I provided the quotes, not you. Obviously, you do not tell the truth, you are too busy telling lies. It's not my contention that people agree or disagree with your political position. I agree with your political position. What is in disagreement is the dishonesty in which you are pursuing a personal vendetta against Arch while you talk about your political opinion. You're the one telling lies here. Your attempt to get me to do busy work by forgetting about comments I made to you less than an hour ago will not work. Your dishonesty is your problem, not mine. No, there were two other people besides myself and Arch who commented on the dishonesty of your YEC = Christianity thread. Well let's get this straight before your ego swells further. I believe in evolution. Apparently most people on this forum do. What we disagree on is your dishonesty in arguing in favor of evolution. I never said I knew which threads are reported in general. That's a misrepresentation on your part. A poster mentioned yesterday that he was reporting your thread (I believe it was Giant Oreo) because it was a troll thread. Symbiote also opined that your thread was stupid. You are the one lying here. That's obviously your MO.","yec-oil-fields","11:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","79"
"05-02-2009","12630",6,"obvious_child","352258","Pretending? How can I quote you pretending when you don't even acknowledge it? Which proves he considers them the same thing. Can you define ""interchangeable"" for me? Who are Creationists? -David Dathe I gotta wonder if you can read.","Roesgen08","352265","So let's be clear. You say I am ""pretending"" and that you cannot prove this? It does not prove he considers them the same thing. What he is considering is more about your actions (i.e. Christian) than what you say he believes is the subject at hand (Christianity = YEC). Define interchangeable for yourself. It will improve your below average literacy. Obviously, you can't. Not only do you fail to read the passage, but you fail to read my pointing out what you missed: ""remember, in science one is never 100% certain "" He clearly has relegated science below where most evolutionists believe it should be, thus reinforcing my point that he tends towards theistic creationism.","yec-oil-fields","11:45 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","80"
"05-02-2009","12630",6,"obvious_child","352260","I'm a liberal? That's news to me. You have not said a thing about the merits of creationism or evolution. How can he consider you anything when you have not stated anything? I've misrepresented them? Sure I have. You can believe that if you're dishonest. Which you are. You have shown nothing. Your entire argument is based on your lack of reading skill in understanding the term ""NO."" Your entire argument is that the cite he linked is actually YEC despite the essay saying that the evidence does not support YEC. Again, your lack of reading skill is your downfall. ""Addressed"" Where? You mean accusing me of misrepresentation while ignoring what I actually say? Got it. lol. Apparently no one can show you anything you do not like. Despite mountains of evidence to the contrary. Interchangeable eludes you. I'm not the one who doesn't understand what ""no"" means.","Roesgen08","352266","I said you were a liberal? Also, nice dodge of how people called you on your troll thread. I've said that I completely disagree with Arch on creationism. You deny this, just like you won't accept Arch's disavowal of the strawman you've foisted on him as well. Again, you showed your dishonesty by misrepresenting that other comment of mine. I said that Arch considered you to be a Christian basher, not everyone, as you twisted my comment to mean. I have shown how you pick one possibility (that Arch is lying) out of a multitude of possibilities, without giving any reason for rejecting those other possibilities. You've shown that you will reject Arch's position, in favor of assigning him a strawman argument, even after he rejects the strawman argument. As for reading comprehension, you failed to even understand the link to the Christian geology site which I showed to you. You are the last one who can criticize anyone's reading comprehension. So basically you don't address what I say and accuse me of doing what you just did. It does appear more and more that your comments are dishonest. You showed no mountains. You showed several quotes that you interpreted in the worst possible way, without providing any reason to reject alternative ways of interpreting those quotes. You continue to make lame insults, instead of good arguments. Again, it is amazing that you cite an example of your failure to understand a reading passage as an example of me not understanding something. The stupidity in your posts is quite amazing. The author saying ""no"" to science proves that he leans towards creationism! He said science is not 100% accurate in the sentences that followed. You failed to understand the very thing that makes you think you're so clever. Totally stupid!","yec-oil-fields","11:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","81"

I know who you are and I'm not playing your game. No respectable scientist states that science is absolute. And nice fallacy of raising the bar. I said he wasn't a YEC from the get go. Now you are attacking me for a complete fabrication. And you said he leaned towards YEC. Let's recap this last point before I stop playing your revenge game Yank. You said this: ""Which is why you don't link to them here, right? I'm capable of reading, you just demonstrate a lack of intelligence by considering the worst possible assumptions about a person you don't agree with to be automatically true."" in reply to this:""And the same site had essays rejecting YEC. Are you capable of reading? Biblical verse is not the same as YEC."" Now when I prove that he was not a YEC, you attack me saying he was a theistic, which I again stated was a possibility from the beginning. I still think it's funny how you pretended to know who reported a thread. I again know who you are. And I'm not playing your game. You'll constantly change arguments, lie and ignore to get back at me for your destruction here and on Livewire. Enjoy. But we know who you actually are.","yec-oil-fields","11:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","82"
"05-03-2009","12630",6,"obvious_child","352261","Lie: anything Roesgen08 disagrees with. Sure, by that definition... never mind my numerous posts about the actual science. So does the Admin know you're using 2 accounts Yank? And I know you're Yankee Fan/Cashburnrate http://www.4forums.com/political/sea...9&pp=25&page=6 Sure you are. Let's see you actually prove it. Yankee fan tried that same argument. Let's hope you learned your lesson the last time. Says? Again, interchangeable eludes you. never mind my numerous posts on the science. Let's pretend they don't exist to suit your ill thought out claim.","Roesgen08","352268","You continue to lie. You made this thread into a YEC=Christianity thread in post #18. I've reported your calling me ""Yankee Fan"" to the admin. I already did prove it by saying that I believe in evolution....and you question my reading comprehension? You derailed your own thread in post #18 where you misrepresented Arch's position. You continue to do so and thus continue to derail this thread. Again, your saying ""interchangeable eludes you"" is your way of taunting me with your own failure. That level of stupidity you just can't buy. You strawman someone else's argument, you reject alternative explanations for what the person could actually mean besides your jaundiced view of what they mean without providing any reason for doing so, and then you act like you're smart for not using reason and believing what you wish. What a self-reinforcing cycle of stupidity is your mental thought process.","yec-oil-fields","12:03 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","83"

You sure do know how to debate. He's saying that science is not absolute in the context of saying that we might want to determine the age of the earth by what it says in the Bible. You may not be able to see what that indicates about his beliefs. I would be very surprised if others also didn't see that. Secondly, you ignored this part of his article that I pointed out for you: ""Have any of you, ever, found evidence from your geological investigations to discredit the claims in the Bible or deny Jesus? I havent."" So that sounds like he's saying that there's nothing in science to disprove what it says in Genesis that the world was created in 6 days. Again, I think most reasonable people would understand that this shows he believes in creationism. No, not just a vague Deism, but the creationism talked about in the Bible. You made a big oversight in not recognizing this and then accused me of not being able to read because of your failure to understand what was said. Just shows how bass ackwards all of your comments are. Show how he can be ""not a YEC"" while simultaneously ""possibly"" being theistic. Nice dodge.

I bet if you ask any Christian on this board who are NOT YEC'ers (Jo Bennet and Shadow Pikachu would be good starts), you would find that they would agree completely with what the author of the article says. Except his own words state this is not the case: ""Does the scientific evidence support a young earth? NO!"" You have a different definition of ""reasonable"" than I do then.
