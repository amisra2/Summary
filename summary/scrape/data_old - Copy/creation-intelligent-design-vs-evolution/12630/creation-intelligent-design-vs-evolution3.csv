You keep proclaiming that you are not equating YEC with christianity as a whole, then you go and do exactly that.","yec-oil-fields","02:32 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","31"
"05-02-2009","12630",3,"Archangel","352127","Show where I have equated YEC with christianity as a whole, in context, if you can.","tester","352130","A simple analogy that comes to mind regarding YEC and Christianity is the distinction between squares and rectangles. Rectangles are polygons with four sides with all internal angles equal to 90 degrees. Squares are rectangles with the further criterion that all sides are of equal length. Accordingly, all squares are rectangles, but all rectangles are not squares. Similarly, all YEC's are Christians, but all Christians are not YEC's. Archangel may have never said, explicitly, that YEC is equivalent to Christianity, but he has been VERY SLOPPY and essentially uses the terms interchangeably. I suspect he does this intentionally to created a straw-man argument. Would ANYONE argue that ALL Christian geologists are hindered because of their religious beliefs? The proposition is absurd! MANY highly functional and successful scientists are Christians. Would a YEC geologist be hindered? Yes! This is the point that several posters have been trying to make. I have not read ANY posts suggesting that Christians, in general, could not be effective geologists.","yec-oil-fields","08:28 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","33"
"05-02-2009","12630",3,"Archangel","352127","Are you going to insist that among all of these christian geologists, that not one of them are YECs who work in the field of oil exploration? With that said, I have at least proven that there are enough christian geologists to justify having a professional association. Neither you nor the obvious child have even tried to show that no christian geologists work in the field of oil exploration.","tester","352134","I STRONGLY doubt he would. The potential existence of some YEC's as a subset within a group of Christian geologists is not a compelling argument to counter the FACT that YEC is not an effective framework within which to search for oil. The point being made, quite effectively IMHO, by your adversaries in this thread is that a YEC would be at a disadvantage as a petroleum geologist, not that NONE exist. NOBODY has suggested otherwise! Of course there are Christian geologists... perhaps most geologists are Christians!! That has NO BEARING on whether or not belief in Young-Earth Creationism would be a hinderance for finding oil (IT WOULD!).","yec-oil-fields","08:54 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","34"

Secondly, I have neither been sloppy nor have I attempted to create a straw-man argument in any way. I have used a hypothetical and my personal beliefs in order to make as clear as possible my position on this issue. All of which you seem unwilling to, or incapable of grasping. I believe that YEC Geologists are not disadvantaged at all in doing their jobs in oil exploration based on their YEC beliefs. I can't be anymore clear than that, and still await your sides evidence that no Oil exploration company has ever hired a YEC Christian. The fact is that it is an impossible question to answer since companies can't even inquire as to ones religion during the hiring process in this country. But the obvious child has now run away since he can't back up any of his claims with actual evidence at all. Why Tester, don't you point out his straw-man which this thread is based upon? Now, I need to run to Salem to pick up my macbook from the Apple Store. See you on the flip side.","yec-oil-fields","08:59 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","35"
"05-02-2009","12630",3,"tester","352137","Because I think you misinterpreted his point. See below: Archangel: I can see why you're protesting the thread opener. I wish I had addressed this first. I interpreted Obvious Child's opener to argue that oil companies don't specifically attempt to hire YEC geologists -- not that they never hire geologists who happen to be YEC. That is, major oil companies seek oil using plate tectonics, stratigraphy and faunal succession, all of which are incompatible with YEC. That does not mean that an individual Young-Earth Creationist would be unable to perform a specific duty within that company. Certainly no oil company would inquire about a candidate's religious beliefs. A Young-Earth Creationish would, however, be at a disadvantage in terms of understanding the big picture, and the principles of Young-Earth Creationism are certainly not useful for finding oil (and therefore not desirable to oil companies). Perhaps Obvious Child will clarify?","Archangel","352140","I'm typing this from the Apple store on my newly refurbished macbook in order to give the new keyboard a test run. In response to your defense of the obvious child, you give him too much credit for actually thinking through his reasons for posting this thread. And the chances are good that he wont clarify his OP because he knows his original intent was based on a straw-man argument which can't be proven. But I have proven that since an association of christian geologists exists that there are many geologists who are committed christians. And your opinion that YEC Geologists would be at some disadvantage is also just that; your opinion. Nobody has posted one iota of evidence verifying that claim at all. And in spite of your attempt to clarify what child intended to say, his opening post is clear and direct in claiming that ""according to the Last I checked, no credible fossil fuel firm hired YEC geologists. That means he actually checked. Why wont he post that evidence for us all to see? It's because he lied and never checked anything at all and the premise of this thread is based on his own anti-YEC/christian bigotry.","yec-oil-fields","10:13 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","37"

No, it's not. A YEC view is completely incompatible with geology. And there it is again (twice in this post). Why do you keep equating christianity with YEC? No one is denying that christians can do geology or any other science. YEC's on the other hand, would be incapable.","yec-oil-fields","11:10 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","38"

Apparently we have something in common Well, I'm sincere in how I interpreted what he wrote, and I honestly believe that is what he meant. Again, I don't think ANYONE has intended to claim otherwise. I think you erroneously interpreted the original post. I'm baffled you're claiming victory for ""proving"" that some, perhaps many, geologists are Christians. It is simply a matter of fact that was never under debate. Unless someone speaks up to explicitly affirm support of the idiotic counter position (i.e, that there are no Christian or even YEC geologists), you're clearly fighting a man of straw. Yes, they have. Seriously. Are you serious? This is a VERY COMMON figure of speech.","yec-oil-fields","11:21 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","39"

That dishonest charge has already been debunked. Why don't you debate the issue of YEC (in)compatibility with geology instead?","yec-oil-fields","01:44 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","40"
"05-02-2009","12630",3,"Roesgen08","352108","ObviousChild: Again, further proof that you dishonestly tie YEC to mean Christanity. Archangel: ""An acceptance of YEC IS NOT A SALVATION ISSUE WHICH DETERMINES IF ONE ACTUALLY KNOWS THE LORD JESUS CHRIST ON A PERSONAL BASIS IN ANY WAY. SO I HAVE NEVER SAID EVEN ONCE ON THIS OR ANY FORUM, NOR HAVE I SAID TO ANY PERSON EVER THAT UNLESS YOU ACCEPT YEC, THEN YOU CAN'T BE SAVED."" Source","obvious_child","352183","Poor argument. First of all, no one knows who is saved as salvation is clearly defined as a Grace issue. Second, in this very thread Arch has deliberately tied the two as one. There are at least three posts here where he has just done that. You'll notice right off the bat, despite a distinct clarification of YEC, and NOT Christanity as a whole, that Arch deliberately takes the discussion on YEC as a discussion on Christanity. Notice that the only person who argued the thread from a Christanity as a whole view was Arch. The rest of us deliberately stated otherwise. Arch is either lying in his tying or lying in his attempted rebuttal. Given his years of tying, I'd guess he's lying in his attempt to make it seem like he's not. Which is more valid, one post saying he doesn't, or a 1,000 where he does tie the two to mean one?","yec-oil-fields","04:10 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","42"
"05-02-2009","12630",3,"Archangel","352140","Nobody has posted one iota of evidence verifying that claim at all","obvious_child","352186","Then explain how a YEC 'geologist' can use evolutionary principles to hunt for oil and gas when their belief system suggests something completely different. Explain to me how a YEC 'geologist' won't have a problem when their belief system is completely contradicted by actual geology? I've cited several pieces of evidence that prove you wrong. You just wish to ignore them as you do everything that contridicts your belief. After all, you said Radioactive dating was wrong on the basis of its principles yet called for more nuclear power despite both sharing the same principles, the very same principles you decried as false. You threw a tantrum instead of addressing that point.","yec-oil-fields","04:14 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","43"

"05-02-2009","12630",3,"tester","352137","Perhaps Obvious Child will clarify?","obvious_child","352190","This is a pretty simple thread. YEC runs contrary to modern geology. Therefore any reputable oil and gas company will not hire geologists who think YEC is correct and that modern geology is wrong (as inline with YEC beliefs) nor will they use YEC in exploration. I've explained several times why this is true. Arch has deliberately ignored several posts detailing why. Furthermore, he has posted an article about a company using the Bible to find oil only to ignore how that company is using exploration methods in ways that completely contradict what YEC say. This discussion is purely based around YEC view. Not the bible, not Christanity. And Arch knows that he cannot defend his belief system on the basis of scientific merit, therefore he's playing the victim card, he's being 'bullied.'","yec-oil-fields","04:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","45"
