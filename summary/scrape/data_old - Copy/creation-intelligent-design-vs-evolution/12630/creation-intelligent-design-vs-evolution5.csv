"05-02-2009","12630",5,"obvious_child","352183","Poor argument. First of all, no one knows who is saved as salvation is clearly defined as a Grace issue. Second, in this very thread Arch has deliberately tied the two as one. There are at least three posts here where he has just done that. You'll notice right off the bat, despite a distinct clarification of YEC, and NOT Christanity as a whole, that Arch deliberately takes the discussion on YEC as a discussion on Christanity. Notice that the only person who argued the thread from a Christanity as a whole view was Arch. The rest of us deliberately stated otherwise. Arch is either lying in his tying or lying in his attempted rebuttal. Given his years of tying, I'd guess he's lying in his attempt to make it seem like he's not. Which is more valid, one post saying he doesn't, or a 1,000 where he does tie the two to mean one?","Roesgen08","352233","The poor argument is yours. For the purposes of debating this point, it is irrelevant who is actually saved or not. What is relevant is if Archangel believes that you have to believe in creationism to be a Christian, which the post above shows she does not. It's amazing that in supposedly ""1,000"" posts where he supposedly equated YEC and Christianity that you still failed to provide one example of him doing that.","yec-oil-fields","09:09 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","61"

"05-02-2009","12630",5,"obvious_child","352187","How you figure that? The OP and everyone else is discussing YEC. Waxy specifically was discussing YEC. No one was talking about Christanity as a whole. Then Arch comes and notice it is HIM who takes the whole discussion as an attack on Christanity rather than YEC. It was HIS post that specifically said Christanity rather than YEC like the rest of us. Notice the first use of the word ""Christian"" It is in post #8. Arch's post. This is the exact quote: ""But hey it's child and he needs to post any fallacious attack on christians he can dream up."" Never mind how everything up to that point was specifically about YEC. Outside of quotations of Arch's post, the next time we see the equating is in post #17: ""One is an atheist and the other is a christian/creationist."" Again, another Arch post. The even more obvious thing is that arch tries to make this into an atheist vs Christian argument rather than science vs YEC. The sheer amount of tying is insane. Post #27 has Arch linking to a Christian geologist website despite no one except him talking about the religion as a whole. Remember that the title of the thread is ""YEC in oil fields"" NOT ""Christanity in oil fields."" need I go on or will you accept that Arch argues YEC = Christanity? He's not equating the two by using the terms interchangeably? So a part that is interchangeable with another in similar machine is not the same part? So a standard spark plug used in every Toyota car is not the same since they are interchangeable? That doesn't make much sense. If any. Where did you go to school? And was your English teacher fired after you left? Actually, if you bothered to read the thread, everyone except Arch is talking about YEC and geology. Arch has attempted to turn this into Christanity vs detractors despite no one attacking Christanity.","Roesgen08","352238","Already explained that to you yesterday. Again, from Archangel: ""An acceptance of YEC IS NOT A SALVATION ISSUE WHICH DETERMINES IF ONE ACTUALLY KNOWS THE LORD JESUS CHRIST ON A PERSONAL BASIS IN ANY WAY. SO I HAVE NEVER SAID EVEN ONCE ON THIS OR ANY FORUM, NOR HAVE I SAID TO ANY PERSON EVER THAT UNLESS YOU ACCEPT YEC, THEN YOU CAN'T BE SAVED."" Source It could be possible that Archangel thinks that you really are anti-Christian. One could express being anti-Christian by attacking the most salient part of the group of Christians (i.e. the Creationists). One doesn't have to equate Christianity with YEC to perceive an attack on YEC to be the primary means of waging a broader offensive on Christianity as a whole. I think that this quote works against you a bit. If Archangel really did believe what you say, that Christianity and YEC are the same thing, then why mention both? Wouldn't that be like saying a US American? If Christianity and YEC are the same, maybe he would just use one term instead of both. Well, let's pull out an essay from the website that was referenced and pull out a passage: Age of the earth. Agreement: Young-earthers, by definition, and scientific creationists both agree that the earth is about 10,000 to perhaps 20,000 years old. Conflict: Most conventional geologists would accept the 4.5 billion year old age given by several independent lines of evidence. Comment: Unfortunately, here is where many scientific creationists err. The Bible clearly states the age of the earth in the beginning (Genesis1:1). Why is a young earth necessary? From my own correspondence, scientific creationists and young-earthers ""want"" a young earth so that evolution will not have time to operate. Does the scientific evidence support a young earth? NO! (But remember, in science one is never 100% certain. There is always the possibility of error.) But is this a problem? Have any of you, ever, found evidence from your geological investigations to discredit the claims in the Bible or deny Jesus? I havent. I fully believe that God has given us talents to use to investigate his creation. Should we fear the results? I have struggled many, many years with the creation/evolution debate. The questions raised above represent only a small number of the ideas, thoughts, and queries I have had. While writing this I happened across a Bible verse that put the debate in perspective: For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered or come into mind. (Isaiah 65:17) Until this time, I welcome your comments and thoughts. While the author is not saying he is 100% sure that creationism is true, it's clear that he clearly leans towards creationism. Therefore, Archangel's listing of the website as a site of people who believe in YEC is fair enough, given that part of the selected reading is very favorable to creationism. What you really need to prove your argument about Arch is a slam dunk. Something along the lines of this: People who do not believe in creationists are not real Christians. That's would be a slam dunk for you, if you could ever show that Arch said anything like that. Already addressed this in response to your quote on post #8. A better school than yours. You obviously took the little bus to school. I bothered to read the thread, you bothered to see only what you wanted to see. Although the evidence does not prove such a conclusion, I could accept Arch being wrong. The dishonesty you show means that you cannot accept the possibility that you are wrong.","yec-oil-fields","09:42 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","63"

You said this in post 46: ""Especially since everyone except Arch is talking about YEC and not Christanity."" If one were to apply your method of inference, not using context and assuming that things that you want to hear that CAN be true, MUST be true, we can arrive at the following conclusion on your comments: We are talking about YEC and not Christianity. YEC is not Christianity. Creationists are not Christians. I'm just saying that using your method on your own words can have some interesting results.....","yec-oil-fields","09:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","64"
"05-02-2009","12630",5,"obvious_child","352230","That doesn't mean squat. Merely because he said that there after he took flat for tying doesn't mean he actually means that. You yourself have failed to even address the actual evidence of his tying arrangement. And if you bothered to read the thread, you would have noticed I stated that YEC is one of many beliefs within Christanity and often not held by many Christians. How can I imply that Creationists are not Christians (well, some aren't, namely the Muslims and Jews) when I stated that early on in the thread? Seriously? Before we took you serious, now it looks like you're just supersport back with a new account.","Roesgen08","352242","Personally, I don't believe Archangel lied. That being said, it's possible that he lied. It's possible that you lied. It's possible that everyone on this thread is lying. The error of your reasoning is that you assume what COULD BE with what is LIKELY. From the point of view of someone who doesn't like Arch, it's still reasonable to believe that Arch: * Actually believes you are a Christian basher OR * Has used some hyperbole in denigrating your position Those are reasonable assumptions based upon someone who does not like Arch. You reject them out of hand (which seems unreasonable) and immediately proceed to the worst scenario: * Arch is lying about what he believes. I'll admit that I didn't see it until about half an hour ago. Those posts are at the bottom of the thread and people posted after it, pushing the thread into a new page. You don't have to believe that and you are free to use that as fodder for insults against me. I will be sure to return the favor. I could accuse you of lying.....the same way you do to Arch. You speak on behalf of the forum? I don't think so. Your last thread entitled ""YEC = Christianity"" was reported for trolling by someone who shares your politics, and it wasn't me. Someone else replied who gives a s*** about this? It seems that many people are on to your hatred for Arch and that you don't speak for them. As for supersport, that is not me. Perhaps, you are the old poster supermoron, who has come back with a new account.","yec-oil-fields","10:10 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","65"
"05-02-2009","12630",5,"obvious_child","352235","How about you be honest for a change? Furthermore, you pretend you never made arguments after I refuse your garbage. Frankly, you're just as bad as him. Although, I like how you pretend that arch's one post saying he doesn't believe that YEC = Christianity suddenly trumps several posts where he uses YEC and Christanity interchangeably. Not to mention citing Christanity instead of YEC in replies to criticism of just YEC.","Roesgen08","352243","How about you take your own advice? I pretended nothing. Quote my so-called pretending. Frankly, you're just as bad as the Westboro Baptist bigots. He doesn't use YEC and Christianity interchangeably. He uses your attacks on YEC interchangeably with attack on Christianity. A reasonable person would suspect that's got less to do with Arch's view on Christianity, and more to do with Arch's views on you. I shot this claim down by actually going to the website you mention and pulling out that the site did not just mention Christianity, but indicated that it valued Biblical verse over scientific fact.","yec-oil-fields","10:16 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","66"

I take it you're a creationist eh? Not even symbiote who does what you do here on occasion will deliberately change the subject away permanent like you did. Regardless of what Arch believes, YEC cannot function well in oil and gas exploration.","yec-oil-fields","10:33 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","70"
"05-02-2009","12630",5,"obvious_child","352225","How many times in this thread have you deliberately ignored the discussion of why YEC doesn't make sense? Explain to me why oil companies look for ocean based oil and gas when the flood argues that no deposits should be found there. Explain to me why oil companies look in areas where diatoms lived in great numbers? Explain to me why oil companies specifically look for oil and gas in geological areas which are conducive to oil formation and NOT uniformly across land as the Flood would produce? Yell at us all you want, you cannot for your life, argue on a reality based, evidence based, fact based basis why you are right.","Archangel","352250","How many times in this thread have you documented any of your claims with absolute irrefutable evidence? NOT ONE TIME. You expect me to accept and respond to your bogus claims as if they are facts. But your opinion means nothing to me since I know it is unprovable and based in your fairy tale world view regarding the so called evolution of life on Earth. Have you supplied even one iota of documented evidence which either proves this claim or that creationists reject it? NO! yet you want me to argue it as if it's a fact. You mean for bio-diesel research? What does that have to do with fossil fuels? Changing the subject once again, and expanding the issue without proving anything up front once again? When will you get it that you don't define the debate without supporting any of your allegations with evidence which works within my belief system. Prove this allegation that these locations oppose what creationism says is possible from our perspective. You speak boldly and bluster just like daewoo, yet you prove nothing and produce no evidence at all SHOWING THAT WHAT YOU'RE ASKING OPPOSES THE CREATIONIST BELIEFS. I am arguing from reality according to my belief system which rejects your evolutionist belief system as rational or absolutely provable. The problem is that you are so incredibly arrogant that you can't imagine anyone not accepting what you believe as obvious. But it isn't obvious at all. What you believe requires more faith in Mans science than my faith requires to believe in God. But you are completely blind to that reality which is why you flail around insisting that it's me who doesn't get it when all I'm doing here is telling you straight out that YEC Geologists don't have to accept evolution in order to accept the science of geology. So go ahead and prove the premise of the OP, and prove all of the other claims you have made but supported none of with any absolute evidence at all. Then we'll have something to discuss, maybe. But don't expect me to jump through your fallacious hoops and respond to your drivel as if it is factual at all because I reject it for what it is. Fairy tales which only an obvious child and his arrogant pseudo intellectual humanists will buy into.","yec-oil-fields","10:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","71"
"05-02-2009","12630",5,"obvious_child","352244","So? That means nothing compared to what he did. Or more accurately, Arch thinks that anyone who disagrees with him is anti-Christian and an atheist. Including other Christians. Seriously? If I was anti-Christian, I'd be making the bull**** threads like those in the gay and religion forum. Don't know. But he doesn't do it for the rest. The rest he removes creationist or YEC and instead replaces it solely with Christianity. What form of Creationism? He clearly rejects YEC. But that does not mean he rejects a Deist view of origin. But that is not what we are talking about. Except that it's not YEC and we have long been discussing just YEC. Grasping for straws you are. You are dishonestly arguing that all forms of Creationism are the same where this discussion was always focused on JUST YEC. Maybe to you. The rest of us all accept that Arch believes YEC = Christanity. Cite. hardly. You think that interchangeable use of words means that the person using the words interchangeably doesn't think they mean the same thing. Therefore parts made for multiple cars to be used interchangeably are not the same part. Then why are the only one who thinks that way?","Roesgen08","352252","He ""did"" nothing. It's not a question of what he ""did""; it's a question of your interpretation of what he did and the possibilities that you rule out without even considering them. Oh, more accurately? Then it should be very easy to prove that Arch doesn't simultaneously think: YEC is not equal to Christianity AND You are anti-Christian I don't know if you are or you aren't, but given that you've just implied that there are anti-Christians, is it not reasonable to conclude that someone could believe you to be an anti-Christian rightly or wrongly? Which again can be explained by him possibly perceiving you as a Christian basher. He says: ""Have any of you, ever, found evidence from your geological investigations to discredit the claims in the Bible or deny Jesus? I havent."" Before this he says: ""Does the scientific evidence support a young earth? NO!"" The Bible (read literally) supports a young earth. He says there is no scientific evidence to discredit this. So he's not just a deist, but more of the God made the universe like it says in the Bible kind of creationist. What's dishonest is your claiming that the source is not YEC without providing proof, as well as your dishonesty in not recognizing that the author's very low relative value on science makes him closer to YEC than deism. Lastly, it's dishonest of you to say that I am grasping at straws, when it's your straws. You're the one who chose to pick Arch's source as evidence of her supposed YEC = Christianity views. You provide no quotes from the source, but instead find yourself on the defensive and that's me ""grasping at straws""? Clearly delusional on your part. Again, given that two people who believe in evolution have commented on the dishonesty of your YEC = Christianity thread, and the thread was shat upon by a third person as well, your claim to be a spokesman of some sort is compromised. If you cannot remember comments I made in posts that are less than an hour old, then that is your problem. Find it yourself. Believe that you have some intelligence if you wish, I know better than to try to get you to see reason. Again, you fail on two fronts here: you fail to distinguish between your subjective OPINION that someone uses a word interchangeably and the objective facts of how someone used the word. Secondly, your opinion is compromised by the fact that you have not provided any reason to reject alternative hypotheses to your opinion. Again, your YEC=Christianity thread was reported yesterday by another evolutionist besides myself and further condemned by a third poster. Do you deny that?","yec-oil-fields","10:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","72"

If a ""high sedimentation rate"" will preserve organic material, a catastrophic sedimentation rate, such as we envision for the worldwide Flood, would uproot, kill, and bury organic material so rapidly as to cut the porphyrins off from oxidizing agents which would destroy them in the ocean water. Under this model, flood geologists would predict that porphyrins should be commonly found in sedimentary rocks I am arguing from reality according to my belief system which rejects your evolutionist belief system as rational or absolutely provable.

By your logic, there is no such thing as absolute irrefutable evidence as you reject everything you do not like. http://www.4forums.com/political/352231-post60.html Fail. No. Diatoms were algae, which was compressed into hydrocarbons. Get it? Simply put, is oil found everywhere? No. It's not. But the Flood argues it is. The Chemistry of Oil - Explained by Flood Geology Sedimentary Rock: Face of the Earth They argue that the compression of the water and sediment made the oil. They also argue that oil and gas are found largely in sedimentary rock. The thing is that such rock covers roughly 75% of the land and most of the ocean floor. Therefore, we should be finding oil pretty much everywhere according to flood geology models. Interestingly enough, Flood geology rejects plate tetonics as well as rejecting oil formation in ocean water. It's internally a bunch of contradictions. Oil can't form in ocean water, but the sea floor made of rocks where oil is expected to be is has oil. Wait what? I can go on and on. But you get the point. The flood model is inherently contradictory and wrong. See above. More veiled threats. Enjoying the taste of fail?","yec-oil-fields","10:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","73"
"05-02-2009","12630",5,"obvious_child","352246","Then why are you ignoring my statement regarding how YEC is not limited to Christanity? Thanks for proving my point . He considers an attack on YEC as an attack on Christanity, as the two are one and the same. We have made it perfectly clear this is a discussion just on YEC and that Christanity has no problems with actual science, just YEC. Yet why does Arch keep using YEC as a substitute despite our many statements saying the two are not the same? And the same site had essays rejecting YEC. Are you capable of reading? Biblical verse is not the same as YEC.","Roesgen08","352254","No, not why am I supposedly ignoring this or that. I asked you to quote me supposedly pretending. Nope, you've only proved my point, that you see what you want to see, instead of what's there. He possibly considers an attack BY YOU on YEC as an attack on Christianity. Again, I already explained to you why he might think that. Which is why you don't link to them here, right?
