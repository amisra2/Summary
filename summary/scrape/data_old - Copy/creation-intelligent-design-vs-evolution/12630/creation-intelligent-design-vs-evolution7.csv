Indeed, obviously you care nothing about the truth, since your complaint with me rests on nothing more than semantics.","GiantOreo","352282","It may or may not be accurate to call it a troll thread. That is not the point here, nor is it the topic. The point is your mischaracterization of my post. I never called it a troll thread like you claimed I did.

"05-03-2009","12630",7,"Roesgen08","352281","You are the one who does not tell the truth. You characterized the thread as mainly a lover's feud between Arch and OC and that's why you reported it. Given that OC started the thread for that reason, that makes calling it a ""troll thread"" a fair description. Symbiote said something to the effect of what is the point of this thread? If you want to continue your dishonesty and deny that, then that's your problem.","GiantOreo","352284","That is correct - a majority of the posts there were spam between Archie and OC - the Admin removed those posts. It was not the whole thread, nor the thread itself - just a number of subsequent posts IN the thread. I'm sorry it seems you don't like it when your own rules are applied to yourself - that's just tough, isn't it? It may or may not be a fair description. That is not what is being talked about here. What is being talked about here is YOUR false claim that that is the description I gave of it in my post, when I gave no such description. I did not deny nor accept that Symbiote posted that. I said I could not recall if Symbiote had posted, but said he very well could have. Please do not misrepresent my post by claiming that I denied it when I did no such thing. Especially since you have been complaining about O_C misrepresenting you and Archie in posts. It isn't that fun when you get a taste of your own poison, is it?","yec-oil-fields","01:26 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","92"
"05-03-2009","12630",7,"T.Q","352274","You've spoken to him? You know precisely what he was stating? Or are you interpreting it? Because I interpreted it the exact same way as O_C did. You're interpretation requires you to ignore the fact that he stated the evidence contradicts a young earth. I'd be very surprised if anyone else interpreted it the way you did. I bet if you ask any Christian on this board who are NOT YEC'ers (Jo Bennet and Shadow Pikachu would be good starts), you would find that they would agree completely with what the author of the article says. Except his own words state this is not the case: ""Does the scientific evidence support a young earth? NO!"" You have a different definition of ""reasonable"" than I do then. Wait, so now your position is that someone must believe in creation ex nihilo in order to be theistic? You're really not helping yourself or Archie out much at this point...","Roesgen08","352285","Yeah, I've spoken to him. He's my next door neighbor. You again fail to read several sentences after he said that the evidence contradicts the young earth. After that he then discredited science by saying it is never 100% certain. Thus, he has a much lower value for science than do most people who believe in evolution. I think that you and OC have not only misread, but you also ignored how he played down the accuracy of science after the comment. You are free to try out your idea. The Bible says the world was created in 6 days and so was man. That means that the world was created basically at the same time as the advent of man. That means that dinosaurs roamed the earth at the same time as man. Thus the dinosaur fossil record (geology) directly contradicts Genesis. Feel free to ask them if they see that contradiction. You ignore what comes after that quote: ""(But remember, in science one is never 100% certain. There is always the possibility of error.)"" I agree. Asking someone to explain themself is not taking a position. Oh I've helped Archie out and set the record straight, showing that OC has no reason to call him a liar, although OC did that mostly by himself. As for you, you've failed to accurately comprehend Dathe's article, just like OC. You didn't help OC out.","yec-oil-fields","01:28 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","93"

"05-03-2009","12630",7,"T.Q","352293","No, he didn't. He stated what everyone but you and Archie apparently know-science is never certain, and most certainly never proven. I'm going to let you in on a little secret: No one but people who are ignorant of science believe that science is 100% accurate. I told Archie as much this afternoon in this very thread. If you want proof, study mathematics. If you want the best explanation that currently fits the facts as they are known and that is provisionally true beyond a reasonable doubt, then you have a scientific theory. OK, so according to you, a christian is a creationist, and believes that dinosaurs and man co-habitated the planet together, and you believe a statement by a christian scientist who says that science is not 100% accurate backs you up on this? So, we're just going to ignore the fact that the majority of christians around the world are not creationists? How does this address my question? It doesn't. No, I'm pretty sure I've comprehended it quite well. You, on the other hand... Yeesh.","Roesgen08","352297","If your statement were true then you would believe that science is 100% accurate. Again, the context is the key, he's saying that science is not 100% with the alternative being that you have to believe that the universe was made in 6 days. If you could read, you would see that. Also, given his comment about how he has seen no evidence to dispute that the world was made in 6 days, that's also a fairly creationist point of view. Show where I said that a christian must be a creationist. Show where I said that science not being 100% accurate establishes a theist creationist doctrine. It addresses your question.

You described the thread as being ""filled with spam"" relating to an ""ongoing feud"" between the thread starter and the person whose comments were the target of the opening post. That's a troll thread. The fact that you did not use the actual word ""troll"" is irrelevant. Terms can have a synonymous meaning without being the exact same word. The only way you can prove that I misrepresented your thread is if you can show that I said Giant Oreo verbatim called it a ""troll thread."" Can you show this? Again, notice the word ""if."" I said ""if"" you want to do that. If means that you may decide to do something or not. Given that you may decide to continue to be dishonest or not is a true statement, the comment I made is true.

You can dishonestly say that I did what OC did, but that's just a lie. He misrepresented Arch's comment, I accurately represented your comment about the admin edited thread being a troll thread.

And again, no. Seeing as how you were just telling me that I said the exact opposite of what I explicitly, in no uncertain terms actually stated, I think your idea of who can and can't comprehend simple statements is suspect. No. He states there is no evidence of a young earth. He then states that he has seen no evidence to make him question the bible or Jesus' existence . That is not the same as stating that 6 day creation is a fact . No where does he even mention 6 day creation. The closest he comes to it is to state that a young earth is flatly contradicted by the evidence! You are doing the exact same thing that you are arguing Archie was not doing-conflating creationism with christian beliefs. There are numerous ways to reconcile a non-literal reading of the bible and the christian faith with science. Since he explicitly states that there is no evidence for a young earth, the fact that you keep insisting that he is a creationist is dishonest! It's your argument that a literal 6 day creation reading of the bible is the only logical explanation. You are the one who seems incapable of understanding that there are other (more likely and less schizophrenic) options that the author is describing. I already provided the quote which leads me to believe this is your argument. I won't repeat it again. Great.
