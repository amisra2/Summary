Have you ever seen an employment application or a work resume which stipulates ones beliefs as a creationist or an evolutionist? Since they can't even legally ask about a persons religion, how would they determine the answer to this question? But more importantly, are you actually suggesting that YEC Geologists deny that fossil fuels exist underground and therefore would be useless in such a position? Let me simplify this for you, does ones personal beliefs about how oil got there effect ones ability to locate it according to the known applications of the science of Geology? Of course not, but you will never cease to ask the dumbest questions if you think it will insult creationists.","yec-oil-fields","06:21 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","2"

His religious beliefs are still on the unusual side, but he managed to keep faith, while other YEC that followed the same path he did lost their faith.","yec-oil-fields","12:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","5"

From a geologists perspective who is looking for oil deposits, the back story of how it got their is irrelevant as long as he understands the physical signs which have proven reliable in locating those deposits.

Compressed Diatoms are found in certain areas under certain types of geological conditions. This is inherently contradictory to YEC which believes that the flood created the hydrocarbon reserves. The problem with such reasoning is that a flood would do this evenly and uniformly since it is the weight of the water that is doing the compression. A YEC model would expect oil and gas to be found everywhere as that is how they are formed under the global flood model. Hence why it is relevant. You are just too stupid to understand how your belief cannot be molded with reality. See above. And I did answer, therefore you are wrong.","yec-oil-fields","07:32 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","10"

But again, that requires a YEC to contradict their belief in the flood. As earlier stated, previous YECs have gone into the field, looked at the data and evidence and abandoned YEC as it makes absolutely no sense. YEC 'science' is not used in hydrocarbon production. Total and utter bull. If that was true, why does Chevron's oil exploring ship specifically hunt for areas believed to have large diatom populations in the past? While they are looking for specific physical signs, they also start to look in specific areas based on the back story. Your argument essentially says that they randomly look for physical signs rather than start with areas believed to have high concentrations of organisms that turned into oil. I didn't think you thought Exxon and Chevron were run by ######. See above.","yec-oil-fields","07:36 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","11"

I'm sure there are a few geologists (and most engineers lol) working out there for whom this would pretty much be the extent of their knowledge and skills. So to some extent, Archie is correct. After a couple of hours of basic instruction most grade schoolers could look at a well log and decide if there's oil/gas there, or look at a seismic line and choose a drilling location, it's not that hard. However, if that's all that you understand, or if you're trying to apply some YEC depositional theory completely incompatible with reality, your chances of being a successful exploration and development geologist are somewhere in the very low single digit percentages. Understanding depositional models, paleoenvironments, regional basinal depositional histories, oil source rocks, oil generation and migration, trapping mechanisms, diagenesis, timing of deposition and deformation, and on and on are critical to being a successful geologist, and would be VERY difficult to reconcile with hard line YEC beliefs.
