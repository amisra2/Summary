"05-07-2008","10438",4,"dace","310325","That a given gene is needed to induce a given trait in an organism does not mean that this gene (along with the protein it generates) is sufficient to produce the trait. I need a computer to view 4Forums. Does this mean 4Forums is contained within my computer? Of course not. My example is simplified for the sake of brevity. Of course, the nuts are also evolving, and the macaw has other food sources. The question is how this evolutionary arms race proceeds. How many millions of such coding mistakes had to come and go before the right one announced itself, and at last the bird got its meal? So stupendously unlikely is the perfect mutation at the perfect time that calculating the odds against it taking place even once exceeds our imaginative capacity. It is, in fact, a miracle. The macaw wants to eat. To do so, it must crack a very hard nut. It thus develops its jaw muscles in order to achieve its goal. Does natural selection operate in tandem with random mutation or adaptive mutation? Does the adaptation need to be expressed at the genetic level, or can somatic changes, through a process of morphogenetic memory, directly influence the forms and instincts of descendants? The instruction manual for the child seat works precisely because there is an intelligent agent, i.e. you, that interprets it. So this analogy is not helpful to the point you're trying to make. What really counts is the way genes are used rather than their content. So now we need an instructional manual on how to properly implement the blueprint. If the manual is embedded within the DNA itself, how is the DNA able to read it? Presumably the instructions for reading the manual would also be contained within the manual. Perhaps there's another manual that explains how to read the first manual, and then yet another manual to explain how to read that one, and so on, ad infinitum. Let's take the example of a tornado. One moment there's no tornado, just a massive gradient between warm air on the ground and cool air in the sky. The next thing you know , a tornado has emerged fully formed, seemingly out of nowhere, and begins efficiently wiping out the temperature gradient. It's not as if the tornado emerged from the dust particles of which it is composed or a smaller proto-tornado. Why should the second batch do any better? Unless there's a survival issue involved, the second batch should take exactly as long as the first. The most recent test I'm aware of that confirms morphic resonance was carried out by Rupert Sheldrake and Steven Rose on chicks who received food after pecking at LEDs of a particular color. Only those who pecked at the ""correct"" color (yellow) were rewarded. Each batch of chicks, unrelated to the previous batch, learned to peck at the yellow diodes more quickly. What resonates is the whole form, not the material constituents. In contrast to artificial memory, which reduces to stored material configurations, natural memory is holistic, operating on the basis of morphological similarity. I tune into my ancestors because we have a similar overall form, not because we have the same chemical constituents. Thus life is fundamentally conservative, continually mimicking its past states, with evolution as the exception that proves the rule. Why posit intelligence at the level of the organism but ban it from the level of the cell?","Peeling","310560","A fact which can be straightforwardly established by disconnecting your computer from the internet and attempting to access the site. The exact same test would establish that plenty of software is entirely contained within your computer. You claim traits are like internet sites - gene splicing demonstrates that many are not; that 'installing the software' is sufficient. If it were merely simplified, then nothing you omitted or assumed would damage your argument. But since that argument concerned the implausibility of evolution solving such a huge problem in a single step, the example was a worthless contrivance, not a 'simplification' I see. So this is your fallback position when this: is not allowed to pass unchallenged. This is a false dichotomy. Random mutation can be - and is - modulated by previously evolved regulatory systems (mutation-prone plasmids etc). However, the very existence of such physical systems undermines the notion of a holistic intelligence doing the same job. If those physical systems are necessary for evolution, then how did they themselves evolve? The only logical explanation is that such systems are an evolved optimisation - helpful, but not absolutely necessary. Another false dichotomy. Epigenetic inheritance does not require morphogenetic memory - whatever that is. Of course it is. You don't need intelligence to follow instructions, and you don't need new instructions to accomplish or construct new things. This apparent recursive paradox is the result of a failure of your own imagination. 1. You do not need new instructions to accomplish or construct new things. You merely need a different configuration of existing instructions. 2. You fail to take into account the active chemical nature of the 'instructions'. If a new gene were a hammer, it could be thought of as a hammer with electrodes in the handle, capable of inducing a muscular spasm to cause itself to be wielded. I'm really not sure what you're trying to achieve with this analogy. The concept of a 'tornado' is something we as observers impose upon the collective motions of individual particles. Any problems we might have with the fuzzy distinction between no tornado and tornado are our fault for inventing a discontinuous concept to describe a continuously variable phenomenon. Well, it's your hypothesis so you can make it up as you go along, of course. I merely presumed it would be consistent. My first concern would be, as others have voiced, that insufficient controls were in place to ensure independence of the trials. Occam's razor suggests that's the more likely explanation, given the utter failure of millions of routine fluctuation tests to yield a similar improvement in results over time. As I anticipated, you speak of conceptual resonance - which merely shuffles the problem around without solving it. How do the material constituents attain the status of 'a concept'? If we abstract a vital nucleotide, why isn't the remaining 'resonance' enough to carry the organism through? It should be, given that many of the 'living' configurations of that organism are far more physically distinct from one another than the one we've engineered by removing the nucleotide. What decides that the trillions of moment-to-moment 'living' configurations of a cell resonate, but not the one where a single genetic base-pair has gone astray? Epigenetic inheritance still has traceable, physical mechanisms - not all memory needs to be genetic for it to be represented physically. As an aside, I would wager you're no more physically similar - at any level beyond the genetic - to your great great grandfather than I am - so why haven't I 'tuned in'? You do know what 'proves the rule' means, don't you? For the very simple reason that if cells were intelligent animals wouldn't need brains. You may as well ask 'why posit computational power at the level of the computer but ban it from the level of the transistor'.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","05:31 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","49"

A tornado is not a collection of particles but a spiraling vortex that evacuates warm air from the ground and delivers it into the upper atmosphere, thereby eliminating the temperature gradient from which it derives its energy. When the gradient is gone, the tornado blinks out of existence as suddenly as it emerged. Meanwhile all those particles are still around, just not being animated by a self-organized force of nature. To reduce a tornado to dust is the ultimate in blind reductionism. There is neither reason nor evidence to this view. It's just pure dogma. In the case of natural, complex systems, including organisms, the whole is a thing in itself, not just a concept. Check out Into the Cool by Eric D Schneider and Dorion Sagan to understand the fundamentally holistic nature of complex systems, both lifelike and living.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","05:15 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","52"

Did I once mention dust? No; I spoke of particles, in which category I include those of the air, water and all other components of the system. Each of them individually moves under the laws of physics, and the pattern thus formed we call a tornado, when it becomes apparent to our senses. The supposed 'holistic' nature of the system is merely semantic confusion: the application of a binary, on-off term to describe an analog, continuous phenomenon. In future, if you're going to cherry-pick one point out of a post to use as a smokescreen for your inability to tackle the rest, I recommend you fully understand it first. Sorry, but I don't see you drawing any useful distinction between 'thing' and 'concept' here. Or 'form' for that matter, which is another term you've used interchangeably. All these words simply refer to degrees of abstraction. Two bacteria are not similar at all in terms of their moment-to-moment molecular configuration. By ignoring progressively more and more of the detail of that configuration - abstracting from the reality - we can find sweet spots of conceptual similarity: stage of lifecycle, species etc. But that's a function of us as observers, not the 'thing' itself. What you propose is that the universe itself appreciates these anthropological degrees of abstraction. Unfortunatly the whole notion is incoherent. How can morphic resonance be so specific as to discern between species of bacteria, yet so loose as to equivocate between you and your ancestors? How can subtle mutations - changes in the fine molecular detail - of one organism propagate accurately into the completely different fine molecular detail of another via a resonance which must of necessity ignore such detail in order to occur? It would be like trying to play gamma waves on a violin. Conversely, why don't mutations that substantially alter the gross physical form of the creature 'break' the morphic resonance? Then there's the 'first time' paradox. If a new form - possessed of a particular novel trait or mutation - can function for the first time without needing to be informed by resonance with past equivalents, then it can work for the second time without resonance, and the third, and every time after that. Morphic resonance can't be needed the first time - thus it is redundant every time. All in all, it's empirically defunct and a theoretical train-wreck. Now I think I've said it all.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","07:20 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","53"
"05-08-2008","10438",4,"Symbiote","310562","Basically you claim that the brain operates non-deterministically, but that you can't provide a single example of a non-deterministic event that has ever occured in it. In fact, when asked to provide an example, you point to a small change deterministically causing a large change, later. PS you still haven't explained how you tune into your ancestors, is this psychic tuning the same power that allows people to bend forks with their mind?","dace","310662","The burden of proof is not on me. How can you prove that a single large-scale event in the brain is conditioned by immediately prior events? Of course, in retrospect you can always say that a given event was caused by whatever came right before, but in advance you don't know what will occur. The point is that we don't know which tiny event will result in huge consequences down the road. In meteorology, this is known as the butterfly effect. A butterfly flaps its wings, and the weather takes a radically different course than would otherwise have happened. Well, butterflies flap their wings all the time. Which one will trigger a momentous chain of events? We can't say. This is because the weather hasn't been determined in advance. At any given time, many things could happen. Only in retrospect can we trace a definitive causal chain. At the moment it's happening, it's wide open. Strict determinism died in the 19th century with the onset of Boltzmann's statistical mechanics. Boltzmann established that the behavior of molecules in a gas cannot be accurately predicted. The laws of thermodynamics apply only en mass. Thus the gas as a whole will most likely follow predictable modes of behavior but not the individual molecules composing it. With the death of strict determinism, a new outlook emerged which was built around ""chance and necessity,"" as Jacques Monod put it. This is fine as far as clouds are concerned, but the behavior of complex systems cannot be explained according to chance at one level of operation and necessity at a higher level. Instead, the system as a whole is probabilistic. All complex systems, whether lifelike or living, are embedded with goals. The goal of a whirlpool is to evacuate water. The goal of a tornado is to equalize temperature between ground and sky. The goal of a bacterium is to consume sugar. If there's more than one way to achieve a goal, then there's no telling which route the system will choose. Let's say an individual suffers brain damage and loses the ability to speak. The goal of the brain is to restore its lost function. If the damaged area is beyond repair, another brain region will adapt to the task of processing speech. No one can say beforehand which brain region will take on this task. All we can say is that a new speech center will emerge somewhere in the cerebrum. There is no chain of cause and effect that determines precisely what the brain will do. The point is that it has a goal and will use whatever means it has to attain that goal, by whatever route. A cell operates the same way. No matter what event you point to in a cell, you can only trace the causal chain back so far before hitting a wall of molecular disorder. A cell is essentially a sea of gas on which macromolecules bounce about like buoys. Simple physical and chemical forces do not determine the overall patterns of activity within the cell. Rather, the cell makes use of physical and chemical forces to achieve its ends. If you wish to prove that the behavior of a cell is physically determined, you must identify a causal chain leading from the actions of genes to large-scale activities such as building membranes, removing waste, distributing ATP, etc. Of course, no one has been able to demonstrate anything close to this. We can identify only very short causal chains in tiny pockets amidst an ocean of chaos. It's the cell as a whole that has causal primacy not its chemical constituents. Ah, a trick question. I'm not aware of any evidence for ""telekinesis."" As to natural memory, I've explained it many times. We are all at all times influenced by our past behaviors as well as those of any past, similar organism, presumably though not necessarily ancestral. A current organism resonates with a past organism on the basis of similar morphology. In essence, this is no different than saying an antenna resonates with a transmitter on the basis of similar frequency. We have no direct evidence of electromagnetic fields but can certainly deduce their existence given the fact of radio. So to, we have no direct evidence of morphogenetic fields, but we can deduce their existence given the fact of memory. Since organisms behave in particular, stereotypical ways in the absence of deterministic forces compelling these behaviors, we can surmise that they are influenced by past, similar modes of activity. Whereas electromagnetic fields are deterministic, morphogenetic fields are probabilistic. An organism has many options at any one time. It will probably do what it has done in the past but not necessarily. Otherwise, there would be no novelty and no evolution. Bottom line: causation is deterministic when it stems from the immediate past and probabilistic when it stems from the deep past.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","06:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","54"

And I never said anything about a single step. It's implausible that random mutation would provide the necessary solution in any reasonable amount of time. But let's say the macaw and the tough nut is the one example in which a random mutation did the job. What about all the other millions upon millions of similar examples? Every organism on earth is suited to its environment in numerous ways. Are we to explain every one of these traits in every one of these creatures by an astronomically improbable mutation? This doesn't mean, of course, that we must invoke a supernatural intelligence to account for life in its manifold varieties. All we need is to identify a method by which the adaptations resulting from the natural intelligence of organisms can be transmitted to descendants. There are two possibilities. One is adaptive mutation, implying cellular intelligence, while the other is holistic, species-wide memory, allowing adaptations of organisms to be picked up by their descendants without the need for genetic transmission. It may be that both of these scenarios are correct. Certainly, once we admit to the existence of intelligence at the level of the whole organism, we cannot deny the possibility that it exists at lower levels of structure, right down to the cell. If a bacterium can make intelligent decisions, so can our cells. The brain is merely a vehicle of intelligence. There are other possible vehicles. So too, the genome is a vehicle of species memory, but there are other possible vehicles. According to Walter Elsasser, memory runs on two tracks, genetic and holistic. If it's strictly genetic, why do organisms reveal the same general patterns of their predecessors while exhibiting wildly varying individuality in their chemical makeup? It doesn't make sense. There's got to be a holistic aspect of development. Couple that with the undeniable fact of our own self-existence as conscious minds, and ideological reductionism starts looking weak at best. No inconsistency. If there's no imperative to act more quickly, there's no reason why a second batch would complete faster than the first. Oh, and it's not my hypothesis. First of all, the notion of holistic memory, otherwise known as morphic resonance, goes back to 1981, when Elsasser proposed it in the Journal of Theoretical Biology and Sheldrake independently proposed it in his book, A New Science of Life . Moreover, holistic biology in general has a lineage going back 200 years, and yes, it includes Charles Darwin (though not his chief popularizer, TH Huxley). Holistic and reductionist biology are like the tightly coiled strands of DNA. They've always both been present and always will be. After all, even with the recognition of the fundamentally holistic nature of life, we must still recognize that many processes in organisms can be reduced to simpler, more mechanical processes. Yeah, do you? When you say ""the exception that proves the rule,"" it means yes, there's an exception, but the rule is still essentially correct. Life is mostly conservative, but where an opportunity for something better arises, it can radicalize real fast, hence punctuated equilibrium.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","07:45 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","56"

A natural form of memory, it retrieves past organic form on the basis of similarity to current organic form. Fine molecular details do not propagate via morphic resonance. Only general forms propagate. So, for instance, during development liver cells form by mimicking the development of prior liver cells, not on the basis of genetic information. In their details, the cells will be quite different. Only in their overall pattern of activity are they the same. Who says they don't? It's called speciation. A species is, in essence, a collective pool of memory. Once a population has its own pool of memory, it's a species. The mystery is not how an organism does something novel. The mystery is how it knows to do things exactly the same way their ancestors did. This includes development from the egg. How does a fish embryo know to hold onto its gills while a primate embryo knows they're just a stage? An organism can certainly engage in something novel once. But for it to keep doing it and for its descendants to keep doing it just the same way, there has to be a kind of memory. It can be particulate, as in DNA, or it can be holistic, which is harder to understand because it's not tangible. That didn't stop Newton from proposing gravity and shouldn't stop us today from recognizing that the particulate form of memory is never going to be sufficient, either in explaining development or evolution.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","08:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","57"
