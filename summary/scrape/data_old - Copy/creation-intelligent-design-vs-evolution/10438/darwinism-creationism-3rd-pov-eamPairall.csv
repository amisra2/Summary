All the evidence for the role of genes in the inheritance of forms and instincts is evidence as to necessity. So far as I know, no one has ever proposed a testable hypothesis that could verify or falsify the proposition that genes or brain cells are not only necessary but also sufficient to account for memory. The nonsense is entirely Falk's. Note that he never explains exactly what it is that's taught in high school biology that contradicts my statement. Evo-devo research has demonstrated that what counts is not so much the genes themselves but how they're used. Assuming that the knowledge of how to manipulate genes is not paradoxically encoded in the genes themselves, this implies the existence of endogenous intelligence at the cellular level. Complex systems, where living or merely lifelike, always emerge in whole, not in part. Complexity is fundamentally holistic. The shift to complexity in biological thinking represents a definitive rebuke of the reductionist interpretations that characterized 20th century theory. Of course, we could say that morphic resonance (i.e. formal similarity) is the mechanism by which current organisms tune in to their predecessors. I didn't use the word mechanism that way in this essay because I didn't want to create confusion by using the same word in two different ways. That there are no distant goals in evolution does not mean there are no immediate goals. The macaw wants to eat. To do so, it must crack a very hard nut. It thus develops its jaw muscles in order to achieve its goal. Nothing foolish about any of this. In fact, it's foolish to deny that evolution is driven, in part, by purpose and intelligence.","Peeling","310250","The short answer: gene splicing. I had a protracted discussion with WW about this very point: to induce a trait in a different species or organism it is necessary to transfer to that organism all the information necessary to yield the trait. Obviously, the organisms will already have a lot of non- trait-specific information in common, eg they employ the same cipher for translating DNA bases into amino acids and thus proteins. So what we're really asking is whether a given gene encapsulates all the novel information required for the trait to present. The success of gene splicing confirms that this is very often the case. Even where the transplanting of a single gene is insufficient, it seems reasonable to suppose that it is the unique physical context in which that gene is operating - the cogs with which it meshes in the original species - that yield function, rather than speculating that it indexes some metaphysical 'memory'. I don't know whether it's taught in high-school biology, but the primary faults in the (your?) reasoning are common wrong-turns made by critics of evolutionary theory: the false assumption of constancy, and the construction of an implausible starting scenario. In the scenario as presented, the macaw is the only variable. Right from the start it is faced with the problem of an incredibly tough nut, which it must somehow eat. Thus you engineer an insurmountable problem for evolution to solve: a non-viable animal which must within its own lifetime become viable. Taking the assumption of constancy first - why are you assuming that back in the day when macaws lacked their formidable jaw strength, the nuts they had to eat were as tough as they are now? Why would they need to be that rugged and over-engineered if nothing in the environment poses them that great a threat? Remove the assumption of constancy and we see an evolutionary arms-race: the toughest nuts from one generation surviving to grow, yielding a next generation of tougher-nutted plants, in turn favouring the macaws with the strongest jaws, who breed to produce a stronger-jawed macaw population - and so on. Secondly, is your starting scenario a sensible one? For the macaw species to have survived long enough to evolve that far, there must be other things around it can and has been eating! If all those food sources suddenly disappeared, we know what would happen: extinction. We don't need to find ways to improve evolution's ability to solve your problem, because your problem is fundamentally flawed. Why would that be a paradox? Have you never bought anything that came with an instruction manual? I have a child seat for my car with the instructions printed on the side - where's the paradox? Even that is underselling the potential for genes to regulate themselves and each other. They are not words on paper but chemically active compounds: they can directly alter the function of their biological context without that biological context needing to know 'how', or make any kind of decision on the matter. This is another common logical failure, similar to that responsible for the myth that 'Irreducible Complexity' is a problem for evolution. Just because a complex system is holistic doesn't mean it couldn't previously have been a simpler (or in the case of IC systems, more complex) holistic system in the past. What is a vital role now may at one time have been an unintended by-product of a quite different process - a by-product which opportunistic evolution made use of, to the point where the role is now indespensible. Such 'resonance' is trivial to debunk. Carry out a fluctuation test on a batch of bacteria. Now do it again on another batch. If morphic resonance could inform the second batch they ought to do better - they don't. Even at the theoretical level, the notion of morphic resonance is irretrievably flawed. At any given instant, the molecular configuration of one bacterium will be entirely unlike that of even its immediate neighbour, let alone some previous generation, so what exactly is supposed to be resonating? If you invoke the idea of conceptual resonance to solve that problem, you still haven't provided a place for the metaphysical rubber to hit the physical road. See above. I wouldn't go so far as to call it foolishness, but there is a failure on your part to critically examine your assumptions. Now that is true. Sexual selection, migration, intelligently exploiting niches using what nature has given you - all these factors guide evolution.

I need a computer to view 4Forums. Does this mean 4Forums is contained within my computer? Of course not. It's a simple question of logic. Maybe all the information does lie within the gene. But from a scientific standpoint, it hasn't been proven. Calling it metaphysical is begging the question. If natural memory is real, then it's not ""metaphysical."" My example is simplified for the sake of brevity. Of course, the nuts are also evolving, and the macaw has other food sources. The question is how this evolutionary arms race proceeds. Does natural selection operate in tandem with random mutation or adaptive mutation? Does the adaptation need to be expressed at the genetic level, or can somatic changes, through a process of morphogenetic memory, directly influence the forms and instincts of descendants? If not, is there an intelligence operating at the cellular level which is sensitive to the survival needs of the whole organism? Or is there some kind of mechanical process such as Darwin's pangenesis that allows somatic information to enter the germline? Nobody knows the answers to these questions. It's all up in the air. That's the thing about science. We can imagine we know the answers, but in the end science kicks us in the XXX. The instruction manual for the child seat works precisely because there is an intelligent agent, i.e. you, that interprets it. So this analogy is not helpful to the point you're trying to make. In the old days it was assumed that DNA contains the blueprint or recipe of the organism and that the application of this blueprint was a strictly mechanical process. Now we see that developmental genes are virtually identical in everything from flies to people. What really counts is the way genes are used rather than their content. So now we need an instructional manual on how to properly implement the blueprint. If the manual is embedded within the DNA itself, how is the DNA able to read it? Presumably the instructions for reading the manual would also be contained within the manual. Perhaps there's another manual that explains how to read the first manual, and then yet another manual to explain how to read that one, and so on, ad infinitum. This is the fallacy of the homunculus. Even without the question of the instructional manual, the idea that organisms require a kind of blueprint in order to be formed is already an example of the homunculus fallacy. After all, if an organism needs a blueprint in order to be assembled, wouldn't the blueprint also need a blueprint? Of course, now that we understand the stupendous complexity in the operation of genes, the whole issue has been rendered moot. The point of reductionism is that a complex process is ""reduced"" to a simple process. Yet the operation of genes turns out to be as complex as any process in the body, including the brain. In short, biological reductionism is as dead as the mechanistic creationism that inspired it. The search for the sources of evolutionary novelty in genetic mutations, remixing, drift, etc., is no longer viable, as the entire theoretical framework of epigenetic development has been abolished. Let's take the example of a tornado. One moment there's no tornado, just a massive gradient between warm air on the ground and cool air in the sky. The next thing you know, a tornado has emerged fully formed, seemingly out of nowhere, and begins efficiently wiping out the temperature gradient. It's not as if the tornado emerged from the dust particles of which it is composed or a smaller proto-tornado. Organisms aren't built up from DNA any more than tornadoes are built up from dust. This is what I mean when I say that complex systems are holistic, not reductionist. Why should the second batch do any better? Unless there's a survival issue involved, the second batch should take exactly as long as the first. The most recent test I'm aware of that confirms morphic resonance was carried out by Rupert Sheldrake and Steven Rose on chicks who received food after pecking at LEDs of a particular color. Only those who pecked at the ""correct"" color (yellow) were rewarded. Each batch of chicks, unrelated to the previous batch, learned to peck at the yellow diodes more quickly. Shockingly, Dr. Rose refused to concede the results of his own experiment. He came in convinced that each batch of chicks would perform no better than previous batches, and he came out no less convinced. Though science follows the evidence, scientists sometimes do not. What resonates is the whole form, not the material constituents. In contrast to artificial memory, which reduces to stored material configurations, natural memory is holistic, operating on the basis of morphological similarity. I tune into my ancestors because we have a similar overall form, not because we have the same chemical constituents. Incidentally, the point you make about chemical individuality in organisms is precisely the point made by the revered embryologist Paul Weiss when he coined the term morphogenetic field. What endures in the organism is overall pattern, not molecular details. The field has causal primacy, directing molecules towards its own end. Sheldrake adds to this notion the idea that morphogenetic fields contain an inherent memory on the basis of which they direct molecular activity. Thus life is fundamentally conservative, continually mimicking its past states, with evolution as the exception that proves the rule.

How many millions of such coding mistakes had to come and go before the right one announced itself, and at last the bird got its meal? So stupendously unlikely is the perfect mutation at the perfect time that calculating the odds against it taking place even once exceeds our imaginative capacity. It is, in fact, a miracle.

The exact same test would establish that plenty of software is entirely contained within your computer. You claim traits are like internet sites - gene splicing demonstrates that many are not; that 'installing the software' is sufficient. If it were merely simplified, then nothing you omitted or assumed would damage your argument. But since that argument concerned the implausibility of evolution solving such a huge problem in a single step, the example was a worthless contrivance, not a 'simplification' I see. So this is your fallback position when this: is not allowed to pass unchallenged. This is a false dichotomy. Random mutation can be - and is - modulated by previously evolved regulatory systems (mutation-prone plasmids etc). However, the very existence of such physical systems undermines the notion of a holistic intelligence doing the same job. If those physical systems are necessary for evolution, then how did they themselves evolve? The only logical explanation is that such systems are an evolved optimisation - helpful, but not absolutely necessary. Another false dichotomy. Epigenetic inheritance does not require morphogenetic memory - whatever that is. Of course it is. You don't need intelligence to follow instructions, and you don't need new instructions to accomplish or construct new things. This apparent recursive paradox is the result of a failure of your own imagination. 1. You do not need new instructions to accomplish or construct new things. You merely need a different configuration of existing instructions. 2. You fail to take into account the active chemical nature of the 'instructions'. If a new gene were a hammer, it could be thought of as a hammer with electrodes in the handle, capable of inducing a muscular spasm to cause itself to be wielded. I'm really not sure what you're trying to achieve with this analogy. The concept of a 'tornado' is something we as observers impose upon the collective motions of individual particles. Any problems we might have with the fuzzy distinction between no tornado and tornado are our fault for inventing a discontinuous concept to describe a continuously variable phenomenon. Well, it's your hypothesis so you can make it up as you go along, of course. I merely presumed it would be consistent. My first concern would be, as others have voiced, that insufficient controls were in place to ensure independence of the trials. Occam's razor suggests that's the more likely explanation, given the utter failure of millions of routine fluctuation tests to yield a similar improvement in results over time. As I anticipated, you speak of conceptual resonance - which merely shuffles the problem around without solving it. How do the material constituents attain the status of 'a concept'? If we abstract a vital nucleotide, why isn't the remaining 'resonance' enough to carry the organism through? It should be, given that many of the 'living' configurations of that organism are far more physically distinct from one another than the one we've engineered by removing the nucleotide. What decides that the trillions of moment-to-moment 'living' configurations of a cell resonate, but not the one where a single genetic base-pair has gone astray? Epigenetic inheritance still has traceable, physical mechanisms - not all memory needs to be genetic for it to be represented physically. As an aside, I would wager you're no more physically similar - at any level beyond the genetic - to your great great grandfather than I am - so why haven't I 'tuned in'? You do know what 'proves the rule' means, don't you? For the very simple reason that if cells were intelligent animals wouldn't need brains. You may as well ask 'why posit computational power at the level of the computer but ban it from the level of the transistor'.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","05:31 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","726"

A tornado is not a collection of particles but a spiraling vortex that evacuates warm air from the ground and delivers it into the upper atmosphere, thereby eliminating the temperature gradient from which it derives its energy. When the gradient is gone, the tornado blinks out of existence as suddenly as it emerged. Meanwhile all those particles are still around, just not being animated by a self-organized force of nature. To reduce a tornado to dust is the ultimate in blind reductionism. There is neither reason nor evidence to this view. It's just pure dogma. In the case of natural, complex systems, including organisms, the whole is a thing in itself, not just a concept.

Did I once mention dust? No; I spoke of particles, in which category I include those of the air, water and all other components of the system. Each of them individually moves under the laws of physics, and the pattern thus formed we call a tornado, when it becomes apparent to our senses. The supposed 'holistic' nature of the system is merely semantic confusion: the application of a binary, on-off term to describe an analog, continuous phenomenon. In future, if you're going to cherry-pick one point out of a post to use as a smokescreen for your inability to tackle the rest, I recommend you fully understand it first. Sorry, but I don't see you drawing any useful distinction between 'thing' and 'concept' here. Or 'form' for that matter, which is another term you've used interchangeably. All these words simply refer to degrees of abstraction. Two bacteria are not similar at all in terms of their moment-to-moment molecular configuration. By ignoring progressively more and more of the detail of that configuration - abstracting from the reality - we can find sweet spots of conceptual similarity: stage of lifecycle, species etc. But that's a function of us as observers, not the 'thing' itself. What you propose is that the universe itself appreciates these anthropological degrees of abstraction. Unfortunatly the whole notion is incoherent. How can morphic resonance be so specific as to discern between species of bacteria, yet so loose as to equivocate between you and your ancestors? How can subtle mutations - changes in the fine molecular detail - of one organism propagate accurately into the completely different fine molecular detail of another via a resonance which must of necessity ignore such detail in order to occur? It would be like trying to play gamma waves on a violin. Conversely, why don't mutations that substantially alter the gross physical form of the creature 'break' the morphic resonance? Then there's the 'first time' paradox. If a new form - possessed of a particular novel trait or mutation - can function for the first time without needing to be informed by resonance with past equivalents, then it can work for the second time without resonance, and the third, and every time after that. Morphic resonance can't be needed the first time - thus it is redundant every time. All in all, it's empirically defunct and a theoretical train-wreck.

A natural form of memory, it retrieves past organic form on the basis of similarity to current organic form. Fine molecular details do not propagate via morphic resonance. Only general forms propagate. So, for instance, during development liver cells form by mimicking the development of prior liver cells, not on the basis of genetic information. In their details, the cells will be quite different. Only in their overall pattern of activity are they the same. Who says they don't? It's called speciation. A species is, in essence, a collective pool of memory. Once a population has its own pool of memory, it's a species. The mystery is not how an organism does something novel. The mystery is how it knows to do things exactly the same way their ancestors did. This includes development from the egg. How does a fish embryo know to hold onto its gills while a primate embryo knows they're just a stage? An organism can certainly engage in something novel once. But for it to keep doing it and for its descendants to keep doing it just the same way, there has to be a kind of memory. It can be particulate, as in DNA, or it can be holistic, which is harder to understand because it's not tangible.

Again, inconsistent. If you're right and only 'general forms' propagate thus, Sheldrake was completely wasting his time testing those chicks - the tiny neurological differences present in a yellow LED-averse chick could never propagate via morphic resonance into another chick. Even if you claim the differences were not neurological, the same logic applies: for a chick's mind to 'resonate' with those of its predecessors all the fine detail would need to be smoothed over - a 'thought' as fine grained as 'don't peck the yellow LED' could never propagate.

You're anthropomorphizing, a common mistake among reductionists, who claim that DNA is like a book and the body a machine. Reductionism is in fact a modern form of anthropomorphosis, projecting our technological mindset onto nature much as Paley did 200 years ago. There's nothing remotely like intelligence in morphic resonance or any other kind of resonance. This is not to deny the possibility of nonhuman intelligence, only that morphic resonance is about memory, not intelligence. What matters is the degree of similarity relative to the differences.

Care to explain how it 'naturally' exhibits steeper attenuation with bacteria than with humans if there is no boundary to what constitutes 'a bacterium' in morphic resonance terms? Earlier you said this: On the face of it, this makes no sense whatsoever. If the differences are tiny, then morphic resonance should be strong. But here you're saying that if the differences are tiny, morphic resonance will be weak unless the differences are really tiny. That's clearly nonsense. All you're saying is that you get to make it up as you go along: you get to look at two humans and say 'yeah, close enough to resonate' and then look at two bacteria of different species that are far, far more similar than any two humans and say 'Yeah, but they could be even more similar so they won't resonate'. Because that's clearly nonsense, I gave you the benefit of the doubt and presumed you had merely clumsily worded a quite different idea: that resonance is based on the actual degree of difference compared to the potential degree of difference. Except that still doesn't work because to measure 'potential' you need to draw a circle around what counts as 'a bacterium' and measure its diameter - and you can't do that without imposing arbitrary classifications, which you've just said morphic resonance doesn't.

It sounds like an unnecessarily convoluted wording of a straightforward physical phenomenon. You've already said morphic resonance does not propagate molecular details, so no, maybe they don't.

Behe's argument relies upon the false assumption that there is no 'half an eye' - no intermediate step - that is in any way useful; it's all or nothing. My argument is that if you already have a sequence of developmental events A and B, where B depends upon A, then there may well be no single mutation that can eliminate A and transform B so as to work in the absence of A, and it's also very unlikely that any stepwise accumulation of mutations would be viable. A mutation that makes B work in the absence of A could be catastrophic in the presence of A, and a mutation that eliminates A would be catastrophic for B. This would not hold true for every developmental step, but it's reasonable to predict that it would crop up from time to time. You may not buy it, but you cannot discount it. Given evolution's opportunistic nature, the gene combinations responsible for those structures may have become entangled with the formation of other structures. Actually, there's an even simpler explanation which doesn't involve that kind of developmental dependency: say we start with a creature with gills. The first mutation that eliminates them from the adult form might be one that prevents them forming in the first place, but it might not be - it might be one that catalyses reabsorption. Now we have a two-step process in place - what happens if another mutation 'streamlines' the development process by preventing the gills forming at all? What will the 'reabsorption' step do now? Maybe nothing, maybe something catastrophic. Again, you might end up stuck with the first solution hit upon. Of course it does! Physical isolation from other organisms doesn't necessarily mean you aren't in competition. A longer, more complex and potentially more error-prone developmental process will yield statistically fewer live births than a simpler, safer one. Unless the attendant benefits in adulthood outweigh the risks, such a process is at a selective disadvantage. For you to realise that, I must be succeeding in being clear by using such shorthand - so why complain about it? Perhaps.

It's simply a matter of shifting the context from womb to outer environment, and you're arguing against the viability of random mutation as the source of novelty in evolution. I happen to take this view myself, which is why I support Miroslav Hill's proposal for adaptive mutation of genes (really just an updated version of Darwin's pangenesis) as well as Sheldrake's proposal for form-based inheritance. It's interesting how, as soon as you begin looking at it from the point of view of the embryo, you start to see the implausibility of neo-Darwinian evolution. Yet any argument that applies to the womb can also be applied to evolution in the context of the outer environment. Be careful of what you write. Creationists could easily remove your words from their embryonic context and claim you're talking about the implausibility of evolution in general. And this is my point exactly. Given the potential problems that can crop up during a lengthy gestation full of odd detours through the phylogenetic tree, embryogenesis ought to have been streamlined by the same process of random mutation that allows for advances in the adult form of the organism. But it hasn't happened because novelty doesn't stem primarily from random mutation. It stems from pressures on the organism in its environment and the adaptations it undertakes so as to improve its chances for survival. These adaptations, as Darwin argued, are then inherited by offspring. But in this case, the risks are faced by the expectant mother while the organism that would have to creatively adapt is adrift in the oceanic bliss of the womb. Since the embryo itself isn't going to adapt, and the mother can't do anything but wait for the process to play itself out, the only adaptations that occur are those that arise spontaneously from accidents in the replication of genes. And here we see just how paltry is the effect of such accidents. After millions upon millions of years, we're still recapitulating in the womb the same old developmental processes of our early vertebrate ancestors. It all comes down to what our default assumption ought to be. Neither side has been proven. The originator of genetic reductionism, August Weismann, stated that he had no evidence for his belief but simply couldn't imagine any other possibility. He assumed that organisms possess no endogenous intelligence by which to adapt genes in accord with behavioral and morphogenetic adaptations. Thus organisms cannot transmit their living adaptations to progeny. He also arbitrarily disallowed the possibility that organisms transmit information in any kind of long-distance sense, such as the way a radio transmitter links up to disparate receivers on the basis of electromagnetic resonance. So there's no evidence that inheritance is limited to whatever mutations spontaneously arise from within DNA. Just pure assumption from the get-go. Nor is there any evidence that genetic transcription is the motive force in development. It's not as if anybody's ever traced a causal chain from the activities of genes to the creation of multicellular structures or even the patterned activities within cells themselves. All we have is a link between genotype and phenotype. This gene means you'll have blue eyes. This one means you'll have dimples. This one means you'll have a gift for mechanical analysis. It's simply assumed that since we have the front end (genotype) and the back end (phenotype) there must be a causal chain connecting them which accounts for the construction of all the organs and tissues of the body. But what if genes don't contain anything like a blueprint of the body but merely influence its development so as to promote differences between individuals? Perhaps the actual basis of development is the ability of organic systems to directly mimic previous similar systems. Like Newton positing gravity to explain planetary motions, we simply posit memory as a universal feature of nature. Because we cannot discount the possibility that memory is a property of nature, we cannot assume that genes provide the basis for development in general. Instead, we must have evidence, but the only thing we know on the basis of hard evidence is that genes differentiate between individuals, not that they provide the general template for the species. The beauty of Weismann's reductionism is that it explained something complex (the complete living organism) according to something simple (""germ-plasm"" or genes). And it's true that the information contained in genes is stunningly simple in relation to the body and its organs. But now, in light of ""evo-devo"" research, we discover that developmental genes are virtually identical in everything from people to flies. What distinguishes us is the way in which our genes are operated, and this process of operating genes is as complex as anything we've ever found in nervous, endocrine or immune systems. What's the point of explaining one complexity in terms of another? The entire foundation of genetic reductionism has simply vanished. Where before we stood on terra firma, we now stand on thin air. But there's more. It turns out that complexity is fundamental to nature. Nature is not based on static simplicity but process complexity. A whirlpool, for instance, is a self-organized system that derives energy by rapidly reducing the pressure gradient resulting from a large body of water trying to fit through a small opening. The only law of physics that gives shape to a whirlpool is the second law of thermodynamics. Because energy is always being leached in the form of entropy, natural systems must draw in more energy than is lost. It's not about physical laws determining the actions of passive matter but this gray area in which matter is not passive but takes the form of a complex system actively striving to maintain enough energy flow to stave off the ravages of entropy. It's often thought that evolution is a property of life. In reality, life is a property of evolution. Before there was life, there was evolution of complex chemical systems that derived energy by tapping into temperature and/or pressure gradients. The greater its internal complexity, the more energy a given chemical system can harness. The problem is that increased energy flow today means increased entropy tomorrow. In order to overcome increased entropy, the system must further complexify in order to harness even more energy, setting the stage for even more entropy down the road. And so on, and so on, and so on until you've got human beings trying to develop new sources of energy while coping with all the garbage and pollution and infrastructure decay resulting from prior energy-intensive development. From complex chemical systems of the early Earth to human civilization, it's all a single thread of complex self-organized systems overcoming entropy by drawing in more energy. Evo-devo and complexity theory constitute a one-two punch that has knocked reductionism out of the ring. It's holism from here on out with reductionism demoted from theory to mere methodology. Naturally, we still wish to break down complicated phenomena into simpler underlying phenomena wherever possible. It's just that we'll never reduce any complex, self-organized system into laws, on the one hand, and matter on the other. The system must be taken as a thing in itself, and to understand its actions, we must interpret them in light of its overall needs and not some combination of abstractions and atoms. So where does this leave biology? Do we have to start from scratch, scrambling to apply the lessons of complexity science to organisms? Not at all. Biology has always had a holistic component. The theory of evolution doesn't follow from biochemistry but stems from observations of embryos recapitulating their ancestral forms. Darwin explicitly denied Descartes' notion (then being trumpeted by T.H. Huxley) that animals are machines. Rejecting the view of the fundamental passivity of matter, Darwin saw evolution as an expression of the creativity inherent in matter. C.S. Peirce generalized Darwin's doctrine by arguing that even the principles of physics are mere cosmic habits that came into being in time and reinforce themselves over time. Henri Bergson argued on the basis of neurological observation that brains are not passive memory-storage devices but serve to filter out the masses of extraneous memory continually pouring down on us from our living past. In other words the problem is not remembering what is important but forgetting what is not. Bergson's arch-enemy Bertrand Russell referred to this insistent pressure of the past on the present as ""mnemic causation."" Though Russell disdained everything uttered by his more famous French counterpart, he did at least concede the possibility that the present is influenced by the deep past in addition to the immediate past of standard causation. Russell's associate Alfred North Whitehead went much further, arguing that science was in for a wholesale shift from physio-centric to bio-centric, from static instant to living process. Embryologist Paul Weiss, who argued that ""morphogenetic fields"" organize development from the egg, was once president of the National Academy of Sciences, giving the lie to the idea that holistic biology has always been the reserve of marginal thinkers. South African naturalist Eugene Marais demonstrated that an organizing field, over and above ordinary chemical communication, maintains the integrity of termite mounds. The physicist Walter Elsasser, who solved the equations for the Earth's electromagnetic fields before turning from physics to biology, published his insights in numerous biological journals. He defined holistic memory not just in terms of personal memories and habits but ""all informational stability in the organism that does not yield to an understanding in terms of mechanistic models."" Sheldrake's notion of morphic resonance, far from being an oddball theory out of left field, is the crowning achievement in a long lineage of holistic thought in biology. For the first time we have a testable means by which the present comes under the influence of the past. Though complexity theory can explain how a generic system self-organizes and self-perpetuates, it can't explain why one particular system comes into being and not another. This is where memory comes in, and there's no longer any reason to assume that species-memory is strictly a matter of genes. If an organism is a holistic, complex system, why assume its memory is reducible to particles? Fascinating.

The argument pertains to potential restrictions on how evolution can proceed, not what it can yield. Evolution can produce a human without gills or a swimbladder, but it can't necessarily streamline those features away entirely. That was in fact what you asked for: a genetic explanation for why certain features would be revised away in a particular manner. Imagine you have some scaffolding covered in tarpaulin. It functions well enough as a domicile. Then, within and using the scaffolding, you construct a house, and you live for a while within the house within the scaffolding. Then you remove the tarpaulin, then you remove the scaffolding. That process of constructing houses can be arrived at by stepwise evolution: repeat it several times, adding one more modification each time. However, although it's possible in principle for houses to be built without ever using scaffolding, it may not be possible to evolve stepwise to such a process from the one above. The scaffolding may get in the way of the scaffold-less process of construction, so that has to be the first change you make to the process - except that without it, you can't build the house any more, so you need to change the house-building process first, except you can't because the scaffolding is in the way... your only option is to make two precisely complementary changes simultaneously , which is comparatively unlikely in an evolutionary scenario. None of this says anything about the ability of evolution to produce the result we're interested in: a process for constructing a house. It only speaks to the optimisations it can or cannot be reasonably expected to make to that process. Undoubtedly, and I would have to correct their misapprehension, as I have here with you. ...of the reasons I've already laid out. That does not entirely follow. The lack of any conceivable mechanism for reverse-engineering phenotypic change into genetic change precludes it happening in some ways, but there are other routes by which behavioural adaptations in particular can be transmitted between generations. The fact that animals raised in captivity - even naturally solitary ones - can struggle to function in the wild demonstrates that exogenous pathways for inheriting acquired behaviour exist within their species. Indeed, that's yet another empirical nail in the morphic resonance coffin: if chicks can supposedly learn something as specific as 'don't peck the yellow LED' via morphic resonance, then no animal, wherever and however reared, should struggle to occupy its usual niche when released into the wild. That's terribly woolly thinking. A reciever does not resonate with the transmitter, it resonates with the proximate electromagnetic waves. By what method do waves of 'chick averse to pecking yellow LEDs' propagate? Nor is there any statement to that effect; you are constructing a strawman. Tea, anyone? There's a pot in orbit around Jupiter if you're thirsty... The complexity of life is layered; cumulative. Just because genes are leveraged in a complex fashion now does not mean such was always the case, any more than the complexity of the genes themselves has been invariant, or the complexity of the macro forms produced by those systems. All life in existence today has had a few billions of years to accrue the most baroque complexity, so naturally understanding it is going to be difficult. We may never understand it entirely - but that doesn't mean there's nothing there to be understood. I don't see any merit in saying ""That explanation is just so darn complicated, I can't understand it, so I've decided a different explanation that I can understand must be right instead"".

Point being that all randomly driven evolution is unlikely compared to intelligently driven evolution, as Darwin originally conceived it. Because the intelligence of the organism has been removed from the equation, it's popped up again in the form of intelligent design. Hence the creationist monkey on reductionism's back. Morphic resonance is not magic. It doesn't perform miracles. An animal with no experience in the wild is going to have a very tough time adjusting, even with the help of species-wide holistic memory. Receivers resonate with transmitters via electromagnetic waves. It's not that I'm being woolly but that you're splitting hairs. More hair splitting. As you know perfectly well, according to Weismannian, a.k.a. ""neo-Darwinian"" theory, the information relevant to the formation of the body is limited to genes in the nucleus. When Newton proposed that gravity is a property of nature, Leibniz accused him of introducing ""occult qualities and miracles into philosophy."" I learned about this ignorant and unscientific comment from none other than Charles Darwin, who took Leibniz to task in The Origin of Species , a book you may just want to have a look at someday. Spoken like a true bureaucrat. Stop prevaricating and accept reality. Reductionism is based on translating something complex into something simple. The operations of genes are no longer simple relative to the bodies whose forms they allegedly determine. End of theory. Modern thought offers four theories of life. The first was proposed in 1802 by William Paley in his book, Natural Theology . Paley claims that life is the product of God's mechanical genius. An organism gains its form through divine craftsmanship. Call it the intelligence theory of life. The second theory was proposed by August Weismann in the 1890s. An organism gains its form through the inheritance of morphogenetic information contained in its germ-plasm. The complex organism is effectively ""reduced"" to its germ-plasm (genes). Though the organism is still a machine, its ""maker"" is whatever random mutations in its genes happen to be beneficial and are therefore environmentally selected. The first theory was undone by evolution, while the second theory was undone by evo-devo and the refutation of reduction from complex body to simple genome. These are the mechanistic theories, and both are wholly discredited. To continue clinging to the second is no more scientific than clinging to the first. There is no longer any difference, so far as scientific credibility is concerned, between a creationist and a reductionist. The next two theories are holistic, and the dispute between them is the fundamental concern of 21st century biology. First we have the theory coming into focus under the guise of complexity theory, which is derived primarily from the study of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Life originated from self-organized chemical systems characterized by autocatalytic reactions, meaning that the result of the final reaction sets the stage for the first step. The processes occurring in our cells are simply continuations of autocatalytic reactions that began four billion years ago. Species are differentiated via genes which, rather than containing information for the construction of the organism, merely channel the autocatalysis in a slightly different direction, causing a different outcome at the morphological level. This is akin to C.H. Waddington's concept of chreodes, whereby a hillside is carved with grooves that represent developmental pathways, and ontogeny is represented by a ball rolling down the hill. The function of genes is to redirect the ball from one set of grooves to another. Since the body is not reduced to genetic information but is taken as a holistic, complex system, the fatal flaw in reductionist information theory is avoided. Much like Michael Shermer arguing against creationists, I've spent far too much time battling proponents of a failed theory. The complexity theory of life is formidable. It is not easily falsified, as is the reductionist model which, after all, never had any evidence to back it up. As Stephen Jay Gould pointed out, from the time of Weismann forward, no one ever proposed a testable hypothesis that could either verify or refute the reduction of organisms to morphological information. It was simply assumed, due to lack of imagination, precisely the problem with creationists, who simply can't imagine how life could exist without an intelligent designer. However, as brilliant as the complexity theory is, it still falls short of a convincing explanation of life. Where is the explanation of atavism? Where is the explanation of parallel evolution? What about personal memory? What about consciousness and intelligence? And can we really account for the activities of cells without any kind of coordinating force, such as the electromagnetic force that lines up magnetic particles? The fourth theory of life, proposed almost simultaneously by physicist Walter Elsasser and biologist Rupert Sheldrake, accepts the holistic framework of complexity theory but adds to it an inherent memory by which organisms negotiate the many biochemical pathways at their disposal. Choices are made unconsciously in accord with whatever the organism has always done before. During development of new structures, it does what its kind has always done before. In novel situations, it can use its intelligence to set out on a new course. Out of the organism's inherent memory is derived mind and all the seemingly impossible properties that follow from it, including representational intelligence. In short, organic order in matter leaves a wake in mind, and this wake then informs subsequent activity. Perhaps the memory theory of life is incorrect, and somehow the complexity theory will account for all known features of life. I doubt it. Nonetheless, this is where the action is. If you want to be relevant to the science of life as it unfolds in the coming years, you will need to get a solid grounding in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, not to mention the dynamics of instability, a.k.a.

Stepwise evolution of a process can yield the results we're interested in, but not necessarily the optimal process by which those results might be achieved. That is the answer to your original question concerning recapitulation; this whole 'creationist monkey' diversion is a red herring. See, this is the kind of thing I mean when I talked about goalpost moving. The lack of metrics means it feels like you get to make it up as you go along. On the one hand you expect to see chicks becoming averse to pecking an LED within just a few weeks, while on the other you see no problem with millions upon millions of years of morphic instinct evaporating in a single generation. I find that horribly contradictory. Not at all - the fact is receivers do not resonate with transmitters. You cannot gloss over that when describing morphic resonance - how much big science is being done to identify the carrier waves of properties like gravity? Not the modern synthesis as I understand it; perhaps I'm out of touch I don't think that someone being wrong about gravity carries any implications for me being wrong about morphic resonance I'll check it out, thanks. Perhaps the terminology is tripping me up, but why employ the term 'goal' with its connotations of intelligence? Especially when you were pretty intolerant of the practice earlier. I'm sorry for speaking harshly about something close to your heart, but when you hold up Sheldrake's 'chick' experiment as evidence, and stand by it no matter how many times its flaws are exposed, it tarnishes whatever value your message might possess. For morphic resonance to have any kind of credibility you must distance yourself from bad science done in its name, and Sheldrake's chick experiment - and especially his write-up - was bad science. I think you've been a bit hasty in branding me a reductionist and thus dismissing me out of hand. I'm quite aware of the fact that one cannot always arbitrarily divide a system in half and understand each half in isolation - my day job would be much easier if you could. But nor do I fall into the 'what use is half an eye?' trap. While an eye can and should be understood holistically, it can also be understood in terms of the incremental steps by which it attained its modern form. That can tell us a great deal about what is steering the process: is it goal-based and holistic, results-fed and reductionist, or a bit of both on different levels? The fact the end result is very complicated does not on its own give us the answer, as you seem to think it does - we need to investigate the stages by which that complexity accrued. Perhaps it's my fault. When you talk about two humans resonating and two bacteria not, it's hard for me to conceive of one set of goalposts that could accommodate both observations without rendering the theory of morphic resonance purely descriptive. Similarly, when you talk about chicks learning to avoid a yellow LED in a few weeks while simultaneously saying the instantaneous loss of million-year-old wild instincts isn't a problem. The former in particular sits very ill with me. What exactly is it about bacteria that would induce such a tremendously steep attenuation of morphic resonance compared to two humans? Your earlier reply, that their similarity means small differences matter more, is a contradiction. If A, B and C are all creatures, and A is more similar to B than to C, then A and B should resonate more strongly, right? Only you're saying that because A and B are more similar the differences matter more, so they resonate less than A and C. Uhhhhh.... Not at all - thank you for reading it. That in itself is a rarity It depends upon what scope for improvement there is. I look at the results and see a short familiarisation period where bumbling ineptitude gives way to competence, followed by a more gradual gaining of expertise. To the best of my knowledge, all non-trivial activities follow a similar pattern. Without knowing what the procedure actually was it's hard to speculate, but I can imagine the lab tech getting more adept at both physically wielding the stimuli and picking up and responding appropriately to signs of interest on the part of the chicks. Remember, the chicks were far less interested in the chrome pin than the yellow LED in absolute terms, so there's much more of a scope for improvement on the part of the lab tech. I think that might be a misunderstanding. Every batch of test chicks and control chicks were injected with something after pecking the LED or chrome pin. In the case of the test chicks the injection contained lithium chloride which made them mildly ill, in the case of the control chicks the injection was pure saline and didn't make them ill. That constituted the 'training' phase of each batch. Those exact same chicks (both the test and control groups) were then exposed to both the chrome pin and the yellow LED in order to establish whether any greater or lesser aversion to either had been induced by the training. This was the 'test' phase of each batch. Both these phases were performed with each daily batch of chicks. There are therefore two kinds of results we can observe: changes in latency of a single batch of chicks between their first and second exposure to the chrome pin or yellow LED, and any trends in those latencies over the course of the experiment. The results were as follows: 1. Trained on Chrome (not made sick), Tested on Chrome: In any given control batch, chicks on average exhibited no detectable change in aversion between training and testing on the chrome pin. There was an unexpected overall downward trend in the aversion of each successive batch over the course of the experiment. 2. Trained on Chrome (not made sick), Tested on LED: The LED was, as noted, much more attractive than the chrome pin, so it's not meaningful to compare the training/testing results. There was no trend toward increased aversion to the LED over the course of the experiment. However, Sheldrake reports this as an increase in aversion by subtracting or dividing the results from 1. above. 3. Trained on LED (made sick), tested on Chrome: Again, becase the LED was much more attractive than the chrome pin, comparisons between training and testing results are meaningless. The chrome pin latencies followed the same downward trend as elsewhere. 4. Trained on LED (made sick), tested on LED: Pronounced increase in aversion between training and testing: these chicks had learned their lesson. Still no trend toward increased aversion to the LED on the part of each successive batch over the course of the experiment. Again, Sheldrake reports this as an increase in aversion by subtracting or dividing by the chrome pin results. The mistake is to assume that the same trend underlies both the control results and the test results, which is what would need to be true for the divergence in the results to require further explanation. I don't feel that's a safe assumption for two reasons: 1. If the divergence was evident and the control group showed the expected lack of a trend, I feel we would be justified in looking for an explanation favourable to morphic resonance. One anomaly, one explanation. Such was not the case. Sheldrake must therefore propose not one but two forces at work: experimenter experience influencing both sets of results equally, counteracted by morphic resonance in the case of the yellow LED. But if experimenter experience is a factor, why can't it be the sole explanation for the chrome pin trend, end of story? 2. If the stimuli were equivalently attractive to the chicks to begin with, I feel we might be justified in attaching significance to the later divergence of the results. However, the chicks always preferred the yellow LED, so much so it would have been impossible for the trend in the control results to be reflected in the test results. Once you appreciate that, you can see how flawed Sheldrake's interpretation was. Experimental capping made it impossible for the LED results to exhibit the downward trend Sheldrake assumes was counteracted by morphic resonance.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","12:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","1567"

Randomly-driven novelty can yield the relevant results - - but not necessarily. So too, randomly-driven novelty can generate the optimal process which achieves those results - - but not necessarily. There's no fundamental difference between the results and the optimum route of achieving them. In both cases, maybe random mutation will produce the relevant outcome - - or maybe not. Even if the unlikelihood of producing the optimum route is greater than the unlikelihood of producing the optimum results, it's still all extremely unlikely in any given case. But hey, over enough time, even the loftiest peaks of Mt. Improbable can be scaled by a process of evolution dependent on random mutation - - right? By the way, not all evolution is necessarily stepwise. Just as the complex structure of a tornado emerges in full out of nothing more than a temperature gradient, many features of organisms may emerge in full without having to be built up stepwise. As biology moves away from reductionism and toward complexity theory, a key argument of creationism will be nullified. I would find that contradictory as well. So it's a good thing I never claimed that millions of years of collective memory evaporate in a single generation. Memory is precisely that which does not disappear with time. It's just that as populations evolve into new species, they no longer tune in to their ancestral populations. Still, there's never a complete break. Just as a twig is still connected to its branch, a species remains mnemically bound to its genus. None, of course. It's well known that there's no carrier of either gravitational or electromagnetic waves. Though the existence of such a carrier was assumed in the classical era of science, the ""luminiferous ether"" was refuted by the Michelson-Morley experiment (or more specifically Einstein's interpretation of Michelson-Morley). Genetic reductionism is the ether of the 20th century, positing genes as the carrier of biological inheritance when no such carrier is necessary. Just as gravitational and electromagnetic waves are propagated across space without any material intermediary, acquired adaptations are inherited without having to be carried on the backs of mutated genes. Weismannian-Mendelian theory, which ultimately came to be known as ""the modern synthesis,"" (since superceded by evo-devo) posits that phenotypic changes are derivative of changes in genes. (We now know that developmental genes stay the same while their epigenetic tags, also composed of DNA, are what mark evolutionary changes at the genetic level). As to the overall egg cell donated by the mother, according to Haldane's synthesis, none of this material determines phenotypes. All self-organized complex systems have the goal of gradient reduction. The movements of a tornado follow precisely the concentration of warm air near the surface. So, is a tornado intelligent? Surely we can agree that this is not the case. Yet it is goal-directed. I think what this means is that intelligence evolves out of the germ of goal-direction. Once again, we see how life not only involves evolution but is a product of evolution. Absolutely not. Rose and his team ran the experiment beautifully. He assumed that so long as the experiment was performed in his lab under his direction that he would be able to definitely refute morphic resonance. When he failed, he tried to conceal the results through selective use of the data. Now that's bad science. Again, you're attributing words to me that I've never spoken. I've never said anything about two bacteria not resonating (assuming they're the same kind of bacteria, and one bacterium precedes the other in time). Morphic resonance operates on the basis of similarity. The most similar thing to a given organism is itself. Thus a bacteria resonates with itself foremost and its predecessors secondarily. If the differences between species of bacteria are smaller than the differences between, say, primate species, then bacterial resonance is narrower than primate resonance. Nonetheless, so long as there are similarities in contrast to differences, resonance will occur. It's only natural. This is the part I was missing. I read the description of the test procedure yet didn't grasp the divide between training phase and testing phase. To me, testing was just another word for training. This caused untold confusion in my ability to understand the results. Thanks again. Okay, this is where you go wrong. The mean latency of chicks tested with the control chrome bead falls, while the latency of these same chicks tested with the yellow diode rises. The trends move in opposite directions, not the same direction, as you've asserted. Rose simply left this result out of his paper. Moreover, you've overlooked a crucial point in the training phase of the experiment, during which ""naive chicks"" revealed an increasing aversion to the yellow diode with each successive batch. This figure is arrived at by using Rose's own proportional methodology of comparing the number of chicks who pecked within ten seconds to the total number of chicks trained. Because previous chicks who pecked at the yellow diode were injected with lithium chloride, newly trained chicks showed an aversion to pecking at the yellow diode. In other words, their collective memory was weighing on them, discouraging them from pecking at the bright, attractive diode. It seems I conceded too much ground in my last post. Go back to the original paper. You will find the results of the increased aversion among subsequent batches of training chicks in figure 3. The increased aversion among chrome-tested chicks to the yellow diode is presented in figure 5. http://www.sheldrake.org/Articles&Pa...formative.html","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","04:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","1039"

But hey, over enough time, even the loftiest peaks of Mt. Improbable can be scaled by a process of evolution dependent on random mutation - - right? By the way, not all evolution is necessarily stepwise. Just as the complex structure of a tornado emerges in full out of nothing more than a temperature gradient, many features of organisms may emerge in full without having to be built up stepwise. I would find that contradictory as well. So it's a good thing I never claimed that millions of years of collective memory evaporate in a single generation. Memory is precisely that which does not disappear with time. It's just that as populations evolve into new species, they no longer tune in to their ancestral populations. Still, there's never a complete break. Just as a twig is still connected to its branch, a species remains mnemically bound to its genus. Morphic resonance is not magic. It doesn't perform miracles. An animal with no experience in the wild is going to have a very tough time adjusting, even with the help of species-wide holistic memory. On the one hand you expect to see chicks becoming averse to pecking an LED within just a few weeks, while on the other you see no problem with millions upon millions of years of morphic instinct evaporating in a single generation. None, of course. It's well known that there's no carrier of either gravitational or electromagnetic waves. All self-organized complex systems have the goal of gradient reduction. Absolutely not. Rose and his team ran the experiment beautifully. He assumed that so long as the experiment was performed in his lab under his direction that he would be able to definitely refute morphic resonance. When he failed, he tried to conceal the results through selective use of the data. Now that's bad science. Again, you're attributing words to me that I've never spoken. I've never said anything about two bacteria not resonating (assuming they're the same kind of bacteria, and one bacterium precedes the other in time). Morphic resonance operates on the basis of similarity. The most similar thing to a given organism is itself. Thus a bacteria resonates with itself foremost and its predecessors secondarily. If the differences between species of bacteria are smaller than the differences between, say, primate species, then bacterial resonance is narrower than primate resonance.

Stepwise adjustments to a process resulting in a different outcome and optimisations to a process preserving the same outcome are not equivalently difficult problems for evolution to solve.

You cannot equivocate between events of radically different probability like that. Furthermore, it's meaningless to say that both are possible without reference to the number of opportunities available for each event. So long as there is, somewhere on that mountain, a gradient that can be scaled by the available opportunities for variation, yes. What you're doing is picking an arbitrary piece of rockface, claiming that evolution ought to be able to scale it, and complaining when it can't. Which pretty much misses the whole point of the Mt Improbable analogy. 'Next thing you know' is not the same as 'instantly fully formed'. That was not what I was referring to. It was perfectly clear what I was talking about : I find it ludicrous to suppose that something as esoteric, novel and specific as aversion to a yellow LED could propagate within weeks, while literally millions of years of resonating species memory could fail to inform an animal raised in captivity how to behave in the wild. Evasiveness is not an attractive quality. I'll say it again: receivers do not resonate with transmitters but with electromagnetic waves - do you contend that there are waves of 'chick averse to yellow LED' propagating through the universe? No, it has the effect of gradient reduction. Why introduce teleological terms to describe an effect? The experiment was performed just fine, but it was a bad experiment in principle. First, it failed to exclude enough factors for the proposed effect to be reliably discerned, and second the LED results were too close to the experimental cap for trends in both directions to register. Sheldrake's write-up is worse science because it ignores both these problems. Why narrower and not stronger? You can't have both the strength of the resonance and the attenuation of the resonance based on the similarity between two organisms because the two effects conflict with each other. More similar = more resonance, yet more similar = steeper attenuation = less resonance. If I have two organisms and tell you nothing except the fact they are 90% similar, you cannot tell me how strongly they should resonate, can you? You've nothing to base the attenuation upon. I could be talking about two bacteria, two primates, two anything. Now think: if I tell you it's two bacteria, what information are you using to arrive at the decision that the attenuation should be steep? Answer: you're using your knowledge of what counts as a bacteria to decide that 90% similarity is not that high, relatively speaking. You're using the definition of 'bacteria' as your benchmark for potential variability. You don't include yeast cells in your estimate because you know they don't 'count'. But why don't they count? If A and B are both bacteria and C is a yeast cell, why isn't C an example of a really, really different kind of A? Unless you arbitrarily draw a line around what's allowed to count, a line chosen to yield the 'right' answer, there's no reason to suppose the existence of yeast cells - or primates for that matter - wouldn't broaden the attenuation of bacterial morphic resonance beyond the species level. No, they dont. They merely diverge, in the same way that a man whose parachute has worked will diverge from a man whose parachute hasn't. The 'trend' in figure 3 is in no way statistically significant (p=0.6, compared to the typical required value of 0.05). Figure 5 shows the LED results with the chrome pin results subtracted. I'll reiterate for clarity: there was no statistically significant trend towards increased aversion to the yellow LED. There was a statistically significant trend towards decreased aversion with respect to the chrome pin. Sheldrake himself explains this via increasing competence on the part of the experimenter. He assumes the divergence between the chrome and LED results is caused by two factors: 1. Equally increasing competence on the part of the experimenter with both the chrome pin and LED (so the graphs should look the same all else being equal) 2. Morphic resonance precisely offsetting factor 1 (making the graphs diverge and removing all sign of a secular trend from the LED results) These assumptions are unfounded for three reasons: 1. Sheldrake himself asserts that competence with the two stimuli advanced differently earlier in the experiment - what justification does he have for supposing this has changed? 2. The LED and chrome pin were not inherently equally attractive to the chicks, so improving experimental technique would inevitably influence the chrome pin results more strongly than the LED results. Thus any trend induced by equally increasing experimental competence with the two stimuli would be a divergent one (as seen), not a parallel one as Sheldrake assumed. I dub this the 'bad product, good salesman' effect: a good salesman will improve the sales of a bad product more significantly than he will improve the sales of a product that sells itself. 3. The LED results were experimentally capped, such that it would be impossible for them to exhibit the same trend as the chrome pin results, even if morphic resonance aversion had been removed from the equation by not making the LED-trained chicks sick.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","07:59 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","1063"

This is the point of Dawkins' Mt. Improbable analogy. But it doesn't happen because there's no survival pressure on the embryo, and this, as Darwin correctly observed, is what drives evolution. No amount of information is enough when the receiver is broken. For instance, children who are not exposed to language never learn to understand sentences or to speak coherently. The language instinct won't kick in unless the preconditions are in place. This is true whether we regard the instinct as being encoded in genes, as Chomsky suggests, or if it's passed onto us holistically by past speakers. Either way, if the preconditions for reception aren't in place, it doesn't catch. For animals introduced to the wild, their instincts may not kick in, regardless of whether those instincts are conveyed to them holistically or genetically. Receivers do not resonate with electromagnetic waves. The charged particles in receivers are excited into motion by electromagnetic waves, thereby bringing the receiver into resonance with the transmitter of those waves. Morphic resonance does not operate across space. It operates across time. Another way of saying this is that time is two-fold. On the one hand, time is in motion. We see this perfectly well all around us, moment to moment. On the other hand, time is perfectly still. We see this within, in our consciousness of presence. No matter what time it is, it's always now. Five minutes ago, now was five minutes ago. Five minutes hence, now will be five minutes hence. Time is absolute presence, and via consciousness we are plugged in, each of us in our mind a microcosm of the absolute presence of time. The material present is always in motion, but the mental present is always the same. Only from the point of view of matter-energy-space is time on the move: one moment disappears as another moment takes it place, and so on. From the point of view of mind, time is not passage but accumulation. The absolute now is always expanding, taking in more and more of the past. The material configuration of a body is always changing, but the presence of its form is absolute. For mind, past is present and therefore always informing what is currently materializing.

Naturally, given enough time, a species will locate the gentler slope so as to avoid the cliff. And I disagree that there are no scalable slopes for embryogensis. The reason we don't see evolution in embryological development is not that it's impossible from the point of view of random mutation but that novelty in bodily form is not driven primarily by random mutation. It is driven, as Darwin asserted, by the adaptations of organisms struggling for survival in a hostile environment and the inheritance of these adaptations by descendants. You snipped the most important part. ""Either way"" refers to genetic memory or holistic memory. Either way , if the preconditions for reception aren't in place, the information doesn't catch. You're arguing against your own theory. There isn't even an issue here. Again, to take the example of language acquisition, whether the language module comes to us via genes or resonance with past speakers, if you're not exposed to speech as a young child, you will never develop language. Got it? A completely groundless claim. Can any observation shake your conviction in genetic reductionism? You see how pointless such ad hominem comments are. They don't move the debate forward. It's not the receiver that's broken but rather the preconditions required for the receiver to do its job. No, there's nothing ""strange"" here. If an animal is never exposed to the wild, it lacks the necessary background for the instincts - - whether conveyed holistically or genetically - - to kick in. Obviously morphic resonance is a simpler explanation than relying on storage of relevant information via random genetic mutation. I mean, come on, are you serious? Every time we change our way of thinking or behaving, we have to wait around for just the right mutation in order for it become instinctive? Wouldn't it be simpler if we just resonate with our forebears, so the newly-formed instinct comes through with or without genetic change? Be careful. Occam is a double-edged razor. Time capsules do not contain representations. The representation occurs only in the mind of the person who opens the time capsule. What the capsule itself contains is matter arranged in a particular way. This is not the same as a representation. For material objects, the law is A = A (the law of identity). For representation, the law is A = B (a thought ""stands in"" for the object being thought of). Representation cannot exist in material form, whether in time capsules, books, brains or genes. Representation is strictly a function of mentality. It's the interpretation of material configurations. Like believing that the law of identity applies everywhere in the universe except in books, brains, genes, etc? So many questions. I suppose it is possible that abstract laws of physics determine the actions of a tornado. Of course, it's also possible that the devil is responsible for tornadoes. Problem is, from a scientific standpoint, both conjectures have no meaning. The only actual scientific theory anyone has ever come up with to explain tornadoes is based on the subset of physics known as nonequilibrium thermodynamics. I'm sorry if this is not the answer you were hoping for. You need to get yourself up to speed on this. Read Into the Cool by Eric Schneider and Dorion Sagan. This is a brilliant book, and best of all, it has nothing to do with Rupert Sheldrake! Morphic resonance is not based on species identity but on similarity, which could conceivably apply to other species. This is how we can explain parallel evolution, such as the astonishing similarity of marsupial and placental mammals that evolved on different continents. Marsupials fell into the developmental pathways of already-established placentals. No abstract classifications involved. Morphic resonance, of course. It's for precisely this reason that Sheldrake posits morphic resonance, so as to provide a mechanism by which an embryo is placed under the influence of the appropriate developmental pathway and not simply tossed about on a sea of morphogenetic noise. We resonate with whatever is similar. That's what determines what counts and what doesn't. Sheldrake is proposing that similarity is the mechanism of organic memory. This applies only to organic forms, such as atoms, crystals and complex, self-organized systems, including organisms. Nonetheless, you've made a really useful observation, one that I've never come across before. Resonance would be different for bacteria than for, say, primates. Contra Gould, evolution does have a direction, from simplicity to complexity (involving ever greater efficiency at gradient reduction and energy harvesting). Since primitive species are more similar to each other than more evolved species, bacteria would experience more background noise relative to foreground information. Perhaps this does mean that resonance is weaker among bacteria than primates. If so, not only does energy efficiency increase with evolution, but so does resonance efficiency.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","05:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","921"

Evolutionary theory states only that we should be able to find a scaleable slope leading to every phenomena we do observe. Since a streamlined embryogenesis of the type you postulate (eliminating gills and swim bladder) is something we don't observe, there's nothing for evolutionary theory to explain. Your challenge to it, on the basis of something we don't see, is therefore meaningless. The issue, which you're dodging again, is that you have no working definition of the 'preconditions' for holistic memory. You just make it up as you go along. If some holistic memory goes missing, you just say the preconditions mustn't have been in place. You never have to say what they were or why they were missing. Please, prove me wrong: describe a consistent scheme under which isolated chicks could 'pick up' something as abstract, esoteric and fleeting as 'don't peck the yellow LED' while a creature reared in captivity would consistently and inevitably fail to pick up on millions of years of 'holistic memory'. I did not say you would do that, which would indeed be ad hominem. I merely said you could - which is true. If morphic resonance does not require wild animals to pick up millions of years of accumulated holistic memory, then it certainly doesn't require a few chicks to learn to avoid a yellow LED over a period of a few weeks. If that's what you think has to happen in every case, I'm not surprised you're turning to morphic resonance Not in this case. We're talking about behaviours animals raised in captivity lack in comparison with their wild cousins. Why is it simpler to first say those behaviours are instinctive and then invent a reason why they aren't being activated, than it is to say the behaviour isn't instinctive and the organism was simply denied the opportunity to learn by example from its parents? They do in the book I'm thinking of. ""The End of Time"" if I recall correctly. We're probably not talking about the same thing here. That much, at least, is wrong - or at least it's question-begging. For representation to be strictly a function of mentality you would have to prove that mentality is not a function of the material. I will; it sounds very interesting. But I'm sure you aren't suggesting that the formation of a tornado causes the individual particles of which it is composed to break the laws of physics, hmm? Failing which, they must be in accordance. Nature may abhor a gradient, but it has to play nice when eliminating them. But again, only when it suits you. Placentals and marsupials - yep, there's morphic resonance at work. Two species of bacteria? Well, that depends - have they done anything that looks similar lately? Inventing morphogenetic noise and then inventing a solution to it doesn't strike me as much progress. In any case, resonating with whatever is similar - fine. The missing variable is the attenutation of that resonance, and what causes that to vary between organism-pairs. You cannot invoke similarity again to define attenuation; it contradicts itself. Though I despair at the idea of propagating this nonsense further, I can't in good conscience pretend there aren't answers, so here's the one I would favour: there's no variability in attenuation. Morphic resonance, based as it is on form, is incredibly strong between all bacteria - but doesn't have a great deal to do. Rather like the strong forces at work in the nucleus of an atom, genetic/chemical imperatives are overpowering on that scale. Only at the macro scale of intercellular organisation can the comparatively weak marshalling force of morphic resonance make itself felt to any great effect. There really is no reason to try and explain anything a bacterium does by morphic resonance anyway. Mind you, I feel the same about all organisms but I think the attenuation issue is a killer. Background levels of similarity just won't cut it - you can't seriously suggest that just the right number of bacteria have existed so as to fine-tune morphic resonance attenuation down to the observable (ie species) level. That's just mad. No: better to let genes have their say and postulate morphic resonance as a parallel or layered effect like other exogenous inheritance pathways.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","12:34 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","808"
