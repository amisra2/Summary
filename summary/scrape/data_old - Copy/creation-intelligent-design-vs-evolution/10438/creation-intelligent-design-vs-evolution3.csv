"05-01-2008","10438",3,"dace","310210","It may be that genes and brain cells are also necessary but insufficient to account for memory. All the evidence for the role of genes in the inheritance of forms and instincts is evidence as to necessity. So far as I know, no one has ever proposed a testable hypothesis that could verify or falsify the proposition that genes or brain cells are not only necessary but also sufficient to account for memory. The nonsense is entirely Falk's. Note that he never explains exactly what it is that's taught in high school biology that contradicts my statement. Evo-devo research has demonstrated that what counts is not so much the genes themselves but how they're used. Assuming that the knowledge of how to manipulate genes is not paradoxically encoded in the genes themselves, this implies the existence of endogenous intelligence at the cellular level. Complex systems, where living or merely lifelike, always emerge in whole, not in part. Complexity is fundamentally holistic. The shift to complexity in biological thinking represents a definitive rebuke of the reductionist interpretations that characterized 20th century theory. Of course, we could say that morphic resonance (i.e. formal similarity) is the mechanism by which current organisms tune in to their predecessors. I didn't use the word mechanism that way in this essay because I didn't want to create confusion by using the same word in two different ways. That there are no distant goals in evolution does not mean there are no immediate goals. The macaw wants to eat. To do so, it must crack a very hard nut. It thus develops its jaw muscles in order to achieve its goal. Nothing foolish about any of this. In fact, it's foolish to deny that evolution is driven, in part, by purpose and intelligence.","Peeling","310250","The short answer: gene splicing. I had a protracted discussion with WW about this very point: to induce a trait in a different species or organism it is necessary to transfer to that organism all the information necessary to yield the trait. Obviously, the organisms will already have a lot of non- trait-specific information in common, eg they employ the same cipher for translating DNA bases into amino acids and thus proteins. So what we're really asking is whether a given gene encapsulates all the novel information required for the trait to present. The success of gene splicing confirms that this is very often the case. Even where the transplanting of a single gene is insufficient, it seems reasonable to suppose that it is the unique physical context in which that gene is operating - the cogs with which it meshes in the original species - that yield function, rather than speculating that it indexes some metaphysical 'memory'. I don't know whether it's taught in high-school biology, but the primary faults in the (your?) reasoning are common wrong-turns made by critics of evolutionary theory: the false assumption of constancy, and the construction of an implausible starting scenario. In the scenario as presented, the macaw is the only variable. Right from the start it is faced with the problem of an incredibly tough nut, which it must somehow eat. Thus you engineer an insurmountable problem for evolution to solve: a non-viable animal which must within its own lifetime become viable. Taking the assumption of constancy first - why are you assuming that back in the day when macaws lacked their formidable jaw strength, the nuts they had to eat were as tough as they are now? Why would they need to be that rugged and over-engineered if nothing in the environment poses them that great a threat? Remove the assumption of constancy and we see an evolutionary arms-race: the toughest nuts from one generation surviving to grow, yielding a next generation of tougher-nutted plants, in turn favouring the macaws with the strongest jaws, who breed to produce a stronger-jawed macaw population - and so on. Secondly, is your starting scenario a sensible one? For the macaw species to have survived long enough to evolve that far, there must be other things around it can and has been eating! If all those food sources suddenly disappeared, we know what would happen: extinction. We don't need to find ways to improve evolution's ability to solve your problem, because your problem is fundamentally flawed. Why would that be a paradox? Have you never bought anything that came with an instruction manual? I have a child seat for my car with the instructions printed on the side - where's the paradox? Even that is underselling the potential for genes to regulate themselves and each other. They are not words on paper but chemically active compounds: they can directly alter the function of their biological context without that biological context needing to know 'how', or make any kind of decision on the matter. This is another common logical failure, similar to that responsible for the myth that 'Irreducible Complexity' is a problem for evolution. Just because a complex system is holistic doesn't mean it couldn't previously have been a simpler (or in the case of IC systems, more complex) holistic system in the past. What is a vital role now may at one time have been an unintended by-product of a quite different process - a by-product which opportunistic evolution made use of, to the point where the role is now indespensible. Such 'resonance' is trivial to debunk. Carry out a fluctuation test on a batch of bacteria. Now do it again on another batch. If morphic resonance could inform the second batch they ought to do better - they don't. Even at the theoretical level, the notion of morphic resonance is irretrievably flawed. At any given instant, the molecular configuration of one bacterium will be entirely unlike that of even its immediate neighbour, let alone some previous generation, so what exactly is supposed to be resonating? If you invoke the idea of conceptual resonance to solve that problem, you still haven't provided a place for the metaphysical rubber to hit the physical road. See above. I wouldn't go so far as to call it foolishness, but there is a failure on your part to critically examine your assumptions. Now that is true. Sexual selection, migration, intelligently exploiting niches using what nature has given you - all these factors guide evolution.

I need a computer to view 4Forums. Does this mean 4Forums is contained within my computer? Of course not. It's a simple question of logic. Maybe all the information does lie within the gene. But from a scientific standpoint, it hasn't been proven. Calling it metaphysical is begging the question. If natural memory is real, then it's not ""metaphysical."" My example is simplified for the sake of brevity. Of course, the nuts are also evolving, and the macaw has other food sources. The question is how this evolutionary arms race proceeds. Does natural selection operate in tandem with random mutation or adaptive mutation? Does the adaptation need to be expressed at the genetic level, or can somatic changes, through a process of morphogenetic memory, directly influence the forms and instincts of descendants? If not, is there an intelligence operating at the cellular level which is sensitive to the survival needs of the whole organism? Or is there some kind of mechanical process such as Darwin's pangenesis that allows somatic information to enter the germline? Nobody knows the answers to these questions. It's all up in the air. That's the thing about science. We can imagine we know the answers, but in the end science kicks us in the XXX. The instruction manual for the child seat works precisely because there is an intelligent agent, i.e. you, that interprets it. So this analogy is not helpful to the point you're trying to make. In the old days it was assumed that DNA contains the blueprint or recipe of the organism and that the application of this blueprint was a strictly mechanical process. Now we see that developmental genes are virtually identical in everything from flies to people. What really counts is the way genes are used rather than their content. So now we need an instructional manual on how to properly implement the blueprint. If the manual is embedded within the DNA itself, how is the DNA able to read it? Presumably the instructions for reading the manual would also be contained within the manual. Perhaps there's another manual that explains how to read the first manual, and then yet another manual to explain how to read that one, and so on, ad infinitum. This is the fallacy of the homunculus. Even without the question of the instructional manual, the idea that organisms require a kind of blueprint in order to be formed is already an example of the homunculus fallacy. After all, if an organism needs a blueprint in order to be assembled, wouldn't the blueprint also need a blueprint? Of course, now that we understand the stupendous complexity in the operation of genes, the whole issue has been rendered moot. The point of reductionism is that a complex process is ""reduced"" to a simple process. Yet the operation of genes turns out to be as complex as any process in the body, including the brain. In short, biological reductionism is as dead as the mechanistic creationism that inspired it. The search for the sources of evolutionary novelty in genetic mutations, remixing, drift, etc., is no longer viable, as the entire theoretical framework of epigenetic development has been abolished. Let's take the example of a tornado. One moment there's no tornado, just a massive gradient between warm air on the ground and cool air in the sky. The next thing you know, a tornado has emerged fully formed, seemingly out of nowhere, and begins efficiently wiping out the temperature gradient. It's not as if the tornado emerged from the dust particles of which it is composed or a smaller proto-tornado. Organisms aren't built up from DNA any more than tornadoes are built up from dust. This is what I mean when I say that complex systems are holistic, not reductionist. Why should the second batch do any better? Unless there's a survival issue involved, the second batch should take exactly as long as the first. The most recent test I'm aware of that confirms morphic resonance was carried out by Rupert Sheldrake and Steven Rose on chicks who received food after pecking at LEDs of a particular color. Only those who pecked at the ""correct"" color (yellow) were rewarded. Each batch of chicks, unrelated to the previous batch, learned to peck at the yellow diodes more quickly. Shockingly, Dr. Rose refused to concede the results of his own experiment. He came in convinced that each batch of chicks would perform no better than previous batches, and he came out no less convinced. Though science follows the evidence, scientists sometimes do not. What resonates is the whole form, not the material constituents. In contrast to artificial memory, which reduces to stored material configurations, natural memory is holistic, operating on the basis of morphological similarity. I tune into my ancestors because we have a similar overall form, not because we have the same chemical constituents. Incidentally, the point you make about chemical individuality in organisms is precisely the point made by the revered embryologist Paul Weiss when he coined the term morphogenetic field. What endures in the organism is overall pattern, not molecular details. The field has causal primacy, directing molecules towards its own end. Sheldrake adds to this notion the idea that morphogenetic fields contain an inherent memory on the basis of which they direct molecular activity. Thus life is fundamentally conservative, continually mimicking its past states, with evolution as the exception that proves the rule.

Arguing against something because ""it hasn't been proven"" even though the huge plethora of evidence unfailingly supports it? That's idiotic. We haven't proven that the earth revolves around the sun, therefore we aren't justified in accepting the boatloads of evidence that it does? This is the logic you're encouraging. Furthermore, you're introducing a supposition that has no evidential support in order to posit an explanation with no evidential or logical support. Occam's razor is well-known for a reason. You don't get to make up problems that don't exist so that you can shoehorn your pet idea into scientific discussion. Who's banning it? If your assertion is that cells have intelligence, you have to support the assertion with evidence. Apparently, an unsourced, casual synopsis of an experiment that lacks important details passes in your world as evidence. You clearly have no understanding of the nature of science. You think that this test -- that is, if we assume that this summary from an apparently scientifically illiterate obfuscate is accurate -- actually supports the idea of ""morphic resonance""? What the hell? Looks like a test for color-blindness. Or ability to be classically conditioned. Just for you, I read up on this on Sheldrake's own site. Rose disagreed with Sheldrake's interpretation of the data, so they sent the data to a third party for an analysis. The unbiased analysis says the same thing that Rose does, and goes so far as to state that Sheldrake's misrepresentation of the data is ""obscuring"" the fact that the data doesn't support the hypothesis of morphic resonance. It's like dealing with wabbit all over again: scientifically illiterate, uneducated of the facts, and damn sure he's right despite the evidence to the contrary.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","11:48 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","36"

It's interesting that in all the pointless ad hominem attacks on me in response to my post, no one mentioned an obvious mistake I made. It's been several years since I've looked over the data, and in my dim recollection, I reversed a key point. Pecking the yellow LED was followed by injection of a saline solution, causing an unpleasant association with the yellow LED. (I wrote that there was a pleasant association with the yellow LED). Rose predicted that subsequent batches of chicks, having no experience with the yellow LED, would be no more averse to it than prior batches. Sheldrake predicted that subsequent batches would be influenced by the experience of previous batches through a kind of collective memory he calls morphic resonance. It turned out that subsequent batches were significantly more averse to the yellow LED. At this point, Rose backed out of his agreement to publish the results together with Sheldrake, so Sheldrake had to publish the results on his own. Then Rose ran a rebuttal in which he tried to explain away the results.

"05-03-2008","10438",3,"Symbiote","310328","please provide a link to studies you reference where possible, or at the very least reference them in an appropriate style so that at least those of us with access to online journals can track them down. Most of what you say is mystical nonsense, you claim to be making scientific claims, but use vague quasi-spiritual terms to describe actions and realities, for example you say you ""tune into your ancestors"" without explaining what, if anything, that means. Oh and by the way, ""memory"" occurs in the most basic sense at the cellular level. For example, brain cells adaptively respond to electrical charges like those they would normally be exposed to in their natural environment (the brain) by altering in response to those charges such that their response to those particular charges increases in future. Whether you therefore want to term such cells ""intelligent"" is up to you - the response of brain cells is quite mechanical and can be wholly explained in terms of their physical composition. But then again, so can a cluster of these cells, or indeed the operation of the brain as a whole. I will remain unconvinced in non-physical explanations of behaviour until they can be demonstrated - if cells begin changing without prior physical cause, or electrical charges spring into existence from nothing, or molecules of sodium materialise from the nether. Until such things are found, there will be no evidence that the spirit-world can create change in the physical world.","dace","310351","4Forums doesn't allow links until you've written ten posts. So I can't provide links to the Rose-Sheldrake experiment. No doubt Rose would like the whole episode to vanish, and he provides no information on it. But you can find it all on Rupert Sheldrake's website. Under articles and papers, click on scientific papers. Then click on morphic resonance. There are three relevant papers in this list: An Experimental Test of the Hypothesis of Formative Causation Rupert Sheldrake Biology Forum (1992) 85,(3/4), 431-443 So-called ""formative causation"" - a hypothesis disconfirmed Steven Rose Biology Forum (1992) 85,(3/4), 445-453 Rose refuted Rupert Sheldrake Biology Forum (1992) 85,(3/4), 455-460 By all means read all three papers. Rose doesn't have a case. That you would employ the term ""vague"" is ironic since your comment itself is too vague to have any meaning. Only specific critical comments have meaning. Clearly, I explain what ""tune into your ancestors"" means. In order to respond effectively, you must make an effort to understand what you're responding to. That neurons adapt by altering responses to electrical charges is precisely what we would expect if neurons play a role in memory. This does not mean memory literally exists in the neuron or their connections to other neurons. That networks of neurons are necessary for memory does not mean they're sufficient. To assume sufficiency from necessity is a classic error of logic. Memory is the influence of the past. In other words, causality operates from the deep past as well as the immediate past. Biology reveals action-at-a-distance over time (memory) as clearly as astronomy reveals action-at-a-distance over space (gravity). If by ""mechanical"" you mean deterministic, this is certainly incorrect. The brain's behavior is probabilistic, allowing for influence from the brain's morphogenetic fields, also known as the mind. Your failure to understand what I'm saying results in meaningless comments like this.

This amounts to the standard conspiracy theory nonsense. Are you kidding? Even after reading Sheldrake's ""refutation"" of Rose, the original paper is still the most convincing document he has, and Rose and Bateson both countered it. (I particularly like how Sheldrake attacks Rose's observation that the chicks seemed attracted initially to the yellow diode more than to the bead not as false but as unexplained, as if that somehow undermines anything Rose said.) The only things that Sheldrake's ""refutation"" conveyed to me were that (1) he's incredibly fast to attribute anything to ""morphic resonance"" -- see all the ""maybe [this] is morphic resonance"" and ""maybe [that] is morphic resonance"" -- and (2) the experiment was set up in such a way that the experimenter's practices had extreme effects; why weren't the beads locked in place but interchangeable?

"05-06-2008","10438",3,"Symbiote","310367","I have no idea how you ""tune"", do you need to meditate, or do the voices in your head tell you what to do without you needing to ask? And you seem to believe that chicks can learn from being in the same cage that others were that were not ancestors, but supposedly also things can learn from ancestors which are not in the same place. In fact it seems that morphological resonance occurs wherever you can imagine it does, and whenever it isn't needed somewhere, it pops up somewhere else, like a game of whack a mole, impossible to pin down. So everything influenced by the past has memory. But neurons, which are influenced by the past, do not have memory. How convenient it is when words you are using don't mean anything. Or mean two contradictory things at the same time. Ok, so you believe that everything that happens in the brain is deterministic, so you can't actually pinpoint any non-deterministic effects, but you want the brain to be non-deterministic anyway. Show me one of these so-called ""probabilistic"" events in the brain, show me a neuron which might fire, or then again might not, under the same physical conditions. No such probabilistic events occur. One neuron, two neuron, three neuron or four, it doesn't matter how many you add together, they don't start becoming ""probabilistic"". Actually you have it entirely backwards champ, neurons are not necessary for memory, many other memory systems will suffice. But they are sufficient. As I have already explained to you, even a SINGLE neuron ""remembers"" the charges it is exposed to. There isn't anything probabilistic about it, there isn't a Ghost Pirate at the wheel, or a Magic 8-Ball telling it what to do, it just does it, because that's the way a neuron is constructed - to be influenced by the past.","dace","310493","Resorting to meaningless ad hominem comments not only demonstrates a lack of character but that you don't have any real arguments to make. This is the kind of thing you say when you're intellectually bankrupt. If my message is so nonsensical that it indicates possible psychosis, why would you even bother responding? Perhaps you just like to show off. As a bully, you enjoy demonstrating your superiority, though of course this is entirely delusional. Once again, you've demonstrated a failure of comprehension. If you had taken the trouble to try to understand what you're attacking, I wouldn't have to explain this simple point. As I stated in my paper and in follow-up reports on this bulletin board, morphic resonance is a kind of memory that operates on the basis of similarity. Though organisms are obviously similar to their ancestors, they can resonate with any past creature that is similar. Direct lineage is not required. Interestingly, this is not the case in quantum physics. When two photons are separated out from a beam of light, they are entangled, meaning that if one photon is disturbed, the other photon, no matter how far away, will exhibit exactly the same disturbance. Thus the photons ""remember"" that they were once united. But there's no such thing as similarity in quantum physics. All photons are identical, as are all electrons, etc. In physics, natural memory is revealed through lineage, while in biology, mere similarity enables resonance across time. Impossible to pin down if you never bother to understand the theory. Once you get it, then of course there's no problem pinning down where resonance occurs and where it does not. Of course neurons have memory. They have the memory of how to operate as neurons. By operating correctly, they facilitate both conscious and unconscious memory. But this doesn't mean the neuron's memory is located within the neuron itself. The only things you'll ever find in a neuron are chemicals and electrical pulses. Memory is an expression of time, not matter. Rather than containing memory, living bodies are only influenced by it. This is no different than saying gravity is an expression of space, not massive bodies, and that the behavior of planets is only influenced by gravity rather than literally containing it. (Search all you want. You will find only atoms and molecules of various kinds, not ""gravity""). To say that the concept of memory is inherently mystical or unscientific is to say that the concept of gravity is inherently mystical or unscientific, which by the way, is precisely what Leibniz said when Newton unveiled his theory over three centuries ago. Leibniz was wrong. Newton was right. And how convenient it is to simply dismiss a proposal rather than taking the trouble to understand it. Where do I claim that what happens in the brain is deterministic? Once again, you're revealing an inability or unwillingness to follow my argument. This is pure fantasy. You're way out of the loop here. It's well known that the brain is the most complex system in the known universe. Like all complex systems, the brain is nonlinear, meaning that a minuscule event can have huge repercussions. Like the weather, which is also nonlinear, the behavior of the brain cannot be predicted with 100% confidence. As I have already explained to you, that neurons exhibit a kind of mechanical memory does not mean their activity is sufficient to account for conscious and unconscious memory. The brain may simply be facilitating memory, much as a tuner facilitates radio reception. It's a fundamental point of logic, and disagreeing with logic is generally not a good idea. It's odd that you claim neurons are not necessary for memory. Neurons are implicated in all brain activities, including those that facilitate memory. electrolyte writes: Quote: Originally Posted by dace ""You're referring to P Bateson, whose analysis, as Sheldrake demonstrates, was indeed biased.

Rose and Sheldrake got together to perform an experiment on memory in chicks. Each batch of chicks was conditioned to associate pecking yellow LEDs with an unpleasant sensation. Rose predicted that any given batch of chicks would show no difference in pecking behavior relative to prior batches. Sheldrake predicted that once a batch of chicks had been conditioned to be averse to yellow LEDs, subsequent chicks would demonstrate an initial bias against yellow LEDs, and that this bias would increase with each new batch. The result was that subsequent batches of chicks demonstrated a significant initial bias against yellow LEDs. The more batches that were tested, the stronger the bias. This bias was much stronger than what the control group demonstrated. Rose was privy to same numbers as Sheldrake. He just didn't want to admit he got it wrong. However, that Sheldrake's prediction was correct doesn't mean that memory operates holistically on the basis of similarity. It only means exactly what I said it means, that Sheldrake's prediction was correct. Perhaps there was something wrong with the experiment. What we really need is replications. We need more experiments along these lines. Since you and Symbiote don't seem to grasp the issues at stake here, let me try to bring you up to speed. Biology is in a state of crisis. It was long believed that organisms are ""reducible"" to genes (and the complex of proteins that accompany genes). But this notion was predicated on the idea that genes are simple units of information whose expression automatically results in organisms. Now it turns out that genes are not simple at all. The genome undergoes incredibly complex operations, so complex that they are beyond computation. Thus, instead of reducing something complex to something simple, we are reducing something complex to something else complex. The entire basis of genetic reduction has been swept away. We no longer have a viable theory of development from the egg. But there's a much deeper problem to reductionist biology. In order to have a science of life, we must be able to account for such factors as conscious self-existence, the unconscious mind, purpose, intelligence, feeling, experience, etc. Instead, reductionism posits that organisms are machines and that all nonmechanistic features of life are illusory. Yet the mind is self-evident. We begin with a recognition of the mind and from there assume that our perception of physical reality is essentially correct. But the only thing we know for sure is that mind is real. Reductionism was never a sensible or logical approach, so it's no surprise that molecular biology has now rendered it obsolete. It was only a matter of time before the methodology of science exposed the failed philosophy underpinning modern biology. This is why the notion of holistic memory is significant. If memory is a property of nature, then organisms can inherit morphological and behavioral information directly from their predecessors on the basis of similarity. Rather than being built by genes from the ground up, organisms self-organize on the basis of how their predecessors lived. As the organism develops, each system - - be it chromosome, cell, tissue, organ, organ system or body - - simply mimics what its kind has been doing for eons. This is crucial in the evolution debate, because it means adaptations do not have to find their way into our genes before they can be passed on. Thus we can return to Darwin's original commonsense view of evolution, according to which organisms make adaptations to their environment and, if successful, pass along those adaptations to offspring. A commonsense view of evolution will have far more strength to withstand creationist attack than the unwieldy theory we've been stuck with since the 30s. Of course, I've already explained all this in the essay posted at the top of this thread as well as in subsequent posts. I will not be explaining it again. If you and Symbiote are too dogmatic to participate in scientific discussion, that's your problem, not mine.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","01:27 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","42"

So if somebody disagrees, he's a biased reductionist. This amounts to the standard conspiracy theory nonsense. >>> This is the fallacy of guilt by association. By falsely claiming that I propose some kind of conspiracy theory, you can dismiss my views without actually investigating them. Biology is in a state of crisis. As I have already explained to you, that neurons exhibit a kind of mechanical memory does not mean their activity is sufficient to account for conscious and unconscious memory. Let me make this as plain as I can. Biology is in a state of crisis. It was long believed that organisms are ""reducible"" to genes .... Now it turns out that genes are not simple at all. The entire basis of genetic reduction has been swept away.","electrolyte","310519","Well, you've committed a fallacy all right... You've asserted that the analysis was biased with your ""evidence"" being your assertion that a bias exists. I have not committed the fallacy of guilt by association; I'm exposing your reasoning that is basically the no-true-Scotsman fallacy. Falsely? You just up and said that a reductionist bias pervades biology. Are you claiming exemption from ""conspiracy theory"" status because you think that the bias is subconscious? And I did investigate them, dace. I specifically said that I went through and read the info on the experiment. How in the hell can you accuse me of refusing to investigate? Do you really have no problem with shameless lying? Ah, apparently you have no problem at all with shameless lying. And as has already been explained to you, this is not sufficient reason to attribute a characteristic for which there is insufficient evidence. ""Just because the evidence says [this] doesn't mean that our explanation is complete"" is a valid observation, but ""just because the evidence says [this] means it's reasonable to positively assert incompletion based on vacuous evidence that something else is at work"" is a violation of Occam's razor. By repeating what I've already read, complete with your spin? Look, I can read, but my questions weren't answered. As somebody quite educated about science, my questions are topical and substantive, and they demand an answer for a reasonable interpretation of the recountings. You say that Rose had the same numbers. Sheldrake said that Rose didn't have the same numbers. Are you knowingly lying, or are you talking out of your XXX because you really don't know? I really see no alternative. And who learned this? Biologists. So, no, there's no state of crisis at all. You must really enjoy talking out of your XXX. Just because there's not a one-to-one relationship between genes and traits doesn't negate what we've learned about genetics and expression. What becomes clear upon reading your tripe is that you're really just hellbent on attacking reductionism. That's your right. You seem to think that cellular processes happen because similar processes happened in the past. Then why can't humans synthesize vitamin C? Our ancestors could. Why did that trait go away? According to your cockamamie balderdash about morphogenetic fields, a mutation wouldn't effect this, because the correct amino acid would mystically be placed in the correct position. It's not, which is a hurdle that your mystics cannot overcome. Please go read about Occam's razor; you can come back when you've realized how idiotic it is to take your insistence of incompletion based on ignorance and shoehorn fantasy into cellular biology. Meanwhile, I'll get back to work teaching my students about how chemistry actually explains phenomena.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","05:41 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","45"
