Why do developing organisms recap, to a degree, their phylogenetic history? This is a total mystery to reductionist biology, as I discuss in my paper <snip> Mutations that streamline embryogenesis thereby reducing the time and energy requirements of gestation ought to be environmentally selected right along with those that beneficially alter the adult body. Do we really need a swimbladder and fins in the womb? Cant we just bypass all that and go directly to human form?","Peeling","310789","As it turns out, genetics has everything to say on this subject. It positively predicts O.R.P. The logic is simple: at any given point in the embryonic developmental process, what happens next is a transformation of what is already there. It's like a set of directions to a destination: first left, straight on for two miles, turn right, etc. Let's imagine we have a set of directions that takes us from 'zygote' to 'fish', and let's also imagine the formation of a swim bladder occurs fairly early on in those directions. Now imagine we experience a series of mutations that changes our ultimate destination - now our directions take us from 'zygote' to 'amphibian'. But we're still going via 'swimbladder', so we still end up with one. Can a further mutation eliminate the formation of the swim bladder? Not if the creature's mutated genes only tell it how to get to 'amphibian' from 'embryo with swim bladder'. You would need an impossibly unlikely confluence of multiple mutations: eliminating the swim bladder and rewriting all the subsequent developmental process to still reach a viable end product, all in a single step. Once the developmental dependency stage has passed, however, the otherwise useless swim-bladder (or tail, say) can be subject to atrophy and reabsorption. Mutations which cause this will be beneficial and selected for. In short, then, genetics predicts we should see a spectrum of such features in embryonic development: features upon which no subsequent development critically depends that have disappeared entirely, features which appear during development, hang around long enough for the processes that depend upon them to complete, and then get reabsorbed, and features which, though useless in themselves, are so integral to the subsequent developmental processes that they cannot be mutated away.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","07:42 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","76"
"05-11-2008","10438",6,"Peeling","310685","Originally Posted by dace: ""Morphic resonance neither discerns nor equivocates. A natural form of memory, it retrieves past organic form on the basis of similarity to current organic form."" To retrieve past organic form on the basis of similarity, it must discern between the non-similar and equivocate the similar. The trouble is, you have no consistent definition of 'similar'. Two seperate species of bacteria are far more similar to each other than you are to your immediate ancestor. So I ask again: how can morphic resonance be at the same time so discerning as to only equivocate between bacteria of the same species, yet so loose as to permit resonance between you and your mother? Originally Posted by dace: ""Fine molecular details do not propagate via morphic resonance. Only general forms propagate."" Again, inconsistent. If you're right and only 'general forms' propagate thus, Sheldrake was completely wasting his time testing those chicks - the tiny neurological differences present in a yellow LED-averse chick could never propagate via morphic resonance into another chick. Originally Posted by dace: ""A species is, in essence, a collective pool of memory. Once a population has its own pool of memory, it's a species."" Which throws another spanner into your works. According to you, morphic resonance tells an organism what shape to be. But the novel trait that has made this population a new species only informs a small part of that organism's form, yes? A longer neck, webbed toes, whatever. But now the resonance with the ancestral species is broken, what tells the rest of the organism what shape to be? Epigenetic inheritance is integral - that's why you can't grow a baby in a test-tube: you need the biological systems of the mother - and essential nutrients, the production of which is inherited in different species entirely - to regulate and cooperate in its development. Life has grown into a tangled web indeed, but we don't need morphic resonance to explain it.","dace","310792","That's like saying for a receiver to pick up a signal from a transmitter, it must discern between non-similar frequencies and equivocate similar frequencies. You're anthropomorphizing, a common mistake among reductionists, who claim that DNA is like a book and the body a machine. Reductionism is in fact a modern form of anthropomorphosis, projecting our technological mindset onto nature much as Paley did 200 years ago. There's nothing remotely like intelligence in morphic resonance or any other kind of resonance. This is not to deny the possibility of nonhuman intelligence, only that morphic resonance is about memory, not intelligence. What matters is the degree of similarity relative to the differences. If the differences are tiny, then resonance will occur only among very close similarities. This is presumably what would happen naturally, without any intelligent intervention. Nature doesn't discriminate against the very small. What the experiment seemed to show is that changes in neural resting states propagated to subsequently tested chicks via morphic resonance. Each pool of memory is a subset of a larger pool. Perhaps a better metaphor would be the parts of a tree. The trunk is the set of memory shared by all living things. One of the boughs emerging from the trunk is the set of memory shared by all animals.

Schlitz announced that she got the same results, while the ideologue Wiseman, to his discredit, tried to prevaricate. Yet the numbers are there. No one wants to replicate Sheldrake's experiments because he's a taboo figure, and as Freud pointed out, when you touch the taboo, you become the taboo. Steven Rose had to apply seriously deceptive analysis in order to remove all sign of inherited aversion among chicks, and no one wants to have to go through that headache. And then of course there's no money in it. You're not gonna get a grant testing for morphic resonance, not only because dogmatic, blinkered biologists would raise a stink but because biology as it currently exists isn't really about understanding life. It's about getting grant money to learn how to re-engineer it. What diseases will be cured from understanding the holistic nature of life? How will this knowledge help us incorporate more herbicides into our crops? That's the kind of thing biology deals with. Sheldrake is to biology what Chomsky is to US foreign policy.

This is because what keeps the melting points the same for perennial chemicals is not some abstract, timeless law of physics but simply the force of memory acting on the crystals. He gives many more examples and notes the well known fact that such increases don't occur with long-established chemicals. Such as literally every single fluid in the body. Blood, saliva, bile, mucus, you name it. Every single one. They're all like that. They all reveal huge chemical variation from person to person, including genetically identical twins. Same genes, different chemistry. How does a reductionist explain that?","electrolyte","310796","I'll digress from roasting the absurdity of philosophical claims like substances' having memory that only exists after some unknown and unpredictable period of time to stick to actual science, of which dace is apparently terribly unaware. You should know better than to discuss biochemistry and chemistry with somebody who has a degree in biochemistry and teaches chemistry. (But then, you should know a lot of things that you don't.) The temperature of phase changes are determined by the strengths of the intermolecular forces of a substance. The melting point of a pure substance is the temperature at which the average particle has sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the intermolecular forces that prevent that particle from moving within the lattice structure of the solid. We expect the apparent melting points of substances to change as we get better at producing the substance with fewer contaminants and in a more stable arrangement of molecules. Amorphous silicon dioxide has a melting point different than crystalline silicon dioxide's due to the optimized intermolecular forces within the crystalline structure. If melting points were based on the ""force of memory"" on the ""crystals,"" you'd be able to take crystalline SiO2, melt it, cool it quickly, and then heat it to that same melting temperature before it melts. You won't. Cooling it quickly results in irregular arrangement of the covalent network, which reduces the melting point. See glass transition . Add to this the fact that introducing impurities into substances lowers their melting points (a colligative property with the technical name that even you can understand: freezing point depression), and the increases that we see make sense without invoking magical molecular memory. You mean chemicals for which we've had good purification techniques for as long as we've had accurate and precise temperature measurement techniques? Because I'm willing to bet that this is the case. Does your hero actually name these chemicals, or does he do the cowardly vague allusion with no evidence again? But they're not ""wildly variable."" Blood is blood, bile is bile, and you don't find bile picking up on the vibes from blood and deciding to haul around some oxygen for a while. I already told you that similar reactions can occur even with different substances; why do you think that my blood -- which is nearly identical to your blood -- wouldn't react the same way to carbon dioxide without magical memory? If I construct a heme group complete with iron from scratch, do you think it wouldn't bind oxygen because it hasn't been exposed to my blood's magical memory?","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","08:52 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","81"

Function does not imply intelligence. No, I'm not. You are engaging in semantic quibbling, a pursuit you will have to undertake solo, I fear, since I have no patience for it. I couldn't make much sense of that at first, but I eventually decided what you must have meant is that the degree of similarity relative to the potential scope for difference between two things is what counts. So two bacteria, which can differ to a lesser extent than two humans, enjoy a more sharply focused morphic resonance. Superficially that sounds reasonable, but in reality it's deeply flawed. If you ask me how different two creatures could be, why should I assume you mean 'while both still being bacteria'? Why isn't the scope species, genera, the whole scope of life itself? And given that we classify creatures as bacteria based on their similarity in the first place, what possible answer has the question ""How different could those two creatures be while still being similar?"" It's circular nonsense. It showed no such thing, because the batches of chicks never demonstrated any increased aversion to the yellow LED. Again, I urge you to reread the paper more carefully. Well, yes - that's genetics for you. The point is very much here and there. To give birth to a healthy baby a mother must consume certain nutrients, nutrients produced by other species.

However, the idea that eliminating phylogenetic recapitulation in the womb would require ""an impossibly unlikely confluence of multiple mutations"" sounds suspiciously like Michael Behe's claim that a complex system such as the eye could not possibly have evolved in a single step. In fact, the eye did not have to evolve in a single step. Its various elements could have played useful roles before the organ as a whole coalesced. Nor do I buy the argument that a swimbladder or gills or any of that other fishy stuff is so integral to embryonic development that multiple simultaneous mutations would be required to streamline it out of the picture. I'm with Darwin on this one. What drives novelty in behavior and body is primarily the adaptations made by organisms themselves in response to the outer environment and only secondarily the ""spontaneous variations"" in ""germ-plasm"" buried deep in their cells. The reason the embryo doesn't streamline its development is that it faces no survival pressure in the womb. Thus the occasional random genetic mutation might cause some streamlining, but otherwise embryogenesis stays the same. Darwin's explanation strikes me as more elegant and compelling than the predictably unwieldy neo-Darwinian explanation. By the way, you've anthropomorphized twice in your post, once with the use of the term, ""rewriting,"" implying that DNA is something like a ""book of life"" or ""recipe,"" and also with your use of the concept of directions, implying that DNA is essentially a map of development. If so, then there must be a reader or interpreter of this book/recipe/map, which brings us back to the homunculus. Now, I realize perhaps you're just stating it this way for the sake of clarity. Still, I have to wonder if all this habitual anthropomorphizing colors our perception of biological processes.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","04:27 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","86"
"05-12-2008","10438",6,"Collin","310791","Proof doesn't exist in science. I'm surprised someone at your level is even confusing the deductive logic used in philosophy with the inductions drawn in science. Science works like this: Hypothesis: The data shows A. It appears as though B is true. Prediction*: If B is true, then we should not observe C and/or we should observe D. Conclusion**: We did not observe C and/or we did observe D. Therefore, B is probably true. *As you can see, the prediction is the only section of the scientific process that ever relies on deductive logic. Modus tollens is the most common operation here, in that it's often a necessary condition of the hypothesis that certain data does not appear, because if that data does appear, it contradicts the hypothesis and shows it to be false. **You will also note that the conclusion is deductively flawed. Fulfilling all necessary conditions for the hypothesis does not make the truth of the hypothesis deductively sufficient. Instead, what happens is that the hypothesis will offer a series of deductions, and if none of a giant list of necessary conditions is ever contradicted, then the conclusions can safely follow probably , or inductively. Stop lingering on meaningless concepts like ""proof"" in science. As Francis Bacon noted centuries ago, logical deduction is a chain that prohibits science from advancing. Our newfound reliance on inductive reasoning is what allowed the scientific enlightenment. Getting back to the point now: What this means is that you are wrong. Induction often allows ""some"" to be extrapolated to ""all."" Hence, the scientific process itself allows ""some"" to be extrapolated to ""all."" It is by no means necessary to demonstrate that intelligence cannot exist on any other level except in brains. As far as the science goes, you're the one with the burden of proof here.","dace","310863","Keep in mind that the issue here is whether intelligence can exist at the cellular level. My point was that once you allow for the concept of intelligence at any biological level, the door has been opened for it to be applied at any other level. The only way to negate this view is to somehow prove that brains are necessary for intelligence, an impossible task. So my point stands. My view of how science works is a little different than yours. While studying an anomaly, you get in intuition as to how the problem might be solved. You state your intuition in the form of a hypothesis that can be tested either against historical data or new data generated through experimentation. The test can either provisionally verify your hypothesis or definitively falsify it. There is thus no positive proof, only negative proof. Proof is a mathematical concept. It was smuggled into science back in the days when science was little more than highly abstract mathematical physics. For Galileo, Descartes and Newton, it's all in the equations. Newton was a modern day Plato, except that instead of positing timeless, immaterial Forms that correspond to every intelligible material form, Newton posited equally timeless, immaterial Laws whose operations on matter bring on the familiar forms of material existence. Either way, you have a dualistic worldview in which physics is divided between passive matter on the one hand and deterministic laws on the other. The proof, it was thought, was in the math. Over time, many discoveries have abolished the modified Platonism of early science. With the convertability of matter and energy, we can no longer accept the notion of a purely passive matter being operated on by timeless ""laws."" Instead what we have is process and complexity. There's neither a Form of ""tornado"" nor a set of laws that compel the ""tornado"" to come into existence. A tornado is a self-organized system that spontaneously emerges in the process of the separation of cold and warm air. Like an organism, tornadoes do not defy physical laws, but neither are they explained by these laws. Moreover, natural laws seem to be time-based, not descended from some eternal heavenly realm. There are no laws of motion without motion and no motion without time. It now appears that the so-called fundamental constants of nature can alter over time. For instance, the alpha constant, the electromagnetic force that holds matter together, seems to have altered over the course of cosmic evolution. Evolution itself is a strictly time-based concept and implies genuine novelty in the universe. The idea that the laws of physics are more like habits, meaning that they can evolve over time, was first proposed by Darwin's contemporary, the American philosopher CS Peirce. Since then, there's been a kind of culture war pitting those who accept the new ""holistic"" science based on time, process and evolution against those who cling to the ""reductionst"" science based on passive matter under the weight of deterministic law. Given that all the evidence is in favor of process science, the only explanation for the reactionary tendency is a psychological one. Reductionism used to be known as the ""grand doctrine"" (GD) because, at least in theory, it provided an explanation for all quantifiable phenomena. Thus he who understands the GD is, in essence, master of the universe. Proponents of the GD cling to their model because it gives them a sense of authority. It's no accident that the GD is a direct descendant of mechanistic theology. Newton believed that God was the ultimate lawgiver. God created the universe and gave it the laws that have determined every event that has transpired since. The worldview of the GD is identical to this except that God has been airbrushed out. That the laws are now blind doesn't make them any less deterministic. With or without God, you've got a universe in which everything is completely under control, and true novelty is disallowed. Once we completely understand these laws, we are safe from surprises. By applying our knowledge of the laws, we merge with cosmic Authority. It's because the GD is based not on reason but on fear of uncertainty and the need for control that its proponents lash out hysterically against anyone who calls into question their blinkered worldview. Electrolyte is literally hysterical. He cannot even begin to engage, as Peeling has done, with my arguments. All he can do is misconstrue my words, denounce my mental state, and assert his fear-based assumptions as fact. For electrolyte, the point of being a scientist is not to understand nature but to establish himself as an authority figure. As the Authority, his word is sacrosanct. He speaks with the voice of nature itself. No matter how at odds with the facts, his words are true simply because he has uttered them. To take but one example, electrolyte casually denies my assertion of chemical heterogeneity in organisms and claims that the blood in one person's veins is essentially identical to the blood in anyone else's. Yet the fact of chemical heterogeneity in a wide range of bodily substances was firmly established decades ago by Roger Williams, who published the results of his studies in his book, Biochemical Individuality (1956). Williams notes wide ranges of chemical variability in brains, blood, bones, muscles and glands, in which the relative prevalence of chemicals commonly vary from person to person (and within the same person over time) by a factor of two and often as high as four to six. As Walter Elsasser notes, even within a single cell, no two regions demonstrate the same chemical makeup. In contrast to chemists, who purify their samples as thoroughly as possible, cells can tolerate heterogeneity because causal primacy in the cell does not reside at the chemical level. The source of electrolyte's confusion regarding biology is not simply his handicap as a chemist but his fear of a messy universe, a place where all sorts of things can happen, and nothing is under control. The deterministic nature of the universe, he believes, has long-since been proven, and anyone who doubts it is simply incapable of understanding science. Yet this is not science but a cult with a long lineage known since the 19th century as scientism. In contrast to scientism, where everything of consequence was proven long ago, real science is not so much about proving a postulate as determining what the default assumption ought to be. I make no claim of having proven that evolutionary novelty is driven primarily by heritable adaptations undertaken by the organism in its environmental context. I merely claim that this ought to be the default assumption until it's been disproved. I don't claim to have proven that an organism is a holistic system whose central properties are self-existence and self-determination. I merely claim that this ought to be the natural assumption for many reasons, not the least of which that it fits in with what is self-evident in our own experience as organisms. Even if you can't prove something difficult, at least endeavor to disclose what is obvious. This, by the way, is the aim of philosophy.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","07:07 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","87"

He places the term latency into context here: ""This increasing aversion in naive chicks should be measurable in terms of an increase in the time-lag between being exposed to the stimulus and pecking at it, or in other words an increasing latency."" Latency means the desire is there but hidden. The chick wants to peck but the beads but holds back due to aversion. A statistically significant increase in the latency of the test chicks relative to the controls means the test chicks showed greater aversion over time than the controls. This is what Sheldrake predicted on the basis of morphic resonance. The test chicks were influenced by previously tested chicks who had been injected with lithium chloride. Thus the previous chicks contributed to the memory pool while the latter ones drew from it (as well as reinforcing the trend). This is incorrect. Perhaps you're confused owing to the fact that at first both groups tended to peck more readily. Rose and Sheldrake agreed this was an artifact of the improving skills of the lab-tech. The student who actually ran the experiment needed a few trials to get the hang of it. By simply lopping off the first few trials, the trend toward increased aversion becomes clear. Absolutely not.

This is particularly true in this case. The fact that the properties of a computer can't be found at the level of a transistor does not mean that in all cases, including organisms, a property found at the whole cannot also be found in one of its parts. This is not even a serious proposition, particularly given the fact that organisms have a completely different relationship to their parts from machines. In machines, the whole is really nothing more than the parts all working together. The parts are built so as to fit the machine. As Kant pointed out, in organisms each part is both cause and effect, end and means of the operation of the whole. Parts and whole emerge together, that is, organically , rather than being stamped into place mechanistically. Oh, there's plenty of stuff on single celled organisms reacting intelligently to altered conditions. When their usual food source is removed, they simply adapt, producing a new enzyme with which they can digest a carbohydrate they hadn't relied on before. And of course there's the whole issue of how genes are operated, which turns out to be incredibly complex. Each developmental gene is preceded by bits of DNA called ""switches,"" or epigenetic tags, which can activate and deactivate the gene so it turns on at precisely the right moment in the developmental process. This is happening simultaneously to thousands of genes in a given cell at blinding speed, a jaw-droppingly complex procedure that seems to have no basis in any information contained within the genes. It's bad enough that the genes are supposed to direct the construction of a complete living organism, far worse that now they need another map just to properly negotiate their own operations. This has caught reductionists off guard. No one has any idea how the genome performs its miraculous feat. Hence the supposition of cellular intelligence. Perhaps the cell operates holistically, via what the great theorist and embryologist Paul Weiss dubbed a ""morphogenetic field"" which, according to Rupert Sheldrake, contains inherent memory. The cell field directs the operations of the genome, producing the proteins required for the developing matrix in which it is embedded. Of course, it's not much of an intelligence if all it has to do is make the same decision cells of its kind in similar situation have always made before. Not so much intelligence as memory. Nonetheless mentality is implicated at all levels of biological operation.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","11:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","90"
