Or are you again lying to the forum by implying that you have ever given me any sort of beat down? Oh I'm sorry, since may of 03, according to dsadevil, you have actually won one debate here. That's quite a record. You must be so proud. Anyway, I'm bored with your juvenile game of one upmanship. So as I'm sure you're very used to, and comfortable with, you can play with yourself from here on.","electrolyte","312695","""Threat of past violence""? Now there's something that's only effective in Archieland: ""I'm going to have already beaten you up, so watch out!"" No, seriously, I don't need to work any harder to show Archie's disconnect with reality. Not a lie at all. I could link readers to lots of examples, but all I really have to do is have them re-read this post. That's one formal debate. Also note that I've lost zero formal debates. I'd ask you to help me calculate that win percentage, but I worry that the math is too hard for you. So, we have shown that you either lie or make claims without checking them first, thereby confirming my assertion. It appears I could add another informal debate win tally if I actually kept up with such. Jealous? You came in here and badmouthed me , not the other way around. You go right ahead and scamper away with your tail between your legs; it's a shame you won't learn from this experience. And you call me juvenile? How pathetic.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","09:00 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","137"

I had to explain to him that Dace is a different breed, though closely related in that they both feel science should be conducted a priori . Mentioned his worshiping Sheldrake, and that was enough to end the conversation with an exasperated moan.","darwinism-creationism-3rd-pov-eam","08:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","139"
