No, because the flood makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. http://www.4forums.com/political/cre...-possible.html Do you realize you just proposed a double standard? Rage? Come again?

No. Mostly we have significant pity on you, as you believe something so detached from reality and yet cannot make the connection to how it makes your life a contradiction.

Tell me, what do you think of a person who calls physics wrong and does not understand what ""force"" is? What do you think of someone who calls geology wrong but doesn't know what a rock is? Do you think that someone who calls genetics false but cannot define what a gene is to understand the subject? You call evolution wrong, but have repeatedly shown you have absolutely no idea what it is. No it's not. All it is, is a measure of one group. And that group in total is only 2,100 members. There are 800 steves on the steve list with 51% being biologists. Are you seriously going to tell me that the NAS represents all biologists beliefs when the biologists belonging to the NAS are statistically tiny in comparison to all biologists? Let's see just how asinine your response will be. It is when you compare them to the general public stratified by education. Gallup did a poll on that around the same time. Hint: the more poor you are and the less educated, the more you believe in Creationism. Who called ID a conspiracy theory? Lying again eh Marc? ID as I pointed out is nothing more than animism. I see you refused to answer my question about Zeus. Tell me, how is ID fundamentally any different from Animism? What we cannot explain now is credited to a higher being. Replace lightning with eye and the argument is still the same. So what do you use to determine reality? If God said there were two suns, would you use your eyes and testable methods to determine if there were two suns or just believe God independent of the actual facts? God said pigs can fly! Therefore, reality has flying pigs. And some people are wrong. That was weak and you know it. Your critical thinking skills and basic knowledge are severely stunted. And that is likely due to lack of decent education. Simple fact of the matter is that you think you can discuss evolution without a slightest understanding of it. It's like calling physics all wrong without understanding what a force is. It's like calling genetics wrong without understanding what a gene is. It's like calling geology wrong but not knowing what a rock is. You don't understand, but your lack of education has prevented you from making the connection that sheer unbridled ignorance creates problems when one declared a subject they do not understand to be false.

Studies in biology should stop before that happens, shouldnt it? Some imperfect human interference must be happening. And atheism doesnt have a political agenda? You know it does. So we can agree that they both do. It would be nice if I could point out factual evidence of political action of atheism without another stronger, mocking term like conspiracy theory being used against me. Its a form of emotional shout-down, not honest debate. In terms of science they are, but in terms of philosophical applications of science, they are not. Surely youre kidding. We can make predictions about many things, most notably human behavior, by consulting subjects other than science. Unrevised history is a good one, some people believe a recognition of supernatural good & evil is another. What were doing here is discussing the APPLICATION of a subject, not necessarily the nuts and bolts of the subject itself. There is a big difference. A detailed knowledge of a subject isnt necessary to form an opinon on how far an application of that subject should go in politics. Atheists here seem to demand a detailed knowledge of science by Christians, yet they show a woefully inadequate knowledge of Christianity to disregard it to the extent that they do. Its wrong in that it cant go on indefinately. Two opposing viewpoints cant claim studies of the same subject increase proof for BOTH VIEWS forever. If neither of them eventually fails, its clear that neither of them are accomplishing anything. There are several messages when it comes to origins of life - Stenger/Dawkins has one, Miller has one, Behe/Dembski has one. All three are blends of science and philosophy, but all three are philosophical enough so that a neutral scientific community should treat them equally, and they dont. If a young person is deciding which one to persue, a consultation of the scientific community would be a logical way to help them make their decision. That young person shouldnt see winking an nodding going on with one philosophy, and condemnation of another.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","10:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","54"

Is there really a difference? But since atheism claims all naturalism proves its concept, it really has a big advantage with science, doesnt it? It has a much politically easier time leaving the neutral area of actual science. This Wikipedia related page says this; Claims and implications that only natural causes exist is happening in the scientific community. It need not happen in a perfect world, but since its not a perfect world, its happening, and its not a good thing, and theistic evolutionists should be concerned. The mathematical improbability of naturalistic origins (increasing recently by new scientific studies) is a valid point as the creation/ID side pursues their concept. Most everyone could probably agree that talkorigins is a pretty good representative of what should be the neutral scientific community.

If you're a true believer answering these questions which pose real problems for the theory of evolution should be easy for you. And by easy, I mean supportable with the bible itself, not just your opinion. But let me ask you this as one fundamental Christian to another. How do you align the concept of the Genesis Creation story which clearly states that God created the Universe and everything within it in 6 days time which were broken up into 24 hour days, with evolution which claims that man evolved from lower animals over hundreds of millions of years, if not billions of years if we consider the alleged appearance of original life on Earth according to evolution hypothesis? What does the evolution account do to the Genesis accounts introduction of sin into the world by way of A&Es fall from grace, and Mans need for reconciliation to God because they disobeyed God, and ate of the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? Don't you agree that if evolution is true then there is no need for God or the need for Mans redemption as outlined in the bible? The whole bible is about mans need for reconciliation to God due to our initial rebellion by disobeying His very clear warning that the day that we ate of that tree we would surely die through A&E. And because of that, the need for Jesus plan for salvation became a spiritual necessity. Can't you see that according to evolution, none of this is necessary?","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","11:34 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","58"

"06-14-2009","12338",4,"None","None","None","Archangel","357421","Why's that? Because you repost the same post 3 times that greentwiga wrote, that proves nothing at all, but is simply his opinion? He says this: Even he admits how convoluted his explanation is and he ties nothing together at all in the end. No wonder you accept that as evidence. In another post on the same thread he says this, and I quote: [greentwiga said:] Goliath's height was six cubits and a span. A cubit was the length from the elbow to the fingertip and it varied from one person to another and from one culture to another. A typical 6 foot tall person has a cubit (1/4 of height) of 1 1/2 feet. Six cubits is 9 feet. Sumerians had a cubit slightly longer (19 or 20 inches) A tribe with men averaging 5 feet tall would have a cubit of 1 1/4 feet. Thus Goliath would have been 7 1/2 feet tall. He could have been a perfectly normal giant with none of the health problems that come from a pituitary abnormality. This leaves us with an interpretation of the Bible that does not contradict science. So my alleged fundamentalist friend is all over the place as he attempts to marry science with theology. What he will eventually realize hopefully is that all he accomplishes in doing so is to deceive himself and miss the precious truth in Gods word. Here, let me explain how his explanation contradicts Gods word and message in the end. It is exposed in this attempt to once again compromise Gods truth with a secular humanist interpretation which he supports with no spiritual or theological sources at all. [greentwiga also said:] The second problematical interpretation is that all men died in the flood. The word for World in Gen 6 & 7 is also translated region or country. In Peter, he refers to the creation of the world and the final destruction of the world with the word ""Ge."" He refers to the destruction of the world by the flood with the word cosmos . This means the organized world. An literal interpretation of the Bible can be that just Sumer was flooded. Then the Nephilim were not all destroyed in the flood, Goliath was one of the Anakim who were descended from the Nephilim, and there is no contradiction. So, if you read greentwigas second paragraph here and place it side by side with the Genesis account regarding Gods reason for destroying the Earth by flood as told here: Gen 6:1 Now it came about, when men began to multiply on the face of the land, and daughters were born to them, Gen 6:2 that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose. Gen 6:3 Then the LORD said, ""My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; nevertheless his days shall be one hundred and twenty years."" Gen 6:4 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore {children} to them. Those were the mighty men who {were} of old, men of renown. Gen 6:5 Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. Gen 6:6 The LORD was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart. Gen 6:7 The LORD said, ""I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, from man to animals to creeping things and to birds of the sky; for I am sorry that I have made them."" So, we see that according to greentwiga God totally failed in his reason and motivation for destroying the World through the flood if the giants survived, since Gods intention was to wipe out these creatures which were the result of Fallen Angels mixing with women which resulted in these giants existing in the first place. Also greentwiga, you have an immediate problem of credibility with true believers around here since the only people buying into your theology are atheists like the obvious child here. Also you say the word used to describe the world/Earth in Genesis 6 is cosmos? Gen 6:4 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore {children} to them. Those were the mighty men who {were} of old, men of renown. Wrong again, and here is evidence from the Lexicon. How about you stop just making claims and start supporting your theological assertions with respected theological sources which support what you say? Blue Letter Bible - Lexicon For a real comparison, here is the usage of the word Earth in Genesis 1:1 click on #776 to get the meaning of the word used and you will see that it is the same word used in Genesis 6. Blue Letter Bible - Book of Beginnings - Genesis 1 (NASB - New American Standard Bible) So rather than use diversionary tactics which attempt to build an argument that is once again based on misinformation and lies, why not honestly respond with actual supportable theological evidence for once? Or is it your preference to always promote lies rather than the truth, little child?","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","08:52 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","60"
