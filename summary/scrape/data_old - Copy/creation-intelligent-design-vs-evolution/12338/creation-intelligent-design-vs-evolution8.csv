"06-23-2009","12338",8,"Archangel","358384","But I do reject this so called science of evolution which denies the true origins of humanity by misinterpreting how we came to be by its claim that we evolved from lower animals over millions of years. This philosophy is patently false and intended to draw people away from our true origin which is the Genesis Creation account.","Larni","358392","You are rejecting science. Just like I would be rejecting your god if I rejected the only the Genesis account of creation. How could I believe in your god if I did not believe in Genesis? How can you 'accept science' but reject biology, physic, geology, to name but a few? You can't pick and choose. A priori assumption and a patently absurd prejudice about the motives of scientists. If I said all xians are right wing bigots would you believe me? No, of course not because it's not true. You can't ascribe motives to people as a homolgous group like that.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","07:26 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","106"
"06-23-2009","12338",8,"Archangel","358384","Also Larni, I don't reject science at all. I respect it as Mans ability to discern and define the world we live in in an organized manner.

In most posts you reject science as a whole. Remember, you stated that density is a key factor in sorting in a fluid medium was ""ludicrous."" Too bad you can test this in your sink to show that it is in fact true. Furthermore, you have called for more nuclear power which rests upon the same principles as radiometric dating yet have called the assumptions and principles of radiometric dating ""false."" We have repeatedly pointed this out to you and all you do is throw hissy fits and toss horrible insults at us rather than address how you called the basis of nuclear power ""false."" And you have cited a theory of creationist plate tectonics that is so implausible that many other Creationists reject it due to its heat issues. A theory that its creator has admitted required miracles to function. Historically, you argued that bees can't fly according to modern understanding. Too bad that you were flat out wrong as the basis of bumblebee flight is the same as the physics that allows helicopters to fly. You wonder why we don't take you seriously? You reject science on a daily basis which enjoying its products everyday. Contradictions are the blood of YEC. Except when it rejects a young Earth. Which mostly all of it does. And what evidence do you have to suggest there is misrepresentation? I mean actual evidence. Not the Bible. Never mind how your belief mandates God to be a liar.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","07:38 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","107"

"07-14-2009","12338",8,"None","None","None","MarielB","360625","Just pointing out that the first definition of theory in the American dictionary is the correct one to use regarding evolution. ""A set of statements or principles devised to explain a group of facts or phenomena, especially one that has been repeatedly tested or is widely accepted and can be used to make predictions about natural phenomena."" If someone did so already, I apologize. I can't navigate through all these posts and counter-posts as easily as you all do. There is OVERWHELMING evidence in support of evolution. The fossil record is quite convincing, but is only one factor. ( What's New in An Index to Creationist Claims ) Genetics also presents excellent evidence. The fact that we share over 90% of our DNA with higher primates for instance. ( Comparing Genomes - Page 1 ) The fact that we still have DNA for tails (see: Evidence for Evolution (Page 11) ) The fact that cephalopods have no blind spot and we do (See: Pax-6: Where to be conserved is not?conservative ? PNAS ) There is much, much more. This website explains how science and faith can work well together, if you care to read it. http://www.songofgenesis.org","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","02:42 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","110"
