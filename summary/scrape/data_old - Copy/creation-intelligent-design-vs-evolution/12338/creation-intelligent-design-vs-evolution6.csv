Atheism, although not a religion, isn't taught. Biology is not a form of atheism. Yes, it would. But atheism isn't taught in science class. Further, only dimwits think that the Constitution requires an ""alternative philosophy"" to modern science to balance it. That has been rejected by every court that has considered the issue. The mythology of creationism is religion with no foundation in reality. Who is Victor Stenger and why should the mention of his name in science class be important? I know who Dawkins is, but you'll have to offer more than your hysterical fear of the mention of his name is actually justified by the mention of his name. What science classes - when and where and by whom. Moreover, in what context were their names mentioned. I'll bet that Ken Miller's name has been mentioned more times than either of yours put together, and yet Ken Miller is a christian. Why should the mention of his name cause distress for scientists? Actually, common sense should tell you not to invent such idiotic scenarios and attribute them to me. As far as I am aware, no such rants have ever taken place. In my experience, there are far more rants by creationists, who even do their ranting at school board meetings. Besides, what you characterize as a rant by a teacher against religion is probably just a teacher trying to explain that the superstition of religious mythology has no place in a science classroom. Justice should be done when students who cause disturbances when they find that scientific facts and theories disagree with their particular mythological superstitions. The teacher should be allowed to permanently eject them from the class. How do you know that? What RECENTLY DISCOVERED complexities are you babbling about? I do know that the ID creationist movement began about 18 years ago and the proponents have made promises of scientific research programs. I also know that there have been none - nothing published. No discoveries recently or ever about simple forms of life establishing a religion. Are you smoking something? Can I get some? Actually, the Constitution is talking about any establishment of religion by the government. If the government were to support the teaching of ID creationism in science classes, that would violate the Establishment Clause. However, on the other hand, you are actually free to adopt any mythological superstition as your religion that you wish. You are free to practice that superstition as you see fit without interference from the government. But you are not permitted to impose your mythology on everyone through our public schools just because you fail to understand what science is and how it works, and in fact don't want to learn. By the same token, I may not teach my religion as a matter of science. That's not a problem for me. Science isn't my religion and I have never presented religious matters in science classes. Of course it isn't. ID creationism is religion. Are you not aware of the court cases that have found it to be so? As a result, the presentation of ID creationism, because it is religion, cannot be presented in public schools as science. That would be unconstitutional. On the other hand, science is not religion and is actually the proper subject for presentation in science classes. Why is that concept so hard for you to grasp? Again, what are you talking about? I certainly hope that it isn't the bacterial flagellum, since that is neither recent nor baffling. Of course, the origin of life is not a question of evolutionary theory. It may be a question of a field of biology called abiogenesis. But, recent discoveries have allowed the manufacture of synthetic life forms. Some of these were imitations of real organisms that were assembled a nucleotide at a time, others were inventions of man that do not exist in nature. But they live! (Well, except for the artificial viruses. They are mostly defined as being outside of living organisms.) In fact, there are no recent discoveries by ID creationists that point out complexities that were previously unknown by real scientists. On the other hand, there have been recent discoveries that have been published in scientific literature that document the creation in the lab of artificial viruses and bacteria. But ID creationists haven't published any new methods of studying life. What is even worse, even if it were true, there is no such thing as an atheist life style. You've actually gone off the deep end here. The courts have said that religion may not be presented as science in public school science classes. The courts have said that creationism, creation science, and ID creationism are religious in nature and therefore may not be presented in public schools. On the other hand, the scientific theories of evolution have been found to be evidence based science and non-religious in nature. What discoveries? Again you babble about nonsense. Please tell us in which scientific journal these scientific discoveries have been published. Science doesn't seek truth (and neither does any religion). Science seeks explanations for observed facts that have been verified. When a scientific explanation if found to be in conflict with reality, the science is rejected or adjusted. When religious truth is found to be in conflict with reality, reality is rejected. Your superstitious mythology is always true no matter how idiotic it becomes. Actually, science is a process of offering and testing naturalistic explanations for naturalistic processes. If an explanation fails a test, it is rejected. That is why spiritualism, super-naturalism, and mythology have not been allowed to be taught as science in public schools. They are mostly not subject to test. They are based on belief in mythology and magic. Any time that someone has actually offered an hypothesis of superstitions mythology that has been able to testing, the hypothesis has failed the test. Of course, there are many christian schools that teach the above in lieu of science. I know. And that is puzzling since it is you who has characterized science at opposing or fighting against your superstitious mythology. It has always been my position that ""science"" doesn't actually give a rat's tootie about what your mythology asserts. As opposed to the biased and imperfect religious community? As a scientist, my bias is in favor of empirical evidence. Show me evidence the the earth is only 6,000 years old. Show me evidence that women are made from man. Show me evidence of a great FLUD and ""kinds"" of living organisms. Show me evidence that 8 people could load and care for millions of species of living organisms on that little wooden box for a year. Or, as an alternative, show me evidence that 36 species of cat, in three genera, could have evolved from a single pair of the cat kind in a few hundred years, along with the several genera and many known species of extinct cat. Follow that up with the species of canid (dog) - even more numerous than cats. In other words, show me any bit of evidence that your superstitious mythology has the slightest possibility of being true. Please stop with the whining about your Constitutional rights unless you understand your rights and my rights, and unless you can actually present real evidence. Well, at least you admit your silly paranoia. That's a step. On the other hand, the only reason that any scientist has come to care about ID creationism is because of efforts by creationists to introduce it as science in public school classrooms. If it were not for the religious zealots who pretend that because they are prohibited from imposing their religion on all public school students, their constitutional rights are being violated. The logic seems to be that because the Constitution prohibits Congress, and by incorporation under the 14th Amendment, all bodies of government from making laws regarding an establishment of religion, this somehow means that spiritualism and the mythology of bronze age, nomadic herdsmen must be taught as science, because to prohibit the teaching of such superstition would be making a law about an establishment of religion. Sadly, creationists have little understanding of the Constitution. They seem to continue to maintain their historical position of opposition to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The major opposition to the ratification of both documents was from christian churches.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","01:55 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","86"

Now I realize that you will take this evidence and squirm in 3 different directions as you insist you are right. But that wont change the fact that you are as wrong as only you are capable of being. Animism: Greeks, Romans, Santeria, Voodoo, American Indians, Mayas, Witches, Ancestors, Hindus... The ""Primitive Religions"" were born in the five Continents, more than 3,000 years ago, mostly in the form of ""Animism"", because they believed that everything has a ""soul"", an ""anima"" in Latin, a ""spirit""... including animals, plants, rocks, mountains, rivers, stars... each ""anima"" is powerful, spiritual, that can help or hurt them, including the souls of the dead, the ""ancestors"". For thousands of years they deified animals, stars, idols of any kind... and practiced Spiritism, witchcraft, divination, astrology... and they used magic, spells, enchantments, superstitions, prayers, amulets, talismans, charms... often with the worship of an Absolute, or the Great One... Today Animism is represented, among others, by the Mormons, Hinduism and the New Age. They proclaim that every human is God, and their practices will help each one to realize it. The Bible destroys this way of thinking in the first verse of he Bible: 1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. (Gen.1:1). There is only one God, everything else in the heavens or earth are ""creatures of God"". The sun and the moon are ""creatures of God"", and the rocks and animals and oceans, and all the mountains and stars, and each man and woman is also a ""creature of God"", is not God. But they usually did not care much about a Creator God, only about the ""spirits"" that can help or hurt them... and what they sometimes called ""gods"", are ""demons""... or simply a ""lie""... and this is why the Bible condemns them with very strong words: abominations to God, stone them to death, the fire shall burn them (Deut.18, Lev.20, Isa.47). - 10There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch. 11Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. 12For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD: and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee. (Deut.18:10-12) - 27 "" 'A man or woman who is a medium or spiritist among you must be put to death. You are to stone them; their blood will be on their own heads.' "" (Lev. 20:7). - 12Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail. 13Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee. 14Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it. (Is.47:12-13) God, for the Animist, is not a person... as for the Hindu, god is the Energy, the Force, the Power, the Universal Mind, the Absolute, the Unknown, the Divine Being... is not a ""he"" but an ""it""... it is not somebody but something... but something powerful able to get wonderful things for you using Magic... and worshiping it!... yes, worshiping the Force or the Energy... Since god is not a person, there are no revelations from a non-person... you never find in Animism or Wicca or Hinduism, God said... Yahweh calls... The gods never existed, they are the product of novels or the imagination... they are myths, legends... but they never existed and they do not exist today. The big problem is that ""Today"" an estimated 40% of the world's population is animistic (Van Rheenen), including all kinds of occultism, often in syncretism with Christianity, Islam, Buddhism... The Animism is attractive because infuses the sacred into the real life, and mainly, because offers people a way to cope with one's everyday needs and problems: Healing of an illness, to be successful in a business, or in love, or to find a job, or to restore a soured relationship, to find a mate, to gain guidance for the future... The animist views the ""formal religions"" as being relevant with respect to ""ultimate"" issues, but irrelevant when it comes to addressing the ""immediate"" issues of everyday life... which is totally wrong!, because Christianity, Islam, and all ""formal religions"" deal with issues of every day's life... but this is the reason why a Christian or a Jew go to the witch or consult the Zodiac... They go to church on Saturday or Sunday to take care of their soul, and they go to the witch or astrologer on Monday to take care of their business or illness... absolutely wrong!... Come to Jesus... Believe in him!... is the solution of all the problems in this life, and on top of the glorious life on earth, he offers you eternal life of joy in Heaven. The World View of Animism: Pantheism is the first logical consequence of Animism: All the world is divine: A mountain is god, a rock, an animal... you are god!... though you can't make stars not even atoms, but you are god!... a planet, and even a cockroach is god!... they are the ""idols"" often mentioned in the Bible. Polytheism is the next obvious consequence: There are thousands of gods... the concept of 333 million deities is believed to emphasize the fundamental doctrine of Animism, Hinduism, Wicca... The first verse of the Bible contradicts these views: In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth... so, in the Bible, there is one God, a person, and everything else in the world are creatures of God... God created and is the soul and life and is inside everything, but everything is not God... there is only one God, Creator. Of course, for Animists or Hindus, the aim of this life is to stop the relentless and frightful reincarnation, and become nothingness, not-a-person, but the drop of water in the ocean of the Absolute... for a Christian, an eternal life of joy is waiting, and not like a drop of water, but as a person, recognizable by God and by every neighbor... a person!, an individual!, eternally!, as God is an eternal Person!... eternally in Hell or in Heaven!... Religion and Cults - Animism So you see, those who worship idols and such are the practitioners of animism. Judaism and evangelical christianity condemn such practices as abominations before God. And that is because the God of the Old and New Testament also condemns such practices throughout His word. So you have once again blatantly and ignorantly misrepresented what the bible and God Himself stands for and represents to us as His Truths. So in short order I have easily proven that according to what animism is, it plays no actual part in the scriptural perspective of how, why and who Man is according to our relationship with the living God.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","07:33 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","88"

Animism lies at the foundation of all religion. It signifies man's earliest attempts to understand his surroundings, and take to himself the perception of control of them.
