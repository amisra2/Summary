Just because there are scientists that don't believe in my God doesn't mean that they can't put out solid science that I can use. Just because there are people who have basically the same theology as me doesn't mean that I have to like their evidence that they have collected. I am trained in science and can tell the difference between a scientist pushing his bias and a scientist publishing solid science. I have some objections to the current version of the Big Bang, but that doesn't stop me from looking at the latest research trying to support the theory.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","01:21 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","31"
"06-11-2009","12338",3,"marc9000","357216","My point is that I dont understand the lack of debate between theistic evolutionists and atheistic evolutionists. Atheistic evolutionists claim that science shows that God does not exist, and many/most theistic evolutionists claim that science shows God more vividly than the Bible does. They both wink and nod at each other as they both claim additional proof for their conflicting conclusions. Do you think that Michael Behe could put out solid science that you could use? You should be upset that the scientific community, that claims to be an objective, unbiased organization, roundly critisizes scientists like Behe, while not roundly critisizing atheists like Victor Stenger, who has an obvious ideological bias. Why is Behe condemned for having an ideological bias while Stenger is given a free pass for an ideological bias? As long as the scientific community continues to draw a blank on naturalistic origins, ID cannot be completely ruled out by actual science. It can be ruled out by atheism, but not by science. If you have objections to the current version of Intelligent design, does something stop you from looking at the latest research trying to support the theory? If so, why? It figures that it would stop an atheist, but not someone who believes in an intelligent God, as theistic evolutionists claim to. Do you wonder why atheists make these statements to creationists and not to theistic evolutionists?","T.Q","357223","Why should they be debating? Are people not allowed to have different opinions? Which is their opinion Which is their opinion Or they both understand that their differences are a matter of faith and make no real difference to the science under study. Why do you consider it neccessary for theistic evolutionists to denounce atheists? The fact that you consider all theistic evolutionists liars and frauds is getting really sickening. snip paranoid ranting He hasn't yet. For not producing solid science! FFS Marc, consider what you write before you hit submit It's a pop culture book, not a science text book. It is his opinion. How is it that you always have trouble distinguishing this? Because he does No one says he doesn't have an ideological bias. You show me how he's trying to get his book introduced into a classroom as science, and I'll denounce it just as vehemently as I do ID. So, you're a God of the Gaps kind of guy. What research?! There is no research. There are pop books, blog postings, and newsletters. That is not research. Back to the paranoid conspiracy theories. I would say it's because theistic evolutionists don't deny reality and try to institute their fantasies into schools. Aaaaand...snip rest of paranoid conspiracy theory.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","09:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","33"

Their problem is primarily with the issue of God itself. As neither reject the science behind evolution, there is no need for conflict there. And you do see atheists who accept evolution arguing with theists who accept evolution on matters of whether or not a God exists. What you don't see them arguing about is the mechanisms of evolution, where we see people like you and Arch denying evolution without understanding it.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","10:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","34"

There might be some atheists that say it, but at the very best, what could be said is that evolution shows a way that any kind of deity might not be needed. That scares the living pants out of some folks.

I don't say it is exactly right. In fact, I enjoy the changes as scientists learn more. I also enjoy the debates over different Theories, such as the one over the humanoid fossils. Is X in the direct chain to mankind or just a dead end side chain? I recognize that details of the theory, or even major chunks can change, but still I am comfortable with the science, and the theory. Now, I know that no science can prove that there is no God guiding evolution, and no science can prove that there is a God guiding evolution. Neither should be taught in schools, just the science. I do see Christians teaching interpretations of the Bible, like the world wide flood, which cause many to turn away from God. I also see other Christians trying to mash the Bible to show that Noah's flood was the flooding of the Black Sea. Now the flooding of the Black Sea was an amazing scientific/historic event, but it doesn't fit Noah's flood. I have searched scripture to see what is possible, within the Biblical statements, and then looked to see which of the possibilities fit science. We can't convince anyone that there is a God by these studies. We can only avoid driving people away by unscientific interpretations. That is only possible if there are solid interpretations that also fit science. My study of the Garden lead me to conclude that it described the moment of Domestication. As a followup, it lead me to give up the Creationist teaching and come to peace with evolution, a conclusion I didn't really want to make. Now, I still am convinced that God is involved in the process, but all I would try to convince you is that the Garden was set in a point in history. If you wanted to talk about the existence of God, I would use a completely different strategy. Therefore, I don't believe that teaching Intelligent Design belongs in a scholastic setting.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","01:14 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","36"

"06-12-2009","12338",3,"greentwiga","356858","As a Fundamentalist Christian, if I saw a decent, well supported set of facts supporting Creation Science, I could accept it. I have read enough to reject all their ""evidence."" One of the attacks on evolutionary science is to attack C14 decay. I have worked with a group that separated tree rings and analyzed each ring. The tree ring chains that allow us to cringsorrect the C14 analysis back for thousands of years are solid. Furthermore, there are similar layer dating systems, ice core, lake core, stalactite rings among others. These help scientists, even other Christian scientists, to verify other radioactive dating systems. Therefore, when the bones are dug up from the earth and are dated millions of years apart, They have substantial nonevolutionary science backing them up. They also show that the layers are not flood layers, laid down in one years time as some of the Creation scientists maintain. Then, when a chain of bones of a family of animals shows up with the dating agreeing with the pattern of changes, the evidence seems substantial. Whether Whales, Horses or dinosaurs to birds, the chains seem clear. Not only that, but continuing research finds more intermediate species just as the evolutionary Anthropologists had predicted. Well, most of the time. Some times the chian proposed is different from the chain later found, but it is still an evolutionary chain. As I said, I am a devout Fundamentalist Christian, but I must face the facts. Even if a facet of the Evolutionary theory is found wrong, the replacement is also a form of evolution. Some believe in steady changes but more and more believe in punctuated evolution. Even if part of the theory was wrong, the theory as a whole is solid. I went and analyzed the book of Genesis. I thought I might find that genesis was poetry like the songingenesis person states. Instead, I found high accuracy. Especially startling was the story of Adam and Eve. When I didn't bring in any traditional interpretations, but let the Bible speak for itself, I found it preserved the exact location of the domestication of wheat. Thus, though science is proving the evolutionary theory more and more solidly, it is also proving the accuracy of Genesis. See Home ?(gardenofeden)?","Archangel","357251","The key question to ask greentwiga, is: ""Has the ratio of C-14 to C-12 ever changed from what it is today, and if so, when and by how much?"" If a change or changes took place, a carbon year may not necessarily equal a calendar year. Radiometric dating and real time may be assumed to be equivalent only if the following criteria are met: For C-14 dating the conditions are: 1. The material to be dated must be organic 2. The organism to be tested must have gotten its C-14 from the atmosphere 3. The sample has remained chemically and physically a closed system since its emplacement. 4. That we know what the atmospheric concentration of C-14 was when the organism lived. From your first paragraph where you discuss dating objects at thousands of year ages, you then make the giant leap in this next paragraph and extrapolate that to then extend and accept the dating of fossils at millions of years is rational and a naturally correct progression. Nothing could be more fallacious and wrong to make such a leap based on your perceived, yet unproven C-14 Dating methods. But let me ask you this as one fundamental Christian to another. How do you align the concept of the Genesis Creation story which clearly states that God created the Universe and everything within it in 6 days time which were broken up into 24 hour days, with evolution which claims that man evolved from lower animals over hundreds of millions of years, if not billions of years if we consider the alleged appearance of original life on Earth according to evolution hypothesis? What does the evolution account do to the Genesis accounts introduction of sin into the world by way of A&Es fall from grace, and Mans need for reconciliation to God because they disobeyed God, and ate of the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? Don't you agree that if evolution is true then there is no need for God or the need for Mans redemption as outlined in the bible? The whole bible is about mans need for reconciliation to God due to our initial rebellion by disobeying His very clear warning that the day that we ate of that tree we would surely die through A&E. And because of that, the need for Jesus plan for salvation became a spiritual necessity. Can't you see that according to evolution, none of this is necessary? http://www.specialtyinterests.net/carbon14.html","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","07:47 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","38"

"06-12-2009","12338",3,"marc9000","357300","I was afraid of that. All you saw in those posts was answers? Because statistics show that roughly 95% of biologists are atheists, so theres no question that they believe that life arose from some godless way, most of them believe they can repeat it, most of them try it or want to try it, and most of them want the public to fund it. Why would they do that? Because atheists rant that there was no flood with a louder voice? Its going to happen every time you make an imperfect human study an ultimate standard, a measuring point, and then subject the Bible to that standard. Gt, why do you suppose atheists fly into a rage when I express my opinion? Theyll say its because my opinion is stupid, while we watch one say; science shows that God does not exist, and the other answers I study science too, and I like how it shows God more vividly than ever before! Youre cool, lets go have a beer! And ~Im~ the stupid one?","obvious_child","357325","That doesn't mean much coming from a person who has shown a complete lack of any understanding of the terms in question. Come again? That poll was done on the National Academy of Sciences biologists. I wasn't aware that all biologists in the world belonged to that. Care to provide information regarding such a statement? Furthermore, that was in 1998. Your data is more than 10 years old. And the rest of your argument is nothing more than conspiracy theory. No, because the flood makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. http://www.4forums.com/political/cre...-possible.html Do you realize you just proposed a double standard? Rage? Come again? Your opinion is baseless and ignorant. Does that mean we are angry? No. Mostly we have significant pity on you, as you believe something so detached from reality and yet cannot make the connection to how it makes your life a contradiction.
