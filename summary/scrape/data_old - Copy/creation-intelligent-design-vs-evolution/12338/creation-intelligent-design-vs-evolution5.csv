In terms of science they are, but in terms of philosophical applications of science, they are not. Surely youre kidding. We can make predictions about many things, most notably human behavior, by consulting subjects other than science. Unrevised history is a good one, some people believe a recognition of supernatural good & evil is another. Atheists here seem to demand a detailed knowledge of science by Christians, yet they show a woefully inadequate knowledge of Christianity to disregard it to the extent that they do. Its wrong in that it cant go on indefinately. Two opposing viewpoints cant claim studies of the same subject increase proof for BOTH VIEWS forever. If neither of them eventually fails, its clear that neither of them are accomplishing anything. There are several messages when it comes to origins of life - Stenger/Dawkins has one, Miller has one, Behe/Dembski has one. All three are blends of science and philosophy, but all three are philosophical enough so that a neutral scientific community should treat them equally, and they dont. If a young person is deciding which one to persue, a consultation of the scientific community would be a logical way to help them make their decision. That young person shouldnt see winking an nodding going on with one philosophy, and condemnation of another.","Larni","357435","The scientific method cannot prove anything.

How do you align the concept of the Genesis Creation story which clearly states that God created the Universe and everything within it in 6 days time which were broken up into 24 hour days, with evolution which claims that man evolved from lower animals over hundreds of millions of years, if not billions of years if we consider the alleged appearance of original life on Earth according to evolution hypothesis? What does the evolution account do to the Genesis accounts introduction of sin into the world by way of A&Es fall from grace, and Mans need for reconciliation to God because they disobeyed God, and ate of the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? Don't you agree that if evolution is true then there is no need for God or the need for Mans redemption as outlined in the bible? The whole bible is about mans need for reconciliation to God due to our initial rebellion by disobeying His very clear warning that the day that we ate of that tree we would surely die through A&E. And because of that, the need for Jesus plan for salvation became a spiritual necessity. Can't you see that according to evolution, none of this is necessary? [/QUOTE] First, I accept each and every word in the original was inspired by God (not necessarily the translations) Then I went back to look at the original passage. It says, ""There was evening and there was morning, a second day."" This pattern is repeated almost unchanged over six days. Then I looked to see what it means. It could be six literal days. In Genesis 2:4, it says, ""This is the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the heavens and earth. 5:1 and 10:1 are two other passages that use the same formula and cover all the generations mentioned. Frequently, the next statement about generations goes back in time from where the previous one ended and starts another group, such as Gen 11:10 where it even repeats part of the genealogy of Shem. The first one, started in Gen 2:4 ends (time wise) with the three sons of Lamech. All this, according to Gen 2:4 is in one day. The six days of Genesis 1 are said to be one day and the seven generations of Cain are also part of the one day. It could be that the days of Genesis 1 are not 24 hour days. Thus, it does nothing to the account of Genesis 2-4. Adam and Eve committed Evil (Look up the meaning in Hebrew), and in the same day, died. They lived many more years, so could this mean they died spiritually? Yes. Now they needed the reconciliation. When you understand the Hebrew word for Evil, you see that even if evolution is right, Rom 5 shows that through one man, sin entered the world and death spread to all men, because all sinned. It states how Adam was given a law and broke it. Death spread to all men, even over people who had not sinned in the likeness of Adam. They had sinned a different way. I agree, the whole Bible is about man's need to be reconciled to God. I fail to see how evolution negates that in any way.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","07:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","62"

But theres common sense evidence that shows Darwinism is elevated above that. In 1959, George Gaylord Simpson said No other single human production has had so great an impact on science or on learning and thought in general as The Origin of Species. Ernst Mayr said that Darwins work led to perhaps the most fundamental of all intellectual revolutions in the history of mankind. I realize thats only two men, but its not hard to see throughout the scientific community. That kind of worship of Darwin is throughout Kenneth Millers book Finding Darwins God, which I read, and is also throughout the rantings of people like Dawkins, who I try to avoid reading, (but sometimes watch him speak if Im trying to accomplish a personal medical task, like purging my stomach of its contents) Imperfect humans, even those with impressive educations, take Darwinism far beyond paradigm status. Its a worship that is no easier to re assess than any religion. Findings are results of searches. Not everything will be found, and not everything will be searched for. Science cant do everything possible that is scientific, decisions have to be made concerning choices of what to study, and applications.The applications/searches shouldnt be controlled by those who get paid for the searching, it should be controlled by those who pay for the searching. Well, it really wasn't my example, you used the words ""predictions"" and ""reality"", as if scientific mastery over them was all-encompasing, which it clearly isn't. Theres magical thinking in Darwins elevated status too. The idolization of him continues to grow since his death. It's been established that Jesus Christ is the most written about person who has ever walked on earth. If Darwin isn't yet in second place, I'm sure he will be some day. Lets try this again; You quoted what I said all around the above three sentences, yet left those sentences out. Either you didnt think they were important at all, or they were too troublesome for you. Im not trying to pin you down on why you left them out, but I have to restate them because they are important to what I believe, and as you have probably guessed, my belief is that the Dover court decision was the wrong one. Its easy to see that Im not alone, not only because of the interest the Dover case generated, but because theres enough logic in my (and millions of others) viewpoint that there is a chance that a future political event/court decision will overturn that Dover decision. ID's status as science, independent of everything else concerned , isn't the only issue. ID can be a form of competition, to expose other forms of non-science. And I've heard it all before - science shouldn't be a place for competitive games. In a perfect would, that would be true. In a world where a minority, (atheists) largely rule it, it is true. Like selection without a selector, or information without an informer? Is the definition of magic, something that humans cant figure out? I know what the claims are, Ive discussed them with others here many times before. They say ID is not science because anything that deals with the supernatural has limits on what can be studied, that science can only study naturalism. Ive said that abiogenesis shouldnt be studied by the public scientific establishment because it can be a [public/ government established/ government sanctioned] attempt to disprove the supernatural. If religion should be kept out of science, then attempts to disprove religion should also be kept out of science. Ive been told thats just too bad for religion, that abiogenesis is 100% naturalism, therefore its science. So thats where we are, we have a constitution that says we cant publicly establish religion, but we have, to some degree, a public establishment of atheism. Young people need to know it. They need to know that its un-American for the majority who believes in an intelligent designer to have tax money taken from them so atheists can waste it looking for godless origins of life that theyre never going to find, and call it science.

It is a literal six days. Why would God creates 24 hour days, and tell us He's creating each aspect of creation in a day and then actually mean some other measure of time? It makes no sense. This is complete gibberish. It makes no sense at all, nor is it consistent with any theological explanation of Gods timing in the creation account. You'll have to do better than this if you're going to suggest that God didn't create the world in 6 literal days. Why don't you show the specific verse in Genesis where the word evil is used in the context which pleases you, then show what it means in the original language using an online lexicon? Here's an example. Gen 3:22 Blue Letter Bible - Book of Beginnings - Genesis 3 (NASB - New American Standard Bible) You don't? I thought my question above was outlined very clearly. With evolution as envisioned by Darwin, there is no need for God or salvation in any way. Evolution erases God from the equation of how and why Man exists at all. That's why evolution negates the Creation account.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","09:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","64"

Maybe we need mandatory science watch classes in public schools. Q: York County was recently in the news for a lawsuit involving the teaching of intelligent design. What's your attitude regarding the teaching of evolution in public schools? A: ""I'm a Christian, and I believe in parents being able to provide children with religious instruction without interference from the state. But I also believe our schools are there to teach worldly knowledge and science. I believe in evolution, and I believe there's a difference between science and faith. That doesn't make faith any less important than science. It just means they're two different things. And I think it's a mistake to try to cloud the teaching of science with theories that frankly don't hold up to scientific inquiry.""","Larni","357532","Ask yourself why this is. ToE is an incredibly well supported theory. Just like Gravitational and Germ theory. We no longer believe disease created by 'bad humours', do we? At one time this is what people believed (as a result of magical thinking [which I use in its formal sense]). Now we don't because of a solid and very well supported theory (Germ Theory). Once some people believed Earth was created by supernatural means. Can you see the parallel? I see your point. However, if something is viewed as tremendously important (again I point out Germ Theory) it is because it most likely is. Anyone with the ability can wade through the reams and reams of research and draw ones own conclusions about any subject. If one disagree ones is able to perform research to explore the reasons for that disagreement. The fact is that challenging ToE on scientific grounds is as impossible as challenging Germ Theory on scientific grounds. That's why all the challenges are religious or (in the case of the Wedge brigade) politico-religious. Either way one cuts it, it is biblical literalists who push this argument. The fact that some people may or may not take ToE beyond that which it is, is no reason to compare lack of belief in the supernatural with holding a belief in the supernatural. Lack of belief is not the opposite of belief, just as darkness is not the opposite if light. As much as it sometimes pains me, I concur that the areas for the searches should be determined by the people. But I don't agree that those with the means to pay should dictate the direction of the searches. As I said before, this choice is the choice of the people, not a privileged, rich minority. As I said, science does what science does. Sometimes the wider population does not have a correct picture of what science can do and what it can't. But I do confess to pouncing on the psychology reference (human behaviour is often trumpeted as a limit of science-it's not). I'm using magical thinking in its formal usage, here. Point taken. As I said: by the people (not just the rich). But this simply goes back to the issue that many people do not have the training to make an informed choice. Every single person with OCD believes the way to control their anxiety is to perform some ritualised task. Every. Single. One. This is an example of magical thinking. What is and is not is not a democracy. Experts are far more likely to be right than non experts. I don't how ID can do anything other than encourage biologist to knock down IC (over and over again). But is this not a waste of money? ID basically plays God of the Gaps and keeps losing ground. IC has never been upheld. What a waste of time and money. I'm sorry, I was using magical thinking in it's formal sense. With out digressing too much. The 'selector' in this case is the environment and if you are calling DNA Shannon information you are dead wrong. There is no part of the supernatural that science measure. Full stop. It is not research to disprove the supernatural. It is an attempt to establish as best as we can the facts around abiogenesis. If you don't want this to be studied you can use your political power to influence your government to cut funding. I support your right to do that (even if I believe it will cause your country to lag behind the others in terms of scientific prowess). Science is not a crusade against religion. The fact that science affects the likelihood of someone holding faith based beliefs is a side effect that is not even a guaranteed: my father in law is a physicist and is Christian. He is part of the scientific establishment (as I would like to think of myself) with no anti religious axe to grind. I suspect he is not a biblical literalist (never asked-it's considered rude to bring up religion in polite conversation over here). Can't comment, I don't know enough about your constitution. I agree that the majority should decide where the money goes, but you sound as if you are demonising people who don't believe in ID as un-American. I dug this up on the first hit (google) about your president commenting about ID in schools. Bold by me. Obama on ID (Intelligent Design) Is he un-American? Was he voted in by un-Americans?","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","06:47 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","65"
"06-18-2009","12338",5,"None","None","None","greentwiga","357896","Overall, Larni gave a very well reasoned reply. As long as the Theory of Evolution (ToE) sticks to what is says, it doesn't say a thing about Atheism or religion. Some people use it and go beyond it to say there is no God, but it does not say that. Years ago, people said Galileo's sun centered solar system attacked the Bible and oppressed scientists. The only thing that Galileo's theory attacked was a certain interpretation. The only thing that ToE attacks is a certain interpretation. There was a dramatic change possibly 70,000 years ago. Whether the complex sudden changes were that a group of statistically unlikely changes happened together, or that a God caused them to happen, science can't say. All science can say is that suddenly there were these beings that science calls fully modern Humans. As for the rest of time, Christians know that miracles are not common. Most of the time, it operates according to the laws God establishes. (eg ps 104:5 compared to what scientists say about the moon keeping the earth from tottering forever and ever. One act, and after that, the laws keep it going.) Therefore, the ToE could be true and Gen 1 could refer to specific points in time when God stepped in, and that Sin entered the world through Adam and that Jesus then had to die. Though Atheists try to use the ToE to prove there is no God, most scientists will say they have not proven that. Though IDers are welcome to try to prove their point scientifically, there is nothing solid yet. I as a Christian am much more willing to accept their studies than skeptical scientists, and I have seen nothing that I would use, yet.","evolution-what-facts-there-prove-all-they-all-theorys","04:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","66"

The fact that some people may or may not take ToE beyond that which it is, is no reason to compare lack of belief in the supernatural with holding a belief in the supernatural. Lack of belief is not the opposite of belief, just as darkness is not the opposite if light. As much as it sometimes pains me, I concur that the areas for the searches should be determined by the people. But I don't agree that those with the means to pay should dictate the direction of the searches. As I said before, this choice is the choice of the people, not a privileged, rich minority. As I said, science does what science does. Sometimes the wider population does not have a correct picture of what science can do and what it can't. But I do confess to pouncing on the psychology reference (human behaviour is often trumpeted as a limit of science-it's not). But this simply goes back to the issue that many people do not have the training to make an informed choice. Every single person with OCD believes the way to control their anxiety is to perform some ritualised task. Every. Single. One. This is an example of magical thinking. What is and is not is not a democracy. Experts are far more likely to be right than non experts. I don't how ID can do anything other than encourage biologist to knock down IC (over and over again). But is this not a waste of money? ID basically plays God of the Gaps and keeps losing ground. IC has never been upheld. What a waste of time and money. I'm sorry, I was using magical thinking in it's formal sense. With out digressing too much. The 'selector' in this case is the environment and if you are calling DNA Shannon information you are dead wrong. There is no part of the supernatural that science measure. Full stop. It is not research to disprove the supernatural. It is an attempt to establish as best as we can the facts around abiogenesis. If you don't want this to be studied you can use your political power to influence your government to cut funding. I support your right to do that (even if I believe it will cause your country to lag behind the others in terms of scientific prowess). Science is not a crusade against religion. The fact that science affects the likelihood of someone holding faith based beliefs is a side effect that is not even a guaranteed: my father in law is a physicist and is Christian. He is part of the scientific establishment (as I would like to think of myself) with no anti religious axe to grind. I suspect he is not a biblical literalist (never asked-it's considered rude to bring up religion in polite conversation over here). Can't comment, I don't know enough about your constitution. I agree that the majority should decide where the money goes, but you sound as if you are demonising people who don't believe in ID as un-American. I dug this up on the first hit (google) about your president commenting about ID in schools. Bold by me. Obama on ID (Intelligent Design) Is he un-American? Was he voted in by un-Americans?","marc9000","357999","Bad comparison. We have gravity now. We have germs now. We dont have events of billions of years ago now. Once? I still do, as do many people. I know the big bang theory is accepted by many people, Christian and non-Christian alike. I dont claim to rule it completely out myself, I just think speculation about that and similar things is the ultimate exercise in futility. We live in a realm of re-arrangement, and thats all we can think about. We cant create nor destroy, and we cant witness creation or destruction. There may be a significant realm of creation and destruction that we cant comprehend, yet is very present in what we experience. (I believe its the Christian God) If science claims it can explain everything we experience by naturalistic means (re-arrangement) then science goes beyond its bounds, and into philosophy. And I believe that studying the possibility of abiogenesis from billions of years ago on scientific grounds is just as impossible. Equally, its atheists who push abiogenesis. (and some theistic evolutionists) I guess the theistic evolutionists dont think God is intelligent. Talkorigins, and many other scientific websites, devote plenty of energy to downgrade creationism and religion. Are they taking the ToE beyond that which it is when they do that? Could you explain that? If lack of belief is not the opposite of belief, are you saying that something else is the opposite of belief? Or are you saying that there is no opposite of belief? What is the opposite of light if its not darkness? No no no, you misunderstand, Im not saying those with monetary influence should have a greater influence in what is studied at all, Im saying anyone who contributes in any way to the public till should have a say in what is searched, not because of any in-depth knowledge they may have of the searches, but because of their conclusions concerning the goals/uses of the results of the searches. Often, it is the scientific community that is a privileged and rich minority. But they have the most correct picture of the public usefulness of a search. According to Wikipedia; ""The sufferer feels compelled to voluntarily perform irrational, time-consuming behaviors to diminish the anxiety."" What makes you use the word ritualised over irrational, time consuming? The word ritualised can tend to lean toward religion, and I think it has a possibility of being unfair, in a field such as yours. When it comes to feeling compelled to perform irrational, time consuming behaviors.I THINK I MIGHT HAVE THAT NOW!!!!!!! HELP ME HELP ME!!!!!!!! Its a worldview difference I think the ones who are losing ground are the Darwinists. Ever since the enthusiastic writings of numerous followers of Darwin, (Huxley, Spencer, others) the origin of the first, simplest form of life didnt seem of much concern to them, or Darwin for that matter. They had no idea of its complexity, and didnt know that finding it would be so elusive, if not impossible. I was referring to purpose , and specified information . Just because evolutionists don't like the terms, it shouldn't mean we have to automatically rule them out. If it cant measure it, it cant challenge it . The scientific community ""roundly criticizing Behe over Stenger lays the serious problem bare. If science doesnt want to measure with ID, it shouldnt have such a keen desire to challenge religion with atheism. Its what abiogenesis is. Scientific prowess, or atheistic prowess? We seem to be doing just fine in that department according to statistics - the U.S. and the world. The big bucks seem to be in atheism far more than science. Its largely the same over here. Thats what I love about good ol worldwide 4forums, we dont let too much politeness get in the way here. Its simple - religion cant be publicly established, and cant have its free exercise publicly prohibited. Different people have different ideas of when attacks on it in public education actually publicly prohibit it. With the vast majority of biologists being atheists, largely controlling every aspect of biological application and education, were supposed to believe that everything suddenly snaps into 50/50 neutrality in publicly funded science education classrooms. Common sense and actual events tell me its not going very well. Teacher's rant on Christians draws court rebuke For every child who goes to all the trouble to record his teachers rant against religion, how many go unrecorded? Thousands? Millions? There is a difference between having a staunch belief in something, vs having an open mind about exploring its possibilities. Those who vehemently oppose both are who I demonize. No, but Id question his honesty. When he says that doesnt make faith any less important than science, what consideration is he talking about? Public policy? Personal action? If its personal action, thats something that is often altered by public policy. Theyre not going to be given equal consideration concerning public policy. As Phillip Johnson said, there will be a ruling realm, and a subordinate realm.
