You can also find this permanently posted, HERE: 4Forums.com Political Debates and Polls - View Profile: Archangel I guess what gets me so flummoxed is that we have here a member in this obvious child (and evidently, smiley also)who is so absolutely dishonest, so blatant in his arrogance and delusions, that he feels he can state what my deep seeded beliefs are based on things I have never, ever said in any way. This liar must know he is perverting my beliefs but has such little respect for the truth and so little shame that he isn't even embarrassed about not only misrepresenting what I have said, but actually arguing and defending that fallacious stance after repeated denials by me, and my insistence that his interpretation of what I have said is absolutely false. Only in this generation do we have people like this mentally ill troll who will insist on telling another person what he believes after he has repeatedly told him he is wrong. I can't imagine a psychosis so severe in a person who is functioning in society that he will refuse to accept it when another person says NO, that isn't what I said or meant to say. I must assume that this lunatic is communicating from some institution and is safely being held behind locked doors and is under 24 hour watch by qualified medical personnel. So it becomes painfully obvious to me that attempting to reason with this sick and disturbed lunatic is a complete waste of my time as there is no reasoning with him. He will continue to argue such insane positions as I believe that because TQ insulted my ability to do math, and I responded by saying that I reject his atheistic and secular world view, that from that exchange, one must conclude that I then believe that anyone who relies on MATH must then be an ATHEIST. And only in his very sick and disturbed mind can my stating the FACT that scientists have studied the issue of BUMBLE BEES defying the laws of flight for decades, that in his psychosis induced mind have I argued and still believe that BEES CAN'T FLY AT ALL. Forget that I was speaking only of bumble bees in my original claim, and forget that I wasn't saying even they can't fly but was saying that they DEFY THE LAWS OF FLIGHT. To his disturbed reality, evidently that means I don't believe that any bees can fly anywhere despite a lifetime of seeing bees fly. Can you appreciate how sick such a person who makes such a claim as this obvious child is? That none of that matters to this mentally ill person is evidence that he has lost his grip on reality. And that is the most gracious conclusion I can come to here. Otherwise, if I don't conclude that he is mentally ill, the only other option is to conclude that he is a committed fabricator of facts, a false witness, a falsifier of reality, a maligner of his opponents stated beliefs, a purposeful perjurer, and an unapologetic prevaricator who prefers to lie about a persons beliefs in opposition to the stated truth of what another person insists they actually believe. So which is it? Either way what is painfully obvious is that attempting to reason with such a person is a complete waste of time. as he has proven to be beyond the capability of rational discourse. My only option if admin refuses to ban such a member, is to ignore him. So consider it done.

According to the Arch level of honesty, accusing someone of something and then backing it up is lying but accusing someone of something and then providing absolutely no proof of your claims is not lying especially when someone provides evidence that what you said was patently false and when you repeat the same accusations despite being proven wrong in the same thread. I do suppose we are insane though if we expect Arch to express any level of honesty by showing he's wrong. Doing something the same three times and expecting different outcomes is crazy . We have showed to Arch he is is wrong, his statements are ignorant and his accusations are meritless. Does it change his behavior? No.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","04:34 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","281"
