With that kind of argumentative skill, it's not surprising he called in the discussions on homosexuality, especially one that's 51 pages long that he knows we won't bother to check. He resorted to the fallacy of changing the subject.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","03:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","46"

And you'll note who started this quibble - Archangel, who seems to be so obsessed with Gays and his arguments on the Gay Rights forum, that he has to bring it up in almost any discussion he gets into.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","03:20 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","47"
"10-04-2007","10445",4,"Archangel","286519","Sure, that's easy. Here's one of many. Of course getting you to admit defeat is another story.","ShadowPikachu","286556","Leave it to you, EasyRider to bring up gays and gay rights in a forum that has nothing to do with it. Your obsession is disturbing, EZ. Oh, as to your arguments you won, are you counting all the ones where you basically ad-hommed people into ignoring you and not paying attention to you? Because yeah, if you count those, you've won a few. Oh, are you including the evolution debates? You know, the ones where you brought up at least two frauds as evidence for yourself? You know, the ones where you used the source that had the Ica stones, and the one where you completely fell for the TV show prop and thought they had a genuine picture of a pterodactyl with some civil war soldiers?","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","03:24 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","48"
"10-04-2007","10445",4,"None","None","None","obvious_child","286558","The great advantage of being a Biblist Shadow, is that they can pretend that whatever they don't like didn't happen. They already live a giant lie, what's another lie that they didn't lose all those arguments? It's obvious that Biblists don't use logic or reason and hence they are free to create fantasy worlds that are devoid of those key traits. Hence Arch freely believes he actually won those arguments despite reality showing he did not. When you don't follow honesty or anything Jesus actually said and freely deny the sciences that give you products every day, why is it so hard to understand that he'd deny losing arguments as well, freely believing he won them? If you can ignore that geology which brings you gasoline says that evolution is true, then you can pretty much ignore everything else.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","03:32 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","49"

"10-04-2007","10445",4,"sinjin","286567","I do not believe these are the same person. Why do you?","ShadowPikachu","286568","have long suspected that EZ ad Archangel are one and the same. I've mentioned it several times in fact. Archie ""appeared"", and then EZ's posts began dwindling and he finally left a message that he was leaving to another forum about a month after Archie came. About a month or so ago, EZ reappears and posts sporadically for about a month, and then when that month is up, suddenly Archie disappears and EZ starts ramping up his posts. Now, EZ has disappeared once again, and Archangel has begun to ramp up his posts. Not to mention their identical obsession with homosexuals, wanting a blind support of Israel, etc. - their arguments seem to be basically the same. I have no reason to believe they AREN'T one and the same. EDIT: and I am not alone in this belief - MrWriteLA spotted this correlations as well and commented on it, and I think several others have as well.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","04:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","51"

Now go ask samiinh and tuba how many warnings they got for trolling on that thread. The hard reality that is impossible for your side to recognize and accept is that being a group of spiritually dead reprobates, they considered the truth I spoke as insults while interpreting the multiple hundreds of personal attacks levied against me as acceptable debating form. As usual they showed that hypocritical and a contradictory, self defeating life philosophy is the only truth your side knows.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","09:13 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","57"
"10-04-2007","10445",4,"Benjamin","286096","Evolution theory is not science at all, it is faith. Period. How can I conclude that? Because an examination of the evidence shows that a bias/ ideology/ Godless belief system is the only real evidence for evolution theory: evolutionist Stephen Jay Gould: Our ways of learning about the world are strongly influenced by the social pre-conceptions and biased modes of thinking that each scientist must apply to any problem. Evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin said: we have a prior commitment to materialism. It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us to accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are forced by our priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counter-intuitiveMoreover, that materialism is an absolute, for we cannot allow a divine foot in the door.","supersport","286606","that quote just about says it all. Naturalistic explanations are not the result of scientific investigations...instead, naturalism is the assumption on which all investigations are based. In otherwords, the paradigm of naturalistic/materialistic causes is taken for granted...and instead of considering how the real physical evidence bears on the paradigm itself, todays scientists only wish to investigate the evidence within the naturalistic paradigm. Problems or contradictions that may occur in these investigations in no way are interpreted as a problem with the paradigm itself...instead, any contradictory data are just said to be ""unexplained"" or ""mysterious."" Contradictions are also just hand-waved as ""different points of view."" For example, the idea that Darwin required gradualism for natural selection to operate in no way was invalidated when Gould said gradualism simply wasn't found in the fossil record. Today's science simply ASSUMES there is a naturalistic explanation -- and no other explanation is allowed.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","09:45 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","58"

And remind me, who is the person calling everyone who disagrees with him a ""hatemonger?"" Was it you or was it me? Come again? Could you care to show where you disproved a single point made against you? Shall we bring up your hoaxes and the infamous ""birds with jet engines coming out of their butts?"" And apparently you consider everyone who isn't a radical fundementalist Christian to be ""spiritually dead,"" nevermind that you can't even prove your God exists much less your religion is correct....
