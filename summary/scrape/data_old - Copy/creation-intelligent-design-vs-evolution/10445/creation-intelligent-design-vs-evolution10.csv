Here's what I mean, take this biblical warning seriously if you have even one ounce of wisdom: Rom 1:18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, Rom 1:19 because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them. Rom 1:20 For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse. Rom 1:21 For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Rom 1:22 Professing to be wise, they became fools, Rom 1:23 and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures. Rom 1:24 Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them. Rom 1:25 For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen. Rom 1:26 For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, Rom 1:27 and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error. Rom 1:28 And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper, Rom 1:29 being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; {they are} gossips, Rom 1:30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, Rom 1:31 without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful; Rom 1:32 and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","08:12 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","140"

Sure, you can ignore them and insist that they don't have any influence on you, but when all is said and done in this life, they will be all that truly mattered. I also find it interesting that you so fear the TRUTH that you are afraid to even read it.

Don't you get it yet? You can ignore, deny, reject and turn away from the living God all you want to, but that does nothing to lessen the fact that HE IS THE GOD OF ALL CREATION AND THE LORD OF LIFE. FOR IT IS WRITTEN AND A RELIABLE PROMISE: Phl 2:10 that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, Phl 2:11 and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","06:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","149"
