The speed of light has been directly measured both in the laboratory, from the moon, from the other side of the sun, from the fringes of the heliosphere. Not only that, the mathematical theory behind basic physics rules out light traveling significantly faster than has been measured, and it certainly rules out light being faster in the past by a factor of a million, which is necessary for a thousands year old universe. That is a far cry from ""assumption"". If the light from distant stars is not ancient (i.e., traveling at the speed of light), then obviously either all of physics and chemistry is wrong, or the light was created on its way to earth 6,000 years ago. The problem is that this light contains a history of events in it, and consequently light created en route contains a history of events that never happened. The same is true for the earth's geology. It is not a question of a 6,000 year old earth created to ""look mature"". Rather, the earth's geology contains a history of events (meteor impacts, volcanoes, tectonic movement, sedimentary rock formation, etc.). Basic 19th century physics shows that if all these events happened in the past several thousand years, our current earth would be a molten ball because of all the heat produced by these events. Once again, either all of physics and chemistry is wrong, or the history of events in the earth's geology never happened. If the creator of this 'light en route to earth' and earth's geology could place fictitious events in the light and in the earth's rocks, then it would seem this same creator could create a holy book full of fictitious events.

And I totally agree with you that from our perspective what you say appears to be true and even reasonable. The problem here is that our perspective is that of an ant with its miniscule life span attempting to discern eternity. It simply can't be done. Not that the attempt is wrong, it's just that we don't have the tools to verify that our interpretations of the available observations are the correct ones. Here's an example of what I mean. Gen 1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. When was the beginning? Gen 1:2 The earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters. Gen 1:3 Then God said, ""Let there be light""; and there was light. If God placed all of the stars in space at the same time, wouldn't that give a deceptive appearance to the age of the stars and the universe based on our assumption that measuring the alleged time it took for the light to travel here was necessary at all? Again, it's our perspective based on assumptions that the universe must be old which is questionable, if not faulty. According to verse 1, if the beginning was mere thousands of years ago, and God called light into being as verse 3 says, and the stars are the source of all light throughout time and space, then what appears to have taken billions of years to occur to us, actually took place instantaneously. This exchange is an excellent example of why we will never agree on the observations of science though, you are willing to accept any outcome which agrees with your preconceived notions, where as I require absolute and undeniable evidence for any claims which contradict or oppose the word of God which I consider preeminent according to my world view.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","02:20 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","377"

But we haven't experienced meteor events on the scale of neighboring planets by any means. Why is that when we share the same spacial real estate, so to speak? Geographic Distribution of Known Impact Structures This image shows the geographic distribution of about 160 structures that have been positively identified to date as impact structures based on the presence of shock-metamorphic effects and/or the presence of a meteoritic component or fragments at the structure. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications...BUTION_MAP.JPG Compare this image to the number of craters on the moon which is our closest neighbor/satellite and the other planets in our neighborhood. Although I believe a big one is coming our way, we have dodged many bullets compared to the other planets around us. And remember, it isn't that these events occurred which I argue, it is when. Just look at Mt St Helens today and see how the destructive evidence of that event has been completely erased and grown over in a short 30 years, not 3,000, or 3 million years, but just 30 years.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","05:17 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","217"

Accipiter has already given the reason we don't see as many craters on earth as other bodies in the solar system. But I'll just talk about the confirmed craters as pointed out on your map, and we can compare those to Mt. St. Helens. The Mt. St. Helens eruption was the equivalent of a 24 megaton bomb going off. For reference purposes, the largest atomic bomb ever tested was a 25 megaton hydrogen bomb, and the Hiroshima bomb was a 0.01 megaton bomb. Now, if we take Isaac Newton's formula for kinetic energy (E = 1/2mv^2), we can calculate the amount of energy needed to create all those craters on your map. The result: over one billion megatons of energy. That would be the same as 40 million Mt. Saint Helens eruptions! Over a 5,000 year YEC period, that would be the equivalent of twenty 25 megaton bombs exploding every single day ! It would be the equivalent of 23 Mount St. Helens eruptions every single day ! Of course, even young earth creationists don't believe that such catastrophic events have been happening for the past 3,000 years at least, and most young earth creationist literature I've read attributes the above meteor impacts to a single ""flood year"". That would mean that during the ""flood year"" there was the equivalent of 40 million Mount St. Helens eruptions on the earth . If the earth is only thousands of years old, then those meteor impacts should have obliterated the surface of the earth and generated sufficient heat to boil away the oceans. Or the basic physics of Isaac Newton are another aspect of science that young earth creationism rejects. Or those meteor impacts never really happened. If the earth is at least several hundreds of millions of years old, then the above meteor impacts present no problem as evidence of a history of events.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","08:05 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","353"

And if I still don't manage to believe in it then I'm obviously not trying hard enough. What a load of twaddle. As I said, no facts here. Move along people, move along, nothing to see here. No facts, no facts at all!!!","Archangel","385425","What you call proof is something that someone else feeds you which you will then decide if its valid or not. But either way it comes from another person whom you must trust if you accept their evidence. I'm telling you that our God is a personal God and is the only person who can supply the necessary evidence since both it and He is supernatural in nature. How sad that you choose to ignore that reality and scoff at the opportunity I'm revealing to you. Just imagine smiley, all you must do to discover the secrets of the universe is grope out into the spiritual darkness of this world and sincerely ask God to reveal Himself to you if He truly exists. You don't even have to believe He exists when you ask, I didn't, when I did, just be sincere in your desire to know Him if He does exist and He will reveal Himself to you because He wishes that none should perish. So move along if you like people, but if you sincerely seek God, He will find you. And that is a promise from Him that I can only attest to from personal experience.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","08:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","213"

Does that about sum it up correctly? You know, you keep accusing everyone around here of dishonesty, or misinterpretation. Did you ever consider that the problem might be you? We have a whole forum here for you to prove your accusations of my dishonesty. You have yet to do it. Odd, since I'm such a prolific liar.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","10:18 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","127"
