You will never see him argue something on this own unless it's an insult tirade.","Archangel","358977","Psa 36:2 For in his own eyes he flatters himself too much to detect or hate his sin. Psa 36:3 The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful; he has ceased to be wise and to do good.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","06:46 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","151"

People are going to think we are in cahoots. I predict it and then you go and do exactly what I said you do! You are SERIOUSLY jeopardizing our cover.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","06:49 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","152"
"06-28-2009","10445",11,"Archangel","358974","The bible is the word of God and your rejection of that FACT does nothing to negate that reality. Don't you get it yet? You can ignore, deny, reject and turn away from the living God all you want to, but that does nothing to lessen the fact that HE IS THE GOD OF ALL CREATION AND THE LORD OF LIFE. FOR IT IS WRITTEN AND A RELIABLE PROMISE: Phl 2:10 that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, Phl 2:11 and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.","Accipiter","358984","Your argument is a joke as usual. I dont know what happened to you to make you this way but it must have been terrible.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","07:12 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","154"

Jhn 3:6 Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit [fn] gives birth to spirit. Jhn 3:7 You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You [fn] must be born again.'","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","07:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","155"

So I figured that responding to you with Gods word is my only chance for getting through to you. Got it? Jer 48:42 Moab shall be destroyed and be no longer a people, because he magnified himself against the LORD. Jer 48:43 Terror, pit, and snare are before you, O inhabitant of Moab! says the LORD. Jer 48:44 He who flees from the terror shall fall into the pit, and he who climbs out of the pit shall be caught in the snare. For I will bring these things upon Moab in the year of their punishment, says the LORD. This is the fate of they who mock and blaspheme God. Heed this warning and the warnings to come or be destroyed by the same word of God which you mock.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","08:49 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","157"

Bombast and threats of reprisal by an imaginary friend are as worthless as they were in kindergarten. We grew up, while you just got older, substituting one dependent relationship for another.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","09:44 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","158"

I call it denying ones birthright. Rom 8:13 For if you live according to the flesh you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. Rom 8:14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. Rom 8:15 For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, ""Abba, Father."" Rom 8:16 The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, Rom 8:17 and if children, then heirs--heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with [Him], that we may also be glorified together.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","10:19 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","159"

You just spam the same argument over and over again and cannot produce original material. It does not matter that what you spam is the Bible. It is the fact that you cannot produce any original material yourself. You just article spam. What you spam is irrelevant to whether it is spam or not. The fact you can't understand that is a reason public schools suck. Your education was horrible.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","10:27 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","161"

But since you are the product of His existence, then your claim is a total denial of reality. And unfortunately this will be the result for you.
