An educated person would know proper english.

"10-07-2007","10445",8,"Mucusaur","287006","Just noticed this - I find it interesting. Generally speaking the days of natural disaters and disease being seen as a sort of divine judgment are over since the middle ages. DO you archangel, hold to the belief that these otherwise understood phenomena are actually caused by supernatural means?","chemist99a","287014","I would ask Pat Robertson rather than rely on Jay Leno. Its pretty obvious that Katrina, Iraq, GBII and other misadventures are due to GOD punishing the US for its transgressions.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","10:06 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","112"

Not surprising after all. You can't actually address a single argument made to you, which again isn't surprising given your argument that you're right because you're not me. Has it ever occurred to you that perhaps English is not my first language? And improper grammar is hardly a sign one is uneducated. Failure to show any critical reasoning whatsoever and relying upon Goddidit and I'm right because I say so is.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","10:13 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","113"

And I've never met an educated person who couldn't form a proper sentence. So take a word of advice and dont think more of yourself than you ought to because there's always going to be someone who is smarter than you are. Especially in your case.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","11:59 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","114"

And knowledge is not a sign of intelligence. One could easily memorize the encyclopedia and not understand what the words meant. Now, as I never made any mention to how smart I was you're a liar until you can prove that I did. Well considering you never met a 'educated' person, that's not surprising. Obviously I'm suggesting something about your parameters about what 'educated' means. Of course, that applies to all but a single person. But you aren't smarter then I, that is obvious to everyone , even you as you can't refute my points and largely don't even try anymore. Especially since you believe that birds can't fly because they don't have jet engines coming out of their butts and believe that multimegaton creatures can fly despite the engineering realities of it all. And seriously, what kind of educated, smart person uses the ""I'm right because I'm not you"" kind of logic? The realities are that the people that support you are radical theological fools who don't understand much of anything that is relevant to the world. The biggest supporters of Literal Creation are in the south, where education systems are ranked at the bottom of the 50 states and in the Muslim World where many only receive religious indoctrination. Pakistan for one has one of the largest population of literal genesis and happens to be a hotbed of Islamic Fascism. So you're more or less in bed with the enemy.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","12:10 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","115"

Grammar attacks should be left in the arsenal of the weak and the pathetic.

"06-26-2009","10445",8,"Archangel","286641","First of all, are you so inept as to only be able to post from page 3 of a thread rather than give the link for the actual post where I made a statement about BIRDS WITH JET ENGINES COMING OUT OF THEIR BUTTS ? Instead, you are attempting to mock me for making the simple statement that bumble bees defy the laws of flight which according to this article has been widely believed by millions and has travelled the World after being started in Switzerland. Well riddle me this schmuck, how does a bumble bee fly ? The greatest minds in the field can't figure that one out. So obviously bumble bees flying must not truly exist right ? Scientifically it's proven to be impossible so it must be a figment of our imagination right? You seem to sucker for every myth and hoax that says what you want to believe with no critical thinking at all.","obvious_child","358754","Your ignorance is astounding: http://www.4forums.com/political/258852-post68.html (notice you lied about me comparing them to fixed winged craft, in fact going so far as to explain the differences between fixed wing flight and everything else prior to you making the lie) Racist attacks and ignorance all in one package along with sheer and utter stupidity. How efficient of you. How bees fly has been known for quite some time. Dynamic stall - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Dynamic Stall, Unsteady Aerodynamics I do like Padion's statement: And interesting, that thread brings up several other ridiculously stupid things you've said. http://www.4forums.com/political/258698-post21.html Shadowpikachu pointed out that your argument for a photo of a dinosaur was just a tv prop. http://www.4forums.com/political/258726-post36.html Shadow again points out that you indeed did cite comic book art drawn on to rocks as evidence of creation. Either you were too damn lazy to read your own links, or you were trying to weasel out of another idiotic statement. Thanks, I needed to find the links to more statements proving you did exactly what I said you did. I'll bookmark that one for later reference Mr. ""Oil is not a hydrocarbon."" Still pretending you never said that one eh?","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","04:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","119"
