It's just that I'm dealing with people with the emotional stability of prepubescent children who have tantrums and hissy fits when I respond to your insults with irrefutable truths which you can't oppose with your irrational rants and hate based rhetoric. I'm dealing with people here who either defended daewoo's lies about using a hand grenade as a hammer or were too wimpy to stand up and oppose his lies due to your hatred for me. You proved right there that it isn't truth you seek, but the defense of a fellow deceiver and liar. And you hate me because I have single handedly opposed each and every one of you since arriving here. I have punched more holes in your shallow and empty world views than can be found in a window screen. Your so called theory of evolution is a sham which you can't defend with one iota of absolute scientifically tested and repeatable evidence. You rely on the so called evidence of flawed men who come to conclusions which can't be verified in any real way at all, yet they combine various so called observation, add them together and claim these prove that certain things occurred in certain orders multiple billions of years ago. Never realizing or admitting to themselves that if even one equation is off by one decimal point the impact that has on all of the combined theories renders them useless as originally intended. And that's just one decimal point for one theory. What if multiple decimal points are off by only that much? And I'm telling you they are. This means that the calculations you have relied on are as bogus as your world view is. But hey, I'm just a christian so what do I know, right? Well you will see one day what I knew, and you will learn that all of the people you clung to as allies lied to you and deceived you with their man made philosophies which agreed with you, while this christian whom you detest was the guy who showed you true love and respect because he dared to tell you the real truth which mattered in spite of the unending barrage of insults you spewed non stop at him. Truths which you rejected in your spiteful arrogance and will live to regret one day. Like I said earlier, I don't condemn you at all because you condemn yourself.","smiley","385022","You really should be a comedy writer.

He even fallaciously argues that we should abandon the benefits of modern science since we both recognize and reject this false science of evolution. People like you erroneously like to imply that because we reject the lie and fraud which evolution represents that we are anti-science. This is because you are extremists with no balanced insights at all. Here's my COMPLETE post which you quoted just part of, once again for clarification, just to show the objective observer how irrational your criticisms are as you bluster while making no correct or well thought out point at all.

"01-08-2010","10445",24,"Terry Pratchett, Science of Discworld","None","after the fact calculations of probabilities are meaningless. LETS HEAR IT FROM THE OTHER NINE! I want to explore just how dismissive the atheist mind really is concerning realities other than ""science"". after the fact calculations of probabilities are meaningless. [A viewer from another world looks down at prehistoric Earth] The ice age was clearing up. He wondered what was happening down there, what gastropod or mammal or lizard was even now winding up it's elastic ready to propel itself towards the crown of the world. Soon, without a doubt, some creature would develop an unnecessarily large brain and be forced to do things with it. And it'd look around and probably declare how marvellous it was that the universe had been built to bring forward the inevitable development of creature-kind. Boy, was it in for a shock...","iangb","385145","Not sure if I count as one of 'the other nine'*, but here goes nothing... Take a fair coin. Toss it 10 times. The probability that you will get that precise pattern of heads and tails is 1 in 2^10, or just under a 0.1% chance. However, that doesn't mean that the fact you got that incredibly unlikely pattern in a single set of tosses is not an 'indication that God exists'. Another example, and one that demonstrates one of the most common misunderstandings about 'unlikely events': Get 23 people in a room together. There is a greater than 50% chance that two of those people will share the same birthday , despite the fact that there are many more days in a year than people in the room. Increase that number up to 57 people - less than a sixth of the number of days in a year! - and the probability shoots up to over 99%. Again, the fact that two of them share a birthday would not indicate divine providence. There are a great many such examples I could have used, from the fact that someone wins the UK lottery most weeks (at odds of 14 million to one) to the fact that you exist, with your precise genetic code (at incalculable but astronomic odds, given the mixing of your parents DNA, all the factors that led your parents to meet each other etc, plus their parents and their parents and so on). The facts remain - firstly, 'statistically impossible' events happen all the time, because if they hadn't happened that particular way, they would have happened a slightly different way instead, as per the coin toss/your genes example. See my Pratchett quote, below. Secondly, lots of trials make even vanishing possibilities of a single event much, much more likely, as per the lottery/birthday problem example One final example of probability abuse would be refuted by snowflakes. Snowflakes are created by water molecules locking in place as the water transits from liquid to solid, as I'm sure you know (with a few extra complications). If you approach snowflake formation in the same manner that I have seen most ID arguments approach probability (for example, that of amino acids forming) then you would assume that molecules can form at any angle to each other and in any pattern, calculate the probability that all the water in a snowflake had frozen in that precise geometric pattern and conclude that all snowflakes must be Intelligently Designed. However, this simply isn't the case - not only are there lots of snowflakes, but the laws governing crystalline water result in beauty. That's not God - it's described by physics, not theology. I'll leave you with the words of Terry Pratchett, discussing the natural state of intelligent life. (Rant demoted to footnote status) *which, incidentally, you are getting close to by making blanket statements about 'the atheist mind'. Oh, and ignoring the fact that Archie has ignore the only actual refutation to his arguments (mine, post #323 and #325), instead focusing only on the flak. And claiming that you asking a newbie why he's spamming an anti-christian website is something that everyone who disagrees with you should be concerned with.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","07:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","356"

BTW crediot, you don't just oppose evolution, to do so you must reject all the sciences that support it, and by necessity all the ancillary disciplines based on those. That means if you had any balls, which we know you don't, you'd reject all aspect of modern life. When dealing with XXXXX creationists (redundant I know) there is little to do but insult them and point out their lack of critical thinkings skills. We already know they reject all knowledge. Since they crediots don't come to their position by teh use of facts and reason, we cannot use them to dissuade them. Crediots believe in magic and explain anyting they donw' like like the magic men they worship. With a little hand-wave you XXXXXX think you can do away with the facts. Get a life loser, you have done nothing that brings evolution into question. The simplistic by the numbers rhetoric you spout has no effect on scientific progress and you will continue to benefit from the work science provides you despite your derision of it - like I said you are a coward and a hypocrite.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","07:49 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","357"

Quote me producing that evidence cuz I don't see it. You see evo-XXXXX, just because you reject my perspective on the value and legitimacy of evolutionary science, and since you aren't the arbiter of any truth at all here or anywhere else in this world, then you don't have the right or authority to just label me as you see fit. Beside, I haven't lied about anything and have framed my arguments against evolution so coherently that I have reduced you apologists to this irrational, raving and specious response which this diatribe of a post is. The preposterous and therefore mindless ramblings you subject us to are in and of themselves an affront to common sense and rational discourse. Yet you spout these inane criticisms so easily, one would think you actually believe your massively ignorant assumptions regarding my beliefs about science in general. But if it floats your boat, you can think anything you like about me because it has no impact on my reality at all. Nice rant, too bad its just that and nothing more. Oh, and by the way my looney and irrational simpleton, I don't believe in magic in spite of what you and other deranged crazies say. It is actually outlawed and condemned in the bible. Here's what I mean for your edification, although I'm sure it's a waste of bandwidth. Those who follow the path of the magic arts are on the wrong path - a road that leads away from God, not toward Him. In one way or another, the end will be disaster. The evil Queen Jezebel practiced witchcraft (2 Kings 9:22) bringing catastrophe on herself and all Israel. Over and over, God denounces those who conjure spells (NKJV) and those who practice witchcraft and sorcery. The Bible says that anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord (Deuteronomy 18:10-12; 2 Kings 21:6; Micah 5:12; Isaiah 47:12; Ezekiel 13:18, 20; Acts 8:11-24; Leviticus 20:27; Exodus 7:11; Revelation 9:21; 22:15). God warns of the ultimate punishment. Revelation 21:8 says of ""those who practice magic arts their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur the second death"" (NIV). Those who practice witchcraft (sorcery) will not inherit the kingdom of God (Galatians 5:20-21). So like pandion and others around here, you throw labels around based on a complete ignorance of what I and other believers in Messiah actually believe in. Yet none of you have posted absolutely any evidence at all refuting my arguments. If I am so ignorant then why is it that all you guys have are these insulting rants against me while producing none of that scientific evidence you claim is so overwhelming. So nice demonstration of arrogance and sanctimony, but you have accomplished nothing more.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","01:28 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","358"
