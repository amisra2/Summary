Since I could post a hundred examples of you and your cohorts misinterpreting what I have clearly stated, so why should I accept this interpretation of yours of what you claim admin said when I have brought the issue up to him personally?

Does that about sum it up correctly? You know, you keep accusing everyone around here of dishonesty, or misinterpretation. Did you ever consider that the problem might be you? We have a whole forum here for you to prove your accusations of my dishonesty. You have yet to do it.

I may have missed it, but can anyone show how Arch's spamming (which violates forum rules and is grounds for banning) addresses anything I wrote in post 192? http://www.4forums.com/political/359217-post192.html Let's go over the facts. TQ calls Arch stupid partially on Arch's inability to do math. Arch replies directly calling TQ's worldview atheistic. As TQ's worldview clearly accepts that math is a fact, Arch logically by sequence of his posts believes that math is Atheism. Interesting how I got no response to this: ""T.Q insults you for your inability to do math (in addition to other things) and you reply calling his world view ""atheistic and secular."" He directly cited your inability to do math as part of his reason he insults you. Do you reject that this happened?

You can also find this permanently posted, HERE: 4Forums.com Political Debates and Polls - View Profile: Archangel I guess what gets me so flummoxed is that we have here a member in this obvious child (and evidently, smiley also)who is so absolutely dishonest, so blatant in his arrogance and delusions, that he feels he can state what my deep seeded beliefs are based on things I have never, ever said in any way. This liar must know he is perverting my beliefs but has such little respect for the truth and so little shame that he isn't even embarrassed about not only misrepresenting what I have said, but actually arguing and defending that fallacious stance after repeated denials by me, and my insistence that his interpretation of what I have said is absolutely false. Only in this generation do we have people like this mentally ill troll who will insist on telling another person what he believes after he has repeatedly told him he is wrong. I can't imagine a psychosis so severe in a person who is functioning in society that he will refuse to accept it when another person says NO, that isn't what I said or meant to say. I must assume that this lunatic is communicating from some institution and is safely being held behind locked doors and is under 24 hour watch by qualified medical personnel. So it becomes painfully obvious to me that attempting to reason with this sick and disturbed lunatic is a complete waste of my time as there is no reasoning with him. He will continue to argue such insane positions as I believe that because TQ insulted my ability to do math, and I responded by saying that I reject his atheistic and secular world view, that from that exchange, one must conclude that I then believe that anyone who relies on MATH must then be an ATHEIST. And only in his very sick and disturbed mind can my stating the FACT that scientists have studied the issue of BUMBLE BEES defying the laws of flight for decades, that in his psychosis induced mind have I argued and still believe that BEES CAN'T FLY AT ALL. Forget that I was speaking only of bumble bees in my original claim, and forget that I wasn't saying even they can't fly but was saying that they DEFY THE LAWS OF FLIGHT. To his disturbed reality, evidently that means I don't believe that any bees can fly anywhere despite a lifetime of seeing bees fly. Can you appreciate how sick such a person who makes such a claim as this obvious child is? That none of that matters to this mentally ill person is evidence that he has lost his grip on reality. And that is the most gracious conclusion I can come to here. Otherwise, if I don't conclude that he is mentally ill, the only other option is to conclude that he is a committed fabricator of facts, a false witness, a falsifier of reality, a maligner of his opponents stated beliefs, a purposeful perjurer, and an unapologetic prevaricator who prefers to lie about a persons beliefs in opposition to the stated truth of what another person insists they actually believe. So which is it? Either way what is painfully obvious is that attempting to reason with such a person is a complete waste of time. as he has proven to be beyond the capability of rational discourse. My only option if admin refuses to ban such a member, is to ignore him. So consider it done. His lies aren't worth defending against anyway since everyone can plainly see how he distorts what others say.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","10:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","250"

Couple his inability to read and comprehended the written word and a completely meritless belief system, it is all too common for Arch to lash out at others when his belief system is so thoroughly challenged. I cited him directly replying to T.Q's partial math based justification where Arch called T.Q's worldview atheistic. Furthermore, I cited how Arch scientifically was dead wrong from the beginning on bee flight. And I cited him on Tv props, rock art, his insane hydrocarbon comment and his recent grammar is dependent on the person, not the statement. Yet he still calls me a liar. I don't think he quite realizes the whole point was to show that he is in fact the ignorant one. After all, he did in fact saying "" [oil] and it ain't a hydrocarbon.""","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","05:41 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","253"

An explanation provides a reasoned, evidence based argument. All you did was go off on an insult filled tirade that provides absolutely no evidence of your claims. Furthermore, an explanation provides specific points and rebuttals, something your spamming has yet to to do. An explanation explicitly lays out specific arguments and corresponding evidence. A tirade fills posts with accusations and insults. T.Q insults you for your inability to do math (in addition to other things) and you reply calling his world view ""atheistic and secular."" He directly cited your inability to do math as part of his reason he insults you. Do you reject that this happened? Do you reject that you stated that Taz, who originally posted the joke on man's creation from dirt did not screw up the grammar, but I, who posted the joke verbatim did? Thus presenting the argument that you believe grammar is dependent upon the person, not the statement being made? Do you reject that this happened? I stated that oil was a hydrocarbon. You claimed it was not. You then cited from your own source a quote that you believed proved your point and followed it with a statement proclaiming that oil was not a hydrocarbon? Do you reject that this happened? You posted a picture you believed was a flying reptile that lived during the dinosaur era that was shot and killed by civil war soldiers as evidence of creation that was later proved to be a TV prop. Do you reject that this happened? You posted a link to Incan stone art that you alleged was evidence of man living with dinosaurs. It was later proved that the villagers had copied comic book art on to rocks to sell to dinosaurs. Do you reject that this happened? I can keep going.
