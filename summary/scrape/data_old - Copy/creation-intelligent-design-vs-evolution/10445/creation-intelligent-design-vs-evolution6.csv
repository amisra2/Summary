"10-05-2007","10445",6,"thelmoose","286772","The way I remember it, you claimed dragons have existed. Someone pointed out that the weight of a dragon would preclude their ability to fly. To that you replied: If you feel you have been misunderstood, tell us then, what really were you trying to say. Don't evade. Don't call anyone names. Just explain your position regarding birds, dragons and jumbo jets. Now is your chance. Either explain what you were trying to say, or let it go.","Archangel","286776","That's not good enough moose. Let obvious child quote my posts where he has stated categorically that I made these claims as if they were positive arguments I was making. Because that is what he has been claiming here in his mocking way. He has implied that I said these things as a matter of fact and either he supports that accusation by quoting me actually having said these things in my posts or he is the proven liar and slanderer that I am very clearly calling him. I am sick of explaining myself to you people when I communicate my thoughts very well before you take my clearly made arguments and twist them into something I never intended to say at all. And then by the time I have attempted to clarify myself and further explain what i originally meant, you schmucks have me claiming that I believe birds can't fly unless they have jet engines up their butts. So if that is what obvious child believes I said and is attributing that belief to me, then let him prove I said that by quoting the post where I said it. Once he posts it, I will then explain it. But he can't post it because I never said it. I don't believe and have never even had such a thought in my mind. So put up or shut up child because I'm not playing any more of your infantile head games.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","10:15 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","76"

Of course, his ""jet engines up the butt"" was a humourous representation of your point. Because you, indeed, cannot explain what you meant, you are dwelling on the literal details of his words. His point, however, is still well taken, you seem to think because a 747 can fly, then it stands to reason a dragon could as well. I was dumb enough to expect you would step up to the plate here. I can't believe I am actually talking about dragons.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","09:09 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","77"
"10-06-2007","10445",6,"Archangel","286827","So let this lying punk post me saying that birds need jet engines coming out of their butts in order to fly and I will gladly explain what I meant. I mean, if he sent it to chemist so he could get a good laugh at my expense then surely he can post the exact link of me saying that so we can all get a good laugh together, right ? Either that or he owes me an apology.","jim's trucking","286830","Don't hold your breath. Neither will happen. There's a technique used quite often by adolescent posters that involves rewording what you say and presenting it as a quote or an ""oh, so you think....(their words)?"" It a version of strawman.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","12:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","79"

I know of no more A dishonest way of debating, but child and SP have practiced it exclusively since first debating them, not to mention a few others also. That's why I'm calling for him to post the actual statement I made in order to prove he isn't a cowardly liar who must twist what others actually say in order to feel like he is winning. But like the philisophical coward he is, he will just slink away until he can use the same tactics on some newer, unsuspecting member. My whole reason for calling him on it was because he has done the same thing to Benjamin, fiendslayer and ENRI.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","02:51 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","80"

"10-06-2007","10445",6,"Archangel","286827","Sorry moose but I don't know what to respond to. Let this liar post my actual post which he mockingly accuses me of saying in these quotes above and I will gladly respond to them. But why should I explain statements I never made?

Either that or he owes me an apology.[/B] Then explain how a 747 wide body flies then. Its wings dont even flap like a birds or dragons. Have you considered that the wings might be sized in proportion to its mass","obvious_child","286857","Moose posted from the link I gave you which shows your quote. He provided what you asked for.

If it isn't a literal quotation, they believe they didn't make it. Apparently going from A to B to C in a logical fashion doesn't make any sense to them and thus they deny it. Argument via absurd isn't going to work with them.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","04:55 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","84"
"10-06-2007","10445",6,"ShadowPikachu","286856","YEs, EZ, I am expecting you to either substantiate your f-ing slander, or retract it. But then, that's what I would expect of a normal honest person, so I guess I can't really expect that out of you. Nevertheless, either support your slander (typically if one makes such slanderous accusations, one usually has evidence to support them - either that or one is completely retarted) or retract it (and if you do neither, you will be reported for making offensive slanderous accusations without providing any evidence)","Archangel","286863","You're a true laugh riot with your cheap threats of reporting me. I truly marvel that you can be such a hypocrite as you make false accusations about me while demanding retractions from me, and not even see it in yourself . I'll make a deal with you though, when you either prove I'm EZ, or retract that false accusation then I'll consider retracting what I said.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","05:14 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","85"

Now, you must be really dense, because you are accusing me of "" rewording what you say and presenting it as a quote or an ""oh, so you think....(their words)?"" It a version of strawman."" to quote Jim whom you agreed with and named me as one who does this, and then you think this compares to saying that someone is very similar to another poster, and pointing out observational evidence that suggests that the two posters may actually be the same. If you think those two are comparable, your f-ed up.
