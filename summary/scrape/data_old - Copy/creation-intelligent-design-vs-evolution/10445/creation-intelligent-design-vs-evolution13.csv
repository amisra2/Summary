Remember, it was TQ who based him on his inability to do math and Arch replied directly that T.Q's worldview was atheistic. I do find it funny how someone who thinks that grammar is dependent upon the person saying a statement rather than the statement is criticizing someone over spelling. I think I'll intentionally misspell words and then capitalize the incorrect letters just to annoy him. Maybe he'll finally get something right pointing out something I intentionally did wrong? It is funny how Arch can't respond to what I actually wrote. Disagree with Arch in any way and you hate Christianity and God. Insane, but that's Arch.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","04:19 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","185"

GO ON CHILD, I CHALLENGE YOU ONCE AGAIN TO QUOTE ME EVER SAYING THAT MATH EQUALS ATHEISM, AND ACTUALLY MEANING THAT ANYONE WHO BELIEVES IN MATH OR RELIES ON IT MUST BE AN ATHEIST. BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE ASSERTING HERE. SO GO ON AND PROVE YOU'RE NOT A BLATANT LIAR ONCE AGAIN BY COMPLETELY AND DISHONESTLY MISREPRESENTING SOMETHING I SAID IN A PAST DEBATE. Rom 1:18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, Rom 1:19 because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them. Rom 1:20 For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse. Rom 1:21 For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Rom 1:22 Professing to be wise, they became fools,","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","05:37 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","186"

How much remedial reading would Arch need to understand that I never said that he said math = atheism? But that he instead calling a worldview that accepts math as a fact to be atheism?","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","09:51 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","188"

T.Q insults you for your inability to do math (in addition to other things) and you reply calling his world view ""atheistic and secular.""","Archangel","359208","My Lord, you are as dense as a rock. Tell us how rejecting an atheistic world view translates into attributing math to atheism? Are you actually stating that math equals the sum total of TQs world view?

T.Q insults you for your inability to do math (in addition to other things) and you reply calling his world view ""atheistic and secular."" He directly cited your inability to do math as part of his reason he insults you. Do you reject that this happened? One really must wonder if you can read. Notice I said this ""T.Q insults you for your inability to do math ( in addition to other things )"" Simple fact of the matter is TQ said you were stupid partially because you can't do basic math. You then directly replied to that calling his world view ""atheistic."" As math is part of TQ's world view, you consider math to be atheism. If you didn't believe math wasn't atheism, you wouldn't have called his world view atheistic after he directly cited your inability to do math as a reason you are stupid. How do you not think math is atheistic? Still pretending you never argued that bees can't fly according to science eh? And you never said oil wasn't a hydrocarbon? That tv props were evidence of creation? That rock art was evidence of creation? That you never argued that grammar is dependent upon the person rather than the statement? Do you really think we don't consider you extremely ignorant when you have done all of that?","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","12:33 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","192"
"07-01-2009","10445",13,"Accipiter","359224","You remind me of someone that has been brainwashed by a cult.","obvious_child","359226","Nah, Arch has this delusional view that he and only he can speak for Christianity. He and only he can define it. He and only he can interpret it. Thus, if you criticize his interpretation, you attack the religion. Arch has been tying his views on Christianity to Christianity itself since I've been here and likely much longer. It's been pointed out many times and he just ignores it. Thus, you see him calling other Christians like Matthew not Christians because they disagree with him. So whenever Arch claims you are an atheist or you hate God or something truly asinine (as he always does) when you disagree with his view of Christianity, just shrug it off. If anything he's a heretic given his insane views and his delusions of grandeur. And Arch doesn't worship Christ. He worships the Bible. The Bible, not Christ is his God.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","04:27 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","193"
"07-01-2009","10445",13,"None","None","None","Archangel","359231","I guess what gets me so flummoxed is that we have here a member in this obvious child who is so absolutely dishonest, that he is so blatant in his arrogance and delusions, that he feels he can state what my deep seeded beliefs are based on things I have never, ever said in any way. This liar knows he is perverting my beliefs but has such little respect for the truth and so little shame that he isn't even embarrassed about not only misrepresenting what I have said, but actually arguing and defending that fallacious stance after my repeated denials by me that his interpretation of what I have said is absolutely false. Only in this generation do we have people like this mentally ill troll who will insist on telling another person what he believes after he has repeatedly told him he is wrong. I can't imagine a psychosis so severe in a person who is functioning in society that he will refuse to accept it when another person says NO, that isn't what I said or meant to say. I must assume that this lunatic is communicating from some institution and is safely being held behind locked doors and is under 24 hour watch by qualified medical personnel. So it becomes painfully obvious to me that attempting to reason with this sick and disturbed lunatic is a complete waste of my time as there is no reasoning with him. He will continue to argue such insane positions as I believe that because TQ insulted my ability to do math, and I responded by saying that I reject his atheistic and secular world view, that from that exchange, one must conclude that I then believe that anyone who relies on MATH must then be an ATHEIST. And only in his very sick and disturbed mind can my stating the FACT that scientists have studied the issue of BUMBLE BEES defying the laws of flight for decades, that in his psychosis induced mind have I argued and still believe that BEES CAN'T FLY AT ALL. Forget that I was speaking only of bumble bees in my original claim, and forget that I wasn't saying even they can't fly but was saying that they DEFY THE LAWS OF FLIGHT. To his disturbed reality, evidently that means I don't believe that any bees can fly anywhere despite a lifetime of seeing bees fly. Can you appreciate how sick such a person who makes such a claim as this obvious child is? That none of that matters to this mentally ill person is evidence that he has lost his grip on reality. And that is the most gracious conclusion I can come to here. Otherwise, if I don't conclude that he is mentally ill, the only other option is to conclude that he is a committed fabricator of facts, a false witness, a falsifier of reality, a maligner of his opponents stated beliefs, a purposeful perjurer, and an unapologetic prevaricator who prefers to lie about a persons beliefs in opposition to the stated truth of what another person insists they actually believe. So which is it? Either way what is painfully obvious is that attempting to reason with such a person is a complete waste of time. as he has proven to be beyond the capability of rational discourse. My only option if admin refuses to ban such a member, is to ignore him. So consider it done. His lies aren't worth defending against anyway since everyone can plainly see how he distorts what others say.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","06:20 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","194"
