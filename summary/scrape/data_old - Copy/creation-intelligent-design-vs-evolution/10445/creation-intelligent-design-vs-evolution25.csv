No evidence of my ignorance, mind you. But simply accusations via rants and diatribes which are founded in the abject hatred for anything good and righteous since I (we) recognize and acknowledge the living Creator God who called all that is in time and space into being. I cannot be any more clear in defining what I believe for you mooks, yet all I will get in response are personal attacks which contribute nothing at all to proving your world view is anything more than the ignorant imaginings of sheeple who are encouraged with compliments of intellectual insight into following man made lies which lead you down a completely bogus and unprovable and assumed 14.5 BILLION year old man made fairy tale. Yet I must be subjected to the irrational label that I am the stupid one? The arrogance your side presents is mind numbing. At least this is a somewhat fair fight though since I alone in most cases take on your side without any assistance at all. I love it when marc, Easyrider and a couple of other friends pipe in to contribute opinions in debates like this, but they realize very well that I don't need any actual assistance in handling a combination of any 10 of you at one time. Which is usually what I'm up against. It's when I get multiple posts which only attack my intelligence, but offer no substantial arguments at all that lets me and all observers know that I am pummeling you schmucks. Especially since I get PM after PM encouraging me from people who refer to these threads but never actually post on them. There's a reason why my profile http://www.4forums.com/political/members/archangel.html has so many views accipiter, it's because people care about my opinions and consider me a consistent and thoughtful defender of traditional and conservative values, not to mention rational science in opposition to the man made philosophies with a specific agenda such as Evolution and Anthropogenic Global Warming which you sheeple support, promote and defend.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","10:39 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","367"

And after years on the forum still fails to get my gender right. Not that I'm insulted by the error mind you, I'm feeling rather beautiful at the moment as I imagine a female version of myself. At least you're consistent in your style and tactics, pinhead, err I mean penfold.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","10:46 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","368"

I can stay on topic as I do and focus only on the arguments I am presenting as I do, and the only responses I get are similar to this one from you which doesn't even quote or concentrate on the content of my arguments but focusses on making ignorant and senseless quips like this one. Beside that, you completely miss the point of my post. I wasn't complaining about the way I am treated you your side, I was simply exposing it in clear and undeniable terms. And of course, you prove my point for me by responding with this inane post which verifies my opinion. Really? What is extraneous info from my post? I have learned from past experience that your ilk is as slippery as eels so if I'm not painfully clear in my expository, you know, very descriptive? That you will weasel out by misinterpreting the point I'm actually making or ignore it all together, precisely as you have done here. I know I have been painfully clear when I get responses like this one which just snipe while not daring to quote even one line from my post and responding to it with that actual evidence of the big bang you keep implying I'm too stupid to comprehend. And has anyone noticed that there is still no evidence of anything these self important pseudo intellectuals believe to be true, but just more focussing on me? It's very telling isn't it!!!","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","12:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","371"
"01-09-2010","10445",25,"iangb","385219","*raises hand* Actually... you've simply ignored mine. Care to look at it?","Archangel","385221","Sure, as soon as you post undeniable evidence that your posted beliefs are factually irrefutable evidence of events which occurred between 4.5 BILLION and 14.5 BILLION years ago regarding the claimed formation of our Universe and our Earth. Show the repeatable experiments which have proven these events to have definitely occurred when, and as your pseudo science claims they did with consistent parallel supporting science. Then and only then will we have something real and substantial to discuss. Meanwhile we're going shopping so you'll have time to post your fiction.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","12:10 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","372"

Let's see, iangb answers your post, presents a well thought, reasoned rebuttal, and is ignored. After two days of reminding you that he answered your post and is waiting for your reply (while you rant about how no one even attempted to address your arguments), you respond by completely ignoring what he said You are ignorant, arrogant, pathetically stupid, and not worth the cost of bandwidth that is used to store your insanely insulting (to anyone of mooderate intelligence) rants.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","12:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","373"
"01-09-2010","10445",25,"Archangel","385189","Ahh, the declaration of the arrogant, haughty, conceited, self-important, egotist who's full of oneself and the superior atheist who believes that any faith in the ONE true Creator God of this world is magic and intellectual ghetto thinking. How unique of you. Oh wait, it isn't unique at all but is the SOP of atheists everywhere to make these presumptuous assertions while proving none of them, once again.","Promethean","385228","What a XXXXX you must be to belief that evolution is Godless. That's the certainty that con only come from absolute fund!e ignorance. The FACT is that the largest Christian denomination accepts evolution as a fact and do most moderate Christian sects, so do the Jews that gave rise to Christianity and all but your equally fundamentalist Muslims. But that's the usual level of stupid arguments we get from you retards, complaining about ""atheists"" science while at the same time enjoying all the benefits that it provides you. Again it makes you a coward and hypocrite.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","12:29 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","374"
