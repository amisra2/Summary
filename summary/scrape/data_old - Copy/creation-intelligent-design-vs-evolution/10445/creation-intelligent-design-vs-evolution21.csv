His unbalanced relationship with one of them in particular, where all things positive are attributed to the invisible friend, whereas all the vile thoughts, negativity and personal failures are ascribed to himself, is likely part of his pathology.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","07:12 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","301"

"01-04-2010","10445",21,"Archangel","384519","So we all are mentally ill, correct? We are all victims of the same mass delusion, or are all liars, depending on the nature of our illness? So who again is the LIAR Promethean?","Promethean","384617","The 1918 Pandemic also affected millions.

"01-04-2010","10445",21,"OLEG","384458","The Big Bang arose from a singularity not from nothing. This is a clear sign that th reader doesn't understand cosmology or science. Yet we are supposed to believe that a God created the universe out of nothing especially since there is no shred of evidence for a God. This topic is covered extensively in the online monthly magazine - Science and Discovery. These folks also debunk the Bible and other religious nonsence. The name of the organization which I suggest everyone look at is Science Club of Long Island.","marc9000","384625","There is one shred, that life exists. There is not a shred of evidence that life came into being by only natural processes. Here is the homepage of the site you suggest; Science Club of Long Island Home Page There are seven links called ""evil Bible"", highlighted in red, all going to the same place, that attempt to debunk the Bible and promote atheism - about 30 more links there. Yet the site's mission statement only describes science, nothing about religion or atheism. Why the dishonesty?","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","07:37 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","306"
