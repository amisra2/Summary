Who gave you the idea that nature must adhere to what you define as common sense. The common sense of light being a particle and a wave is hard to find. The patterns formed by diffraction which means a particle is in two places at once is not common sense. The fact that a marble pulls on the earth as strongly as the earth pull on it is not common sense. Common sense is where the ignorant retreat when they find the facts inconvenient. If it was perfect it there would be no evolution, which even the most ardent creationists agree that there is. Fool! It's science. And treated as such by anyone who has studied the subject. Supported by the fossil evidence. What are the odds... And show your work fundie. Observed. You believe in magic. Actually is based on mountains of evidence coming from nearly every discipline in science. Bigger BS, you are not likely to find.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","08:16 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","331"

The truly shallow and uninspired rantings of you pseudo intellectuals who actually believe that the chaotic theory of evolution led to this marvelous and inspired creation we inhabit and are a reflection of proves how blind and lacking of any spiritual depth you are as human beings. I actually mourn for you and wish I had the power to enlighten you by giving you the ability to see what so many of us do. I remember being all alone within myself and going to bed at night not knowing if God exists and feeling so empty as I yearned to know the answer to that question. My prayer was if you exist God, please reveal yourself to me and I will follow you. I had no idea that I was fulfilling the passage which says, ""If you grope out into the darkness, I will find you."" I just wish I could impart that desire to know the objective and unknowable truth to you who scoff, mock, insult and feel so superior in your ignorant and uninspired sanctimony. I wish I had that power, but alas, life is an individual journey and each of us is responsible to seek the truth for ourselves. Sadly, your truth is the shallow and mythological imaginings of fallen men who have created this fraud out of whole cloth. Like the recently exposed anthropogenic global warming scam, you have fallen victim to an older but still an agenda driven fraud which is atheistic in nature and seeks to steal from God the credit, honor, respect and glory He rightfully deserves as the maker of all that is in time and space. These liars have spoken for multiple billions of years of past history and you neanderthals are so simple in your ability to reason that you buy their fairy tales when we see in real time every day that man is incapable of expelling what caused last weeks weather to occur as it did. With that said, I send you not curses or condemnations, but blessings and a warning that you are following the creation rather than the creator and that will never work out for you in the end. So I leave you with this absolute and eternal promise.

"01-06-2010","10445",23,"Archangel","384794","Here's the problem with your chosen mythology, pandit. It lacks any semblance of common sense, and based on the bolded, even you aren't stupid enough to claim it is absolutely proven in any way, shape or form. Here's what I mean, we see before us and exist within an Earth which is a perfectly functioning and self sufficient ecosystem with an unbroken chain of symbiotic life forms which are not only interdependent to each other, but compliment each other on an environmentally balanced chemical level and food chain from the simplest single celled life forms up to the largest apex creatures in each of the species and ecosystems which inhabit this planet. To summarize your problem as simply as possible, your pseudo science claims that life spontaneously appeared by a complete accident 4.5 billion years ago in an unknown, unprovable and unverifiable environment which is completely based on theoretical but also unprovable so called observations which aren't actually real time observations at all since the event being discussed occurred this theoretical 4.5 billion years ago. And from this unprovable accident of mathematically impossible odds, you then claim that through a series of random mutations leading to a process coined by a term by proponents of this myth referred to as natural selection which teaches that each generation fights to survive with no concern for the other life forms which it shares space with. But you believe that from this chaotic struggle for improved life via evolution, that it is rationale that we ended up with this perfectly balanced and cooperating environment? Pleeaasse pandion, you embarrass yourself when you claim that what you believe in by faith is more rational than what we believe in by faith. The fact is that nothing you accept can be proven absolutely either. And it all relies on massive conclusions which are based on completely unprovable assumptions. My God is self evident in every atom and molecule which holds the matter and energy of this universe together. And you will find one day that just because you were blind to that FACT, your lack of insight did nothing to nullify or negate His place as the Master Creator of all that exists in time and space. And that is as sure a guarantee as the blood Jesus shed for your sins on that historic and blessed day 2000 years ago.","pandion","384906","That's great, Archy! I appreciate the fact that in your inability to get my handle correct that you assign to me an Indian honorific that means ""wise or learned."" Or perhaps it was by intention. I would never refer to myself as either wise or learned, although I am well educated. And your belief in the mythology of bronze age nomadic herdsmen somehow indicates common sense? Since when did magic become common sense? How is it anything but nonsense to claim certain knowledge because of something that you don't know? Perhaps if you made an effort to learn what science is and how it works you wouldn't make yourself look like such a fool by demanding ""proof."" Science doesn't offer proof. It offers natural explanations of observations of natural phenomena. The other side of the coin is that you claim truth based on mythology that isn't based on a single bit of observable evidence. Of course I don't claim proof for science. I'm neither stupid nor a fool. On the other hand, you can't claim the same. I suspect that you don't actually understand any of the scientific terms that you used. Symbiotic life forms do not form interdependent chains. You only make yourself look foolish when you speak without learning at least the basics about which you speak. Neither predator/prey nor parasite/host relationships are symbiotic. The religious claptrap of the chain of being from primitive to advanced was rejected hundreds of years ago, with the development of real, empirical science. But still, we have the uneducated fundamentalists, like you, who are living in the middle ages. Actually, no. I don't claim that life spontaneously appeared by accident 4.5 billion years ago. The earth is only about 4.5 billion years old and only a fool would assert that life arose with the formation of the earth. However, there is fossil evidence that life had arisen by about 3.8 billion years ago. I don't personally make any claims about how that happened. I don't know. I do think that it was by natural means, since there is no evidence of the magic that you claim as the cause. As I stated, life is evidence of life. Nothing more. Don't be stupid. I have watched hawks preying on doves in my back yard. How is it that you think that the dove cooperates with the hawk? As for any claims of mathematical impossibility, I wouldn't be so stupid. I leave that to creationists who seem to lack the intelligence to understand that after the fact calculations of probabilities are meaningless. Please explain to me about the concern that lions have for the animals that they eat. Pleeaasse! That's pandit pandion, to you. Or wise pandion, or learned pandion will do. But I don't ""believe"" in evolutionary biology ""by faith."" My faith is something quite different from what you think it is. But it was a nice try in trying to reduce a body of scientific theory to the level of belief in magic. What you believe in by faith is nothing more that a belief in magic and the mythology of an old book. Actually, what I accept isn't based on assumptions. I base it on lots of empirical evidence that I have studied for many years. But if you want to talk about unprovable assumptions, why don't you explain to us why any rational person should accept the idiocy of the mythology of bronze age nomadic herdsmen as true. How is that not an assumption? That's just ignorant. If your petty magic man were self evident then there wouldn't be any debate. Your god is mythological. No better and no worse than any other mythological god. I would have been disappointed if you had not ended your ridiculous rant with the typical fundy threat. Disagree with you and burn in hell. Make an effort to learn so that you don't make yourself look so foolish.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","11:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","334"

You understand neither secular humanism nor spiritual awareness. Probably because both are so foreign to you. One of the tenets of secular humanism is spiritual awareness. But it is you who is promoting mythology. You have been shown to be wrong again and again, and yet you claim that you haven't been refuted. The accusations of stupidity are because you don't seem to understand and are unable to learn. See? Evolution has been explained to you time and time again, and still you spout such stupidity. What drivel! Your emotional experiences are only evidence of your willingness to base decisions on emotions rather than rational consideration of your actions. Spare us the sermons. You waste our time with your mythological nonsense.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","11:37 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","335"

Secular humanism and spiritual awareness are opposing value systems and never the twain shall meet. So you and your cohorts can insist as a matter of assumed fact that because I and hundreds of millions of born again believers, believe as we do that we must be stupid if you like, but that doesn't bother me at all since I know truths which you are too spiritually dead to see or be aware of. Which of course is why you arrogantly think we are stupid. That is why I don't condemn you at all because you are condemning yourself. Your ilk completely ignores a complete dimension of who and what you are as children of the King. You lack all insights regarding the spiritual relationship which is an integral part of who we are as human beings. This massive handicap means that you are literally dead to that aspect of reality which again is why I mourn for you rather than feel the need to condemn you. According to every spiritual law in Gods word you are condemning yourself. And unfortunately, you will never grasp or comprehend that fact until the reality of it hits you head on the day you cross over into eternity. That's why my prayer for you tq is, may God have mercy on the spiritually dead, empty vessel which you are on that final day.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","05:01 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","337"
