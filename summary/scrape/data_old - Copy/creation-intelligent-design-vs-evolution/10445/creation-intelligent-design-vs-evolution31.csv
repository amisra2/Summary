He'll withdraw for now, denying his trouncing, but his arguments will be resurrected within a few months, shiny new and exactly the same.","Accipiter","386536","I didnt defeat him, everybody else did.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","02:45 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","451"

God created the the universe complete with all sorts of evidence to make it appear that it is much older than it in fact is. For instance, evidence would suggest that you made your last post just over an hour ago, but the universe is only one hour old, so none of this actually happened. God has just made it appear that way (he is the great deciever after all). So, all the evidence would make it appear that Archie was defeated in this debate, but it never actually happened, so evidently he did not lose. This will all become clear, as Penfold explained, in a few day/weeks/months Archie will resurrect his very same arguments as if none of this has happened, which of course it hasn't because the universe is truly only an hour old. It just looks older. Got it?","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","04:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","454"

I very well could have literally been born yesterday! As for the rest I dont understand it so it must be hogwash.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","05:32 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","455"

Simply put, if the likes of Archie can ignore vast amounts of evidence and claim that the universe is just thousands of years old (claiming that his god created it to look that way), then it would make just as much sense to pick any other point in time and claim that that was when the universe was created and that all the evidence that suggests otherwise (craters, rock/ice layers, memories, written records etc) were just created that way. I think I'm going to use this argument when I next commit some major crime. I will just claim that all the evidence was created by god (along with the rest of the universe) at some point just after the crime is alledged to have happened. I will then cry some sort of discrimination/victimisation when my religion is questioned. I'm sure I'll get off.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","04:43 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","456"
