Not only is that spamming (which is a forum rules violation), but that spam is based upon beliefs you hold that have been proven to be false. I proved you said oil was not a hydrocarbon. I proved you argued that modern rock art proved YEC I proved you argued a tv prop proved YEC I proved you called math atheism I proved you said bees can't fly scientifically I proved you argued that grammar is dependent upon the person not the statement Call me all kinds of names which violate the forum rules all you want, but you are incapable of addressing those absolute concrete citations which back up my claims. Where is your evidence I actually lied? Simple: It does not exist. You have no evidence to support your tirades. EvC Forum: Human Evolution (re: If evolved from apes, why still apes?) http://www.4forums.com/political/360868-post281.html http://www.4forums.com/political/360776-post274.html If I'm such a liar, why does the Taz link show that I quoted his joke verbatim? After all, you claimed Taz did not screw up the grammar, but I did. As the link shows, I quoted him verbatim. Therefore, you believe that grammar is dependent upon the person, not the statement. Post 266 predicts you will ignore the link. And what do you do? Ignore the link.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","11:20 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","287"

LOL","Nebuchadnezzar","362333","My own personal beliefs aside, making nifty little insults that you deem as clever in your mind make you look like an XXX. Report my post if you must, but I hate it when I'm not taken seriously by an evolutionist because they think that all creationists have to toss in insults to defend themselves. Saying someone else is dumb does not prove them dumb or prove yourself intelligent. The same thing goes for good and evil. Evolution could have been God's device for creating the world. It does not have to be ""evil"" or ""wrong"" within the Christian or Jewish belief system. It could have taken six days. It could have taken six million years. It could have been instantly. What is time to a timeless being? Time could be described as non-existent (created as a measurement by man), relative (time depends on the objects speed versus lights speed and slows down as you go faster), or constant (time never really changes, but we are measured against the constant) depending on your point of view. Now here's something I wonder about, and forgive me for holes in it but it is purely off-the-wall brainstorming. If you find a wormhole that takes 10 minutes to traverse 300 lightyears from earth, then you will see the earth 300 years ago from that point in space, correct? Following that thinking, if you find the origin of the universe according to The Big Bang Theory, traverse a wormhole however many lightyears you deem the universe has existed away from it (ultimately hitting the edge of the universe) and traverse to that point in space nearly instantly so that you can see nearly the beginning of the universe, would you see nothing when you look back? Could you see the universe forming when you are occupying space that has already been formed millions of years later?","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","04:34 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","289"

There is no evidence to rule out God and still no evidence to support it. However, claiming that the Bible's account for creation can be in agreement with measurable and observable evidence is completely false. Stop trying change the Bible's story to make things feasible. The fact is that the Bible was written by man and they meant exactly what they said. Six days is six days.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","01:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","290"

Prove it with absolutely undeniable evidence which cosmologists will defend as irrefutable, if you can. Now let the excuses fly as you admit that nothing in science is absolute, that all we can do is make observations and extrapolate possible outcomes from them until new observations arise which either confirm or refute those previously accepted observations. What is clear is that you don't understand science or cosmology since you are sounding very absolute in your claims here when you can't get one cosmologist to speak with any certainty at all as you are doing. Not ""A"" God, ""THE"" living God of all creation. His name is Yahweh and I would place my faith in His power to speak creation into existence in a heartbeat over your choice to place your faith in the imaginary claims of fallen man as he claims that life spontaneously and accidentally arose from non-life 4.5 billion years ago. I want to see your absolute evidence of this which has been proven under laboratory conditions with repeatable experiments which confirm the theory which says it actually occurred. Go on Egor, err, I mean oleg, show me the ""science"" which supports your bogus and fairy tale claims. Stop spamming us with your on line source of propaganda and just produce the evidence to support your claims if you can. And I mean absolute evidence which is irrefutable since you seem so absolutely convinced of what you say are scientific facts.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","12:20 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","292"

But it is just more delusional drivel when all is said and done in life. My faith demands just the opposite of what you claim. It demands that I not trust any man for what I believe but that I go to a higher source for my beliefs. And by higher I mean the highest source as in God Himself who indwells me via His Holy Spirit. You have no concept of the connection between believers and our heavenly Father via the indwelling of His Holy Spirit which dwells within us from the time we accept Him and are born again until the time we shed this flesh and go to be with Him for eternity. I feel so sad for the rude awakening which awaits you when you cross over and realize that it was you in your shallow and hollow arrogance who was the one who's faith in MAN demanded that you reject the reality which is so clear to us. That it was you in your arrogance who scoffed at the deeper truths we share with you regarding a spiritual dimension which you are completely blind to. How sad it is that you want to come back to me with a response of ""See what I mean?"" as you disregard my warning by arrogantly implying that I'm brainwashed by men rather than speaking from first hand personal experience about our heavenly father who loves you as much as He loves me, and will truly mourn your loss as you condemn yourself on that final day. So keep your sanctimonious quips coming penfold, because as surely as I'm writing this post, you will regret your spiritual blindness one day and you'll learn that the joke was on you the whole time.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","08:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","296"

So we all are mentally ill, correct? We are all victims of the same mass delusion, or are all liars, depending on the nature of our illness? Or maybe it is you deniers of the spiritual nature of Man and that the dimension of our Trinity is real only because you are personally blind to it? How sad it is that you have no idea who or what you are. You live in the ghetto and squalor of secular humanism, clinging to the limitations of natural man as you claim a lineage from the lower animals and ignore and reject the nobility of salvation and the crown of Glory which comes with accepting your inheritance as sons and daughters of the living God who created us all in His image for fellowship. And you are so arrogant in your ignorance that you think the mental illness and shortcomings which lead to these delusions are mine? If the consequences of your error weren't so absolute and eternal, it would be funny. But there is nothing humorous about the error of secular humanism/atheism. And isn't it interesting that the very first sentence of your post actually admits a deeper truth about a fundamental problem with evolution. Like Global Warming which science also can't come to a consensus on, evolution is equally as great a fraud as that pseudo science which has just been outed as rigged science designed to push an agenda rather than follow the rigors and methodologies of true science and reporting on unbiased results. Only dishonest evolutionists seem blind to the inconsistencies which define this scam which is evidenced by the fact that ever since I asked for solid evidence from your propagandists, all I have gotten back from the lot of you are personal attacks, but lo and behold, none of the absolute evidence I requested from OLEG. So who again is the LIAR Promethean?","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","05:09 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","300"
