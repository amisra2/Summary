I never said that Arch said that ""birds can't fly because they don't have jet engines coming out of their butts."" I said that he believed that. I then provided the link that with inductive reasoning shows that he did. The thread also shows a clear lack of any rebuttal by Arch against Pandion who made the comment. If Arch did not believe, he would have made a comment about that. Instead the thread goes on about how bumblee bees can't fly because the calculations for fixed wing say so. This is solidly refuted and Arch pretends in that thread that he never made the argument. Therefore I am not lying as Arch says I am. I never said that Arch stated the comment. Merely believed. As Moose's quote from the thread clearly shows that Arch made a comment linking both birds and a 747 saying one can't fly due to some ridiculous reason, any reasonable person could deduce what I have and many people have coupled with the lack of rebuttal to Pandion, I am in the clear.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","06:06 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","92"
"10-06-2007","10445",7,"ShadowPikachu","286869","I called you EZ because you suggested I was obviouschild - and BTW, I've already pointed out some strong supporting evidence as to you being EZ. Now, you must be really dense, because you are accusing me of "" rewording what you say and presenting it as a quote or an ""oh, so you think....(their words)?"" It a version of strawman."" to quote Jim whom you agreed with and named me as one who does this, and then you think this compares to saying that someone is very similar to another poster, and pointing out observational evidence that suggests that the two posters may actually be the same. If you think those two are comparable, your f-ed up. Now retract your slander - this is your last opportunity.","Archangel","286883","Regarding the bolded, now there is another lie. You just can't help it, can you. And since this is the only thread I have been on in more than a month or so, and you accused me of being EZ on this thread, all anyone has to do is go back and see who made the accusation first. Talk about pathetic though.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","06:48 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","93"

"10-06-2007","10445",7,"obvious_child","286870","Wow you are lazy. I provided you the link to the page. Moose provided you the direct quote. What more do you want? Seriously, does Jesus smile upon sheer laziness and sloth? I remember a quote, ""idle hands are the devil's playthings"" http://www.4forums.com/political/sho...4&postcount=51 Geez, lazy... I already did post the link...you're just lazy.","Archangel","286885","Where did I say anything about birds not being able to fly without jet propulsion ? Now let me show the great flaw in the argument you were attempting to make. On the one hand you insist that Dragons in no way ever existed, yet in your evidence to prove they didn't exist you referred to wing span to mass ratios as evidence that the implication that they could fly is ridiculous. Tell me how that is the least bit rational argument ? First you say they couldn't exist then you show how their wing spans weren't in proportion to their bodies to allow for flight. QUESTION... If they never existed, how do you know their wingspans per body proportion ? But as usual you make off the wall claims with absolutely nothing to support your moronic and irrational contentions. And you don't even see the contradictions in your ludicrous arguments. And then you proceeded to mock me for my beliefs. Maybe that explains why I walked away in total frustration and unable to deal with you any further.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","07:13 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","95"

Under that logic, saying that a argument against birds with the wing spans of hundreds of feet using the same arguments are ridiculous. Do you even understand the wing span to mass to muscle relation? I don't see how that's ridiculous. By mythological statements about their alleged sizes. Furthermore we know just how much lift and energy is required to move mass off the ground. That can be correlated to necessary wing muscle and area necessary to generate such lift. Now if you put flapping in, the muscle requirements exponentially grow. Birds that primarily soar have much less wing muscle then birds that rely on flapping to move. With that exponential muscle and corresponding wing mass, the heat loss is exponential, thus increasing the necessary food requirements. So adding up the muscle, heat loss, size and necessary food requirements, the idea of a medieval type dragon is ridiculous. Now the Asian dragon myth is even more insane as those don't have wings yet can fly and even maneuver like a insect in flight. Just because you lack the engineering understanding along with biological background doesn't make us wrong: it just makes you foolish. Read above. I did predict that you would make yourself look foolish. And I'm right. Translation: AA doesn't have the maturity to ever admit he's wrong.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","07:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","97"

Why did you flee that thread when so many people started to mock you? What makes you think that your little comment here will hold water against a historical thread that has numerous posts all deriding you for your massive ignorance? And I see once again you'd rather flee like a coward then address refutations of your arguments. And you say you win arguments. Win by running away like a little girl....","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","04:29 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","101"

"10-07-2007","10445",7,"chemist99a","286944","One can make nearly any object fly if you have sufficient power. For example consider the Saturn V rockets. No wings, not many control surfaces. Flies like crazy with over 6 million pounds of thrust. I saw one launch once upon a time. Now thats a takeoff! Bit noisy though. When they tested the engines in Huntsville the ground literally shook for miles around. But whats clear is that you do not understand how wing area, weight, and power relate on aircraft. If you just scale them up they will not fly worth a darn! Just as you cannot get a 50 ft tall human with the same proportions as a 6 footer using the same materials. Look up the square cube law for starters.","Archangel","286971","I understand these things chemist, and you know that I do. I see no reason to respond to the ludicrous challenges by ignorant XXXXXX who think they can insult me into answering to or explain statements I never intended to say. Don't feed the Trolls chemist, you are better than that. Or at least I thought you were.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","05:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","103"

We already explained to you the concept of flight and energy. You didn't get it the first time and it doesn't look like you got it now. So therefore you are lying. Furthermore, if you actually understood these things, we wouldn't have needed to explain them to you in the first place and you wouldn't have had to ask how a 747 flies without flapping its wings. So no, you don't and you're a liar. See above. Aside from quotes showing you saying those things and the lack of rebuttals by you you clarify that you didn't. If you did not intend to say those things why is the Dark Ages thread lacking your rebuttal to Pandion? Because you're lying about not intending to say those things. Well, on that logic we should ignore you.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","06:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","104"
