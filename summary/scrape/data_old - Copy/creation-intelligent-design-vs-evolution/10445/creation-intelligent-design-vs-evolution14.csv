"07-01-2009","10445",14,"Archangel","359244","What is not only nutty, but totally insane is your opinion that I am wrong for defending myself against this liars constant irrational distortions of my opinions in debates here. Haven't you the brains to recognize the lies he tells? And how are you to be respected if you can stand by and ignore his tactics while questioning my right to call him out on his blatant lies about what I say? Can you answer that or will you just pull a penfold and troll as usual with your unfounded criticisms?","smiley","359245","But his description of your ignorance is perfectly sound. I find it ironic (pathetic) that you, of all people, can accuse others of dishonesty.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","11:19 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","198"

I find it ironic (pathetic) that you, of all people, can accuse others of dishonesty.","Archangel","359249","So, you believe that I argued that anyone who relies on math must therefore be an atheist? And you believe that I argued that NO bees at all, much less Bumble Bees can fly, when I actually said Bumble Bees defy the laws of flight? You are arguing that obvious childs claims about my saying these things and believing them are true? Is that what you're saying smiley? If so then you are too stupid to see that it is you who is just as dishonest and pathetic as the obvious child. Like everyone else in life, I have made mistakes in things I have said. But to then extrapolate that I am being dishonest compared to what this blatant and unapologetic liar does every time he logs on is disingenuous at best and criminal at worst. To criticize me at all while giving the obvious child a pass as he so blatantly misrepresents my positions reveals your hypocritical bias at every level of rationale.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","11:52 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","199"
"07-01-2009","10445",14,"Archangel","358974","The bible is the word of God and your rejection of that FACT does nothing to negate that reality. Don't you get it yet? You can ignore, deny, reject and turn away from the living God all you want to, but that does nothing to lessen the fact that HE IS THE GOD OF ALL CREATION AND THE LORD OF LIFE.","DrNo","359252","Facts can be proven. You can't prove the bible is the word of god. Therefore, it is not a fact. Simple logic.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","12:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","200"

Simple logic.","Archangel","359253","This is a fact, whether you accept it or not. You will surely learn that it was a fact which you denied, one day. You cannot prove the age of the earth, yet that doesn't change the fact that the earth exists. Many things exist which we can't prove absolutely yet we accept them as real. So it is with the bible and God Himself. Rom 1:19 because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them. Rom 1:20 For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","12:10 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","201"

How does the inability to prove the age of the earth contradict the existence of the earth? What you're saying doesn't make any sense at all. We can prove the earth exists quite easily.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","01:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","203"

I can see how this might lead to a belief that you equate maths to atheism. If you said that bumble bees defy the laws of flight, then you would indeed be wrong. Like everyone else you have made mistakes in things you have said. Unlike everyone else you seem incapable, or at least unwilling, of owning up to these mistakes. Then you go on the describe OC as a blatant and unapologetic liar, and the irony meters explode once more. And you talk about rationale like you have the faintest idea what it is. Classic!","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","02:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","204"

I guess what gets me so flummoxed is that we have here a member in this obvious child (and evidently, smiley also)who is so absolutely dishonest, so blatant in his arrogance and delusions, that he feels he can state what my deep seeded beliefs are based on things I have never, ever said in any way. This liar must know he is perverting my beliefs but has such little respect for the truth and so little shame that he isn't even embarrassed about not only misrepresenting what I have said, but actually arguing and defending that fallacious stance after repeated denials by me, and my insistence that his interpretation of what I have said is absolutely false. Only in this generation do we have people like this mentally ill troll who will insist on telling another person what he believes after he has repeatedly told him he is wrong. I can't imagine a psychosis so severe in a person who is functioning in society that he will refuse to accept it when another person says NO, that isn't what I said or meant to say. I must assume that this lunatic is communicating from some institution and is safely being held behind locked doors and is under 24 hour watch by qualified medical personnel. So it becomes painfully obvious to me that attempting to reason with this sick and disturbed lunatic is a complete waste of my time as there is no reasoning with him. He will continue to argue such insane positions as I believe that because TQ insulted my ability to do math, and I responded by saying that I reject his atheistic and secular world view, that from that exchange, one must conclude that I then believe that anyone who relies on MATH must then be an ATHEIST. And only in his very sick and disturbed mind can my stating the FACT that scientists have studied the issue of BUMBLE BEES defying the laws of flight for decades, that in his psychosis induced mind have I argued and still believe that BEES CAN'T FLY AT ALL. Forget that I was speaking only of bumble bees in my original claim, and forget that I wasn't saying even they can't fly but was saying that they DEFY THE LAWS OF FLIGHT. To his disturbed reality, evidently that means I don't believe that any bees can fly anywhere despite a lifetime of seeing bees fly. Can you appreciate how sick such a person who makes such a claim as this obvious child is? That none of that matters to this mentally ill person is evidence that he has lost his grip on reality. And that is the most gracious conclusion I can come to here. Otherwise, if I don't conclude that he is mentally ill, the only other option is to conclude that he is a committed fabricator of facts, a false witness, a falsifier of reality, a maligner of his opponents stated beliefs, a purposeful perjurer, and an unapologetic prevaricator who prefers to lie about a persons beliefs in opposition to the stated truth of what another person insists they actually believe. So which is it? Either way what is painfully obvious is that attempting to reason with such a person is a complete waste of time. as he has proven to be beyond the capability of rational discourse. My only option if admin refuses to ban such a member, is to ignore him. So consider it done. His lies aren't worth defending against anyway since everyone can plainly see how he distorts what others say.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","03:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","205"
