"10-03-2007","10445",3,"feindslayer","286453","What's 6 billion years, more or less? jk. You must remember that KH recorded this seminar 6 years ago. Science has re-estimated the age of the universe since then. Matter can be taken apart, yes. Matter can seemingly disappear, yes. Matter cannot be destroyed (as in disappear from the universe completely). Also, what does the shining sun have to do with anything? I know the answers to those questions: God. Of coarse, that is assuming that the Big Bang really did occur. Actually, the heating and the expanding would have had to happen at the same time. When an object is heated, it expands as it heats, neither can occur without the other. Thereby, the heating must have occurred at the same time of the explosion. For my final disproving statement, I need to know if evos believe that the matter had always been there or not. Do tell. Touch. Again, evo science probably has changed since KH recorded his seminars. There is no up or down in space. I only used clockwise as an example. It could have been counterclockwise. Still, that doesn't counter my example. If indeed parts of the Big Bang were spinning in opposite directions, then the friction of the parts would interfere with the explosion, causing it to implode or even just stop all together. EDIT: To sum it all up, the Big Bang Theory states that 'nothing exploded and the universe was formed!'","obvious_child","286465","By a few hundred million years. That's not really significant. In accounting, we call it immaterial. Creationists have these asinine ideas that redefining dates by immaterial amounts results in their complete lack of credibility. Notice they don't do it for the financial statements of the Fortune 500 who do this every audit just to please their anal auditors. You don't see them arguing that those FSs are fraudulent. Your ignorance. And matter can be destroyed, or more accurately converted. Fire does this very well. The net weight of the log before you burn it is far greater then the matter of the ash. Matter has been destroyed and converted into heat and light. The shining sun is a perfect example of this, taking a nuclear reaction's matter and converting it into energy. I'm assuming you've burned things in the past. How can you say matter can't be destroyed? Explain why all of the oldest light comes from a single point. Because....expansion occurs after heat is added. How can a expansion occur with a prior cause? You're saying the reaction and cause happen at the same time. Show me an example that does that. But you said that they happen at the same time, then you contradict yourself. Make up your mind. And high pressure systems can prevent expansion while raising temperature. What? You just said that expansion occurs after heating. How can you now say that they occur at the same time? Ah the life of a Creationist, can't be bothered by their own contradictions Disproving what? That you have a education? That's pretty assured. We don't know if matter has always been. That does not mean God. Your argument is nothing more then ignorance = Goddidit. I bet you have no idea how a microwave works. God makes you food hot when you push the button eh? His seminars? You mean scams. Yes it does. What? Why do you assume that space is two dimensional? Read above. Only creationists declare victory.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","10:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","32"

And of course, this sites most consistent hatemongers have come out as a tag team once again to gang up on you with their same old tired arguments. And dont you get a kick out of SP calling herself a rational christian as she blasphemes God and attempts to disprove Him in every post? This is a person who doesn't even know what the word hypocrite means, so she keeps that label under her user name. I just wanted to welcome you and feindslayer to this forum as I have grown weary of the oppositions ignorance and refusal to grow or learn anything that is even the least bit redeeming.","obvious_child","286466","This all coming from a person who believes that birds can't fly because they don't have jet engines coming out of their butts.... Could you cite one of these arguments that has been reused? Actually he doesn't believe in a liar God like you, so really it's YOU who's the blasphemer. And he's a Christian, you're a Biblist. He actually follows Christ, you just try to maintain the credibility of your God-Book. Could you point to a single thread here showing you winning a argument? And let's not forget that you believe that evolution is false while geology which is used by corporations like Exxon to find oil says that evolution is true. The products of the sciences that say evolution is true are freely used by creationists as they deny evolution. Go figure. But when you follow Satan what else matters?","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","10:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","33"

Of course getting you to admit defeat is another story.","Peeling","286522","The Black Knight had much the same problem Outside of adjudicated debates, I'd say the only kind of 'winning' that matters is where one person ends up agreeing with another, at which point both have won - one for having been persuasive and convincing, the other for having been enlightened. I'm not sure refusing to back down in a thread where you expouse your 'tough love' policy toward poor unfortunate sinning gays really counts as a victory. The cruelty of the ignorant or malicious betrays a lamentable lack of empathy. But those who dress cruelty up as piety are worse, for they have empathy but have found a way to be cruel nonetheless.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","11:06 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","39"

It was nice and civilized without your hate-filled posts on the gay section. For all your thousands of posts AA, anyone can attest how absolutely mean spirited you are. You named call constantly. Judge vehemently. When someone doesn't agree with you or proves you wrong (which was pretty much all the time), you just resorted to ""reprobate"" name calling. You haven't won anything AA. You have convinced noone. So, I guess you lost all debates! Keep up the good work though, you're just proving everyone else right with each mean-spirited, un-christianlike, dillusioned posts.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","11:28 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","40"

But since I pretty much single handedly took the whole bunch of you gay apologists on for more than a thousand posts and so frustrated you ALL as a gang that you united to put me on ignore. Like typical philosophical cowards, when you couldn't defeat me in debate you resorted to reporting me to admin enmasse in the hope of getting me banned. Only when you learned that I never got even one warning from him did you then place me on ignore. Here's the thread... on every attack and lame justification your side attempted to promote.

Show me a thread were you refuted a single point one of the people below you made against your claims . If you can't do that, then you could not have won a argument.

When a log burns, its atoms are rearranged into different molecules: bonds are broken, new bonds are formed. The energy released by the forming of the new bonds is greater than the energy used in breaking the previous ones, so this extra energy is released as heat and light. All of the atoms of the log, however, still exist, mostly in carbon dioxide, water vapour and the salts etc that make up the ash. If you could collect all of the carbon dioxide and water vapour released during the combustion, and add their mass to that of the ash, you'd find there was no loss of mass at all: in fact there'd be an increase, as oxygen from the atmosphere has been incorporated into the new products. Now here , you're spot on. But this is nuclear fusion, not combustion.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","01:26 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","43"

More appropriately, the mantra is that energy cannot be converted into matter, but matter can be converted into energy. It's just a example of matter converting into energy.","big-bang-lol-you-cant-serious","03:03 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","45"
