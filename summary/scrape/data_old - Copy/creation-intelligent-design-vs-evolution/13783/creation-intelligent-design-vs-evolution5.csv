I did better. I point out two places that were based on the christian tolerance for slavery. The best they have done is to quote someone mentioning god and claiming that it doesn't sound like deism to them. I wonder if they actually have any idea of the nature of deism in the US in the late 1700s. Funny how they cite ""all men are created equal"" without even noticing what preceded that statement. First of all, it is the ""Laws of Nature and Nature's God"" that entitle them to independence. This is a phrase that is quite typical of deism. The deist god created nature and nature governed the earth without god. Further, it is ""a decent respect to the opinions of mankind"" that impel them to declare the reasons. It isn't a respect for jesus or god. Following that the D of I says that ""We hold these truths to be self evident; that all men are created equal."" How is it that this is somehow a tenet of christianity if it is self evident rather than revealed by christian scripture? Actually, if the christian nation people bothered to educate themselves they would know that self evident truth, equality of all, as well as ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."" are taken from previous writing by humanistic deists. By the way, it was ""life, liberty and property"" in the original by Locke (definitely not a christian - in fact, scorned by christians). Jefferson just wanted to dress it up because he didn't feel that everyone had a right to property - only the intelligentsia, he among them. And when the Constitution was written and placed before the people of the United States for ratification, it was the christians who opposed ratification. Christian clergy preached against the Constitution from the pulpit and christian legislators harangued against it in state legislatures. Christians opposed the Constitution because it was ""godless,"" not based on christian principles. The Constitution granted no special status to christianity or christian principles. It states specifically that no religious test is required for any office under the Constitution. So again I ask the christian nation weenies, where in the Constitution (the founding document of our nation) are these christian principles mentioned? Where does that document mention either jesus or god? Further, as T.Q. and Penfold add, what specifically are these principles that are specific to christianity alone and not civilization in general? And my other questions have also gone unanswered. I guess our christian nation weenies can't answer. How many times is god mentioned in the Constitution? How many times is jesus mentioned in the Constitution? How many times is religion mentioned in the Constitution? Funny how they don't know. On a side note, isn't it peculiar how it is claimed that life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is based on some christian principle, when, in fact, christians have never been shy about taking away all three from anyone who disagreed. Look at the history of any christian country and you will see that it is true. England even fought wars about the correct form of christianity. On the other hand, christian fundamentalists have bee trying for years to impose their religion through government. They want religious displays (their religion) on government property. They want prayer in public schools (their prayers imposed on my children). And they want to replace science (physics, earth science, astronomy, and biology) with their religious mythology.","delusion-atheists","12:33 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","63"

I argued that not only did marc fail to show that a single principle is based on a meaningfully Christian principle but also that I showed that many principles within the Constitution are contrary to Christian teachings. There are two good questions to ask when discussing this topic: 1. If the founding fathers wanted to establish a Christian nation (or a nation based on Christian principles), how would the Constitution be different? 2. If the founding fathers wanted to establish a secular, religion-neutral nation/government, how would the Constitution be different? The answers are simple: 1. Very. 2. Not at all.","delusion-atheists","12:46 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","68"
"01-20-2010","13783",5,"None","None","None","pandion","386608","We know that Easy and Archy are trying to cherry pick answers from creationists sites that seem to them to solve their problem about the founding of a Christian nation. Here are some of the quotes provided by Easy and the principles that he thinks they support. Easy thought he and actually offered something relevant to the question when he cited these and seemed pretty upset when they were ignored. I hope this calms him down. Easy says: Judicial, legislative, and executive branches Constitution and cites Isa 33:22 For the LORD [is] our judge, the LORD [is] our lawgiver, the LORD [is] our king; he will save us. Easy doesnt explain how it is that a single mythical being represents all inspires three branches of government. Easy says: All men are sinners - Constitutional checks and balances And cites Gen 8:21, Jer 17:9, Mk 7: 20-23, Rom 3:23, 1 Jn 1:8 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart [is] evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. The heart [is] deceitful above all [things], and desperately wicked: who can know it? And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man. For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: All these evil things come from within, and defile the man. For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. Easy doesnt tell us how any of that relates to constitutional checks and balances, which have nothing to do with sin. Isnt it amazing how twisted the christian mind can get? Easy says: Sabbath day holy - ""Blue laws"" And cites Ex. 20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Easy doesnt tell us where in the Constitution we can read the article that has to do with blue laws. Those laws are, as far as I know, local in nature and not in effect everywhere in this nation. How is that Biblical trash relevant? Easy says: All men created equal - Declaration of Independence And cites Acts 10:34, 17:26, Gal. 3:28, 1 Pet. 2:17 Then Peter opened [his] mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus, Honour all [men]. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king. Again, Easy doesnt explain why any of that indicates a Christian principle about the equality of all men. Certainly a king is not equal to the subjects. Historically, christians recognized several classes of non-equal people - royalty, nobility, freemen, and serfs and slaves. They were not equal. Three more important facts: First, at the time the Constitution was written, many Christians supported slavery. Slavery was explicitly allowed by the constitution because of the insistence of Southern Christians. Second, the D of I isnt a founding document. It was a statement as to the causes for the separation. Third, the concept of equality is drawn from the writings of humanistic deists of the enlightenment. Christians were generally not in favor of the idea. Were not talking about today when Christians have claimed those ideas for themselves. The fact is that they are not drawn from Christianity but from the ideas of men who opposed Christianity. Easy says: Fair trial with witnesses - Sixth Amendment And cites: Ex. 20:16, Dt. 19:15, Pr. 24:28, 25:18, Mat. 18:16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. ""One witness shall not rise against a man concerning any iniquity or any sin that he commits; by the mouth of two or three witnesses the matter shall be established. Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause, For would you deceive with your lips? A man who bears false witness against his neighbor [Is like] a club, a sword, and a sharp arrow. But if he will not hear, take with you one or two more, that 'by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. Does anyone else find it strange that none of these quotes have anything to do with a court trial? The VI Amendment states: In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district where in the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense. How exactly does the Hebrew prohibition against false witness, commendable as it might be, apply? The lengths to which the Christian nation bunch is willing to go is remarkable. It doesnt matter what the Bible says, they cherry pick quotes out of context to justify imposing their religion on everyone. It doesnt matter where the ideas actually came from; the Christian nation bunch now claims them as their own, some 200 years after they opposed those very same ideas from pulpits and in state legislatures as the fought against the ratification of the godless Constitution. As far as Im concerned, it doesnt matter to me very much. I have studied the Constitution and have formed my own opinions. Mostly I agree with the way it has been interpreted by the Supreme Court. But it does matter to the Christian nation fanatics. Unless it was the intention of the founding fathers to impose Christianity on everyone, their efforts to use the government to impose their religion on everyone are fruitless. They cant put their xmas displays on public buildings, they cant make children pray in school, and they cant teach their religion as science. As a matter of fact, the Constitution also protects children from being required to recite the Pledge of Allegiance who oppose it for religious reasons.","delusion-atheists","12:59 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","69"

Because of the impossibility of establishing a single religion (christianity isn't), they established a secular government in which religion was not supposed to play a part.
