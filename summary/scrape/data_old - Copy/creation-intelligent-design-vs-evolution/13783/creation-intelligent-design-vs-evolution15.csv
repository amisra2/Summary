"04-03-2010","13783",15,"Archangel","396920","You forget that God is a holy God and sin has consequences. Beside, He is the author of life so how dare you question His methods in how He applies justice. And did you completely miss the part of free will requiring a real choice in order to be more than a theoretical concept or an illusion? Do you realize that we are the only creatures God ever created which have free will? Even satan himself doesn't possess that characteristic in his nature or else fallen angels could be forgiven for their rebellion against God. But they can't, only we can since we were deceived in our innocence but the fallen angels rebelled after spending untold millennia in Gods presence. Wrong again, the tree didn't cause Mans spiritual death, disobedience to God did. All we had to do as a race to spend eternity in a perfect Garden and fellowship harmoniously with our Creator would have been to live in the presence of one tree which we all knew we must never touch. Beside that one thing which was a test of our free will, everything else in the world was at our disposal. And we couldn't do that with only 2 people on Earth. Everything else God has done with this human experiment has been designed to reunite us to our former state so He can fellowship with us once again which is why He created us originally. The bible say's ""to those who grope out into the darkness, I (God) will find YOU"". That is precisely what I did as an innocent teen who hungered to know if God was real or just a myth. All I can assure you of is that although it took 7 years, I met Him in Jesus Christ at around 21 years old. I wasn't going to church at all but was running into believers who witnessed to me at every turn. The wisdom of this world is foolishness to God, my friend. It doesn't matter how enlightened you think you are from a fleshly perspective, your understanding is folly compared to the wisdom which comes from the living God via His Holy Spirit which indwells all believers. We are tapped into the only true source of wisdom and knowledge. Wisdom which is far beyond our capacity to fully appreciate or understand beyond His grace to allow.","JWilliam","397003","No, I didn't miss that part. I was at work when I responded and forgot to include it. The point that I am trying to make is that the freewill God bestows upon us is the illusion. ""You obey me or else you go to hell."" Damnation is the part that bothers me. Athiests don't reject God because we want to go to hell. We don't look at the description of hell and say ""That's where I got be!"" It's not the decision we make. We reject God because they're nothing tangible that proves He exists. I know it's a matter of faith. But there are people I won't loan money to because I can't trust them to return it. But I am expected to trust my soul and spirtual life to a being whose only proven existence lies in the hands of those who already believe? Those same people tell me that if I don't agree with them than I'm going straight to hell regardless of how I live my life. My denial of God no way dictates the way in which I will live my life. Even if I do everything in my power to make this world a better place for all and leave this earth better than when I arrived I will still have to suffer an eternity because I did so not believing in God. If you can rebel you have freewill. Athiests do not rebel against God nor do we disobey. We are just not convinced of His existence. This just shows that it is in our nature to be inquisitive. They didn't disobey God, they followed their instincts to understand our world. The way God created them. Yes, there may be things that we would rather not know. But being naive to evil is not a good thing. They only way to recognize good is to know evil. This is what I was searching for when I kept asking why. So, this is an experiment? I will not presume to ask you what is He attempting to discover as this will result in you having to question your God's wisdom and methods and I will not ask you to do that. But I will say that if we are His experiment than this speaks to God's infallibilty i.e. if He has to experiment there is something He doesn't know therefore He cannot infallible because in order to experiment you have to presume you can be wrong. If he is infallible than He knows the results of the experiement and went through with it anyways. His reasons can only be known by Him, but I would say that there is something fundmentally wrong with this as He is allowing people to harmed in this experiement He already knows the answers to. Furthermore, Why does He long for our companionship? Why does He need us to obey? I understand that we are to prosper from a relationship with God. But what does he get out of it? We will probably have to agree to disagree on this one. You must understand that when I left the faith I felt that more opportunities for knowledge presented itself. I felt that religion stifled my spiritual growth because it demand that accept one group of ideals and reject all others. My rejectetion of religion resulted in the ability to explore all avenues of spirtual and mental progression and pick and choose which ideals yo adapt yo my life style. Futhermore it is not the answers that fascinate me but the pursuit. Take music as an example. We all marvel at a persons ability to play one note and say everything that song is supposed to say. But we fail to recognize the notes that came before it and made it so great. Religion requires that we reach that one note and continue playing that note. I reject that notion and strive to find away to make all notes sound good under their repective contexts. You learn more from the pursuit of knowledge than you do from the resulting answer. Now, I understand that this weekend is eventful for you so I cannot submit this post without saying that I wish you and your family all the best and Happy Easter.","delusion-atheists","07:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","211"

"04-04-2010","13783",15,"None","None","None","JWilliam","397111","Okay Archie, I'm going to begin by stating that I don't believe your evil. We may disagree but I don't believe your intentions are to cause me harm. You've been gracious enough to try to answer my questions to the best of your ability. But I feel I must reiterate the athiest position. For us it's not about right and wrong. We are not choosing evil over good. And we do not feel we are being disobedient. We are simply not convinced. It's not as if we see God and then deny His existence. The point is we don't see God. We understand that this is a matter of faith. However, we need more than a book full of unproven conjectures to take that leap. And because of this we are told that we are to expect eternal damnation. We are not comfortable with this philosophy as we are being shunned not for any wrong doing but because we are simply not complacent. Furthermore, our non belief does not automatically equate to us doing ill will. We can lead a good life in spite of God's existence. Our ability to know right from wrong does not stem from some supreme being. And just because we don't believe does not mean we are going to do wrong. We can live peacefully, joyously and harmoniously with one another without the belief of God or the Bible. Our issue with the Bible is that it speaks of many things that just no longer apply. It condoned slavery, the stoning of your children and promoted the idea of men above women. These are all philosophies that we no longer accept as fact. Additionally, it was used to prove the world was flat and then to prove geocentrism. Both of which we know now to be false. However, we are expected to follow every word as truth. God may have spoken directly to man and asked us to transcribe his words for Him, but I do not feel the pen holders wrote everything down verbatim. Personally I feel that God never intended the Bible to be presented as ""letter of the law"". And I am aware that there are passages that state otherwise. However, I feel they were placed to serve mans interest and not God's. There are several different Christian religions that all believe that they serve God and the Bible better than all and feel all others will be going to Hell for their trespass. The Protestants and the Catholics fought and killed for years because of their discrepancies. Not to mention, the non-Christian religions such as the Jews and Muslims who have been fighting even longer over holy land. All of them killing in the honor of God. All of them believing that they are more right than the other. I may not believe in God, but I refuse to believe that He intended people to murder in His name. I also don't believe that he intended for His word to separate people but to bring them together. And once again, this is why I don't feel that the Bible was meant to be taken literally. Ultimately, I feel that it was not the words He cared about but the message. The reason I'm an atheist is because I don't feel I need a religion to lead a good life. I hope I was clear enough above for you to understand where we as athiests stand and why. Have a great holiday. And may you and yours find comfort in the truth you seek.","delusion-atheists","01:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","215"

You are magnanimous to a fault, my lost friend. I basically have no issue with any of this and accept it as your sincere beliefs and an accurate outline of your value system. The question is, so what if at the end of your life you learn that everything you believed, or didn't believe about the living God condemns you to an eternity apart from His love because you chose that path yourself? You confuse Gods values, holiness and character which never changes, with mans cultural setting which has never stopped changing. The fact is that God is the same yesterday, today and forever; it is only mans environment which devolves with new technology and cultural degradations which digress with the ever worsening morality of the human condition. What is so incredible about you humanists is that you perceive the world as becoming more enlightened when it is becoming more reprobate with each passing moment. You see us born again christians as backward thinking simpletons when you will learn that it was only we who held the truth regarding this spiritual battle between good and evil in which humanity is involved. You feel a lot of things J, but you have the eternal perspective of a gnat compared to the God who is called Alpha and Omega. Your arrogance is mind numbing to believe that you possess any rational insights which are worthy of judging Him or His plan for humanity since He can see the end of the race at the same time as He views the beginning of it. You make the typical error of all secular humanists when you hold God responsible for the sins and shortcomings of Man. I will never defend Man in his corruption of Gods values but neither will I judge God or hold Him responsible for Mans corruption of His principles. What bothers me and confuses me about your post is that at the very same time that you insist that you don't believe in God, you say you refuse to believe that ""He"" intended people to murder in His name. How can you refuse to believe anything a God you don't believe even exists, intended at all? It makes no sense but your paragraph above discusses Him in the first person throughout. That's a pretty neat trick coming from an atheist who doesn't believe He exists at all. You don't need religion to lead a good life. Religion is a man made institution which will always be flawed at its core. But you do need a personal relationship with God through His perfect Lamb, Jesus Christ, our Messiah in order to find true and everlasting peace which surpasses all understanding. And you need to get past this fleshly understanding and look at the spiritual side of your being. Yes, you were very clear, unfortunately for you I have heard it all before and even believed much of it before I received Gods Holy Spirit to indwell me and learned the absolute truths about life and why I exist.
