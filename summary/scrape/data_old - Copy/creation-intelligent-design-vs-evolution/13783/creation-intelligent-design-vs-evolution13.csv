If God IS truth and good then a denial of him would be going towards deceit and evil.","JWilliam","396717","Not entirely true, because there is a force normal.

To get back to the point. If, in the beginning, all that existed was god (by some peoples' definition, pure good) and he/she/it created everything, then he/she/it must have created, and thereby contained, evil. The evil had to come from somewhere.","delusion-atheists","04:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","184"
"04-01-2010","13783",13,"JWilliam","396716","Fair enough. But for an atheist, one who denies both God and Satan. Why would he go to hell? Choosing to not follow the Creator is not the same as choosing to follow the father of lies. If both are denied what happens? Also, what abot non-christians who believe in God but not Jesus? What happens yo them? They are at least accepting God as the Creator.","Archangel","396773","You assume you have an independent choice in whom you place your allegiance to, in life; you don't. By rejecting the living God you automatically pledge allegiance to the devil even if you don't consciously make that decision. Here's how Gods worse says it: Rom 6:16 Do you not know that when you present yourselves to someone as slaves for obedience, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin resulting [fn] in death, or of obedience resulting [fn] in righteousness? So, if you ignore your spiritual nature in life and live it for yourself and for your natural inclinations, then you have chosen by that rejection of who God made you to be, to be apart from Him. And on that Judgement Day you will clearly see all of the abundant evidence He revealed to you in life and all of the times you rejected ""HIM"" by ignoring who you are. This verse says it best as mammon represents the world system in it. Matt 6:24 ""No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.","delusion-atheists","04:58 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","185"

By rejecting the living God you automatically pledge allegiance to the devil even if you don't consciously make that decision.","Peeling","396774","Acceptance or denial of god isn't analogous to movement in a direction, it's a disagreement over the nature of the force defining that direction. This is precisely the kind of idea that puts me off gods.","delusion-atheists","04:59 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","186"

"04-01-2010","13783",13,"Steeeeve","396684","Evil is just an opposite of Good. In other words, it only exists by the denial of God.","Winston Smith","396781","but if a denial of God is evil, then where does that denial come from when there is no denial of God in God ? we know that Evil is the antithesis of Good but where does it come from when God who created everything is pure absolute Good ? your logic is akin to saying that because there are white swans necessarily there must exist black swans.

For example, if I say I have no money then something wasn't created as nothing exists. When I have 1 dollar I have money and something exists. So by the very existence of God someone can say they have no God (in terms like I used in the previous example) and that is what evil is. In short, a denial of God is a nothingness or evil.","delusion-atheists","07:43 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","192"

The Devil is default. This is like walking up the down escaltor. If the goal is to reach the top and I stop moving I didn't choose to go down. I chose not to go up. And on top of that mall security is on top telling me if I reach the top I can have anything I want but If I touch the bottom he'll shoot me. But maybe I don't want anything in the mall. Maybe I just want to get in my car and go home. But I know I don't want to die. So going down isn't an option. Standing still will just send me straight down, so that's not an option either. My only option is to obey. When you only have one option you do not have a choice.","delusion-atheists","08:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","193"

You look around and see people of all shapes, sizes and colors. Some looking down. Some looking around. Some looking straight ahead. You're not too sure what to do, but most people are heading up or at the least trying to maintain their position. All of a sudden you hear someone yell: ""I'm getting Cinnabon!"" ""Well that sounds good."" ""Oh, it's great. And you know what? They never run out."" ""No?"" ""Nope. And, you see that Security Guard up there?"" ""Not really."" ""Well, he makes them."" ""That's pretty nice of him."" ""Yeah. He also made this escaltor."" ""Okay, who are we talking about?"" ""The Security Guard."" ""What security guard?"" ""He's up there. Look, you don't have to see him, just know that he's there. ""What does he have to do with me?"" ""Well when you get up there you can have anything in the mall you want. I'm getting Cinnabon."" ""Look, thanks for all the info but I think I'm going to sit here for a moment."" ""Oh, you don't want to that."" ""Why not?"" ""You'll reach the bottom and he'll shoot you."" ""Why?!"" ""It says so in the Directory."" ""Wha...er...?"" ""Oh, and this one day this kid comes down right? Talking about 'I'm the Secuirty Guards son.' Naturally, we didn't believe him. So we just shoved him down."" ""Wait. What?!"" ""Oh, he's fine. He was back up with his daddy in a few days. And by the way, the Security Guard and his son. Same dude. ""Huh?""","delusion-atheists","10:08 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","194"

And the fact is that you either choose LIFE in the Lord or by default you choose Death apart from Him in eternity. You may not consider that fair but that is the reality of the situation and nothing you as the creature can do to change it. God created us for personal and individual fellowship with Him in this life and anything we do apart from that single act is wasted effort. He even makes clear in the gospel passages I posted above that we are sinners and can never be good enough on our own to reach His Holy Standard to enter heaven so He came and became Man to die for our sins so that He Himself paid the price to redeem us. Now, all we must do is accept what He did for us to be saved. It couldn't be any simpler a process, yet you atheists get hung up on the fact that you're a sinner who can't reach Him any other way. You act like Him doing all the work to redeem you isn't good enough for some reason, and is actually wrong on His part somehow. This verse says it all whether you like it or not. Matt 12:30 He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.","delusion-atheists","01:59 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","195"
