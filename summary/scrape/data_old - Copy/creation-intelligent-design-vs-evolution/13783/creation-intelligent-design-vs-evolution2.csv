Heres what I found on it; Deleted from Wikipedia - Poe's law (deleted 15 May 2008 at 06:32 - Deletionpedia ) It lasted 21 days on Wikipedia before being deleted, and it was originated by a Christianforums poster named Nathan Poe. Doesnt really seem like that big of deal to me, but the atheist community seems to be increasingly fascinated with anything at all that allows them to mock Christianity. As this now famous genius Poe puts it;","trebor","385941","Actually, it got combined with an entry with a whole bunch of other 'laws' at List of eponymous laws - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia It's still there.","delusion-atheists","11:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","16"

Dawkins and Harris are well known authors - I don't believe they get together on something like this only for fun. Who is to say their vid won't find its way into a public science classroom? You know, just as a little filler, a little fun at the end of the class period. Can't have all work and no play all the time, even in science classes.

"01-15-2010","13783",2,"Marc","None","It would become a completely atheist planet in no time - what makes the earth different is Christ's teaching and actions while he was here, and the following ACTS of those who witnessed it. His Disciples (mainly Peter) were scared little rabbits while he was alive, and after his resurection, weren't afraid of anything. That historical fact and other similar ones have had quite an impact for Christianity. The debate about whether God exists or not isn't only about the origin/science debates.","iangb","385969","I realise that Databeds original question was designed to highlight that creationism is based solely on the bible. However, your reply caused me to go all tangental. If you believe that a planet populated solely by atheists would remain solely atheist (without the influence of God), on what basis do you explain the many other religions that exist on Earth? Especially those that were around before Christianity, and cannot therefore be accused of copying a successful format?","delusion-atheists","12:08 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","18"

I remember once when President George Bush referred to Islam as one of the worlds great religions I guess a U.S. President would have to do that, as the President of a country with no establishment of religion in its foundation. A Christian without speech police can refer to Islam in a more direct way its a false religion. Just about any follower of one certain religion is going to have disdain for any other religion, as well as atheism. Many atheists may think they have an advantage in that regard they think they can group all religions together as being wrong in similar ways about their faith, and separate themselves from them. But since the term religion is so broad and vague, its easy to see that atheists cant really do that so well, because there are a few religions that they cant have much disagreement with Pantheism, scientism, would certainly be two, and there are probably more. Any religion that worships nature, with no defined god, isn't really at odds with atheism, is it? Your phrase within parenthesis, without the influence of God, points out (to me) that discussions about God on these forums, and even throughout Christian study and discussion, are all too often about only his presence or absence, nothing more . There is something more, and that something is Satan, the great deceiver, the evil one. In Databeds hypothetical, where he said stuck them on a planet with no access to any knowledge of God or Christ, my belief is that God/Christ would be there, (omnipresent) but I wasnt really consciously thinking about the possibility of the evil one NOT being there. I believe its Satans presence that causes atheism and it also causes false religions to be dreamed up. So to clarify my answer to his question, for people on another planet with no access to any knowledge of God or Christ would become a blend of atheism and false religion, since Satan is the author of both. To me as a fundamental Christian, there is little difference between the two.","delusion-atheists","08:08 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","19"

If that is so, then Popi the sailor man is also the Great ""I Am"". The Greek for the 'I AM' in John is 'Ego Emni' , while if he wanted to say he was god, it would be 'ego emi ho on' . Do try to understand that you are reading a translation of a translation. If you bothered to read what the storyline in is about, you know, context, you would see that the writer of the Gospel of John was saying on The father was greater than Jesus. In context, this is saying that Jesus is claiming to be greater than Abraham, ""Before"" Abraham in priority, not before Abraham in time. So, your example is null and void. I suspect that due to your ignorance and hate, I will get a flip off answer rather than respond to this point.","delusion-atheists","11:39 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","22"

It is true that, in the Septuagint version (the Greek translation of the Old Testament), the translation of Ex.3:14 is ego eimi ho on (""I am the One who exists""). But it is important to note that the Septuagint is actually attempting to translate this difficult Hebrew phrase, and it is of no small significance that the translator felt the need to use two different forms of the verb ""to be"" to do so. Neither of these forms is future, by the way, nor is either form potential (we might have expected an optative or a subjunctive). The point is that even in the third century B.C., the Hebrew ""eyeh 'asher 'eyeh"" really was difficult to do justice to. Given that immediately after this, God tells Moses to tell the Israelites that ""'eyeh"" has sent him (using only one half of the repeated verbal coupling), Jesus statement ""I am"" seems as close as one might come to quoting this passage in Greek (or any other language). So there is really no doubt whatsoever that Jesus is directly and deliberately referring to Exodus 3:14 with these words, regardless of the exact phraseology used by the LXX. Similarly, in Rev.1:8, the Father describes Himself as ""ho on, kai ho en, kai ho erchomenos"" - ""the One who is, and who was, and who is coming"". Both renderings have, to my mind, one and the same central objective: to make clear that God is the author of all existence, of all creation, and that He is supreme within that creation, being both the definition and the ruler of the very notion of being and existence. The use of the divine ""being"" Name in Exodus chapter three (by our Lord Jesus in Christophany acting for the Father) served to put the Israelites on notice that this God is in no way comparable to the gods with which they were familiar (so neither is His Name comparable). In John 8:58 and elsewhere, Jesus makes it clear that He is that very same One, and anyone familiar with the meaning and the translations of that famous Hebrew passage should have recognized this. The meaning of Jesus' words, ""I am"" in John 8:58 Besides, after Jesus said that the Jews tried to stone him for blasphemy. They knew what he was saying.

"01-16-2010","13783",2,"iangb","386020","So newborn babies only have no Christian beliefs because Satan has removed them? My position would be that the 'natural' (read:before external influences) state of a person is atheism, for the same reason that you 'naturally' have no belief in gremlins. People aren't born with beliefs, they are naturalised into them - whatever that belief may be.","marc9000","386061","Something like that its a sinful world. They inherit Adams sin at birth. It makes sense to me they often scream and cry most of the night, load their diapers several times a day, and throw food all over the kitchen as their mom tries to feed them. I dont see complete innocence in them. People (unlike animals) are born with a capacity to absorb profound external influences. I guess I could agree with you that beliefs are naturalized into them, but those beliefs arent necessarily forced on them they draw them in , since they are created in the image of God. Beings that are aware of their own mortality, beings that look skyward and wonder whats out there, beings that wonder where they came from, beings that (some of them at least) show morality and restraint with that thing called love, to their well being and advantage. Most people arent blank/neutral about those things all their lives, like animals are. Most of the world agrees that we live in the year 2010. 2010 years after what? Most people wonder about that at some point in their lives.","delusion-atheists","11:13 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","26"

I wonder why this person couldn't have been inspired by his own beliefs / his own experiences? Is atheism largely dependent on Harris and Dawkins as leaders? Without them, would many outspoken atheists fall into silence, due to insecurity? We don't see the words ""inspired by Ken Hamm"", or ""Rick Warren"", after Christian vids, do we, if those two didn't have a thing to do with the vid.","delusion-atheists","11:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","27"
