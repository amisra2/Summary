(and the one on the list's untraceable except when cross referenced to creationist sources) Then there's the famous ""Project Steve"" where science graduates volunteered their names to a list which currently stands at 1131. (half of which are biologists) This far outnumbers the AiG list, without resort to those scientists whose first name is not Steve.","delusion-atheists","04:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","125"

"01-29-2010","13783",9,"None","None","None","Easyrider","388141","The Scriptures say that all atheists are going to hell when they die. And it looks like the godless jokers around here (including Penfold, Trebor, Accipiter, etc.) will likely be joining them (unless they repent). They can't be very smart.

This accomplishes nothing besides giving you the self-satisfaction of touting your religiosity so that you can pat yourself on the back.","delusion-atheists","09:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","132"

Jesus arose from the dead. That's one of the most well attested to facts in ancient history, whether you want to casually sweep it under the rug or not. Many skeptics set out to prove the story of Christ to be a fairy tale. None succeeded and a number became believers. You guys are playing with absolute fire. If you're wrong (and you are), you're screwed big time. Big time and forever. Do you feel lucky? Well, do you?","delusion-atheists","09:33 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","133"

HA! Jesus, if he truly did exist, didn't rise from anything, and no one would even be claiming he DID if it weren't for PIE IN THE SKY.","delusion-atheists","09:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","134"

You place too much emphasis on what people are telling you. I guess this makes sense considering you base your entire belief system only on what people have told you. That's all you have! Besides, are you saying that science is wrong or right? On one hand you refute science because it leads to a conclusion the Bible is wrong but then two seconds later you want to be on the side of scientists who believe in God. Somehow having people that aren't based in delusion who also believe in God makes you feel better? In response to your second point, I never said anything about being stupid. Just because I make your ideas look stupid doesn't mean I am saying you are stupid. All I said is that the Bible never helped anyone make progress in any way. Can you show me one tangible positive thing that has resulted from the Bible? (other than pretty churches of course)","delusion-atheists","10:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","135"
