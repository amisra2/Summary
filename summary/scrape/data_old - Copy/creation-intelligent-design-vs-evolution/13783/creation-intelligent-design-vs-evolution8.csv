You should get into Biblical theology and study up on it so you know what you're arguing against. The Anvil that Has Worn Out Many Hammers Nineteenth century writer H.L. Hastings once forcibly illustrated the unique way in which the Bible has withstood the attacks of skepticism: ""Infidels of eighteen hundred years have been refuting and overthrowing this book, and yet it stands today as solid as a rock. Its circulation increases, and it is more loved and cherished and read today than ever before. Infidels, with all their assaults, make about as much impression on this book as a man with a tack hammer would on the Pyramids of Egypt. ""When the French monarch proposed the persecution of Christians in his dominion, an old statesman and warrior said to him, 'Sire, the church of God is an anvil that has worn out many hammers.' So the hammers of infidels have been pecking away at this book for ages, but the hammers are worn out, and the anvil still endures. If this book had not been the book of God, men would have destroyed it long ago. Emperors and popes, kings and priests, princes and rulers have all tried their hand at it; they die and the book still lives."" ""No other book has been so chopped, knived, sifted, scrutinized, and vilified. What book on philosophy or religion or psychology or belles lettres of classical or modern times has been subject to such a mass attack as the Bible? With such venom and skepticism? With such thoroughness and erudition? Upon every chapter, line and tenet? The Bible is still loved by millions, and studied by millions.

Here are some of those principles, as summarized by historian Franklin Steiner, that were the law in Virginia, a christian state, prior to the Revolution (these are gentle when compared to Massachusetts Bay Colony): 1. To speak impiously of the Trinity or one of the divine persons, or against the known articles of Christian faith, was punishable by death. 2. The same penalty of death was to avenge ""blaspheming God's holy name."" 3. To curse of ""banne""--for the first offense, some severe punishment; for the second, a ""bodkin should be thrust through the tongue.""; if the culprit was incorrigible, he should suffer death. 4. To say or do anything ""to the derision of despight of God's holy word,"" or in disrespect of any minister, exposed the offender to be ""openly whipped three times, and to ask public forgiveness in the assembly of the congregation, three several Saboth daies."" 5. Non-attendance on religious services entailed a penalty, for the first offense, of the stoppage of allowance; for the second, whipping; for the third, the galleys for six months. 6. For Sabbath-breaking the first offense brought the stoppage of allowance; the second, whipping; and the third, death. 7. Preachers and ministers were enjoined to faithfulness in the conduct of regular services on pain ""of loosing their entertainment."" 8. Every person in the Colony, or who should come into it, was required to repair to the minister for examination in the faith. If he was unsound he was to be instructed. If he refused to go to the minister, he should be whipped; on the second refusal, he should be whipped twice and compelled to ""acknowledge his fault on Saboth day in the assembly of the congregation""; for a third refusal, he should be ""whipt ever day until he makes acknowledgement."" That certainly outlines very clearly the christian principles on which the christian nation crowd claim this nation was established. This is the freedom of religion that the christian nation Taliban endeavor to establish. Christian principles have always been to enforce christianity by force on everyone.","delusion-atheists","01:59 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","113"

Perhaps you could post it for me since you seem to be claiming that there is one. I can't find it. You see, some of us, as opposed to you christian nation types, actually read books rather than get all our information from the Internet. As mentioned, the ""laws"" are from Franklin Steiner as reported in his book, ""The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents From Washington to F.D.R."" published in 1936. But upon looking into the summary of the Laws, I see that Steiner actually took it from one of 29 essays, written by James Parton and published in the Atlantic Monthly in 1872 and 1873, and collected into a book, ""The Life of Thomas Jefferson"" in 1874. Parton comments on how the law was treated by pre-revolutionary Virginians: ""...it was treated as all Christian nations now treat the sublime moral code of Christ--all believe and none practice."" That attitude doesn't seem to have changed. If you want to find out if the book hides something that I don't want you to find out, you're going to have to buy it and read it. I know that actually reading a book is against your religion, so I won't hold my breath. I know that you prefer to allow yourself to be duped by christian web sites and David Barton.","delusion-atheists","11:24 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","118"
