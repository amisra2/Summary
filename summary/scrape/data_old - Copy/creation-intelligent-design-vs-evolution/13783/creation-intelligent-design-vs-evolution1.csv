Without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is impossible to create a parody of Fundamentalism that SOMEONE won't mistake for the real thing.[1] Speaking of dellusion, I'm surprised some YEC didn't already post this in favor of their arguments. Lately, its been tough for us Christians. From Elton John to best-selling books, one of which calls God a delusion,faith is under attack. Well, I have news for atheists, theyre the ones who are deluded! Because God exists He made the universe Im 100% sure of it. How do I know? From the Bible, In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. It says so right there on page one of the book God himself says he wrote. Checkmate! Sorry atheists, scientists believe that the earth is billions of years old, because of something called radioactive decay. Well, the truth is, the earth is only about 6000 years old. God says so in the Bible. Now, who should we believe, the creator of the universe, or some scientist freaks who dont even believe in God? Astronomers claim they can see galaxies so far away, their light must be even older than the earth for them to be visible. But the Bible proves thats impossible. When God created everything, he must have set the light from those galaxies already beaming towards the earth,j so that when he later gave us telescopes, wed have more stuff to look at! Heh, heh, is God unbelievable or what? Now if you think that isnt the work of a conscious, omnipotent being whose son on earth was Jesus Christ, you must be deluded or something. According to atheists, fossils in the ground show that evolution, not intelligent design, produced all life on earth. Thats ridiculous, the Bible clearly says God created man in his own image, though some deluded scientists also say you can see evolution happening in the mutations of drug resisting bacteria. Give me a break God [inaudible mumbling] genes so that Christians can go to heaven, and that means we [George Bush/monkey visual] came from monkeys? Its amazing how science can cure diseases, smash the atom, and create nuclear explosions, yet be so wrong about everything thats mentioned in the Holy Bible. Im sure well find fossils of giants and unicorns one of these days. Look, Im a Christian, and us Christians, we understand that things like miracles that defy the laws of physics are the truth. We will never question that, because we are 100% certain that God meant what he wrote. Scientists arent certain about anything all they have is a bunch of theories! (gravity) Clearly, stuff like science and reason have no place in our lives in the 21st century we must live by the words of a very, very, old religious book. So that when the earth is consumed in fire at Armageddon, well physically ascend to paradise. And when I pray, the creator himself, and his son, born of a blessed virgin, come, and they speak to me, and they tell me Im correct. So atheists, who exactly is the deluded one here? Lately, its been tough for us atheists. From recent scientific discoveries that show the amazing complexities of the simplest forms of life, the subsequent mathematical improbability of random, chance, godless processes producing and maintaining life, to people like Behe, Dembski, Spetner, and many websites untainted with liberalism and political correctness of the mainstream media, the movie Expelled that showed a very real probability of how weve been so close to violating the U.S. Constitution in academia. Well I have news for Christians/conservatives theyre the ones who are deluded! [insert stream of vulgar name calling here] Because God does not exist random chance made the universe with all its order and complexity! How do I know this? From Madelyn Murray OHair! She said so, she proved how smart she was when she won her separation of church and state lawsuit in 1963! She has garnered so many followers that also happened to have an interest in science, that theyve managed to take over the scientific community! How could they be wrong? How could their current representatives, Dawkins and Harris, be wrong? They obviously know all things! Now, who should we believe, the Bible, written and preserved over the entire period of the human ability to write, no matter how many attempts have been made to destroy it, or Dawkins and Harris and their millions of followers in the scientific community? It doesnt matter what the Bible says, Tiktaalik Roseaea is real! A small band of atheist explorers said so! We can look in telescopes and see all the galaxies we want! We know it took that light hundreds of billions of years to reach us! No God would have made the universe, and sat around that long waiting for us to be able to see it! Heh heh, is science unbelievable or what? Now, if you think we dont know how big those galaxies are, how many stars they contain, how many planets they contain that have life on them, how long it takes their light to get here (accurate to only a few hundred light years, plus or minus), you must be deluded or something! Just ask us, well tell you! According to Christians, orderly , specified complexity in life and the universe show a mathematical improbability very close to impossibility of random, purposeless origins and existence of reality. Thats ridiculous all you have to do is note that someone wins the lottery just about every week despite that individuals almost impossible chances - that tells you that evolution HAD to have happened! Dawkins and Harris clearly say that God does not exist, though some deluded non-atheist scientists say that chance cant fully explain evolution, let alone the origins of life. Dawkins has dreams that spacemen came long ago and sowed the seeds of life on earth then flew away, never to be seen again! How could he be wrong he knows all things! Its amazing how the Bible can give us such obviously sound advise concerning finances, morality, behavior, as well as such accurate predictions about the breakdown of those things, and be so wrong about everything that science tells us about politics,and liberalism [Obama/Ried] visual here] and be so wrong about the age of the earth, or how long it takes light to reach us! Im sure well find out life originated from lifeless matter someday, its been just around the corner for 150 years now. Never mind that the corner keeps getting further and further away scientifically, were going to find it really soon! Look, Im an atheist, and us atheists, we understand that things like miracles that defy the laws of physics (the origin of life by natural processes) are the truth. We know there is no God, we will never question that, because we are 100% certain that Madelyn Murray OHair was right! Christians arent certain about anything they dont know how God originated, or where he is! They have no clue about all those galaxies like we do! Clearly, stuff like morals and finances, and written history have no place in our lives in the 21st century, we must live by the words of Dawkins and Harris soon they will be able to cure ALL diseases, make us all live forever, and count more galaxies for us! So that when there is no more death or sorrow thanks to science, and people like Dawkins, Harris, and Obama are ruling over every aspect of our lives, theyll inform me that theyre correct, and they'll have ways of seeing to it that I agree with them. Are Christians ever that logical? So Christians, who exactly is the deluded one here?","marc9000","385920","I wasnt familiar with Poes Law either. Heres what I found on it; Deleted from Wikipedia - Poe's law (deleted 15 May 2008 at 06:32 - Deletionpedia ) It lasted 21 days on Wikipedia before being deleted, and it was originated by a Christianforums poster named Nathan Poe. Doesnt really seem like that big of deal to me, but the atheist community seems to be increasingly fascinated with anything at all that allows them to mock Christianity. As this now famous genius Poe puts it; So thats a problem of fundamentalism, and not a problem with the one creating the parody? Apparently the creation of parodies for fundamentalism is a large part of atheism. Lets have a look at it a little pause button action, a little jotting down and we have it in writing! Atheist scientists (or Algore) provided me with this technology, not sure which. <--- (one of those smileys Mr Poe enlightened me on) Not too bad so far, if we overlook the word arrangement of a 13 year old valley girl, spoken in the voice of a gay 21 year old college student. So far I'm fooled, but suspicious. Moving on; Uh oh, Mr. Poe's proclamation crashes and burns right there - the Bible says no such thing. This is where a satire quickly changes from something that starts out as mocking, (designed to be something that could be innocence) to a complete lie. It never takes long for atheist satirists to demonstrate their lack of knowledge of the Bible. Atheist mockers dont seem to be quite as skilled as Mr Poe would have us believe. Here, the atheist satirists assign perfection to astronomers. They have no comprehension of God being above and beyond time, and this causes them to feel that theyre on the same level as God, able to question him and challenge him to the same extent he can question us and challenge us. Yet they know that there are characteristics of reality that they themselves cannot explain, though they probably seriously believe that astronomy is an exact, non-controversial science. The George Bush visual, the reference to heaven/monkeys was apparently used to emotionally cover the inadequacy of the fossils in the ground, and mutations of drug resisting bacteria as complete explanations. Really no more amazing how science can cure some diseases, smash the atom, create nuclear explosions, yet screw up many other things that it attempts to do, often at great expense to the general public. Global warming hysteria comes to mind. That would be more likely than finding evidence for abiogenesis. Its always interesting to see atheists making profound statements about billions of years, and mocking the Bible as being very, very old. Okay, enough about that Im now going to condense the various atheist explanations that have been presented to me at 4forums over the years. Is the following a parody, or is it the real thing? I dont have the time nor the funding to put this in video form like Harris and Dawkins. I don't think many, if any, Christians really do - satire about atheism isn't a strong Christian practice, not nearly as strong as atheist satire about Christianity, it seems. Maybe that's what made Poe's Law so notable in the beginning of this thread.","delusion-atheists","07:59 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","5"

Dawkins and Harris are well known authors - I don't believe they get together on something like this only for fun. Who is to say their vid won't find its way into a public science classroom? You know, just as a little filler, a little fun at the end of the class period. Can't have all work and no play all the time, even in science classes. Not ""ridiculous"", just 'attacked', or 'losing ground'.","delusion-atheists","10:33 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","13"

It would become a completely atheist planet in no time - what makes the earth different is Christ's teaching and actions while he was here, and the following ACTS of those who witnessed it. His Disciples (mainly Peter) were scared little rabbits while he was alive, and after his resurection, weren't afraid of anything. That historical fact and other similar ones have had quite an impact for Christianity. The debate about whether God exists or not isn't only about the origin/science debates.","delusion-atheists","10:47 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","14"
