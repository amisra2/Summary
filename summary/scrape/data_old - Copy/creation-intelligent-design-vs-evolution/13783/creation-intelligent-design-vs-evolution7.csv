That's a lie. We know he didn't because his pastors said he didn't. Did you look at the numbers taken from Washington's own diary about how often he went to church? What Washington did when duty was calling was to stop keeping his diary. Otherwise it shows a man who infrequently attended church.

You have your sources and I have mine that say otherwise. Here's more: Critics object that Washington never referred to Jesus; refused to partake of the Lord's Supper, and among other things, used Deistic language. Lillback skillfully rebuts all claims: (1) Washington did refer to Jesus, and those who say otherwise just ignore several letters where he recommends ""the author of our Faith"" (a reference to Christ in the book of Hebrews), and the religion of Jesus to the Indians. Also, Washington didn't like to speak of himself at all. It is not the case that he refused to speak of his Faith. Rather, he refused to speak of Washington. (2) It is true at times that Washington refused to take communion, but a number of points need to be made: a) this was not like the modern, high church Episcopalism. Due to the lack of ministers, and the frontier nature of the church, congregations would celebrate communion only a few times a year. Given that other evidence shows Washington took communion , this objection is actually a strong argument for Washington's faith: it is only a few times that Washington actually missed communion! http://www.puritanboard.com/f90/geor...ed-fire-24718/ Was George Washington a Christian? Part Two ""Why do you not know how to interpret the present time?"" (Luke 12:56) In last weeks commentary I examined the secularists accusation that George Washington was not a Christian. They invariably call him a Deist, and try to pin that label on the rest of the Founding Fathers as well. They like to quote Paul Boller, Jr.s 1963 work entitled George Washington & Religion, in which he accused our first President of being a Deist. The issue of Washingtons Christianity is pivotal in the current moral and spiritual civil war for our nations soul, for if these secularists can make a convincing case that the Founding Fathers were not Christians it would be a huge boost for their campaign to undermine the Biblical foundations of America. Last week, to define Deist for my readers I quoted Noah Websters original 1828 American dictionary: one who believes in the existence of a God, but denies revealed religion. I added that the Deists emphatically rejected the divinity of Jesus Christ, the authority and inspiration of Holy Scripture, and the personal nature of God, among other things. They believed that God created the world but then wandered off and ignored it, and has never been heard from since. In examining carefully the voluminous research that objective historians have done on our first President, his spiritual life and character, and in doing my own research into his letters and speeches, I can say that there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that George Washington was not a Deist. He was not even close to being a Deist. Washington was a thoroughly Christian, low-Church Virginia Anglican, who subscribed in all points to orthodox New Testament doctrine. Last week we took up several important proofs of Washingtons Christianity: First, I shared some of the evidence that he was man of prayer, and pointed out that most Deists never bothered with prayer. They didnt think God cared, and besides, since they didnt believe in sin, there was nothing to pray about, anyway! Second, I made the important point that Washington was quite familiar with his Bible. In Peter Lillbacks magnificent book on Washingtons Christian faith, Sacred Fire, he has listed in an appendix over 200 different Biblical phrases or passages, or allusions to Biblical passages. Many of these Washington used over and over in his letters and speeches. It is really quite remarkable how often Biblical passages or incidents cropped up in his thinking and writing. This man knew the Word of God. And he reverenced it, as well. Last week, I quoted from his famous Circular to the States, written to the thirteen State Governors right after the end of the War for Independence. In that letter, he listed several developments that had blessed America, and then he wrote: and above all, the pure and benign light of Revelation (emphasis mine), have had ameliorating influence on mankind and increased the blessings of society. The word Revelation back then generally referred to the Bible, and more specifically to the Gospel of Christ revealed in the New Testament. Notice that he capitalized it, which though standard usage at that time, reveals his acceptance of the inspiration of Holy Scripture. And remember, Deists didnt believe in revelation, because they didnt think that God revealed anything about himself. Lets look at the secularists claim that the Father of our country never used the names God or Jesus which to them is evidence of his supposed Deism. For example, in 1926 historian Rupert Hughes wrote that, there is no direct allusion to Christ, and the word Christ has been found in none of Washingtons almost countless autographs. This is sloppy history writing. Mr. Hughes didnt do his homework! In 1779, some Delaware Indian chiefs came to General George Washingtons encampment, bringing three of their sons that they wanted the whites to educate. In his prepared speech the General said to them: You do well to wish to learn our arts and our way of life, and above all, the religion of Jesus Christ (emphasis mine). These will make you a greater and happier people than you are. Thats putting it rather bluntly! No Deist would have been caught dead telling anyone that the most important thing they could learn was the religion of Jesus Christ. They simply didnt believe it. Granted, Washington hardly ever used the name of Jesus, either in speech or in writing, and he only referred to God by name about one hundred times. But, does this make him a Deist? Hardly. What it makes him is a typical devout 18th Century Virginia Anglican. In Washingtons time Anglicans were very reticent about using the names of Jesus or God. As odd as it sounds to our modern ears, they were very concerned not to profane the sacred names by casual reference to them. Of course, because the Nicene Creed was regularly recited by Washington in the Anglican worship service on Sundays, he would have often professed the names of Jesus and God out loud. But that was sacred usage, with which he would have been totally comfortable. Martha Washington, who was a very strong Christian believer herself, almost always used indirect and honorific titles in place of the names of Jesus and God. Also, in Washingtons personal sermon collection, there is a July 4, 1793 anniversary message from a Presbyterian minister named Samuel Miller who refers to God as: the supreme Arbiter of nations, the grand Source, the Deity himself, the Sovereign Dispenser of all blessings, the Governor of the universe, and so forth. Mr. Miller was certainly no Deist. So, this was common practice at the time, even for ministers of the Gospel. An interesting point is that the Deists were much more inclined to use the names of Jesus and God, precisely because of their lack of reverence. Thomas Paine, whom Lillback calls a soft Deist, used the name of God often, although he also used Creator, and Almighty. Profaning the holy names of Jesus and God, especially in cursing, was something that George Washington hated. In a General Order to his soldiers dated July 29, 1779, he deplored the fact that in spite of the many and pointed orders (that) have been issued against that unmeaning and abominable custom of swearingwith much regret the General observes that it prevails, if possible, more than ever; his feelings are continually wounded by the oaths and imprecations of the soldiers whenever he is in hearing of them. The Name of that Beingis incessantlyprofaned in a manner as wanton as it is shocking. He goes on to say that he hopes that for the sake of religion, decency and order the officers will put a stop to it. Note that he is personally hurt by the swearing obviously because of what the name of God means to him. And, in an order meant to stop the profane use of Gods name, he refers to God indirectly, not wanting to use the name himself. Other typical examples of Washingtons use of indirect titles for Jesus include our gracious Redeemer and the Divine author of our blessed religion. No Deist would ever use those titles! Among his many indirect titles for God (about 95 of them!) we find the Lord, and giver of victory; the Giver of Life; the Judge of the hearts of men; the great Lord and Ruler of nations; and his favorite Providence, with a capital P. He used this one over 270 times! Peter Marshall Ministries, America's Christian Heritage, Restoring America, Christian Homeschool material and curriculum Some deist!

Here's even more sources that record Washington taking communion: There are several testimonies of those who observed him take Holy Communion during the war. General S.H. Lewis of Augusta County, Virginia, in a letter dated December 14, 1855 quoted General Robert Porterfield as saying that he had known General Washington personally for many years I saw him myself on his knees receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. There is also a story that Washington took Communion in the Presbyterian Church while the Continental Army was at Morristown, New Jersey for the winter of 1778-79. Dr. James Richards, who followed Rev. Timothy Johnes, the pastor when Washington was in Morristown, noted that the report that Washington did actually receive the communion from the hands of Dr. Johnes was universally current during that period, and so far as I know, never contradicted. I have often heard it from the members of Dr. Johnes family, while they added that a note was addressed by Washington to their father, requesting the privilege Lastly, there is what I believe is a very credible story from the pen of the Rev. Alexander Hamilton, Mrs. Alexander Hamiltons great-grandson. In 1854, the Hamilton family held a reunion in New York City. Mrs. Hamilton, by then an old woman of ninety-six, was Continental Army General Phillip Schuylers daughter. She insisted on taking her seven-year-old great-grandson, along with other family members, to see St. Pauls Church because she had something very important to tell him. When they got there she took him up to the chancel rail, and told him that she had been present in the church on George Washingtons inauguration day in 1789, when he had received Holy Communion. She made it clear to him that she wanted him to know that she had personally witnessed Washington receiving the Sacrament, so he could tell others. Rev. Hamilton recollected that her words were: If anyone ever tells you that George Washington was not a communicantof the Church, you say that your great-grandmother told you to say that she had knelt at this chancel rail at his side and received with him the Holy Communion.

His diary reveals that in those years in which numbers can be discerned, the most he ever attended church was 18 times. The average over the 14 years in which attendance numbers can be told averages less than 6 times per year. I am amazed at what serves as regular attendance for christian nation fundies. I quote from the Bible. Electrolyte quotes from the Bible. Accipiter quotes from the Bible. trebor quotes from the Bible. T.Q. quotes from the Bible. Penfold quotes from the Bible. I guess we are all devout christians. The question is, why did Washington quote from the Bible? But Washington didn't use the word ""divine."" He said ""revelation."" Thomas Jefferson did too. He said so when he penned the words, ""We hold these truths to be self evident..."" The word ""revelation"" does not mean the Bible to a Deist. Right. So were Jefferson and Madison, neither of whom were christians. The position was more like ""town alderman"" than ""devout christian."" It was a political position in a state in which political and ecclesiastical power were the same. Still you propagate that lie on nothing more than wishful thinking. We accept the word of his pastors and his friends who asserted that Washington was a Deist. Seems strange that when Washington became aware that he was dying, he declined the offer to call a clergyman to his bedside. How strange for a devout christian. How bizarre that all of this discussion was instigated by an objection from one of the whiner twins about an undisputed phrase in an article of the Treaty of Tripoli that I posted in my sig. It seems that Washington, Adams, and the entire Senate agreed with that statement. But modern christian nation advocates who nurse on invented propaganda object.
