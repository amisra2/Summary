God will be nice to you forever when you choose Jesus. But you'll be in big trouble if you don't. And that will be YOUR CALL, so if you fail to repent and wind up in the Pit, don't blame God. Blame yourself, because you were warned.","JWilliam","396524","I don't understand this whole damnation thing. Why would an all loving God send someone to hell to be totured for not following his rules? And how is this an expression of free will? An ultimatum is not a choice. And how arrogant do you have to be to create a species whose sole purpose is to worship you? And then to condemn them if they don't?","delusion-atheists","06:03 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","167"

And welcome to the forum... Verses About Salvation But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, John 1:12 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. John 3:16-17 Jesus said to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. John 14:6 Let it be known to you therefore, brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses. Acts 13:38-39 For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. Romans 1:16 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, Romans 3:23 For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans 6:23 because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. For the Scripture says, Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame. For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him. For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. Romans 10:9-13 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. 2 Corinthians 5:17 In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory. Ephesians 1:13-14 For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. Ephesians 2:8-9 Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, Philippians 2:12 And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. Colossians 2:13-14 For God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we might live with him. 1 Thessalonians 5:9-10 For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works. Titus 2:11-14 Though you have not seen him, you love him. Though you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory, obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls. 1 Peter 1:8-9","delusion-atheists","12:13 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","168"

I look forward to having fun, heartful, thoughtful and thought provoking debates with you. I'm not going to respond to each of the sciptures one by one they all seem to reiterate the idea of salvation through Jesus which doesn't fully answer my question. The one that got close was... But then why would we be sent to hell for not accepting Christ? I understand that the above says He doesn't want to. But He will if we don't follow his word. As mentioned before this is not a choice but an ultimatum. We do not choose to go to hell. We choose to believe or not believe. He chooses to send us to hell. He doesn't have to do this. We could not believe and go to heaven if He makes it so. @Winston I'm sure your reasons may be valid but I will have to agree with Easy and say that name calling does more harm to you than your target. Perhaps this was the last straw?","delusion-atheists","11:34 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","174"
