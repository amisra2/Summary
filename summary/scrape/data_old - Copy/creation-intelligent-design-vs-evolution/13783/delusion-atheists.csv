Without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is impossible to create a parody of Fundamentalism that SOMEONE won't mistake for the real thing.[1] Speaking of dellusion, I'm surprised some YEC didn't already post this in favor of their arguments. Lately, its been tough for us Christians. From Elton John to best-selling books, one of which calls God a delusion,faith is under attack. Well, I have news for atheists, theyre the ones who are deluded! Because God exists He made the universe Im 100% sure of it. How do I know? From the Bible, In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. It says so right there on page one of the book God himself says he wrote. Checkmate! Sorry atheists, scientists believe that the earth is billions of years old, because of something called radioactive decay. Well, the truth is, the earth is only about 6000 years old. God says so in the Bible. Now, who should we believe, the creator of the universe, or some scientist freaks who dont even believe in God? Astronomers claim they can see galaxies so far away, their light must be even older than the earth for them to be visible. But the Bible proves thats impossible. When God created everything, he must have set the light from those galaxies already beaming towards the earth,j so that when he later gave us telescopes, wed have more stuff to look at! Heh, heh, is God unbelievable or what? Now if you think that isnt the work of a conscious, omnipotent being whose son on earth was Jesus Christ, you must be deluded or something. According to atheists, fossils in the ground show that evolution, not intelligent design, produced all life on earth. Thats ridiculous, the Bible clearly says God created man in his own image, though some deluded scientists also say you can see evolution happening in the mutations of drug resisting bacteria. Give me a break God [inaudible mumbling] genes so that Christians can go to heaven, and that means we [George Bush/monkey visual] came from monkeys? Its amazing how science can cure diseases, smash the atom, and create nuclear explosions, yet be so wrong about everything thats mentioned in the Holy Bible. Im sure well find fossils of giants and unicorns one of these days. Look, Im a Christian, and us Christians, we understand that things like miracles that defy the laws of physics are the truth. We will never question that, because we are 100% certain that God meant what he wrote. Scientists arent certain about anything all they have is a bunch of theories! (gravity) Clearly, stuff like science and reason have no place in our lives in the 21st century we must live by the words of a very, very, old religious book. So that when the earth is consumed in fire at Armageddon, well physically ascend to paradise. And when I pray, the creator himself, and his son, born of a blessed virgin, come, and they speak to me, and they tell me Im correct. So atheists, who exactly is the deluded one here? Lately, its been tough for us atheists. From recent scientific discoveries that show the amazing complexities of the simplest forms of life, the subsequent mathematical improbability of random, chance, godless processes producing and maintaining life, to people like Behe, Dembski, Spetner, and many websites untainted with liberalism and political correctness of the mainstream media, the movie Expelled that showed a very real probability of how weve been so close to violating the U.S. Constitution in academia. Well I have news for Christians/conservatives theyre the ones who are deluded! [insert stream of vulgar name calling here] Because God does not exist random chance made the universe with all its order and complexity! How do I know this? From Madelyn Murray OHair! She said so, she proved how smart she was when she won her separation of church and state lawsuit in 1963! She has garnered so many followers that also happened to have an interest in science, that theyve managed to take over the scientific community! How could they be wrong? How could their current representatives, Dawkins and Harris, be wrong? They obviously know all things! Now, who should we believe, the Bible, written and preserved over the entire period of the human ability to write, no matter how many attempts have been made to destroy it, or Dawkins and Harris and their millions of followers in the scientific community? It doesnt matter what the Bible says, Tiktaalik Roseaea is real! A small band of atheist explorers said so! We can look in telescopes and see all the galaxies we want! We know it took that light hundreds of billions of years to reach us! No God would have made the universe, and sat around that long waiting for us to be able to see it! Heh heh, is science unbelievable or what? Now, if you think we dont know how big those galaxies are, how many stars they contain, how many planets they contain that have life on them, how long it takes their light to get here (accurate to only a few hundred light years, plus or minus), you must be deluded or something! Just ask us, well tell you! According to Christians, orderly , specified complexity in life and the universe show a mathematical improbability very close to impossibility of random, purposeless origins and existence of reality. Thats ridiculous all you have to do is note that someone wins the lottery just about every week despite that individuals almost impossible chances - that tells you that evolution HAD to have happened! Dawkins and Harris clearly say that God does not exist, though some deluded non-atheist scientists say that chance cant fully explain evolution, let alone the origins of life. Dawkins has dreams that spacemen came long ago and sowed the seeds of life on earth then flew away, never to be seen again! How could he be wrong he knows all things! Its amazing how the Bible can give us such obviously sound advise concerning finances, morality, behavior, as well as such accurate predictions about the breakdown of those things, and be so wrong about everything that science tells us about politics,and liberalism [Obama/Ried] visual here] and be so wrong about the age of the earth, or how long it takes light to reach us! Im sure well find out life originated from lifeless matter someday, its been just around the corner for 150 years now. Never mind that the corner keeps getting further and further away scientifically, were going to find it really soon! Look, Im an atheist, and us atheists, we understand that things like miracles that defy the laws of physics (the origin of life by natural processes) are the truth. We know there is no God, we will never question that, because we are 100% certain that Madelyn Murray OHair was right! Christians arent certain about anything they dont know how God originated, or where he is! They have no clue about all those galaxies like we do! Clearly, stuff like morals and finances, and written history have no place in our lives in the 21st century, we must live by the words of Dawkins and Harris soon they will be able to cure ALL diseases, make us all live forever, and count more galaxies for us! So that when there is no more death or sorrow thanks to science, and people like Dawkins, Harris, and Obama are ruling over every aspect of our lives, theyll inform me that theyre correct, and they'll have ways of seeing to it that I agree with them. Are Christians ever that logical? So Christians, who exactly is the deluded one here?","marc9000","385920","I wasnt familiar with Poes Law either. Heres what I found on it; Deleted from Wikipedia - Poe's law (deleted 15 May 2008 at 06:32 - Deletionpedia ) It lasted 21 days on Wikipedia before being deleted, and it was originated by a Christianforums poster named Nathan Poe. Doesnt really seem like that big of deal to me, but the atheist community seems to be increasingly fascinated with anything at all that allows them to mock Christianity. As this now famous genius Poe puts it; So thats a problem of fundamentalism, and not a problem with the one creating the parody? Apparently the creation of parodies for fundamentalism is a large part of atheism. Lets have a look at it a little pause button action, a little jotting down and we have it in writing! Atheist scientists (or Algore) provided me with this technology, not sure which. <--- (one of those smileys Mr Poe enlightened me on) Not too bad so far, if we overlook the word arrangement of a 13 year old valley girl, spoken in the voice of a gay 21 year old college student. So far I'm fooled, but suspicious. Moving on; Uh oh, Mr. Poe's proclamation crashes and burns right there - the Bible says no such thing. This is where a satire quickly changes from something that starts out as mocking, (designed to be something that could be innocence) to a complete lie. It never takes long for atheist satirists to demonstrate their lack of knowledge of the Bible. Atheist mockers dont seem to be quite as skilled as Mr Poe would have us believe. Here, the atheist satirists assign perfection to astronomers. They have no comprehension of God being above and beyond time, and this causes them to feel that theyre on the same level as God, able to question him and challenge him to the same extent he can question us and challenge us. Yet they know that there are characteristics of reality that they themselves cannot explain, though they probably seriously believe that astronomy is an exact, non-controversial science. The George Bush visual, the reference to heaven/monkeys was apparently used to emotionally cover the inadequacy of the fossils in the ground, and mutations of drug resisting bacteria as complete explanations. Really no more amazing how science can cure some diseases, smash the atom, create nuclear explosions, yet screw up many other things that it attempts to do, often at great expense to the general public. Global warming hysteria comes to mind. That would be more likely than finding evidence for abiogenesis. Its always interesting to see atheists making profound statements about billions of years, and mocking the Bible as being very, very old. Okay, enough about that Im now going to condense the various atheist explanations that have been presented to me at 4forums over the years. Is the following a parody, or is it the real thing? I dont have the time nor the funding to put this in video form like Harris and Dawkins. I don't think many, if any, Christians really do - satire about atheism isn't a strong Christian practice, not nearly as strong as atheist satire about Christianity, it seems. Maybe that's what made Poe's Law so notable in the beginning of this thread.","delusion-atheists","07:59 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","5"

I remember once when President George Bush referred to Islam as one of the worlds great religions I guess a U.S. President would have to do that, as the President of a country with no establishment of religion in its foundation. A Christian without speech police can refer to Islam in a more direct way its a false religion. Just about any follower of one certain religion is going to have disdain for any other religion, as well as atheism. Many atheists may think they have an advantage in that regard they think they can group all religions together as being wrong in similar ways about their faith, and separate themselves from them. But since the term religion is so broad and vague, its easy to see that atheists cant really do that so well, because there are a few religions that they cant have much disagreement with Pantheism, scientism, would certainly be two, and there are probably more. Any religion that worships nature, with no defined god, isn't really at odds with atheism, is it? Your phrase within parenthesis, without the influence of God, points out (to me) that discussions about God on these forums, and even throughout Christian study and discussion, are all too often about only his presence or absence, nothing more . There is something more, and that something is Satan, the great deceiver, the evil one. In Databeds hypothetical, where he said stuck them on a planet with no access to any knowledge of God or Christ, my belief is that God/Christ would be there, (omnipresent) but I wasnt really consciously thinking about the possibility of the evil one NOT being there. I believe its Satans presence that causes atheism and it also causes false religions to be dreamed up. So to clarify my answer to his question, for people on another planet with no access to any knowledge of God or Christ would become a blend of atheism and false religion, since Satan is the author of both. To me as a fundamental Christian, there is little difference between the two.","delusion-atheists","08:08 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","19"

It is true that, in the Septuagint version (the Greek translation of the Old Testament), the translation of Ex.3:14 is ego eimi ho on (""I am the One who exists""). But it is important to note that the Septuagint is actually attempting to translate this difficult Hebrew phrase, and it is of no small significance that the translator felt the need to use two different forms of the verb ""to be"" to do so. Neither of these forms is future, by the way, nor is either form potential (we might have expected an optative or a subjunctive). The point is that even in the third century B.C., the Hebrew ""eyeh 'asher 'eyeh"" really was difficult to do justice to. Given that immediately after this, God tells Moses to tell the Israelites that ""'eyeh"" has sent him (using only one half of the repeated verbal coupling), Jesus statement ""I am"" seems as close as one might come to quoting this passage in Greek (or any other language). So there is really no doubt whatsoever that Jesus is directly and deliberately referring to Exodus 3:14 with these words, regardless of the exact phraseology used by the LXX. Similarly, in Rev.1:8, the Father describes Himself as ""ho on, kai ho en, kai ho erchomenos"" - ""the One who is, and who was, and who is coming"". Both renderings have, to my mind, one and the same central objective: to make clear that God is the author of all existence, of all creation, and that He is supreme within that creation, being both the definition and the ruler of the very notion of being and existence. The use of the divine ""being"" Name in Exodus chapter three (by our Lord Jesus in Christophany acting for the Father) served to put the Israelites on notice that this God is in no way comparable to the gods with which they were familiar (so neither is His Name comparable).

That's what a Christian government would probably be, so you struck out. Well that's horse drip anyway: Here are just some of the facts that are seldom taught in Americas public school classrooms: The most frequently recognized source for political inspiration for the founding fathers was the Bible, which was referenced in some 34% of the founding fathers quotations. The first reference to God as the foundation of an American colony was noted in the Mayflower Compact, dated November 11, 1620: .Having undertaken for the Glory of God, and advancement of the Christian faith, and the honour of our king and country, a voyage to plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia; Do by these presents, solemnly and mutually in the presence of God and one another, covenant and combine ourselves together into a Civil Body. Many of the founding fathers recognized that the principles of civil law were inseparably linked to Biblical truths. James Wilson, one of the original Supreme Court Justices, and a signer of the Constitution, explained, Human law must rest its authority ultimately upon the authority of that law which is divineFar from being rivals or enemies, religion and law are twin sisters, friends, and mutual assistants Additionally, the United States Supreme Court specifically recognized America as a Christian nation. In the case Church of the Holy Trinity vs. the United States (Feb. 29, 1892, US457-458), Justice Josiah Brewer, following a lengthy and exhaustive search of early American historical literature, commented, We find everywhere a clear recognition of the same truth.that we are a Christian nation. In another Supreme Court Case, Zorach vs. Clauson (1952, US306 307 313), Justice William O. Douglas categorically stated, We are a religious people and our institutions presuppose a Supreme Being. Further, in United States vs. Macintosh (1931, 283 US 605, 625), Justice George Sutherland affirmed, We are a Christian people.affording to one another the equal right of religious freedom, and acknowledge with reverence the duty of obedience to the will of God. At the Constitutional Convention on June 28, 1787, Benjamin Franklin noted: The longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the Sacred Writings, that except the Lord build the House, they labor in vain that build it. There are many today who believe Franklin was a strict deist, but Franklin here is not only referencing the Bible, but is alluding in part to a teaching by Jesus Christ from Matthew 10:29. Concerning the outcome of the American Revolution, John Quincy Adams noted, The highest glory won from the American Revolution was this: it connected, in one indissoluble bond, the principles of civil government with the principles of Christianity. In a letter to Thomas Jefferson dated June 28, 1813, John Adams wrote: The general principles on which the (founding) fathers achieved independence werethe general principles of Christianity. Founding father Noah Webster proclaimed much the same message when he said, The religion which has introduced civil liberty is the religion of Christ and His ApostlesThis is genuine Christianity and to this we owe our free constitutions of government . Time after time, the founding fathers declared similar beliefs. From the archives of Patrick Henrys personal notes (handwritten on the back of his copy of the Stamp Act Resolutions, made public after his death) we read: Whether this (new government) will prove a blessing or a curse will depend upon the use our people make of the blessings which a gracious God hath bestowed on us. If they are wise they will be great and happy. If they are of a contrary character, they will be miserable. Righteousness alone can exalt them as a nation. Thomas Jefferson was hardly speaking from a strict deist standpoint when he said: Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice cannot sleep forever. (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781) I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who lead our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessities and comforts of life. (Monday, March 4, 1805, in his 2nd Inaugural Address) Remember, a strict deist was one who believed God was like a watchmaker, who wound up the universe and thereafter did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. Jefferson obviously believed otherwise. Speaking of Godly principles, Jefferson stated: A more beautiful or precious morsel of ethics I have never seen; it is a document in proof that I am a real Christian, that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus. (Jan. 9, 1816 In a letter to Charles Thomson) George Washington, the Father of our Country, likewise recognized God as supremely important in the American dream. In his first inaugural address on April 30, 1789, Washington remarked: It would be improper to omit, in this first official act, my fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the universe. On Saturday, October 3, 1789, President Washington said this in proclaiming a day of national thanksgiving: It is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the Providence of Almighty God. Today, our public schools are in a moral crisis. Washington once noted, If you remove religious principles from the schools you are going to lose national morality. How prophetic he was! Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence who was also known as the Father of Public Schools, once had this to offer: The only foundation for a republic isreligion. Without it there can be no virtue, and without virtue there can be no liberty. Dont miss the significance of that last statement: ..without virtue there can be no liberty. The principle is clear a lack of virtue engenders bondage. As one writer noted, Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their fetters (bindings). The more liberties a godless people achieve, the more enslaved they ultimately become in their worldly obsessions. Still another founding father, the Reverend John Witherspoon, mirrored Benjamin Rush when he declared, Civil liberty cannot long be preserved without virtue. And finally, lets not forget James Madison, known as the Chief Architect of U.S. Constitution, who once had this to say: Cursed be all that learning that is contrary to the Cross of Christ. This is just a very short list of thousands of such examples that clearly speak of the Biblical and Christian foundations of our Founding Fathers and early America. Along with these there were the church services in government buildings up to and shortly after the civil war; paid chaplains, government authorized missionaries, reliefs of Moses and the Ten Commandments in the Supreme Court building, and so on and so forth. Whatever moral foundations apart from Christian and Biblical principles one may argue was second, was not even a close second. The record on that is clear. And so today, the debate over the moral foundations of America continues, but not in this quarter. America is in a moral and spiritual decline due to the ungodly secularization of this country. Thou shalt not has been replaced with, If it feels good do it. The wisdom of God has been replaced with the tenets of men; absolute truths replaced with moral relativism, and Father God has been replaced with Mother Earth. America is now paying the price for this ill-conceived venture. The remedy: A return to Godly values and principles, upon which this nation of the people, by the people, and for the people, was clearly founded.

Henry then fought to defeat the ratification of the Constitution - it was godless you know. So I ask again, where in the founding document (there is only one) are these christian principles mentioned? It amazes me how the Constitution went from universal opposition from christians (It was opposed from the pulpit by both Anglican and Congregationalist clergy, the two largest denominations) in 1797 to now being claimed as representative of christian ideals. It is even more stunning that these same christians who claim the Constitution as their own work so hard to undermine it in order to establish their religion as official, with official public displays, prayer in schools, religion taught as science, etc. It has to be a christian nation so that christians can impose their religion and go back to slavery and expelling, imprisoning, torturing and killing anyone who disagrees.

For example, opposition to the ratification of the Constitution was primarily for two reasons: one of those reasons was political, resting on the form of government and manner of representation; the other was religious, resting on whether the Constitution granted recognition to the Christian religion. Both in the chambers of the state legislatures and from the pulpits of churches, Christians worked to defeat the ratification of the new Constitution on the grounds that it did not acknowledge Christianity; that it was Godless. In the Virginia legislature it was a Christian, Patrick Henry, proudly claimed by fundamentalist Christians as one of the founding fathers, who led the opposition to the Constitution. And yet, fundamentalist Christians claim that the Constitution was inspired by Christian principles. If that were true, why would Christians have opposed the ratification of that Godless document? Consider the case of Thomas Jefferson. Even though Jefferson often expressed his disdain for Christianity and the Christian clergy, and often expressed his liberal, non-dogmatic religion, and even though fundamentalists do at times admit that Jefferson was not a Christian but a Deist or at best Unitarian, modern fundamentalists also frequently talk out of the other side of their mouths and attempt to rehabilitate Jefferson with claims that he was a Christian. Those claims are particularly strange since Jeffersons statement to Benjamin Rush, engraved on the Jefferson Memorial, for I have sworn upon the altar of god, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man, was a statement of his opinion of the Christian clergy when read in context. Note that the word god is not capitalized as is true of Jeffersons original manuscript. That would be typical of a deist. But Jefferson did have great respect for Jesus although he denied any divinity. Isnt it strange that in order to make their point fundamentalist Christians are willing to accept as Christian a man who thought that Jesus was nothing more than a good man. We have even seen claims that Benjamin Franklin, George Mason, James Madison and Benjamin Rush (friend of and consultant to Thomas Paine) were Christians. It seems that the only one to have been missed is Thomas Paine. Consider the fact that there is not a single, verified example of George Washington making any reference to Jesus Christ or even God in his private correspondence - strange for a man who Christians claim as one of them is of no consequence to fundamentalist Christians. You can find many quotes on fundamentalist web sites put forward to prove that Washington was a Christian. All such examples are apparently inventions since Washington scholars repeatedly deny their veracity. One Christian apologist has even admitted making up quotes. During the Constitutional Convention itself, during discussion of Article VI, it was proposed and rejected that there be some religious test. As Luther Martin said, many delegates rejected the idea that ""it would be at least decent to hold out some distinction between the professors of Christianity and downright infidelity or paganism."" (By the way, it seems that some modern Christians, lacking adequate command of their own language, have great difficulty with 18th century English. Mr. Martin's use of the word ""professors"" indicates men who declare openly that they are Christians. It has nothing to do with university teachers.) It should also be noted that Benjamin Franklin's motion to begin the sessions of the Constitutional Convention with a prayer was not passed. After Franklins motion, there was a brief discussion and then the session was adjourned without moving a vote on the motion. It was never mentioned again. Thus, not a single session of the Constitutional Convention began with a prayer. It might also be noted that Franklin did not propose prayer to Jesus or even god. Franklin proposed prayer to implore the assistance of ""Heaven.""

You're the one who is confused, not me. A true deist was one who believed God created the universe and then sat back and (1) did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations and, (2) did not give (divine) revelation to man. In addition, one of the standard definitions of Deism, then and now, is this: Deism is defined in Webster's Encyclopedic Dictionary, 1941, as: ""[From Latin Deus, God.Deity] The doctrine or creed of a Deist."" And Deist is defined in the same dictionary as: ""One who believes in the existence of a God or supreme being but denies revealed religion, basing his belief on the light of nature and reason."" Along these lines many would argue that, according to 18th century deism, God would not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. He was like the watchmaker who created / wound up the universe and then sat back and didnt involve himself further. People who today try to classify Jefferson, Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and other founding fathers as strict deists have to contend with any number of quotations from these individuals, which to the contrary, show that they believed God did involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. Thomas Jefferson was hardly speaking from a strict deist standpoint when he said : ""Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the gift of God?

Speech to the Constitutional Convention (June 28, 1787) In a pamphlet for Europeans titled Information to Those Who Would Remove to America, 1754, Benjamin Franklin wrote: ""Atheism is unknown there; Infidelity rare and secret; so that persons may live to a great age in that country without having their piety shocked by meeting with either an Atheist or an Infidel. And the Divine Being seems...pleased to favor the whole country."" Religion of the Founding Fathers of America George Washington: He (Washington) was an open promoter of Christianity. For example, in his speech on May 12, 1779, he claimed that what children needed to learn above all was the religion of Jesus Christ, and that to learn this would make them greater and happier than they already are; on May 2, 1778, he charged his soldiers at Valley Forge that To the distinguished character of patriot, it should be our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of Christian ; and when he resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the military on June 8, 1783, he reminded the nation that without a humble imitation of the Divine Author of our blessed religion we can never hope to be a happy nation. Washington's own adopted daughter declared of Washington that you might as well question his patriotism as to question his Christianity. In addition, the inscription on Washington's tomb at Mount Vernon is this: WITHIN THIS ENCLOSURE REST THE REMAINS OF GENL. GEORGE WASHINGTON."" Over the door of the inner tomb is inscribed: ""I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE."" James Madison trained for ministry with the Rev. Dr. John Witherspoon, and Madison's writings are replete with declarations of his faith in God and in Christ. In fact, for proof of this, one only need read his letter to Attorney General Bradford wherein Madison laments that public officials are not bold enough about their Christian faith in public and that public officials should be fervent advocates in the cause of Christ. And while Madison did allude to a wall of separation, contemporary writers frequently refuse to allow Madison to provide his own definition of that wall. According to Madison, the purpose of that wall was only to prevent Congress from passing a national law to establish a national religion.

But consider the facts. At least 50 of the 55 framers of the U. S. Constitution were Christians (see M. E. Bradford...). Every single American president has taken his oath on the Bible and has referenced God in his inaugural address. Every one of the 50 state constitutions call on God for support. The Supreme Court, in 1892 after a an exhaustive 10-year study of the matter, said: ""This is a relgious people. This is a Christian nation."" Even today, the Supreme Court opens each session with the verbal declaration, ""God save the United States of America."" The first state constitution was the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut (1639). You may read this document at The University of Oklahoma College of Law: A Chronology of US Historical Documents: The Fundamental Orders of Connecticut . The framers of this document desired that every aspect of it be based on the Bible (See DeMar's book listed below, America's Christian History, pgs. 57-58). This document was a model for other constitutions including the U.S. Consitution which followed. The above table outlines the wide spread influence of biblical thought on America's legal system. What is the purpose of civil government, according to the Bible? The purpose of civil government is very simply to be God's servant to restrain evil and reward good (Romans 13:1-7; 1 Peter 2:13-14). Christians are (a) to pray for and obey governmental authority (1 Timothy 2:1-4), (b) unless it forbids what God requires or requires what God forbids, in which case Christians cannot submit, and some form of civil disobedience becomes inescapable (Acts 4:18-31, 5:17-29), (c) to influence government because all of life is under God's authority (Psalm 24:1; Psalm 83:18; Isaiah 42:8; Matthew 28:18-20; 2 Corinthians 10:5). In a participatory democracy, Christians are under obligation to participate in civil government (Matthew 22:21).","delusion-atheists","08:44 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","47"

Where did our christian founding fathers state in the founding documents that they were founding a christian nation. The only place I am aware that the topic came up was in the discussions of Article VI. After the discussion the article reads, ""no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States."" This is certainly not a christian principle. Christians have always required that everyone agree with them, and they use imprisonment, torture, and execution to accomplish that. Always have. Why do you think that the Pilgrims left England? They wanted to establish a government where they were free to banish, imprison, torture, and execute anyone who had different beliefs. They were quite successful in doing so. Your remark about Jefferson is really off the wall. It shows the most fundamental ignorance of the topic. Some things that Thomas Jefferson said: ""Say nothing of my religion. It is known to my god and myself alone."" ""I am of a sect by myself, as far as I know."" ""What all agree upon is probably right; what no two agree in most probably is wrong."" Jefferson was writing to Adams about religion in that last one. ""Millions of innocent men, women, and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, and imprisoned; yet we have not advanced one inch toward uniformity. What has been the effect of coercion? To make one-half the world fools and the other half hypocrites. To support roguery and error all over the earth."" You asked, if Jefferson could be speaking from a deist standpoint when he said: ""Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice cannot sleep forever."" Clearly he was. He didn't mention christianity or Jesus. He did mention God. Quite typical of deism. And of course there is: ""I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who lead our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessities and comforts of life."" Again, nothing about christianity or Jesus. I followed with my finger and moved my lips when I read but still didn't find it. The quote is pretty typical of deism. But this is all irrelevant. None if it either supports or denies the founding of a christian nation. That can only be supported by quoting the words in the founding document. Where does the constitution even mention god, Jesus, christianity? Where does it establish a christian nation?

"01-18-2010","13783",4,"None","None","None","Easyrider","386301","The religious practices of this country were around a long time before godless atheists and others like Pandion tried to impose their revisionist standards and dogma on Americans. In the beginning of the American dream, the mention of God was welcome in the halls of government, in our schools, and in our courts of law. So before Mr. Pandion tries to tell you different, here's what was once lawful and appropriate in our nation's Capitol, and elsewhere: To start with: ""Within a year of his inauguration, Jefferson began attending church services in the House of Representatives. Madison followed Jefferson's example, although unlike Jefferson, who rode on horseback to church in the Capitol, Madison came in a coach and four. Worship services in the House--a practice that continued until after the Civil War--were acceptable to Jefferson because they were nondiscriminatory and voluntary. Preachers of every Protestant denomination appeared. (Catholic priests began officiating in 1826.) As early as January 1806 a female evangelist, Dorothy Ripley, delivered a camp meeting-style exhortation in the House to Jefferson, Vice President Aaron Burr, and a ""crowded audience."" Throughout his administration Jefferson permitted church services in executive branch buildings. The Gospel was also preached in the Supreme Court chambers."" More in the following U.S. Library of Congress link: Religion and the Federal Government: PART 2 (Religion and the Founding of the American Republic, Library of Congress Exhibition) The Danbury Baptist Letter, as Originally Drafted The Library of Congress is grateful to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory for recovering the lines obliterated from the Danbury Baptist letter by Thomas Jefferson. He originally wrote ""a wall of eternal separation between church and state,"" later deleting the word ""eternal."" He also deleted the phrase ""the duties of my station, which are merely temporal."" Jefferson must have been unhappy with the uncompromising tone of both of these phrases, especially in view of the implications of his decision, two days later, to begin attending church services in the House of Representatives. Reserved Seats at Capitol Services Here is a description, by an early Washington ""insider,"" Margaret Bayard Smith (1778-1844), a writer and social critic and wife of Samuel Harrison Smith, publisher of the National Intelligencer, of Jefferson's attendance at church services in the House of Representatives: ""Jefferson during his whole administration was a most regular attendant. The seat he chose the first day sabbath, and the adjoining one, which his private secretary occupied, were ever afterwards by the courtesy of the congregation, left for him."" The Old House of Representatives Church services were held in what is now called Statuary Hall from 1807 to 1857. The first services in the Capitol, held when the government moved to Washington in the fall of 1800, were conducted in the ""hall"" of the House in the north wing of the building. In 1801 the House moved to temporary quarters in the south wing, called the ""Oven,"" which it vacated in 1804, returning to the north wing for three years. Services were conducted in the House until after the Civil War. The Speaker's podium was used as the preacher's pulpit. A Millennialist Sermon Preached in Congress This sermon on the millennium was preached by the Baltimore Swedenborgian minister, John Hargrove (1750-1839) in the House of Representatives. One of the earliest millennialist sermons preached before Congress was offered on July 4, 1801, by the Reverend David Austin (1759-1831), who at the time considered himself ""struck in prophesy under the style of the Joshua of the American Temple."" Having proclaimed to his Congressional audience the imminence of the Second Coming of Christ, Austin took up a collection on the floor of the House to support services at ""Lady Washington's Chapel"" in a nearby hotel where he was teaching that ""the seed of the Millennial estate is found in the backbone of the American Revolution."" First Catholic Sermon in the House On January 8, 1826, Bishop John England (1786-1842) of Charleston, South Carolina, became the first Catholic clergyman to preach in the House of Representatives. The overflow audience included President John Quincy Adams, whose July 4, 1821, speech England rebutted in his sermon. Woman Preacher in the House (and call for revival!) In 1827, Harriet Livermore (1788-1868), the daughter and granddaughter of Congressmen, became the second woman to preach in the House of Representatives. The first woman to preach before the House (and probably the first woman to speak officially in Congress under any circumstances) was the English evangelist, Dorothy Ripley (1767-1832), who conducted a service on January 12, 1806. Jefferson and Vice President Aaron Burr were among those in a ""crowded audience."" Sizing up the congregation, Ripley concluded that ""very few"" had been born again and broke into an urgent, camp meeting style exhortation, insisting that ""Christ's Body was the Bread of Life and His Blood the drink of the righteous."" Communion Service in the Treasury Building Manasseh Cutler here describes a four-hour communion service in the Treasury Building, conducted by a Presbyterian minister, the Reverend James Laurie: ""Attended worship at the Treasury. Mr. Laurie alone. Sacrament. Full assembly. Three tables; service very solemn; nearly four hours."" Adams's Description of a Church Service in the Supreme Court John Quincy Adams here describes the Reverend James Laurie, pastor of a Presbyterian Church that had settled into the Treasury Building, preaching to an overflow audience in the Supreme Court Chamber, which in 1806 was located on the ground floor of the Capitol. The Old Supreme Court Chamber Description of church services in the Supreme Court chamber by Manasseh Cutler (1804) and John Quincy Adams (1806) indicate that services were held in the Court soon after the government moved to Washington in 1800. Church Services in Congress after the Civil War Charles Boynton (1806-1883) was in 1867 chaplain of the House of Representatives and organizing pastor of the First Congregational Church in Washington, which was trying at that time to build its own sanctuary. In the meantime the church, as Boynton informed potential donors, was holding services ""at the Hall of Representatives"" where ""the audience is the largest in town. . . .nearly 2000 assembled every Sabbath"" for services, making the congregation in the House the ""largest Protestant Sabbath audience then in the United States."" The First Congregational Church met in the House from 1865 to 1868. House of Representatives, After the Civil War The House moved to its current location on the south side of the Capitol in 1857. It contained the ""largest Protestant Sabbath audience"" in the United States when the First Congregational Church of Washington held services there from 1865 to 1868.

That clause was specifically to allow the slave trade. It was put in as a concession to that christian majority of the south that you guys talked about. And then there is Article 4, Section 2, Clause 3: ""No Person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labour, but shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due."" That required northerners to return slaves to their christian, southern masters. And if you are going to claim that it wasn't the christians who owned slaves, it's already too late for that. You have claimed that George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison were christians.

I did better. I point out two places that were based on the christian tolerance for slavery. The best they have done is to quote someone mentioning god and claiming that it doesn't sound like deism to them. I wonder if they actually have any idea of the nature of deism in the US in the late 1700s. Funny how they cite ""all men are created equal"" without even noticing what preceded that statement. First of all, it is the ""Laws of Nature and Nature's God"" that entitle them to independence. This is a phrase that is quite typical of deism. The deist god created nature and nature governed the earth without god. Further, it is ""a decent respect to the opinions of mankind"" that impel them to declare the reasons. It isn't a respect for jesus or god. Following that the D of I says that ""We hold these truths to be self evident; that all men are created equal."" How is it that this is somehow a tenet of christianity if it is self evident rather than revealed by christian scripture? Actually, if the christian nation people bothered to educate themselves they would know that self evident truth, equality of all, as well as ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."" are taken from previous writing by humanistic deists. By the way, it was ""life, liberty and property"" in the original by Locke (definitely not a christian - in fact, scorned by christians). Jefferson just wanted to dress it up because he didn't feel that everyone had a right to property - only the intelligentsia, he among them. And when the Constitution was written and placed before the people of the United States for ratification, it was the christians who opposed ratification. Christian clergy preached against the Constitution from the pulpit and christian legislators harangued against it in state legislatures. Christians opposed the Constitution because it was ""godless,"" not based on christian principles. The Constitution granted no special status to christianity or christian principles. It states specifically that no religious test is required for any office under the Constitution. So again I ask the christian nation weenies, where in the Constitution (the founding document of our nation) are these christian principles mentioned? Where does that document mention either jesus or god? Further, as T.Q. and Penfold add, what specifically are these principles that are specific to christianity alone and not civilization in general? And my other questions have also gone unanswered. I guess our christian nation weenies can't answer. How many times is god mentioned in the Constitution? How many times is jesus mentioned in the Constitution? How many times is religion mentioned in the Constitution? Funny how they don't know. On a side note, isn't it peculiar how it is claimed that life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is based on some christian principle, when, in fact, christians have never been shy about taking away all three from anyone who disagreed. Look at the history of any christian country and you will see that it is true. England even fought wars about the correct form of christianity. On the other hand, christian fundamentalists have bee trying for years to impose their religion through government. They want religious displays (their religion) on government property. They want prayer in public schools (their prayers imposed on my children). And they want to replace science (physics, earth science, astronomy, and biology) with their religious mythology.","delusion-atheists","12:33 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","63"

Easy thought he and actually offered something relevant to the question when he cited these and seemed pretty upset when they were ignored. I hope this calms him down. Easy says: Judicial, legislative, and executive branches Constitution and cites Isa 33:22 For the LORD [is] our judge, the LORD [is] our lawgiver, the LORD [is] our king; he will save us. Easy doesnt explain how it is that a single mythical being represents all inspires three branches of government. Easy says: All men are sinners - Constitutional checks and balances And cites Gen 8:21, Jer 17:9, Mk 7: 20-23, Rom 3:23, 1 Jn 1:8 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart [is] evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. The heart [is] deceitful above all [things], and desperately wicked: who can know it? And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man. For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: All these evil things come from within, and defile the man. For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. Easy doesnt tell us how any of that relates to constitutional checks and balances, which have nothing to do with sin. Isnt it amazing how twisted the christian mind can get? Easy says: Sabbath day holy - ""Blue laws"" And cites Ex. 20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Easy doesnt tell us where in the Constitution we can read the article that has to do with blue laws. Those laws are, as far as I know, local in nature and not in effect everywhere in this nation. How is that Biblical trash relevant? Easy says: All men created equal - Declaration of Independence And cites Acts 10:34, 17:26, Gal. 3:28, 1 Pet. 2:17 Then Peter opened [his] mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus, Honour all [men]. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king. Again, Easy doesnt explain why any of that indicates a Christian principle about the equality of all men. Certainly a king is not equal to the subjects. Historically, christians recognized several classes of non-equal people - royalty, nobility, freemen, and serfs and slaves. They were not equal. Three more important facts: First, at the time the Constitution was written, many Christians supported slavery. Slavery was explicitly allowed by the constitution because of the insistence of Southern Christians. Second, the D of I isnt a founding document. It was a statement as to the causes for the separation. Third, the concept of equality is drawn from the writings of humanistic deists of the enlightenment. Christians were generally not in favor of the idea. Were not talking about today when Christians have claimed those ideas for themselves. The fact is that they are not drawn from Christianity but from the ideas of men who opposed Christianity. Easy says: Fair trial with witnesses - Sixth Amendment And cites: Ex. 20:16, Dt. 19:15, Pr. 24:28, 25:18, Mat. 18:16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. ""One witness shall not rise against a man concerning any iniquity or any sin that he commits; by the mouth of two or three witnesses the matter shall be established. Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause, For would you deceive with your lips? A man who bears false witness against his neighbor [Is like] a club, a sword, and a sharp arrow. But if he will not hear, take with you one or two more, that 'by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. Does anyone else find it strange that none of these quotes have anything to do with a court trial? The VI Amendment states: In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district where in the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense. How exactly does the Hebrew prohibition against false witness, commendable as it might be, apply? The lengths to which the Christian nation bunch is willing to go is remarkable. It doesnt matter what the Bible says, they cherry pick quotes out of context to justify imposing their religion on everyone. It doesnt matter where the ideas actually came from; the Christian nation bunch now claims them as their own, some 200 years after they opposed those very same ideas from pulpits and in state legislatures as the fought against the ratification of the godless Constitution. As far as Im concerned, it doesnt matter to me very much. I have studied the Constitution and have formed my own opinions. Mostly I agree with the way it has been interpreted by the Supreme Court. But it does matter to the Christian nation fanatics. Unless it was the intention of the founding fathers to impose Christianity on everyone, their efforts to use the government to impose their religion on everyone are fruitless. They cant put their xmas displays on public buildings, they cant make children pray in school, and they cant teach their religion as science. As a matter of fact, the Constitution also protects children from being required to recite the Pledge of Allegiance who oppose it for religious reasons.","delusion-atheists","12:59 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","69"

Nelly wrote: Woodlawn, 26 February, 1833. Sir, I received your favor of the 20th instant last evening, and hasten to give you the information, which you desire. Truro [Episcopal] Parish is the one in which Mount Vernon, Pohick Church [the church where George Washington served as a vestryman], and Woodlawn [the home of Nelly and Lawrence Lewis] are situated. Fairfax Parish is now Alexandria. Before the Federal District was ceded to Congress, Alexandria was in Fairfax County. General Washington had a pew in Pohick Church, and one in Christ Church at Alexandria. He was very instrumental in establishing Pohick Church, and I believe subscribed [supported and contributed to] largely. His pew was near the pulpit. I have a perfect recollection of being there, before his election to the presidency, with him and my grandmother. It was a beautiful church, and had a large, respectable, and wealthy congregation, who were regular attendants. He attended the church at Alexandria when the weather and roads permitted a ride of ten miles [a one-way journey of 2-3 hours by horse or carriage]. In New York and Philadelphia he never omitted attendance at church in the morning, unless detained by indisposition [sickness]. The afternoon was spent in his own room at home; the evening with his family, and without company. Sometimes an old and intimate friend called to see us for an hour or two; but visiting and visitors were prohibited for that day [Sunday]. No one in church attended to the services with more reverential respect. My grandmother, who was eminently pious, never deviated from her early habits. She always knelt. The General, as was then the custom, stood during the devotional parts of the service. On communion Sundays, he left the church with me, after the blessing, and returned home, and we sent the carriage back for my grandmother. It was his custom to retire to his library at nine or ten o'clock where he remained an hour before he went to his chamber. He always rose before the sun and remained in his library until called to breakfast. I never witnessed his private devotions. I never inquired about them. I should have thought it the greatest heresy to doubt his firm belief in Christianity. His life, his writings, prove that he was a Christian. He was not one of those who act or pray, ""that they may be seen of men"" [Matthew 6:5]. He communed with his God in secret [Matthew 6:6]. My mother [Eleanor Calvert-Lewis] resided two years at Mount Vernon after her marriage [in 1774] with John Parke Custis, the only son of Mrs. Washington. I have heard her say that General Washington always received the sacrament with my grandmother before the revolution. When my aunt, Miss Custis [Martha's daughter] died suddenly at Mount Vernon, before they could realize the event [before they understood she was dead], he [General Washington] knelt by her and prayed most fervently, most affectingly, for her recovery. Of this I was assured by Judge [Bushrod] Washington's mother and other witnesses. He was a silent, thoughtful man. He spoke little generally; never of himself. I never heard him relate a single act of his life during the war. I have often seen him perfectly abstracted, his lips moving, but no sound was perceptible. I have sometimes made him laugh most heartily from sympathy with my joyous and extravagant spirits. I was, probably, one of the last persons on earth to whom he would have addressed serious conversation, particularly when he knew that I had the most perfect model of female excellence [Martha Washington] ever with me as my monitress, who acted the part of a tender and devoted parent, loving me as only a mother can love, and never extenuating [tolerating] or approving in me what she disapproved of others. She never omitted her private devotions, or her public duties; and she and her husband were so perfectly united and happy that he must have been a Christian. She had no doubts, no fears for him. After forty years of devoted affection and uninterrupted happiness, she resigned him without a murmur into the arms of his Savior and his God, with the assured hope of his eternal felicity [happiness in Heaven]. Is it necessary that any one should certify, ""General Washington avowed himself to me a believer in Christianity?"" As well may we question his patriotism, his heroic, disinterested devotion to his country. His mottos were, ""Deeds, not Words""; and, ""For God and my Country.""

One of his pastors commented on that fact from the pulpit and as a result, Washington stopped going to church on Sundays when there was a communion service. From his diary it has been calculated that Washington attended church an average of 6 times a year. In one year he actually attended 14 times. One of the quotes below is from George Custis (Martha's grandson and brother of Nellie) that he went home with Washington and they sent the carriage back for Martha because she had stayed for the communion service. In the spirit of fundamentalist christians, I too will spam the board with quotes. Except mine are from sources that can be verified. ""Dr. Rush told me (he had it from Asa Green) that when the clergy addressed General Washington, on his departure from the government, it was observed in their consultation that he had never, on any occasion, said a word to the public which showed a belief in the Christian religion, and they thought they should so pen their address as to force him at length to disclose publicly whether he was a Christian or not. However, he observed, the old fox was too cunning for them. He answered every article of their address particularly, except that, which he passed over without notice."" -- Thomas Jefferson, quoted from Jefferson's Works, Vol. iv., p. 572. (Asa Green ""was probably the Reverend Ashbel Green, who was chaplain to congress during Washington's administration."" -- Farrell Till in ""The Christian Nation Myth."")

He accepted, to a considerable extent, the skeptical views of French Freethinkers."" -- John E Remsberg, Six Historic Americans.) ""I never witnessed his private devotions. I never inquired about them."" -- Eleanor ""Nellie"" Parke Custis Lewis, Martha Washington's granddaughter from a previous marriage, quoted from Sparks' Washingon, also from Franklin Steiner, The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents, p. 22 ""Sir, Washington was a Deist."" -- The Reverend Doctor James Abercrombie, rector of the church Washington had attended with his wife, to The Reverend Bird Wilson, an Episcopal minister in Albany, New York, upon Wilson's having inquired of Abercrombie regarding Washington's religious beliefs, quoted from John E Remsberg, Six Historic Americans ""The pictures that represent him on his knees in the winter forest at Valley Forge are even silly caricatures. Washington was at least not sentimental, and he had nothing about him of the Pharisee that displays his religion at street corners or out in the woods in the sight of observers, or where his portrait could be taken by 'our special artist'!"" -- The Reverend M J Savage, quoted from Franklin Steiner, The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents, p. 22 ""There was a clergyman at this dinner who blessed the food and said grace after they had done eating and had brought in the wine. I was told that General Washington said grace when there was no clergyman at the table, as fathers of a family do in America. The first time that I dined with him there was no clergyman and I did not perceive that he made this prayer, yet I remember that on taking his place at the table, he made a gesture and said a word, which I took for a piece of politeness, and which was perhaps a religious action. In this case his prayer must have been short; the clergyman made use of more forms. We remained a very long time at the table. They drank 12 or 15 healths with Madeira wine. In the course of the meal beer was served and grum, rum mixed with water."" -- Commissary-General Claude Blanchard, writing in his journal, quoted from Franklin Steiner, The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents, p. 23 ""With respect to the inquiry you make, I can only state the following facts: that as pastor of the Episcopal Church, observing that, on sacramental Sundays George Washington, immediately after the desk and pulpit services, went out with the greater part of the congregation -- always leaving Mrs. Washington with the other communicants -- she invariably being one -- I considered it my duty, in a sermon on public worship, to state the unhappy tendency of example, particularly of those in elevated stations, who uniformly turned their backs on the Lord's Supper. I acknowledge the remark was intended for the President; and as such he received it. A few days after, in conversation, I believe, with a Senator of the United States, he told me he had dined the day before with the President, who, in the course of conversation at the table, said that, on the previous Sunday, he had received a very just rebuke from the pulpit for always leaving the church before the administration of the sacrament; that he honored the preacher for his integrity and candor; that he had never sufficiently considered the influence of his example, and that he would not again give cause for the repetition of the reproof; and that, as he had never been a communicant, were he to become one then, it would be imputed to an ostentatious display of religious zeal, arising altogether from his elevated station. Accordingly, he never afterwards came on the morning of sacrament Sunday, though at other times he was a constant attendant in the morning."" -- The Reverend Doctor James Abercrombie, in a letter to a friend in 1833, Sprague's Annals of the American Pulpit, vol. 5, p. 394, quoted from Franklin Steiner, The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents, pp. 25-26 ""When Congress sat in Philadelphia, President Washington attended the Episcopal Church. The rector, Dr. Abercrombie, told me that on the days when the sacrament of the Lord's Supper was to be administered, Washington's custom was to arise just before the ceremony commenced, and walk out of the church. This became a subject of remark in the congregation, as setting a bad example. At length the Doctor undertook to speak of it, with a direct allusion to the President. Washington was heard afterwards to remark that this was the first time a clergyman had thus preached to him, and he should henceforth neither trouble the Doctor or his congregation on such occasions, and ever after that, upon communion days, 'he absented himself altogether from church.'"" -- The Reverend Bird Wilson, an Episcopal minister in Albany, New York, biographer of Bishop White, in his sermon on the ""Religion of the Presidents,"" published in the Albany Daily Advertiser, in 1831, quoted from Franklin Steiner, The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents, pp. 26 ""I have diligently perused every line that Washington ever gave to the public, and I do not find one expression in which he pledges, himself as a believer in Christianity. I think anyone who will candidly do as I have done, will come to the conclusion that he was a Deist and nothing more."" -- The Reverend Bird Wilson, an Episcopal minister in Albany, New York, in an interview with Mr. Robert Dale Owen written on November 13, 1831, which was publlshed in New York two weeks later, quoted from Franklin Steiner, The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents, pp. 27 ""I called last evening on Dr. Wilson, as I told you I should, and I have seldom derived more pleasure from a short interview with anyone. Unless my discernment of character has been grievously at fault, I met an honest man and a sincere Christian. But you shall have the particulars. A gentleman of this city accompanied me to the Doctor's residence. We were very courteously received. I found him a tall, commanding figure, with a countenance of much benevolence, and a brow indicative of deep thought, apparently 50 years of age. I opened the interview by stating that though personally a stranger to him, I had taken the liberty of calling in consequence of having perused an interesting sermon of his, which had been reported in the Daily Advertiser of this city, and regarding which, as he probably knew, a variety of opinions prevailed. In a discussion, in which I had taken part, some of the facts as there reported had been questioned; and I wished to know from him whether the reporter had fairly given his words or not. I then read to him from a copy of the Daily Advertiser the paragraph which regards Washington, beginning, 'Washington was a man,' etc., and ending 'absented himself altogether from church.' 'I endorse,' said Dr. Wilson with emphasis, 'every word of that. Nay, I do not wish to conceal from you any part of the truth, even what I have not given to the public. Dr. Abercrombie said more than I have repeated. At the close of our conversation on the subject his emphatic expression was -- for I well remember the very words ""Sir, Washington was a Deist.""'"" -- Mr. Robert Dale Owen, newspaper reporter, afterwards a member of Congress and later Minister to Naples, after interviewing Dr. Wilson, giving the substance of the interview in a letter written on November 13, 1831, which was published in New York two weeks later, quoted from Franklin Steiner, The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents, pp. 26-27 ""In regard to the subject of your inquiry, truth requires me to say that General Washington never received the communion in the churches of which I am the parochial minister.

These groups were less anxious to cultivate what they had in common with other Americans than to sustain what kept them apart. Washington recognized this, just as he recognized the tenacity of regional and economic interests, and he took pains to explain precisely what national unity meant to him. He carried to his countrymen a vision of ""organic"" rather than ""mechanical"" solidarity, a union based on difference and interdependence rather than uniformity of belief and conduct. Washington's understanding of the kind of integration appropriate to a modern state was not shared by the most powerful Protestant establishments, the New England Congregationalists and Presbyterians; but other religious groups could not have been more pleased.... Acknowledging in each instance that respect for diversity was a fair price for commitment to the nation and its regime, Washington abolished deep-rooted fears that would have otherwise alienated a large part of the population from the nation-building process.

He left the church with George Custis after the blessing and left Martha to participate in the communion service. Washington sent the carriage back for Martha. But, one might assume that a sincere christian would be sure to attend Sunday services on a regular basis. One of the christian nation boys (easy or archy) even made a comment about how Washington's faithful attendance at church showed he was a christian. The following is a record from Washington's diary of his attendance. Those Sundays in which there is no record of Washington's attendance do not differ in detail from those Sundays on which he did attend church. 1768 - 15 1769 -10 1770 - 9 1771 - 6 1772 - 6 1773 - 5 1774 - 18 This was the year of the Continental Congress and the diary records attendance 6 times in Philadelphia, only three of which were at Anglican churches.

We know that Washington attended services from time to time at 2 churches in New York and two in Philadelphia. 1797 - 4 1798 - 1 1799 - 2 Hardly seems like a devout christian.

You have your sources and I have mine that say otherwise. Here's more: Critics object that Washington never referred to Jesus; refused to partake of the Lord's Supper, and among other things, used Deistic language. Lillback skillfully rebuts all claims: (1) Washington did refer to Jesus, and those who say otherwise just ignore several letters where he recommends ""the author of our Faith"" (a reference to Christ in the book of Hebrews), and the religion of Jesus to the Indians. Also, Washington didn't like to speak of himself at all. It is not the case that he refused to speak of his Faith. Rather, he refused to speak of Washington. (2) It is true at times that Washington refused to take communion, but a number of points need to be made: a) this was not like the modern, high church Episcopalism. Due to the lack of ministers, and the frontier nature of the church, congregations would celebrate communion only a few times a year. Given that other evidence shows Washington took communion , this objection is actually a strong argument for Washington's faith: it is only a few times that Washington actually missed communion! http://www.puritanboard.com/f90/geor...ed-fire-24718/ Was George Washington a Christian? Part Two ""Why do you not know how to interpret the present time?"" (Luke 12:56) In last weeks commentary I examined the secularists accusation that George Washington was not a Christian. They invariably call him a Deist, and try to pin that label on the rest of the Founding Fathers as well. They like to quote Paul Boller, Jr.s 1963 work entitled George Washington & Religion, in which he accused our first President of being a Deist. The issue of Washingtons Christianity is pivotal in the current moral and spiritual civil war for our nations soul, for if these secularists can make a convincing case that the Founding Fathers were not Christians it would be a huge boost for their campaign to undermine the Biblical foundations of America. Last week, to define Deist for my readers I quoted Noah Websters original 1828 American dictionary: one who believes in the existence of a God, but denies revealed religion. I added that the Deists emphatically rejected the divinity of Jesus Christ, the authority and inspiration of Holy Scripture, and the personal nature of God, among other things. They believed that God created the world but then wandered off and ignored it, and has never been heard from since. In examining carefully the voluminous research that objective historians have done on our first President, his spiritual life and character, and in doing my own research into his letters and speeches, I can say that there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that George Washington was not a Deist. He was not even close to being a Deist. Washington was a thoroughly Christian, low-Church Virginia Anglican, who subscribed in all points to orthodox New Testament doctrine. Last week we took up several important proofs of Washingtons Christianity: First, I shared some of the evidence that he was man of prayer, and pointed out that most Deists never bothered with prayer. They didnt think God cared, and besides, since they didnt believe in sin, there was nothing to pray about, anyway! Second, I made the important point that Washington was quite familiar with his Bible. In Peter Lillbacks magnificent book on Washingtons Christian faith, Sacred Fire, he has listed in an appendix over 200 different Biblical phrases or passages, or allusions to Biblical passages. Many of these Washington used over and over in his letters and speeches. It is really quite remarkable how often Biblical passages or incidents cropped up in his thinking and writing. This man knew the Word of God. And he reverenced it, as well. Last week, I quoted from his famous Circular to the States, written to the thirteen State Governors right after the end of the War for Independence. In that letter, he listed several developments that had blessed America, and then he wrote: and above all, the pure and benign light of Revelation (emphasis mine), have had ameliorating influence on mankind and increased the blessings of society. The word Revelation back then generally referred to the Bible, and more specifically to the Gospel of Christ revealed in the New Testament. Notice that he capitalized it, which though standard usage at that time, reveals his acceptance of the inspiration of Holy Scripture. And remember, Deists didnt believe in revelation, because they didnt think that God revealed anything about himself. Lets look at the secularists claim that the Father of our country never used the names God or Jesus which to them is evidence of his supposed Deism. For example, in 1926 historian Rupert Hughes wrote that, there is no direct allusion to Christ, and the word Christ has been found in none of Washingtons almost countless autographs. This is sloppy history writing. Mr. Hughes didnt do his homework! In 1779, some Delaware Indian chiefs came to General George Washingtons encampment, bringing three of their sons that they wanted the whites to educate. In his prepared speech the General said to them: You do well to wish to learn our arts and our way of life, and above all, the religion of Jesus Christ (emphasis mine). These will make you a greater and happier people than you are. Thats putting it rather bluntly! No Deist would have been caught dead telling anyone that the most important thing they could learn was the religion of Jesus Christ. They simply didnt believe it. Granted, Washington hardly ever used the name of Jesus, either in speech or in writing, and he only referred to God by name about one hundred times. But, does this make him a Deist? Hardly. What it makes him is a typical devout 18th Century Virginia Anglican. In Washingtons time Anglicans were very reticent about using the names of Jesus or God. As odd as it sounds to our modern ears, they were very concerned not to profane the sacred names by casual reference to them. Of course, because the Nicene Creed was regularly recited by Washington in the Anglican worship service on Sundays, he would have often professed the names of Jesus and God out loud. But that was sacred usage, with which he would have been totally comfortable. Martha Washington, who was a very strong Christian believer herself, almost always used indirect and honorific titles in place of the names of Jesus and God. Also, in Washingtons personal sermon collection, there is a July 4, 1793 anniversary message from a Presbyterian minister named Samuel Miller who refers to God as: the supreme Arbiter of nations, the grand Source, the Deity himself, the Sovereign Dispenser of all blessings, the Governor of the universe, and so forth. Mr. Miller was certainly no Deist. So, this was common practice at the time, even for ministers of the Gospel. An interesting point is that the Deists were much more inclined to use the names of Jesus and God, precisely because of their lack of reverence. Thomas Paine, whom Lillback calls a soft Deist, used the name of God often, although he also used Creator, and Almighty. Profaning the holy names of Jesus and God, especially in cursing, was something that George Washington hated. In a General Order to his soldiers dated July 29, 1779, he deplored the fact that in spite of the many and pointed orders (that) have been issued against that unmeaning and abominable custom of swearingwith much regret the General observes that it prevails, if possible, more than ever; his feelings are continually wounded by the oaths and imprecations of the soldiers whenever he is in hearing of them. The Name of that Beingis incessantlyprofaned in a manner as wanton as it is shocking. He goes on to say that he hopes that for the sake of religion, decency and order the officers will put a stop to it. Note that he is personally hurt by the swearing obviously because of what the name of God means to him. And, in an order meant to stop the profane use of Gods name, he refers to God indirectly, not wanting to use the name himself. Other typical examples of Washingtons use of indirect titles for Jesus include our gracious Redeemer and the Divine author of our blessed religion. No Deist would ever use those titles! Among his many indirect titles for God (about 95 of them!) we find the Lord, and giver of victory; the Giver of Life; the Judge of the hearts of men; the great Lord and Ruler of nations; and his favorite Providence, with a capital P. He used this one over 270 times! Peter Marshall Ministries, America's Christian Heritage, Restoring America, Christian Homeschool material and curriculum Some deist!

Here's even more sources that record Washington taking communion: There are several testimonies of those who observed him take Holy Communion during the war. General S.H. Lewis of Augusta County, Virginia, in a letter dated December 14, 1855 quoted General Robert Porterfield as saying that he had known General Washington personally for many years I saw him myself on his knees receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. There is also a story that Washington took Communion in the Presbyterian Church while the Continental Army was at Morristown, New Jersey for the winter of 1778-79. Dr. James Richards, who followed Rev. Timothy Johnes, the pastor when Washington was in Morristown, noted that the report that Washington did actually receive the communion from the hands of Dr. Johnes was universally current during that period, and so far as I know, never contradicted. I have often heard it from the members of Dr. Johnes family, while they added that a note was addressed by Washington to their father, requesting the privilege Lastly, there is what I believe is a very credible story from the pen of the Rev. Alexander Hamilton, Mrs. Alexander Hamiltons great-grandson. In 1854, the Hamilton family held a reunion in New York City. Mrs. Hamilton, by then an old woman of ninety-six, was Continental Army General Phillip Schuylers daughter. She insisted on taking her seven-year-old great-grandson, along with other family members, to see St. Pauls Church because she had something very important to tell him. When they got there she took him up to the chancel rail, and told him that she had been present in the church on George Washingtons inauguration day in 1789, when he had received Holy Communion. She made it clear to him that she wanted him to know that she had personally witnessed Washington receiving the Sacrament, so he could tell others. Rev. Hamilton recollected that her words were: If anyone ever tells you that George Washington was not a communicantof the Church, you say that your great-grandmother told you to say that she had knelt at this chancel rail at his side and received with him the Holy Communion.

""When the French monarch proposed the persecution of Christians in his dominion, an old statesman and warrior said to him, 'Sire, the church of God is an anvil that has worn out many hammers.' So the hammers of infidels have been pecking away at this book for ages, but the hammers are worn out, and the anvil still endures. If this book had not been the book of God, men would have destroyed it long ago. Emperors and popes, kings and priests, princes and rulers have all tried their hand at it; they die and the book still lives."" ""No other book has been so chopped, knived, sifted, scrutinized, and vilified. What book on philosophy or religion or psychology or belles lettres of classical or modern times has been subject to such a mass attack as the Bible? With such venom and skepticism? With such thoroughness and erudition? Upon every chapter, line and tenet? The Bible is still loved by millions, and studied by millions.

As mentioned, the ""laws"" are from Franklin Steiner as reported in his book, ""The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents From Washington to F.D.R."" published in 1936. But upon looking into the summary of the Laws, I see that Steiner actually took it from one of 29 essays, written by James Parton and published in the Atlantic Monthly in 1872 and 1873, and collected into a book, ""The Life of Thomas Jefferson"" in 1874. Parton comments on how the law was treated by pre-revolutionary Virginians: ""...it was treated as all Christian nations now treat the sublime moral code of Christ--all believe and none practice."" That attitude doesn't seem to have changed. If you want to find out if the book hides something that I don't want you to find out, you're going to have to buy it and read it.

For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. John 3:16-17 Jesus said to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life.

For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. For the Scripture says, Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.

Do you realize that we are the only creatures God ever created which have free will? Even satan himself doesn't possess that characteristic in his nature or else fallen angels could be forgiven for their rebellion against God. But they can't, only we can since we were deceived in our innocence but the fallen angels rebelled after spending untold millennia in Gods presence. Wrong again, the tree didn't cause Mans spiritual death, disobedience to God did. All we had to do as a race to spend eternity in a perfect Garden and fellowship harmoniously with our Creator would have been to live in the presence of one tree which we all knew we must never touch. Beside that one thing which was a test of our free will, everything else in the world was at our disposal. And we couldn't do that with only 2 people on Earth. Everything else God has done with this human experiment has been designed to reunite us to our former state so He can fellowship with us once again which is why He created us originally.

But I want the true and living maker of my soul if you actually exist at all, or will I just live this life, die one day and become nothingness? If you exist, I want to know you. The bible say's ""to those who grope out into the darkness, I (God) will find YOU"". That is precisely what I did as an innocent teen who hungered to know if God was real or just a myth. All I can assure you of is that although it took 7 years, I met Him in Jesus Christ at around 21 years old. I wasn't going to church at all but was running into believers who witnessed to me at every turn. The wisdom of this world is foolishness to God, my friend. It doesn't matter how enlightened you think you are from a fleshly perspective, your understanding is folly compared to the wisdom which comes from the living God via His Holy Spirit which indwells all believers.

You reveal your arrogance by questioning and then rejecting His plan for how we must live. And God wasn't making an ultimatum as you say, He warned them not to eat of a tree which held fruit that would steal our innocence from us. There were very real consequences from eating that fruit beyond disobedience to God and that was the awareness of evil which we were created innocent of. Also, for the third time in this exchange, without a choice to disobey God, free will would have been an illusion for Adam and Eve and nothing more that a theoretical concept. What God gave them by placing that very real tree in the center of the Garden was an opportunity to know a choice existed and to turn away from it by faith that they could believe their Father who visited with them daily and had warned them that eating of that tree would lead to their deaths. You keep blaming God for the selfishness and disobedience of Man. Is it beyond you people to take personal responsibility for our own actions? Bunk, once again, and it has been clearly explained directly above. Once again you ignore the fact that we are all related to each other through Adam and Eve. We inherited the sin nature via the blood line of humanity, therefore it is through the shed blood of Messiah which redemption and forgiveness of sins is accomplished. Lev 17:11 'For the life [fn] of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood by reason of the life [fn] that makes atonement.' This passage from Leviticus which was speaking to animal sacrifice for the temporary forgiveness of the sins of Jews perfectly and concisely extends Gods future plan to sacrifice His own blood as ""Messiah,"" the perfect Lamb of God for the propitiation of all of the sins of Humanity, once and for all time. If you are able to appreciate and make this connection between the Old and New Testaments, it could lead to the eternal salvation of your soul. Now, in regard to the alleged sin of your baby, when did I ever say that God held him responsible for his sin nature? There is such a thing as an age of accountability when God considers us old enough to know right from wrong and therefore take personal responsibility for our actions. That age is believed to be anywhere between the ages of 11 and 14 depending on the maturity of the average normally developed child. What we call special needs or children of retarded growth will be treated accordingly by God and may never reach the age of accountability.

Even satan himself doesn't possess that characteristic in his nature or else fallen angels could be forgiven for their rebellion against God. But they can't, only we can since we were deceived in our innocence but the fallen angels rebelled after spending untold millennia in Gods presence. Wrong again, the tree didn't cause Mans spiritual death, disobedience to God did. All we had to do as a race to spend eternity in a perfect Garden and fellowship harmoniously with our Creator would have been to live in the presence of one tree which we all knew we must never touch. Beside that one thing which was a test of our free will, everything else in the world was at our disposal. And we couldn't do that with only 2 people on Earth. Everything else God has done with this human experiment has been designed to reunite us to our former state so He can fellowship with us once again which is why He created us originally. All I have done throughout this exchange is explain why! I couldn't be more clear if I wrote it all again so if you haven't gotten it yet at least on an intellectual level if not on a spiritual level, I truly feel for you. When I prayed that night I wasn't a believer at all. I was a 14 year old moslem kid who prayed as generic a prayer as I could think of. I referred to every god I could imagine and asked if either of you is the maker of my soul, the real and living God who knows and defines absolute truth, if absolute truth even exists, then please reveal yourself to me and I will follow you. But I want the true and living maker of my soul if you actually exist at all, or will I just live this life, die one day and become nothingness? If you exist, I want to know you. The bible say's ""to those who grope out into the darkness, I (God) will find YOU"". That is precisely what I did as an innocent teen who hungered to know if God was real or just a myth. All I can assure you of is that although it took 7 years, I met Him in Jesus Christ at around 21 years old. I wasn't going to church at all but was running into believers who witnessed to me at every turn. The wisdom of this world is foolishness to God, my friend. It doesn't matter how enlightened you think you are from a fleshly perspective, your understanding is folly compared to the wisdom which comes from the living God via His Holy Spirit which indwells all believers. We are tapped into the only true source of wisdom and knowledge. Wisdom which is far beyond our capacity to fully appreciate or understand beyond His grace to allow.","Winston Smith","397000","God put Evil in his creation. If he hadn't there would be no evil. This is something you can't refute and no one can as has been proven ad nauseum here in this thread and many others. Regurgitating quotes from an ancient collection of writings by ancient primitive people doesn't change the fact that God is Evil. He put evil in the angels who acted accordingly, he put the snake in the Garden of Eden and he put there the tree and its fruits also; and he knew because he knows past, present and future that Adam and Eve would eat of the fruit. So much for free will. By the way, if a person is convicted of a crime are also his descendants sent to jail? No one but Adam and Eve ate of the fruit but we according to your fantasy (beliefs) have also been punished. But, wait a sec. didn't He send his one and only son to atone for Adam and Eve's actions? if so how come nothing has changed, no garden of eden in sight. How can people be so stupid as to believe in that XXXX? Imbecility is boundless and eternal. You are an Evil person Archie, as many power hungry believers are who think that by quoting from the Bible they can hide their hateful evil nature. Throwing the Bible at anyone who disagrees with you doesn't make you a good person, it just shows what a petty wanna be dictator you are. If God exists, he'll ban you to Hell just for the fun of it.","delusion-atheists","05:59 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","210"

I was at work when I responded and forgot to include it. The point that I am trying to make is that the freewill God bestows upon us is the illusion. ""You obey me or else you go to hell."" Damnation is the part that bothers me. Athiests don't reject God because we want to go to hell. We don't look at the description of hell and say ""That's where I got be!"" It's not the decision we make. We reject God because they're nothing tangible that proves He exists. I know it's a matter of faith. But there are people I won't loan money to because I can't trust them to return it. But I am expected to trust my soul and spirtual life to a being whose only proven existence lies in the hands of those who already believe? Those same people tell me that if I don't agree with them than I'm going straight to hell regardless of how I live my life. My denial of God no way dictates the way in which I will live my life. Even if I do everything in my power to make this world a better place for all and leave this earth better than when I arrived I will still have to suffer an eternity because I did so not believing in God. If you can rebel you have freewill. Athiests do not rebel against God nor do we disobey. We are just not convinced of His existence. This just shows that it is in our nature to be inquisitive. They didn't disobey God, they followed their instincts to understand our world. The way God created them. Yes, there may be things that we would rather not know. But being naive to evil is not a good thing. They only way to recognize good is to know evil. This is what I was searching for when I kept asking why. So, this is an experiment? I will not presume to ask you what is He attempting to discover as this will result in you having to question your God's wisdom and methods and I will not ask you to do that. But I will say that if we are His experiment than this speaks to God's infallibilty i.e. if He has to experiment there is something He doesn't know therefore He cannot infallible because in order to experiment you have to presume you can be wrong. If he is infallible than He knows the results of the experiement and went through with it anyways. His reasons can only be known by Him, but I would say that there is something fundmentally wrong with this as He is allowing people to harmed in this experiement He already knows the answers to. Furthermore, Why does He long for our companionship? Why does He need us to obey? I understand that we are to prosper from a relationship with God. But what does he get out of it? We will probably have to agree to disagree on this one. You must understand that when I left the faith I felt that more opportunities for knowledge presented itself. I felt that religion stifled my spiritual growth because it demand that accept one group of ideals and reject all others. My rejectetion of religion resulted in the ability to explore all avenues of spirtual and mental progression and pick and choose which ideals yo adapt yo my life style. Futhermore it is not the answers that fascinate me but the pursuit. Take music as an example. We all marvel at a persons ability to play one note and say everything that song is supposed to say. But we fail to recognize the notes that came before it and made it so great. Religion requires that we reach that one note and continue playing that note. I reject that notion and strive to find away to make all notes sound good under their repective contexts. You learn more from the pursuit of knowledge than you do from the resulting answer. Now, I understand that this weekend is eventful for you so I cannot submit this post without saying that I wish you and your family all the best and Happy Easter.","delusion-atheists","07:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","211"

We may disagree but I don't believe your intentions are to cause me harm. You've been gracious enough to try to answer my questions to the best of your ability. But I feel I must reiterate the athiest position. For us it's not about right and wrong. We are not choosing evil over good. And we do not feel we are being disobedient. We are simply not convinced. It's not as if we see God and then deny His existence. The point is we don't see God. We understand that this is a matter of faith. However, we need more than a book full of unproven conjectures to take that leap. And because of this we are told that we are to expect eternal damnation. We are not comfortable with this philosophy as we are being shunned not for any wrong doing but because we are simply not complacent. Furthermore, our non belief does not automatically equate to us doing ill will. We can lead a good life in spite of God's existence. Our ability to know right from wrong does not stem from some supreme being. And just because we don't believe does not mean we are going to do wrong. We can live peacefully, joyously and harmoniously with one another without the belief of God or the Bible. Our issue with the Bible is that it speaks of many things that just no longer apply. It condoned slavery, the stoning of your children and promoted the idea of men above women. These are all philosophies that we no longer accept as fact. Additionally, it was used to prove the world was flat and then to prove geocentrism. Both of which we know now to be false. However, we are expected to follow every word as truth. God may have spoken directly to man and asked us to transcribe his words for Him, but I do not feel the pen holders wrote everything down verbatim. Personally I feel that God never intended the Bible to be presented as ""letter of the law"". And I am aware that there are passages that state otherwise. However, I feel they were placed to serve mans interest and not God's. There are several different Christian religions that all believe that they serve God and the Bible better than all and feel all others will be going to Hell for their trespass. The Protestants and the Catholics fought and killed for years because of their discrepancies. Not to mention, the non-Christian religions such as the Jews and Muslims who have been fighting even longer over holy land. All of them killing in the honor of God. All of them believing that they are more right than the other. I may not believe in God, but I refuse to believe that He intended people to murder in His name. I also don't believe that he intended for His word to separate people but to bring them together. And once again, this is why I don't feel that the Bible was meant to be taken literally. Ultimately, I feel that it was not the words He cared about but the message. The reason I'm an atheist is because I don't feel I need a religion to lead a good life. I hope I was clear enough above for you to understand where we as athiests stand and why. Have a great holiday.

However, taken from your bible: However, you may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you. You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land. You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance. You may treat your slaves like this, but the people of Israel, your relatives, must never be treated this way. (Leviticus 25:44-46) Also from your bible: When a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod so hard that the slave dies under his hand, he shall be punished. If, however, the slave survives for a day or two, he is not to be punished, since the slave is his own property. (Exodus 21:20-21) These are merely to show that these passages exist. But know that the fact that the bible condoned slavery was not my argument. Even the U.S. government condoned slavery and placed men above women.

For example, economic and political commentator Robert J. Samuelson wrote a very compelling article called The End of Europe where he argues that European influence in the world will decline.[12] In an increasingly global community, of course, this is not good news for European atheism, which is likely to have less influence on the world. In addition, conservative Christianity, which is certainly evangelistic and asserting itself in the world's public intellectual arena, is growing in the USA and especially in the Third World. (For the growth of conservative Christianity in the USA, see the book Exodus: Why Americans are Fleeing Liberal Churches for Conservative Christianity by Dave Shiflett). Since, generally speaking, liberal theologians are more likely to embrace materialist ideas, such as macroevolution, this of course means that fewer Christians are likely to support these ideas, which will reduce the influence of atheism. Penn State professor Philip Jenkins, author of The Next Christendom: The Coming of Global Christianity, has also pointed out that Christians living in Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia are far more conservative theologically than Christians who live in the West, so one would expect they would be less likely to adopt or embrace materialist and atheist macroevolutionary ideas.[13 http://creationwiki.org/Decline_of_atheism","delusion-atheists","06:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","242"

We accept it as Gods word because it attests to be that and has survived in spite of many attempts to destroy it throughout history. And Homers Iliad has never undergone that scrutiny or the same attacks which attempted to destroy it. And neither did it claim to answer the questions of life and the reason for living or the relationship Man has had with His Creator. You possess this typical attitude of most atheists to treat the bible as if it's just a book of literature, but it isn't; it's a book which deals with the spiritual side of humanity, an area atheists have absolutely no concept of. Let me ask you a question daewoo; If a thousand people were lost in a cavern and one man appeared and handed everyone a map which showed the way out and then just disappeared, and 975 out of the 1000 people scoffed at him as a nut and ripped up their maps, would that make the maps any less real or reliable? Of course not, yet that is how atheists judge the bible. They think that just because they reject it as valid that it must not be valid. They forget that their denials of Gods truths have no bearing at all on His truths being real and valid to those who trust Him and accept them. Again, those who are deaf and blind to the wisdom in the bible may not recognize the truths in it, but that's because they aren't in touch with their spiritual side.

"04-19-2010","13783",17,"Archangel","398643","We aren't assuming the bible is the word of God ONLY because of its survival over 3,000 years. We accept it as Gods word because it attests to be that and has survived in spite of many attempts to destroy it throughout history. And Homers Iliad has never undergone that scrutiny or the same attacks which attempted to destroy it. And neither did it claim to answer the questions of life and the reason for living or the relationship Man has had with His Creator. You possess this typical attitude of most atheists to treat the bible as if it's just a book of literature, but it isn't; it's a book which deals with the spiritual side of humanity, an area atheists have absolutely no concept of. Let me ask you a question daewoo; If a thousand people were lost in a cavern and one man appeared and handed everyone a map which showed the way out and then just disappeared, and 975 out of the 1000 people scoffed at him as a nut and ripped up their maps, would that make the maps any less real or reliable? Of course not, yet that is how atheists judge the bible. They think that just because they reject it as valid that it must not be valid. They forget that their denials of Gods truths have no bearing at all on His truths being real and valid to those who trust Him and accept them. Again, those who are deaf and blind to the wisdom in the bible may not recognize the truths in it, but that's because they aren't in touch with their spiritual side.

Many of them were older than the ones that did The gospels, for example, were not written by Mathew, Mark, Luke, and John, those guys had been dead for AT LEAST 100 years before any of those books was written which probably explains some of the rank historical inaccuracies in them. Take a look at the gospel of Thomas. It is a reasonably good example of the books that did NOT make it into the bible. From what we can tell it is older than the books that DID make it into the NT. It does not have the historical problems that the other books have. What is DOES contain is several quotes from jesus like: There were other books that could have been in the bible as well.

"04-19-2010","13783",17,"Easyrider","398618","Mass exodus from atheism worldwide The world is obviously a far smaller place now and it seems that the areas of the world where atheism and secularism have their greatest strength are in decline. For example, economic and political commentator Robert J. Samuelson wrote a very compelling article called The End of Europe where he argues that European influence in the world will decline.[12] In an increasingly global community, of course, this is not good news for European atheism, which is likely to have less influence on the world. In addition, conservative Christianity, which is certainly evangelistic and asserting itself in the world's public intellectual arena, is growing in the USA and especially in the Third World. (For the growth of conservative Christianity in the USA, see the book Exodus: Why Americans are Fleeing Liberal Churches for Conservative Christianity by Dave Shiflett). Since, generally speaking, liberal theologians are more likely to embrace materialist ideas, such as macroevolution, this of course means that fewer Christians are likely to support these ideas, which will reduce the influence of atheism. Penn State professor Philip Jenkins, author of The Next Christendom: The Coming of Global Christianity, has also pointed out that Christians living in Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia are far more conservative theologically than Christians who live in the West, so one would expect they would be less likely to adopt or embrace materialist and atheist macroevolutionary ideas.[13 http://creationwiki.org/Decline_of_atheism","daewoo","398647","I dont associate with those who serve satan.","delusion-atheists","12:05 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","247"

You can deny that God and His truths exist for a complete lifetime just as untold millions of men have throughout the Ages, but none of the denials by all of the deniers has had any impact at all on Gods truths since they remain as absolute as they ever were.

Eusebius was given no instruction about what to include and what to leave out. There was later debate about his choices, but ultimately, 2000+ years later, his choices are still pretty much the ""Holy Bible"". The books he did not include were ultimately condemned as heretical or unorthodox. They were hunted down and destroyed and those who tried to shelter them were slaughtered....and the Church carried out that policy for the next 1500 years. That is not the act of a church that has ""THE TRUTH"" in a book. That is the act of a church trying desperately to cover up the fact that they have pushed an edited and incorrect view of Jesus life in people and were doing their best to destroy all evidence to the contrary.

Read back through this thread where you keep insisting that if we do not believe the particular truth that you are selling, we will all burn in hell. You have a REALLY WEIRD idea of what ""freedom"" and ""liberty"" are. No, I am tearing down trust in a book put together, by the admission of the guy who did it, to serve the interests of the church and the government. I dont have a desire to know god. I do know god. I generally trust in what we know of his word, I just prefer the version that was not admittedly put together in order to advance the agenda of a relatively few powerful people. You are the one deceiving people and others. I am not calling you a liar....I think you honestly believe most of the garbage that you post here. It just happens to be demonstrably false and frankly I dont think that you have enough integrity OR enough actual faith in your relationship with god to even examine that possibility. That is why you have not constructed anything resembling a logical argument to refute mine. I am not even asking for proof. I am more than willing to admit that proof may be hard to come by since it would be thousands of years old and frankly the church burned most of it. I am just asking for a logical argument. How can you possibly reconcile what we know about jesus with what is in the bible and what our religious leaders tell us to believe? Do you really not know enough about your own religions history to recognize that it has primarily been a tool to elevate a few men to positions of great power? Had it not ever occurred to you that when Jesus went looking for a holy man to baptize him he went to John instead of a priest? John the baptist was not only completely unorthodox, he was unorthodox to the point that many people thought he was a lunatic. If your relationship with god is based on the bible, or on a church, or on a priest or preacher, then you have none and I pity you because you so desperately want one. That is what all your religious blather is about. You know that you are not going to convince anybody here that you have even the first clue when it comes to god, but that is OK because you are trying to convince yourself, not any of us. And the funny thing is that if and when you finally do find that relationship with god, you will shut up because it is indescribable. It is like trying to describe what air looks like. IF you actually knew god, you would quit blathering on about the bible and about what a great thing modern Christianity is because you would understand that, in the words of Jesus: You dont need a book. You dont need a priest. God is not a coin operated vending machine where you perform the proper acts and POOF he is compelled to appear. Pouring water on a babies head does not do anything for god. Pouring water on an ADULTS head does not do anything for god. It is what that symbolizes in the recipients mind that matters. God could care less whether your head is wet or dry. Once you figure these things out, you can learn to sit quietly and listen for God and submit to his will. THEN you will know god. Right now you just know what man says about god, and that is about worthless. This is why jesus used so many terrible metaphors. He was trying to describe the indescribable in a way that people could understand. I know all the atheists out there are by now convinced I am mildly schizophrenic. I cannot contest that besides saying that I know they are wrong. I cannot build a logical argument for them being wrong. I cannot explain logically ho I know they are wrong. I just know they are and that is enough.

Trust in God[a]; trust also in me. 2In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you. 3And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. 4You know the way to the place where I am going."" Jesus the Way to the Father 5Thomas said to him, ""Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?"" [B] 6Jesus answered, ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. 7If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him."" 8Philip said, ""Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us."" 9Jesus answered: ""Don't you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'? 10Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you are not just my own. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work. 11Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the miracles themselves. 12I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. 13And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father. 14You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it. Jesus Promises the Holy Spirit 15""If you love me, you will obey what I command. 16And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever 17the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be[c] in you. 18I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. 19Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. 20On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you. 21Whoever has my commands and obeys them, he is the one who loves me. He who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love him and show myself to him."" 22Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, ""But, Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?"" 23Jesus replied, ""If anyone loves me, he will obey my teaching. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him. 24He who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me. 25""All this I have spoken while still with you. 26But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you. 27Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid. 28""You heard me say, 'I am going away and I am coming back to you.' If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I. 29I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe. 30I will not speak with you much longer, for the prince of this world is coming. He has no hold on me, 31but the world must learn that I love the Father and that I do exactly what my Father has commanded me. ""Come now; let us leave.
