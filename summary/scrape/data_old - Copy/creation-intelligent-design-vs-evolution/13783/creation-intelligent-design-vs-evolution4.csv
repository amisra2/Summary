But consider the facts. At least 50 of the 55 framers of the U. S. Constitution were Christians (see M. E. Bradford...). Every single American president has taken his oath on the Bible and has referenced God in his inaugural address. Every one of the 50 state constitutions call on God for support. The Supreme Court, in 1892 after a an exhaustive 10-year study of the matter, said: ""This is a relgious people. This is a Christian nation."" Even today, the Supreme Court opens each session with the verbal declaration, ""God save the United States of America."" The first state constitution was the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut (1639). You may read this document at The University of Oklahoma College of Law: A Chronology of US Historical Documents: The Fundamental Orders of Connecticut . The framers of this document desired that every aspect of it be based on the Bible (See DeMar's book listed below, America's Christian History, pgs. 57-58). This document was a model for other constitutions including the U.S. Consitution which followed. The above table outlines the wide spread influence of biblical thought on America's legal system. What is the purpose of civil government, according to the Bible? The purpose of civil government is very simply to be God's servant to restrain evil and reward good (Romans 13:1-7; 1 Peter 2:13-14). Christians are (a) to pray for and obey governmental authority (1 Timothy 2:1-4), (b) unless it forbids what God requires or requires what God forbids, in which case Christians cannot submit, and some form of civil disobedience becomes inescapable (Acts 4:18-31, 5:17-29), (c) to influence government because all of life is under God's authority (Psalm 24:1; Psalm 83:18; Isaiah 42:8; Matthew 28:18-20; 2 Corinthians 10:5). In a participatory democracy, Christians are under obligation to participate in civil government (Matthew 22:21).","delusion-atheists","08:44 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","47"

Where did our christian founding fathers state in the founding documents that they were founding a christian nation. The only place I am aware that the topic came up was in the discussions of Article VI. After the discussion the article reads, ""no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States."" This is certainly not a christian principle. Christians have always required that everyone agree with them, and they use imprisonment, torture, and execution to accomplish that. Always have. Why do you think that the Pilgrims left England? They wanted to establish a government where they were free to banish, imprison, torture, and execute anyone who had different beliefs. They were quite successful in doing so. Your remark about Jefferson is really off the wall. It shows the most fundamental ignorance of the topic. Some things that Thomas Jefferson said: ""Say nothing of my religion. It is known to my god and myself alone."" ""I am of a sect by myself, as far as I know."" ""What all agree upon is probably right; what no two agree in most probably is wrong."" Jefferson was writing to Adams about religion in that last one. ""Millions of innocent men, women, and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, and imprisoned; yet we have not advanced one inch toward uniformity. What has been the effect of coercion? To make one-half the world fools and the other half hypocrites. To support roguery and error all over the earth."" You asked, if Jefferson could be speaking from a deist standpoint when he said: ""Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice cannot sleep forever."" Clearly he was. He didn't mention christianity or Jesus. He did mention God. Quite typical of deism. And of course there is: ""I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who lead our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessities and comforts of life."" Again, nothing about christianity or Jesus. I followed with my finger and moved my lips when I read but still didn't find it. The quote is pretty typical of deism. But this is all irrelevant. None if it either supports or denies the founding of a christian nation. That can only be supported by quoting the words in the founding document. Where does the constitution even mention god, Jesus, christianity? Where does it establish a christian nation? You guys keep babbling and yet you can't offer a shred of evidence (except what you imagine and invent.)","delusion-atheists","10:13 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","48"
"01-18-2010","13783",4,"None","None","None","Easyrider","386301","The religious practices of this country were around a long time before godless atheists and others like Pandion tried to impose their revisionist standards and dogma on Americans. In the beginning of the American dream, the mention of God was welcome in the halls of government, in our schools, and in our courts of law. So before Mr. Pandion tries to tell you different, here's what was once lawful and appropriate in our nation's Capitol, and elsewhere: To start with: ""Within a year of his inauguration, Jefferson began attending church services in the House of Representatives. Madison followed Jefferson's example, although unlike Jefferson, who rode on horseback to church in the Capitol, Madison came in a coach and four. Worship services in the House--a practice that continued until after the Civil War--were acceptable to Jefferson because they were nondiscriminatory and voluntary. Preachers of every Protestant denomination appeared. (Catholic priests began officiating in 1826.) As early as January 1806 a female evangelist, Dorothy Ripley, delivered a camp meeting-style exhortation in the House to Jefferson, Vice President Aaron Burr, and a ""crowded audience."" Throughout his administration Jefferson permitted church services in executive branch buildings. The Gospel was also preached in the Supreme Court chambers."" More in the following U.S. Library of Congress link: Religion and the Federal Government: PART 2 (Religion and the Founding of the American Republic, Library of Congress Exhibition) The Danbury Baptist Letter, as Originally Drafted The Library of Congress is grateful to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory for recovering the lines obliterated from the Danbury Baptist letter by Thomas Jefferson. He originally wrote ""a wall of eternal separation between church and state,"" later deleting the word ""eternal."" He also deleted the phrase ""the duties of my station, which are merely temporal."" Jefferson must have been unhappy with the uncompromising tone of both of these phrases, especially in view of the implications of his decision, two days later, to begin attending church services in the House of Representatives. Reserved Seats at Capitol Services Here is a description, by an early Washington ""insider,"" Margaret Bayard Smith (1778-1844), a writer and social critic and wife of Samuel Harrison Smith, publisher of the National Intelligencer, of Jefferson's attendance at church services in the House of Representatives: ""Jefferson during his whole administration was a most regular attendant. The seat he chose the first day sabbath, and the adjoining one, which his private secretary occupied, were ever afterwards by the courtesy of the congregation, left for him."" The Old House of Representatives Church services were held in what is now called Statuary Hall from 1807 to 1857. The first services in the Capitol, held when the government moved to Washington in the fall of 1800, were conducted in the ""hall"" of the House in the north wing of the building. In 1801 the House moved to temporary quarters in the south wing, called the ""Oven,"" which it vacated in 1804, returning to the north wing for three years. Services were conducted in the House until after the Civil War. The Speaker's podium was used as the preacher's pulpit. A Millennialist Sermon Preached in Congress This sermon on the millennium was preached by the Baltimore Swedenborgian minister, John Hargrove (1750-1839) in the House of Representatives. One of the earliest millennialist sermons preached before Congress was offered on July 4, 1801, by the Reverend David Austin (1759-1831), who at the time considered himself ""struck in prophesy under the style of the Joshua of the American Temple."" Having proclaimed to his Congressional audience the imminence of the Second Coming of Christ, Austin took up a collection on the floor of the House to support services at ""Lady Washington's Chapel"" in a nearby hotel where he was teaching that ""the seed of the Millennial estate is found in the backbone of the American Revolution."" First Catholic Sermon in the House On January 8, 1826, Bishop John England (1786-1842) of Charleston, South Carolina, became the first Catholic clergyman to preach in the House of Representatives. The overflow audience included President John Quincy Adams, whose July 4, 1821, speech England rebutted in his sermon. Woman Preacher in the House (and call for revival!) In 1827, Harriet Livermore (1788-1868), the daughter and granddaughter of Congressmen, became the second woman to preach in the House of Representatives. The first woman to preach before the House (and probably the first woman to speak officially in Congress under any circumstances) was the English evangelist, Dorothy Ripley (1767-1832), who conducted a service on January 12, 1806. Jefferson and Vice President Aaron Burr were among those in a ""crowded audience."" Sizing up the congregation, Ripley concluded that ""very few"" had been born again and broke into an urgent, camp meeting style exhortation, insisting that ""Christ's Body was the Bread of Life and His Blood the drink of the righteous."" Communion Service in the Treasury Building Manasseh Cutler here describes a four-hour communion service in the Treasury Building, conducted by a Presbyterian minister, the Reverend James Laurie: ""Attended worship at the Treasury. Mr. Laurie alone. Sacrament. Full assembly. Three tables; service very solemn; nearly four hours."" Adams's Description of a Church Service in the Supreme Court John Quincy Adams here describes the Reverend James Laurie, pastor of a Presbyterian Church that had settled into the Treasury Building, preaching to an overflow audience in the Supreme Court Chamber, which in 1806 was located on the ground floor of the Capitol. The Old Supreme Court Chamber Description of church services in the Supreme Court chamber by Manasseh Cutler (1804) and John Quincy Adams (1806) indicate that services were held in the Court soon after the government moved to Washington in 1800. Church Services in Congress after the Civil War Charles Boynton (1806-1883) was in 1867 chaplain of the House of Representatives and organizing pastor of the First Congregational Church in Washington, which was trying at that time to build its own sanctuary. In the meantime the church, as Boynton informed potential donors, was holding services ""at the Hall of Representatives"" where ""the audience is the largest in town. . . .nearly 2000 assembled every Sabbath"" for services, making the congregation in the House the ""largest Protestant Sabbath audience then in the United States."" The First Congregational Church met in the House from 1865 to 1868. House of Representatives, After the Civil War The House moved to its current location on the south side of the Capitol in 1857. It contained the ""largest Protestant Sabbath audience"" in the United States when the First Congregational Church of Washington held services there from 1865 to 1868.

The whole goal of the original founders was to create a nation where every person was free to worship the God of their choice, or no God at all. So they never intended this to be a strictly christian nation. If it had been their intention, they wouldn't have allowed anyone who disagreed with christianity to enter the USA. Had that been the case, this american experiment would have failed miserably, and I never would have come to be an american at all. So you are twisting reality and making a completely fallacious argument by claiming that our assertion that America was founded upon christian values and principles, is actually an argument that we are a uniquely christian nation. That is where you are dead wrong in defining what we are saying. But we have provided ample evidence for our claim that christian principles were at the very foundation of the common laws and spiritual values which this country was based upon. Now you can XXXX hard and bluster all you like as you throw your cheap insults as you most assuredly will with your tantrums and fits that claim how wrong we are, but it doesn't change the fact that your argument regarding what we are claiming is absolutely bogus.","delusion-atheists","06:15 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","55"
"01-18-2010","13783",4,"T.Q","386424","What christian principles specifically ?","pandion","386434","And in what founding document were these christian principles stated. Wait! I know where I can find some of them. In the Constitution. There is Article I, Section 9. ""The migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each person."" That clause was specifically to allow the slave trade. It was put in as a concession to that christian majority of the south that you guys talked about. And then there is Article 4, Section 2, Clause 3: ""No Person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labour, but shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due."" That required northerners to return slaves to their christian, southern masters. And if you are going to claim that it wasn't the christians who owned slaves, it's already too late for that. You have claimed that George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison were christians. They all owned slaves, and in spite of their high thoughts about all men being equal, they kept those slaves until the day they died. Thomas Jefferson had children with his slaves. So where are these other christian principles stated?","delusion-atheists","08:07 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","57"
