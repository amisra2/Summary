"01-17-2010","13783",3,"jazyjason","386104","But in all honesty I think that atheism at it's core is a simple matter of physical evidence versus faith.

That is why faith is such a prominent force in religion.","pandion","386165","Actually, it's a lack of any evidence. Atheism is a lack of belief in magical beings. It is not a belief in the physical. You know, a=without and theism=a belief in gods. Again, it isn't a belief. It is the absence of belief.

It is true that the article states that America wasn't founded upon the christian ""religion"" because it wasn't. America was founded upon the principle that unlike England, the Government would never force any citizen to adopt any Government sanctioned religion as occurred in England at the time. And if you remember, The official religion in England was a form of christianity. BUT, and I mean a big BUT, The United States was most definitely founded upon Christian values and principles and that FACT is easily recognized by observing the common laws which existed before many laws were formerly written on the books by acts of Congress. We have rights endowed by our CREATOR and are one Nation under GOD. I realize these terms are areligious, but once again, just by observing the common laws which are definitely biblical in origin, it is obvious to anyone with an open mind and free of an atheistic and anti-christian prejudice that the values and principles upon which this nation was founded were Judeo-christian in nature.

That's what a Christian government would probably be, so you struck out. Well that's horse drip anyway: Here are just some of the facts that are seldom taught in Americas public school classrooms: The most frequently recognized source for political inspiration for the founding fathers was the Bible, which was referenced in some 34% of the founding fathers quotations. The first reference to God as the foundation of an American colony was noted in the Mayflower Compact, dated November 11, 1620: .Having undertaken for the Glory of God, and advancement of the Christian faith, and the honour of our king and country, a voyage to plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia; Do by these presents, solemnly and mutually in the presence of God and one another, covenant and combine ourselves together into a Civil Body. Many of the founding fathers recognized that the principles of civil law were inseparably linked to Biblical truths. James Wilson, one of the original Supreme Court Justices, and a signer of the Constitution, explained, Human law must rest its authority ultimately upon the authority of that law which is divineFar from being rivals or enemies, religion and law are twin sisters, friends, and mutual assistants Additionally, the United States Supreme Court specifically recognized America as a Christian nation. In the case Church of the Holy Trinity vs. the United States (Feb. 29, 1892, US457-458), Justice Josiah Brewer, following a lengthy and exhaustive search of early American historical literature, commented, We find everywhere a clear recognition of the same truth.that we are a Christian nation. In another Supreme Court Case, Zorach vs. Clauson (1952, US306 307 313), Justice William O. Douglas categorically stated, We are a religious people and our institutions presuppose a Supreme Being. Further, in United States vs. Macintosh (1931, 283 US 605, 625), Justice George Sutherland affirmed, We are a Christian people.affording to one another the equal right of religious freedom, and acknowledge with reverence the duty of obedience to the will of God. At the Constitutional Convention on June 28, 1787, Benjamin Franklin noted: The longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the Sacred Writings, that except the Lord build the House, they labor in vain that build it. There are many today who believe Franklin was a strict deist, but Franklin here is not only referencing the Bible, but is alluding in part to a teaching by Jesus Christ from Matthew 10:29. Concerning the outcome of the American Revolution, John Quincy Adams noted, The highest glory won from the American Revolution was this: it connected, in one indissoluble bond, the principles of civil government with the principles of Christianity. In a letter to Thomas Jefferson dated June 28, 1813, John Adams wrote: The general principles on which the (founding) fathers achieved independence werethe general principles of Christianity. Founding father Noah Webster proclaimed much the same message when he said, The religion which has introduced civil liberty is the religion of Christ and His ApostlesThis is genuine Christianity and to this we owe our free constitutions of government . Time after time, the founding fathers declared similar beliefs. From the archives of Patrick Henrys personal notes (handwritten on the back of his copy of the Stamp Act Resolutions, made public after his death) we read: Whether this (new government) will prove a blessing or a curse will depend upon the use our people make of the blessings which a gracious God hath bestowed on us. If they are wise they will be great and happy. If they are of a contrary character, they will be miserable. Righteousness alone can exalt them as a nation. Thomas Jefferson was hardly speaking from a strict deist standpoint when he said: Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice cannot sleep forever. (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781) I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who lead our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessities and comforts of life. (Monday, March 4, 1805, in his 2nd Inaugural Address) Remember, a strict deist was one who believed God was like a watchmaker, who wound up the universe and thereafter did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. Jefferson obviously believed otherwise. Speaking of Godly principles, Jefferson stated: A more beautiful or precious morsel of ethics I have never seen; it is a document in proof that I am a real Christian, that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus. (Jan. 9, 1816 In a letter to Charles Thomson) George Washington, the Father of our Country, likewise recognized God as supremely important in the American dream. In his first inaugural address on April 30, 1789, Washington remarked: It would be improper to omit, in this first official act, my fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the universe. On Saturday, October 3, 1789, President Washington said this in proclaiming a day of national thanksgiving: It is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the Providence of Almighty God. Today, our public schools are in a moral crisis. Washington once noted, If you remove religious principles from the schools you are going to lose national morality. How prophetic he was! Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence who was also known as the Father of Public Schools, once had this to offer: The only foundation for a republic isreligion. Without it there can be no virtue, and without virtue there can be no liberty. Dont miss the significance of that last statement: ..without virtue there can be no liberty. The principle is clear a lack of virtue engenders bondage. As one writer noted, Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their fetters (bindings). The more liberties a godless people achieve, the more enslaved they ultimately become in their worldly obsessions. Still another founding father, the Reverend John Witherspoon, mirrored Benjamin Rush when he declared, Civil liberty cannot long be preserved without virtue. And finally, lets not forget James Madison, known as the Chief Architect of U.S. Constitution, who once had this to say: Cursed be all that learning that is contrary to the Cross of Christ. This is just a very short list of thousands of such examples that clearly speak of the Biblical and Christian foundations of our Founding Fathers and early America. Along with these there were the church services in government buildings up to and shortly after the civil war; paid chaplains, government authorized missionaries, reliefs of Moses and the Ten Commandments in the Supreme Court building, and so on and so forth. Whatever moral foundations apart from Christian and Biblical principles one may argue was second, was not even a close second. The record on that is clear. And so today, the debate over the moral foundations of America continues, but not in this quarter. America is in a moral and spiritual decline due to the ungodly secularization of this country. Thou shalt not has been replaced with, If it feels good do it. The wisdom of God has been replaced with the tenets of men; absolute truths replaced with moral relativism, and Father God has been replaced with Mother Earth. America is now paying the price for this ill-conceived venture. The remedy: A return to Godly values and principles, upon which this nation of the people, by the people, and for the people, was clearly founded.

Neither does Easyrider. The best he can do is dicta from court cases from well after the founding of the nation. Nothing from the founding documents about a christian nation nor christian principles. But Easyrider does bring up the Mayflower Compact that did reflect christian principles in action. The government of Massachusetts under that document expelled, imprisoned, tortured and killed those who disagreed. That has always been characteristic of christianity. And then Easyrider tries to claim Jefferson as a christian. An unquestioned deist, and Easyrider doesn't know the difference. And then there is Patrick Henry who actually opposed the foundation of this country. For one thing, Henry wanted to tax everyone to support his church (christianity seems to need government support) and was defeated by Madison. Henry then fought to defeat the ratification of the Constitution - it was godless you know. So I ask again, where in the founding document (there is only one) are these christian principles mentioned? It amazes me how the Constitution went from universal opposition from christians (It was opposed from the pulpit by both Anglican and Congregationalist clergy, the two largest denominations) in 1797 to now being claimed as representative of christian ideals. It is even more stunning that these same christians who claim the Constitution as their own work so hard to undermine it in order to establish their religion as official, with official public displays, prayer in schools, religion taught as science, etc. It has to be a christian nation so that christians can impose their religion and go back to slavery and expelling, imprisoning, torturing and killing anyone who disagrees. Always signs of christianity.","delusion-atheists","06:03 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","39"
"01-17-2010","13783",3,"None","None","None","pandion","386206","There seems to be no limit to the extremes to which fundamentalist Christians seem to be willing to go in efforts to demonstrate to the American people that it was the purpose of the founding fathers to found a Christian nation and thereby justify the imposition of fundamentalist religion on everyone by law. For example, opposition to the ratification of the Constitution was primarily for two reasons: one of those reasons was political, resting on the form of government and manner of representation; the other was religious, resting on whether the Constitution granted recognition to the Christian religion. Both in the chambers of the state legislatures and from the pulpits of churches, Christians worked to defeat the ratification of the new Constitution on the grounds that it did not acknowledge Christianity; that it was Godless. In the Virginia legislature it was a Christian, Patrick Henry, proudly claimed by fundamentalist Christians as one of the founding fathers, who led the opposition to the Constitution. And yet, fundamentalist Christians claim that the Constitution was inspired by Christian principles. If that were true, why would Christians have opposed the ratification of that Godless document? Consider the case of Thomas Jefferson. Even though Jefferson often expressed his disdain for Christianity and the Christian clergy, and often expressed his liberal, non-dogmatic religion, and even though fundamentalists do at times admit that Jefferson was not a Christian but a Deist or at best Unitarian, modern fundamentalists also frequently talk out of the other side of their mouths and attempt to rehabilitate Jefferson with claims that he was a Christian. Those claims are particularly strange since Jeffersons statement to Benjamin Rush, engraved on the Jefferson Memorial, for I have sworn upon the altar of god, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man, was a statement of his opinion of the Christian clergy when read in context. Note that the word god is not capitalized as is true of Jeffersons original manuscript. That would be typical of a deist. But Jefferson did have great respect for Jesus although he denied any divinity. Isnt it strange that in order to make their point fundamentalist Christians are willing to accept as Christian a man who thought that Jesus was nothing more than a good man. We have even seen claims that Benjamin Franklin, George Mason, James Madison and Benjamin Rush (friend of and consultant to Thomas Paine) were Christians. It seems that the only one to have been missed is Thomas Paine. Consider the fact that there is not a single, verified example of George Washington making any reference to Jesus Christ or even God in his private correspondence - strange for a man who Christians claim as one of them is of no consequence to fundamentalist Christians. You can find many quotes on fundamentalist web sites put forward to prove that Washington was a Christian. All such examples are apparently inventions since Washington scholars repeatedly deny their veracity. One Christian apologist has even admitted making up quotes. During the Constitutional Convention itself, during discussion of Article VI, it was proposed and rejected that there be some religious test. As Luther Martin said, many delegates rejected the idea that ""it would be at least decent to hold out some distinction between the professors of Christianity and downright infidelity or paganism."" (By the way, it seems that some modern Christians, lacking adequate command of their own language, have great difficulty with 18th century English. Mr. Martin's use of the word ""professors"" indicates men who declare openly that they are Christians. It has nothing to do with university teachers.) It should also be noted that Benjamin Franklin's motion to begin the sessions of the Constitutional Convention with a prayer was not passed. After Franklins motion, there was a brief discussion and then the session was adjourned without moving a vote on the motion. It was never mentioned again. Thus, not a single session of the Constitutional Convention began with a prayer. It might also be noted that Franklin did not propose prayer to Jesus or even god. Franklin proposed prayer to implore the assistance of ""Heaven.""

Nice. Go back and read it again. That was Jefferson's quote that he was a Christian, not mine. That one went right over your head too. No wonder you're confused. You're the one who is confused, not me. A true deist was one who believed God created the universe and then sat back and (1) did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations and, (2) did not give (divine) revelation to man. In addition, one of the standard definitions of Deism, then and now, is this: Deism is defined in Webster's Encyclopedic Dictionary, 1941, as: ""[From Latin Deus, God.Deity] The doctrine or creed of a Deist."" And Deist is defined in the same dictionary as: ""One who believes in the existence of a God or supreme being but denies revealed religion, basing his belief on the light of nature and reason."" Along these lines many would argue that, according to 18th century deism, God would not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. He was like the watchmaker who created / wound up the universe and then sat back and didnt involve himself further. People who today try to classify Jefferson, Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and other founding fathers as strict deists have to contend with any number of quotations from these individuals, which to the contrary, show that they believed God did involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. Thomas Jefferson was hardly speaking from a strict deist standpoint when he said : ""Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice cannot sleep forever."" (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781) Now, why should Jefferson tremble for his country if God does not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations? Some Deist! LOL!! Ant then there's this: ""I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who lead our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessities and comforts of life."" (Monday, March 4, 1805, in his 2nd Inaugural Address) Remember, a strict deist was one who believed God was like a watchmaker, who wound up the universe and thereafter did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. Jefferson obviously believed otherwise. Benjamin Franklin a deist? ""I've lived, Sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing Proofs I see of this Truth That God governs in the Affairs of Men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his Notice, is it probable that an Empire can rise without his Aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the Sacred Writings, that except the Lord build the House they labor in vain who build it. I firmly believe this, and I also believe that without his concurring Aid, we shall succeed in this political Building no better than the Builders of Babel: We shall be divided by our little partial local interests; our Projects will be confounded, and we ourselves shall become a Reproach and Bye word down to future Ages."" Speech to the Constitutional Convention (June 28, 1787) In a pamphlet for Europeans titled Information to Those Who Would Remove to America, 1754, Benjamin Franklin wrote: ""Atheism is unknown there; Infidelity rare and secret; so that persons may live to a great age in that country without having their piety shocked by meeting with either an Atheist or an Infidel. And the Divine Being seems...pleased to favor the whole country."" Religion of the Founding Fathers of America George Washington: He (Washington) was an open promoter of Christianity. For example, in his speech on May 12, 1779, he claimed that what children needed to learn above all was the religion of Jesus Christ, and that to learn this would make them greater and happier than they already are; on May 2, 1778, he charged his soldiers at Valley Forge that To the distinguished character of patriot, it should be our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of Christian ; and when he resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the military on June 8, 1783, he reminded the nation that without a humble imitation of the Divine Author of our blessed religion we can never hope to be a happy nation. Washington's own adopted daughter declared of Washington that you might as well question his patriotism as to question his Christianity. In addition, the inscription on Washington's tomb at Mount Vernon is this: WITHIN THIS ENCLOSURE REST THE REMAINS OF GENL. GEORGE WASHINGTON."" Over the door of the inner tomb is inscribed: ""I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE."" James Madison trained for ministry with the Rev. Dr. John Witherspoon, and Madison's writings are replete with declarations of his faith in God and in Christ. In fact, for proof of this, one only need read his letter to Attorney General Bradford wherein Madison laments that public officials are not bold enough about their Christian faith in public and that public officials should be fervent advocates in the cause of Christ. And while Madison did allude to a wall of separation, contemporary writers frequently refuse to allow Madison to provide his own definition of that wall. According to Madison, the purpose of that wall was only to prevent Congress from passing a national law to establish a national religion.
