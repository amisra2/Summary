"04-18-2010","13783",17,"Archangel","397960","Don't be stupid, the Iliad is a poem written by Homer which chronicles the Trojan War. And it doesn't even claim to be a holy book so your question is foolish. Nice job redefining and thus distorting the point I very clearly made as you misrepresent my argument in order to mock me. So let's get back on track, shall we? I'll quote my previous statement in order to show how you have misrepresented my point. Here's what I said: It is Gods inspired word and that is proven by its very ""survival as an authoritative source of wisdom"" in a world which has always hated it for its everlasting truths. So it isn't just a matter of longevity but is a matter of remaining relevant in a world which is steeped in spiritual darkness and hates the truth it offers. Speaking of hogwash, this paragraph defines it. The bible has been banned in more MAJOR countries in just the 20th century than it has been allowed to be owned in. Just look at China, the USSR, Saudi Arabia and most all of the militant islamic countries, and the dedicated communist countries in the world where it has been banned for so long throughout the 20th century. Now name for me the Christian countries which forced bibles and christianity on people under threat of death over the past 100 years. This I want to see as you must not just rewrite history, but must invent it in order to make that assertion.","daewoo","398617","If we are going to assume that a text is the word of god based on its longevity, it is logical to assume that the older the text, the more accurate a portrayal of gods word it is. If that is the case, bad news, you are worshiping the wrong god. Except that VERY, VERY few people treat it as an authoritative source of wisdom. It is not relevant today, and very few people ""hate"" the truth it offers. They just recognize that it does not offer much by way of truth. I am not sure I have ever in my life heard anybody say they ""hate"" the bible. Most rational people simply recognize that it is largely a load of crapola. Even most religious people realize it is an inspirational book rather than a factual one. Sorry. This simply isnt true. Yes, the bible has been banned in some places but NOWHERE near the majority of major countries. Yea.....lets limit it to the last hundred years so we dont have to deal with the thousand years before that when the church would literally hunt down and kill people for disagreeing with it. That, coupled with the fact that Christianity turns people into good little termites, so governments typically approve of it, is how Christianity grew through most of its history. We no longer allow priests and bishops to burn people at the stake (bummer). Governments certainly still generally approve of christianity, but are not willing to go as far as they once were to cram it down their peoples throats (no more ""official religion""). We have all heard that islam is the fastest growing religion. It is not. Not even close. Nor is Christianity. Atheism and agnosticism are. They are growing at an amazing rate. If you factor in the people who claim a religion but do not practice it, the numbers are staggering. For example, if I have to check a box on a from with my religion, I check Roman Catholic. I was raised catholic. Was an alter boy. Grew up in teh catholic church. Think they are all full of funny, stinky brown stuff, but I still check the catholic box. You talk above about the bible still standing up in a world of spiritual darkness. It hasnt. Not even close. If people actually honestly believed the bible was the word of god, the world would be a lot different. But they dont. If you ask them they may say yes or may say no, depending on their cultural conditioning, but the answer is usually NO regardless of what they say or they would be living their lives differently. It is VERY rare that you find somebody ignorant and delusional enough to actually take the bible as the literal word of god. The idea is just too silly. The book itself is just too silly.","delusion-atheists","05:55 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","241"

For example, economic and political commentator Robert J. Samuelson wrote a very compelling article called The End of Europe where he argues that European influence in the world will decline.[12] In an increasingly global community, of course, this is not good news for European atheism, which is likely to have less influence on the world. In addition, conservative Christianity, which is certainly evangelistic and asserting itself in the world's public intellectual arena, is growing in the USA and especially in the Third World. (For the growth of conservative Christianity in the USA, see the book Exodus: Why Americans are Fleeing Liberal Churches for Conservative Christianity by Dave Shiflett). Since, generally speaking, liberal theologians are more likely to embrace materialist ideas, such as macroevolution, this of course means that fewer Christians are likely to support these ideas, which will reduce the influence of atheism. Penn State professor Philip Jenkins, author of The Next Christendom: The Coming of Global Christianity, has also pointed out that Christians living in Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia are far more conservative theologically than Christians who live in the West, so one would expect they would be less likely to adopt or embrace materialist and atheist macroevolutionary ideas.[13 http://creationwiki.org/Decline_of_atheism","delusion-atheists","06:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","242"

We accept it as Gods word because it attests to be that and has survived in spite of many attempts to destroy it throughout history. And Homers Iliad has never undergone that scrutiny or the same attacks which attempted to destroy it. And neither did it claim to answer the questions of life and the reason for living or the relationship Man has had with His Creator. You possess this typical attitude of most atheists to treat the bible as if it's just a book of literature, but it isn't; it's a book which deals with the spiritual side of humanity, an area atheists have absolutely no concept of. Let me ask you a question daewoo; If a thousand people were lost in a cavern and one man appeared and handed everyone a map which showed the way out and then just disappeared, and 975 out of the 1000 people scoffed at him as a nut and ripped up their maps, would that make the maps any less real or reliable? Of course not, yet that is how atheists judge the bible. They think that just because they reject it as valid that it must not be valid. They forget that their denials of Gods truths have no bearing at all on His truths being real and valid to those who trust Him and accept them. Again, those who are deaf and blind to the wisdom in the bible may not recognize the truths in it, but that's because they aren't in touch with their spiritual side. You are completely void of that side of your nature and you will deny this is true because you don't even know that side of your nature exists. You are calling the most important part of your humanity which the bible deals with, a load of crapola. That alone reveals your spiritual destitution. I said banned in major countries throughout the 20th century and I was right. What countries had a higher population than China? None did yet China banned the bible and christianity into the 1980s. Saudi Arabia is the largest country in the middle east and converting to christianity is a crime punishable by death, as is being caught with the bible. Here's a list countries which don't allow the bible to be carried in public; that says something about how open they are to christianity. In which countries is it illegal to carry the bible? - Yahoo! Answers Nice try, but we weren't discussing the church, but countries which banned christianity. This isn't about the sins of the catholic church of which there are too many to cite, we're talking about countries which have banned christianity and the bible as compared to Homer and other works of fiction over the millennia, stay on point if possible. More atheist assumptions which have no basis in fact at all. If you only understood how independent and questioning I was and am as a person you would realize how ignorant your assumptions are. Believers in Christ, true believers have experience being born again through the supernatural revelation which was realized by accepting Jesus Christ as our personal savior and enjoying a personal relationship with God our Father through Him. This is something you can neither conceive of or even imagine. I don't claim this relationship because some man said it exists. I claim it because Gods Holy Spirit exists and dwells within me, PERIOD! Just because you are incapable of appreciating the reality of that spiritual dimension or the relationship has no bearing at all on its truth to every believer who has personally experienced it.","delusion-atheists","10:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","245"

Jesus said, ""If your leaders say to you, 'Look, the (Father's) kingdom is in the sky,' then the birds of the sky will precede you. If they say to you, 'It is in the sea,' then the fish will precede you. Rather, the (Father's) kingdom is within you and it is outside you. Jesus said, ""I am the light that is over all things.

How about this....I am not an atheist....I am an agnostic, and I still know the bible it pretty much a bunch of XXXX. The bible is a fairly interesting, though badly outdated, book of moral lessons. No more, no less. No, they reject it as being valid because it is nonsensical and illogical to believe it is. You can pretend it is, but that is you substituting wishful thinking and willful ignorance (which you will label ""faith) for using the intelligence that god gave you. Or they dont recognize the truths in it because they dont exist. No, I am not calling any part of my humanity crapola. I am calling the bible crapola. Right....so we forget the VAST majority of the last 2000 years and focus on the VERY short time period where your position is correct, then argue that since TODAY that is the case, it has always been so. That makes PERFECT sense. So on the one hand we have had about 50 years of various countries banning the bible. On the other hand we had a little over 1500 years of it being heavily promoted both by governments and by the church, with torture and death being the alternative for the vast majority of that history. Nope. Not an atheist. Not an atheist assumption with no basis in fact. Christianity is tops when it comes to religions to control people. It was designed this way from day one. The bible you claim is the word of god is the manual to do it. Have you ever read any of the books that did NOT make it into the bible? Many of them were older than the ones that did The gospels, for example, were not written by Mathew, Mark, Luke, and John, those guys had been dead for AT LEAST 100 years before any of those books was written which probably explains some of the rank historical inaccuracies in them. Take a look at the gospel of Thomas. It is a reasonably good example of the books that did NOT make it into the bible. From what we can tell it is older than the books that DID make it into the NT. It does not have the historical problems that the other books have. What is DOES contain is several quotes from jesus like: There were other books that could have been in the bible as well. Many of them are more credible than the ones that made it in. ALL of them contained a similar theme to the above....that you dont need a church or a priest to tell you about god. You dont need a book to understand him. Amazingly enough when the church came up with ""the bible"" they did not include the books that said they were not needed and it was up to the individual to forge a relationship with god. What the priests came up with instead was a book that seemed to indicate that you should give money to priests and venerate them. Governments then were a little more familiar with religious power plays then than they are now, but as long as it included bits about giving to Caesar what is Caesar they were on board with the whole thing. Jesus did not come to earth to start a religion. He was fighting organized religion. If he wanted to start a religion he could have written his own gospel and avoided thousands of years of conflict. That really only leaves 2 options. The first is that he was an ID10T. Son of god, mentally retarded. He just didnt realize that by not writing down his own thoughts he was screwing us over until he got a chance to swing by again.
