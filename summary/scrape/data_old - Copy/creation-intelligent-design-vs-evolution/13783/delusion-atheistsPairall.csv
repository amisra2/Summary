"04-12-2010",1,"13783","235","Archangel","397827","Why is it you people feel it is improper to use the bible as evidence to prove its viability as Gods word? It is Gods inspired word and that is proven by its very survival as an authoritative source of wisdom in a world which has always hated it for its everlasting truths. Only an atheist who is blind could not make such an obvious deduction. I offered you compelling evidence above based solely on its longevity and survivability over so many thousands of years, does that prove to you that it is Gods Holy Word and is worthy of trusting? Probably not to an atheist, but that has no bearing at all on the validity of the bible, and that also is evidence that it stands alone against the lies of this world and its spiritual darkness.","daewoo","397892","The Iliad is MUCH older than the bible. Is it also the word of god?? It is foolish to believe that the bibles longevity is proof of its validity. Complete and utter foolishness. If that REALLY seems logical to you, you should really get some professional help. In reality, the bibles longevity is probably more the result of various governments pushing it on their people because at the end of the day if you are looking for a religion to create a dumb and compliant population, Christianity, with the bible at its center, is pretty hard to beat. I know if I ruled the world, you would be a christian or you would be dead. It is a proven strategy.","delusion-atheists","12:03 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","134"

And it doesn't even claim to be a holy book so your question is foolish. Nice job redefining and thus distorting the point I very clearly made as you misrepresent my argument in order to mock me. So let's get back on track, shall we? I'll quote my previous statement in order to show how you have misrepresented my point. Here's what I said: It is Gods inspired word and that is proven by its very ""survival as an authoritative source of wisdom"" in a world which has always hated it for its everlasting truths. So it isn't just a matter of longevity but is a matter of remaining relevant in a world which is steeped in spiritual darkness and hates the truth it offers. Speaking of hogwash, this paragraph defines it. The bible has been banned in more MAJOR countries in just the 20th century than it has been allowed to be owned in. Just look at China, the USSR, Saudi Arabia and most all of the militant islamic countries, and the dedicated communist countries in the world where it has been banned for so long throughout the 20th century. Now name for me the Christian countries which forced bibles and christianity on people under threat of death over the past 100 years. This I want to see as you must not just rewrite history, but must invent it in order to make that assertion.","delusion-atheists","04:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","274"

If that is the case, bad news, you are worshiping the wrong god. Except that VERY, VERY few people treat it as an authoritative source of wisdom. It is not relevant today, and very few people ""hate"" the truth it offers. They just recognize that it does not offer much by way of truth. I am not sure I have ever in my life heard anybody say they ""hate"" the bible. Most rational people simply recognize that it is largely a load of crapola. Even most religious people realize it is an inspirational book rather than a factual one. Sorry. This simply isnt true. Yes, the bible has been banned in some places but NOWHERE near the majority of major countries. Yea.....lets limit it to the last hundred years so we dont have to deal with the thousand years before that when the church would literally hunt down and kill people for disagreeing with it. That, coupled with the fact that Christianity turns people into good little termites, so governments typically approve of it, is how Christianity grew through most of its history. We no longer allow priests and bishops to burn people at the stake (bummer). Governments certainly still generally approve of christianity, but are not willing to go as far as they once were to cram it down their peoples throats (no more ""official religion""). We have all heard that islam is the fastest growing religion. It is not. Not even close. Nor is Christianity. Atheism and agnosticism are. They are growing at an amazing rate. If you factor in the people who claim a religion but do not practice it, the numbers are staggering. For example, if I have to check a box on a from with my religion, I check Roman Catholic. I was raised catholic. Was an alter boy. Grew up in teh catholic church. Think they are all full of funny, stinky brown stuff, but I still check the catholic box. You talk above about the bible still standing up in a world of spiritual darkness. It hasnt. Not even close. If people actually honestly believed the bible was the word of god, the world would be a lot different. But they dont. If you ask them they may say yes or may say no, depending on their cultural conditioning, but the answer is usually NO regardless of what they say or they would be living their lives differently. It is VERY rare that you find somebody ignorant and delusional enough to actually take the bible as the literal word of god. The idea is just too silly. The book itself is just too silly.","delusion-atheists","05:55 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","546"

We accept it as Gods word because it attests to be that and has survived in spite of many attempts to destroy it throughout history. And Homers Iliad has never undergone that scrutiny or the same attacks which attempted to destroy it. And neither did it claim to answer the questions of life and the reason for living or the relationship Man has had with His Creator. You possess this typical attitude of most atheists to treat the bible as if it's just a book of literature, but it isn't; it's a book which deals with the spiritual side of humanity, an area atheists have absolutely no concept of. Let me ask you a question daewoo; If a thousand people were lost in a cavern and one man appeared and handed everyone a map which showed the way out and then just disappeared, and 975 out of the 1000 people scoffed at him as a nut and ripped up their maps, would that make the maps any less real or reliable? Of course not, yet that is how atheists judge the bible. They think that just because they reject it as valid that it must not be valid. They forget that their denials of Gods truths have no bearing at all on His truths being real and valid to those who trust Him and accept them. Again, those who are deaf and blind to the wisdom in the bible may not recognize the truths in it, but that's because they aren't in touch with their spiritual side. You are completely void of that side of your nature and you will deny this is true because you don't even know that side of your nature exists. You are calling the most important part of your humanity which the bible deals with, a load of crapola. That alone reveals your spiritual destitution. I said banned in major countries throughout the 20th century and I was right. What countries had a higher population than China? None did yet China banned the bible and christianity into the 1980s. Saudi Arabia is the largest country in the middle east and converting to christianity is a crime punishable by death, as is being caught with the bible. Here's a list countries which don't allow the bible to be carried in public; that says something about how open they are to christianity. In which countries is it illegal to carry the bible? - Yahoo! Answers Nice try, but we weren't discussing the church, but countries which banned christianity. This isn't about the sins of the catholic church of which there are too many to cite, we're talking about countries which have banned christianity and the bible as compared to Homer and other works of fiction over the millennia, stay on point if possible. More atheist assumptions which have no basis in fact at all. If you only understood how independent and questioning I was and am as a person you would realize how ignorant your assumptions are.

This is something you can neither conceive of or even imagine. I don't claim this relationship because some man said it exists.

How about this....I am not an atheist....I am an agnostic, and I still know the bible it pretty much a bunch of XXXX. The bible is a fairly interesting, though badly outdated, book of moral lessons. No more, no less. No, they reject it as being valid because it is nonsensical and illogical to believe it is. You can pretend it is, but that is you substituting wishful thinking and willful ignorance (which you will label ""faith) for using the intelligence that god gave you. Or they dont recognize the truths in it because they dont exist. No, I am not calling any part of my humanity crapola. I am calling the bible crapola. Right....so we forget the VAST majority of the last 2000 years and focus on the VERY short time period where your position is correct, then argue that since TODAY that is the case, it has always been so. That makes PERFECT sense. So on the one hand we have had about 50 years of various countries banning the bible. On the other hand we had a little over 1500 years of it being heavily promoted both by governments and by the church, with torture and death being the alternative for the vast majority of that history. Nope. Not an atheist. Not an atheist assumption with no basis in fact. Christianity is tops when it comes to religions to control people. It was designed this way from day one. The bible you claim is the word of god is the manual to do it. Have you ever read any of the books that did NOT make it into the bible? Many of them were older than the ones that did The gospels, for example, were not written by Mathew, Mark, Luke, and John, those guys had been dead for AT LEAST 100 years before any of those books was written which probably explains some of the rank historical inaccuracies in them. Take a look at the gospel of Thomas. It is a reasonably good example of the books that did NOT make it into the bible. From what we can tell it is older than the books that DID make it into the NT. It does not have the historical problems that the other books have. What is DOES contain is several quotes from jesus like: There were other books that could have been in the bible as well. Many of them are more credible than the ones that made it in. ALL of them contained a similar theme to the above....that you dont need a church or a priest to tell you about god. You dont need a book to understand him. Amazingly enough when the church came up with ""the bible"" they did not include the books that said they were not needed and it was up to the individual to forge a relationship with god. What the priests came up with instead was a book that seemed to indicate that you should give money to priests and venerate them. Governments then were a little more familiar with religious power plays then than they are now, but as long as it included bits about giving to Caesar what is Caesar they were on board with the whole thing. Jesus did not come to earth to start a religion. He was fighting organized religion. If he wanted to start a religion he could have written his own gospel and avoided thousands of years of conflict.

And welcome to the forum... Verses About Salvation But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, John 1:12 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. John 3:16-17 Jesus said to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. John 14:6 Let it be known to you therefore, brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses. Acts 13:38-39 For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. Romans 1:16 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, Romans 3:23 For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans 6:23 because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. For the Scripture says, Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame. For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him. For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. Romans 10:9-13 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. 2 Corinthians 5:17 In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory. Ephesians 1:13-14 For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. Ephesians 2:8-9 Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, Philippians 2:12 And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. Colossians 2:13-14 For God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we might live with him. 1 Thessalonians 5:9-10 For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works. Titus 2:11-14 Though you have not seen him, you love him. Though you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory, obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls. 1 Peter 1:8-9","delusion-atheists","12:13 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","830"

I'm not going to respond to each of the sciptures one by one they all seem to reiterate the idea of salvation through Jesus which doesn't fully answer my question. The one that got close was... But then why would we be sent to hell for not accepting Christ? I understand that the above says He doesn't want to. But He will if we don't follow his word.

By rejecting the living God you automatically pledge allegiance to the devil even if you don't consciously make that decision.

So, if you ignore your spiritual nature in life and live it for yourself and for your natural inclinations, then you have chosen by that rejection of who God made you to be, to be apart from Him. And on that Judgement Day you will clearly see all of the abundant evidence He revealed to you in life and all of the times you rejected ""HIM"" by ignoring who you are.

Only God can meet you where you live and remove the scales of unbelief from your eyes. But you must seek Him because if you trust any Man to reveal God to you, you can be sure that you will buy into a cult, a fraudulent view of God and a lie created by some Man in order to gain some power over you. I can confidently tell you that my salvation came from God Himself and no man so I know that who I fellowship with is my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ who is truly the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.

Even satan himself doesn't possess that characteristic in his nature or else fallen angels could be forgiven for their rebellion against God. But they can't, only we can since we were deceived in our innocence but the fallen angels rebelled after spending untold millennia in Gods presence.

When I prayed that night I wasn't a believer at all. I was a 14 year old moslem kid who prayed as generic a prayer as I could think of. I referred to every god I could imagine and asked if either of you is the maker of my soul, the real and living God who knows and defines absolute truth, if absolute truth even exists, then please reveal yourself to me and I will follow you. But I want the true and living maker of my soul if you actually exist at all, or will I just live this life, die one day and become nothingness? If you exist, I want to know you. The bible say's ""to those who grope out into the darkness, I (God) will find YOU"". That is precisely what I did as an innocent teen who hungered to know if God was real or just a myth. All I can assure you of is that although it took 7 years, I met Him in Jesus Christ at around 21 years old. I wasn't going to church at all but was running into believers who witnessed to me at every turn. The wisdom of this world is foolishness to God, my friend.

I was at work when I responded and forgot to include it. The point that I am trying to make is that the freewill God bestows upon us is the illusion. ""You obey me or else you go to hell."" Damnation is the part that bothers me. Athiests don't reject God because we want to go to hell. We don't look at the description of hell and say ""That's where I got be!"" It's not the decision we make. We reject God because they're nothing tangible that proves He exists. I know it's a matter of faith. But there are people I won't loan money to because I can't trust them to return it. But I am expected to trust my soul and spirtual life to a being whose only proven existence lies in the hands of those who already believe? Those same people tell me that if I don't agree with them than I'm going straight to hell regardless of how I live my life. My denial of God no way dictates the way in which I will live my life. Even if I do everything in my power to make this world a better place for all and leave this earth better than when I arrived I will still have to suffer an eternity because I did so not believing in God. If you can rebel you have freewill. Athiests do not rebel against God nor do we disobey. We are just not convinced of His existence. This just shows that it is in our nature to be inquisitive. They didn't disobey God, they followed their instincts to understand our world. The way God created them. Yes, there may be things that we would rather not know. But being naive to evil is not a good thing. They only way to recognize good is to know evil. This is what I was searching for when I kept asking why. So, this is an experiment? I will not presume to ask you what is He attempting to discover as this will result in you having to question your God's wisdom and methods and I will not ask you to do that. But I will say that if we are His experiment than this speaks to God's infallibilty i.e. if He has to experiment there is something He doesn't know therefore He cannot infallible because in order to experiment you have to presume you can be wrong. If he is infallible than He knows the results of the experiement and went through with it anyways. His reasons can only be known by Him, but I would say that there is something fundmentally wrong with this as He is allowing people to harmed in this experiement He already knows the answers to. Furthermore, Why does He long for our companionship? Why does He need us to obey? I understand that we are to prosper from a relationship with God. But what does he get out of it? We will probably have to agree to disagree on this one. You must understand that when I left the faith I felt that more opportunities for knowledge presented itself. I felt that religion stifled my spiritual growth because it demand that accept one group of ideals and reject all others. My rejectetion of religion resulted in the ability to explore all avenues of spirtual and mental progression and pick and choose which ideals yo adapt yo my life style. Futhermore it is not the answers that fascinate me but the pursuit. Take music as an example. We all marvel at a persons ability to play one note and say everything that song is supposed to say. But we fail to recognize the notes that came before it and made it so great. Religion requires that we reach that one note and continue playing that note. I reject that notion and strive to find away to make all notes sound good under their repective contexts. You learn more from the pursuit of knowledge than you do from the resulting answer. Now, I understand that this weekend is eventful for you so I cannot submit this post without saying that I wish you and your family all the best and Happy Easter.","delusion-atheists","07:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","769"
