"10-21-2012","15051",16,"Squatch","464814","What I meant was that abiogenesis in itself is highly improbable. When you look in the right place under the right conditons it becomes inevitable","Easyrider","464819","I don't think so. Scientists have been trying to create life under even the most optimal conditions and have failed. But even if they did succeed it would no doubt be by intelligent design .","goal-evolutionists","11:15 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","226"
"10-21-2012","15051",16,"Freedom","464741","That is certainly chicken out of the egg, life adapts and so you find it many places survivng many things; then you conclude that the conditions favorable to life are similarly diverse and ubiquitous. Before life there was no adaptation, you have no idea whether the first cells were extremophiles or not. Secondly, how do you get from mathematically implausible to inevitable? A fully analysis of the odds would include factoring trials (= trials/time * time)","Accipiter","464820","Can you give us a reference that agrees with your position? I know you can't because the religious are the only people who believe the exact same things you do.","goal-evolutionists","11:21 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","227"
"10-21-2012","15051",16,"Accipiter","464723","Your post does not make sense. Theoretical perspectives and premise are words that you will find in every branch of science. I get the feeling that you did not read the entire page.","gansao","464827","I get the feeling that you are lazy or ignorant of the subject that you supplied a link to. Please explain digital physics and its conclusion that the universe is a computer in your own words. By the way,digital physics is not a branch of science .No doubt theoretical perpectives and premise are words found in some branches of theology. Is digital pyshics a branch of theology?","goal-evolutionists","01:16 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","229"
"10-21-2012","15051",16,"Freedom","464824","If you narrow the parameters for an unlikely event you are merely changing the distribution of unlikelihood not it's sum. For instance if I said finding a statue of liberty on the surface of an alien planet was unlikely, and you said it is inevitable because there was a statue of liberty building rock formation right next to it; you merely shifted the improbability to a statue of liberty building rock formation. The overall odds did not get better. Similarly assuming that conditions were right for abiogensis does not reduce the unlikeness of abiogensis because it's specificity also makes conditions that cause it extremely unlikely. Furthermore you are at risk for going far beyond the evidence, nothing even close to abiogensis has been observed under any conditions no matter how specific. Even the experiments which have observed the formation of amino acids and nucleotides have been limited only by what those conducting them found possible for a pre-biotic earth, not on any real evidence for what pre-biotic environment looked like. If religious people believe exactly as I do could I not reference the religious?","Squatch","464829","What I said was widening the parameters for the existence of life, ie finding life where we once assumed it could not exist, whether it is in a medium thought to be too acidic, too salty, too hot or too cold. Whenever we discover life under these circumstances then we must widen the parameters which allow for life. I find it a bit of a laughable argument to say that I risk going far beyond the evidence for this, when the accusor relies on zero evience for their belief system.","goal-evolutionists","01:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","230"

Man has gone to the moon, man is life; therefore some life from this planet is capable of existing on the moon for a while. We adapted, that does not mean we could have spontaneously formed on the moon. It seems this is unavoidable, so the question then becomes will you retract or become delusional conspiracy theorist along with databed and accipiter?","goal-evolutionists","02:13 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","231"

"10-21-2012","15051",16,"None","None","None","Squatch","464836","I feel that I need to clear this up. What I mean is, where we find life naturally on this planet , we went to the moon and we are life therefore life can exist on the moon. What kind of logic is that? That does not mean that life can exist on the moon it means that we went and that's that. Once we thought that life could exist under certain circumstances, whether that's between a minimum and maximum temperature or particular acidity. So as we've explored the planet and reached places where we didn't expect to find life because it was too cold, we found life. Whenever we've looked and not expected to find life, there it is. Now when we look at abiogenesis it is unknown how it might occur, I'm not claiming to know or trying to guess how it occurred. But that it occurred it is so much more feasible than an extra dimensional wizard twitching his nose.","goal-evolutionists","02:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","233"

Religious people do not know how life was created. No religion believes that life was created by a wizard twitching his nose and to state this is as disengenuous as a religious person saying that abiogenesis is claiming that life sprung out of nothing. Both would show complete ignorance of the others position","goal-evolutionists","02:48 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","234"

Maybe my bad joke about the wizard was a bit close to the bone, but that, for me is basically what God is. I am new to the forum and will take time to find my feet, but I will speak honestly and openly. I do hold contempt for creationists' compulsion to take religion literally when faced with real evidence of another explaination.","goal-evolutionists","03:26 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","235"

What is God proclaimed to be anyway? A magical being with the ability to do magic things. That's my perception. Like I said, the remark was a bad joke so why hop on it with the feigned horror at my ignorance?","goal-evolutionists","05:21 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","238"
"10-21-2012","15051",16,"Freedom","464847","Why, the strawman of course My belief system is based on nothing but evidence and logic. I know what you mean, but in context use of the term 'naturally' is ambiguous because it is universally admitted that life uses structures and systems which allow it to exist in ways and places that other life lacking those systems and structures could not. The extent of life a billion years after the fact gives us no basis on which to differentiate between conditions favorable to abiogensis and those conditions which are indeed hostile to primitive life but which were adapted to later. My moon example illustrated this perfectly, we as life spread to somewhere that would not have supported life before our adaptive structures made us capable of inhabiting it. The same is possible for every extemophile or even what we think of as normal conditions. Some have even tried to turn this into a positive for abiogensis, claiming that life could have arisen in a way totally alien to what we have been looking for and so we can't even begin to calculate the odds. Then I have no problem with your claims.","Squatch","464851","I'm beginning to feel a little mixed up as I had you down as a creationist but there you are citing why evolution prove my argument wrong. I'm afraid you'd better educate me on your view point on evolution. Am I correct?","goal-evolutionists","05:26 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","239"
