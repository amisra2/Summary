I believe in and support Evolution as the explanation for the advancement of Life and hope that the scientists of the world will continue to compile enough evidence to prove to the rest of the world that there is no creator and that we all evolved . As far as religion, well religion has trampled on the rights of others since it's inception so what comes around goes around is my view. I don't have a problem with religious people if they choose to believe in fairy tales, but when religious people force their doctrine on society and into Government I do have a problem with it. Religion In my Opinion should be eradicated from the planet. It's Dangerous, Promotes Bigotry and hate, Teaches Outright Lies, and the list goes on. So I guess in answer of your question I would say for me it's a resounding YES...I would like to Rid the world of religion.","goal-evolutionists","01:04 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","2"

Johnson created ID with the plan to destroy the evolution-accepted science world, and others followed suit, like Behe and Dembski. if a document by Sir Darwin was found illustrating how ToE was a tool to bring down religion, i would disassociate with him and that ideal right away. his theory would still be correct, based on the amount of evidence we have to support it, but evolution isnt a tool to bring down religion. ID was meant to be a tool to bring down evolution; whether it's changed since then or not is irrelevant. what is relevant is that there is no evidence to support anything other than a natural origin to modern biological entities by means of evolutionary theory, and thus, any challenges must have massive substantial emperical evidence, with an absolutely mindblowing theory to assist.

Yet it is considered science, is studied as science in the public realm, and is funded in the public realm. The reason for the double standard? Atheists like it, and atheists control science. Its not a stretch at all. The fact that the scientific community shuts out the open inquiry of a science like Intelligent Design is proof that they seek to weaken the hold of religion. It shows that many of the people in universities may in fact not be more intelligent than those outside of them. That educated people like Ward Churchill have knee jerk reactions and emotions just the same as anyone else. Haha, he is relevant to your point regardless of your ignorance of his existence or actions. His outrageous statements, with his subsequent invitations to speak at dozens of universities by like minded university administrations, served as a wake up call to much of the U.S. general public, of just what may be going on at the ivory towers of higher learning, that are in many ways insulated from the realities of useful products and services that are a large part of survival in the real world. Scientists deal in the absolute of evolution/abiogenesis, of Darwinism. Its a faith exactly the same as religion, and is just as jealously guarded as any religion. The proof is that they use corruptable courts to block any scientific challenges to it.

As far as the second one goes; Students' Research Proves Liberal Bias in College Faculties | Campus Reform There is so much clear proof that U.S. universities administrations have, teach and promote far left political views, that no one with even an elementary knowledge about the subject seriously disputes it. If you do, Im not going to discuss it with you until youve shown that youve attempted to learn something about it. Its not what this thread is about anyway. Much has been put forward by Michael Behe, and others, concerning scientific methods of detecting and exploring design in nature. The main atheist method to take exception to it seems to be to hear it, get angry about it and call names, then come back in a day or a week, and demand that it all be explained to them again, as if theyve never heard it. Im not interested in contributing to an atheist derailing of a thread, so Ill just say again, its not what this thread is really about. I dont refer to the U.S. only because Im a U.S. citizen, though thats part of it. I refer to it largely because one of its founding documents states that its people are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights. As the people in the U.S are now witnessing an atheist establishment in their government, (the required, public teaching of students in science classes that there is no creator) they also seem to be witnessing a government that no longer recognizes any unalienable rights. Many of us believe that those two changes are related to each other. Another reason I sometimes specify the U.S. in ID discussions is because, as far as I know, the concept of ID originated in the U.S. Yet atheists are freely allowed to use evolution/abiogenesis as an atheist tool, and have no fears about losing their jobs and being blacklisted. The double standards are crystal clear. If I show that they can get a Nobel prize for their scientific achievements, and clearly proclaim that the entire scientific community should be contributing to society by destroying religion, and arent criticized in any way by the scientific community, then were getting back on topic, and the opening posters question is getting closer to actually being answered. Why would it have to be Darwin? Why couldnt it be his friend Huxley, or other philosophers like Herbert Spencer, or todays Richard Dawkins? Why couldnt it be countless thousands of others that have extended Darwinian thinking into atheism, and made the two terms almost entirely synonymous? Like the authors of the books I showed above, in my post #24? If Johnson created ID to destroy the evolution accepted science world, with Behe and Dembski following suit, why is that different than Darwin creating common descent evolution with the intent of getting back at the possible God that took his teenaged daughter from him? With Huxley and Spencer following suit? The list of books I showed above, combined with the statement from Nobel prize winner Steven Weinberg, show that it can be a tool to bring down religion. How thoroughly, how often that tool is used goes a long way to answering the question that is the subject of the thread. But, being experienced in these debates, knowing that no matter how thoroughly and often I can show atheists using that tool, I know that MORE MORE MORE proof will always be demanded. This time, I believe I can most thoroughly, and yet briefly answer his question by clarifying the DOUBLE STANDARDS that clearly exist in evolution/atheism. I brought up the double standards issue in my previous posts, and as we see, no one has touched it yet. ID was meant to explore scientific avenues that have thus far gone unexplored in the atheist scientific community. It was meant to provide a challenge to the public establishment of atheism being taught in public science classes that has gradually taken place in the U.S over a period of several decades, in spite of its complete failure to provide any real scientific theories of naturalistic origins of life. As it happened, the atheist scientific community went ballistic about Intelligent Design, putting together a criteria for it to meet to become science, and keeping that criteria just out of its reach. In doing that, they inadvertently realized that abigenesis, and other sciences like SETI, didnt fit the criteria that they themselves established! The keeping of abiogenesis and SETI established as science has had no choice but to quickly spiral into a web of lies, deceit, and most importantly, using the U.S. court system with its ACLU warchest, not public opinion, to maintain the atheist status quo in the scientific community. Natural origin, by means of evolutionary theory? Havent you heard the latest atheist talking points, that abiogenesis (natural origins) and evolution have NOT A THING to do with each other? ID is a thorn in the side of atheism . ID isnt about bringing down evolution, or religious sympathies. You would do well to read my posts, (#'s 3,5,9,10,11,19,21, and 23) in this thread to learn some basics about what ID actually is.

After you check all that out, you can then decide if you'd like to come back here and contribute to a deeper exploration of DOUBLE STANDARDS throughout the scientific community.","Bennedict","424901","first of all, not directed at me, abiogenesis is not considered an accepted scientific theory. very little evidence exists for the theory more is being discovered and researched, and the theory is still being constructed - in no way is it considered by anyone to be accepted science. it is researched in universities which are publically funded, and theres a good reason for that. thats because there IS evidence to support the theory. thus, research will commence. thanks for sharing that information. but would a possibility also be that the more educated a person is, the more they will drift to the left? you musnt just jump to the conclusion that universities are politically biased based on these statistics, maybe they hire based solely on intellect and teaching ability, and those individuals are found to be politically left. afterall, university students are mainly liberal as well, and theres no way to tell where a person is politically by a university application, so the enrollment services have no way to bias their decisions. coincidence? maybe not. you said ""atheists are freely allowed to use evolution/abiogenesis as an atheist tool""... ok, but since when were we talking about atheists? i was referring only to science, and evolution is NOT a tool used by scientists to bring down religion. atheists will use certain pieces of information against religion, sure. thats what they do. and evolution can be used as such. but is that the premise which evolution was founded upon? absolutely not. is that the ""goal"" evolution has in the scientific community? absolutely not. evolution in the science realm is strictly scientific, as with all areas of study in the scientific realm. now, it is also true that the religious people use ID as an attack against evolution and atheism, but again, i dont care what these people use - they dont make any impact on the scientific community. i am only arguing in the defense of SCIENCE, not atheism, and against the ID BIG SHOTS, not just any old religious person or ID supporter. so, lets compare again: evolution in the science world is strictly science based. ID in the science world (or ID big shot world) is meant to bring down evolution and replace it with religious studies. evolution is not used by scientists to attack religion. ID is used by ID big shots to attack evolution-accepted science. it would have to be Darwin's writing because i was talking about the founding member of each ideology (Darwin and Johnson), devising their ideas based on either destroying religion or destroying evolution-accepted science, respectively. if Dawkins wrote about evolution being a tool against religion, i dont care. he would be speaking as an atheist, not a scientists, which ive stated before, i dont care about what atheists use against religion in this discussion. if it were Darwin, that would be an issue of concern, but his theory would still be correct nonetheless. about abiogenesis and SETI, abiogenesis is studied because there is a little bit of evidence for it, and more is being discovered. SETI is not studied in universities, its more of an after school project. and atheists have nothing to do with science. scientists are the ones focused on science, atheists are focused on religion. if you read what i had wrote, i said: ""a natural origin to modern biological entities by means of evolutionary theory"" MODERN... as in the biological organisms we have today. as in the ones that developed by means of evolutionary theory. so ID is a thorn in the side of atheism, correct? so it's purpose for existence is to convert atheists to christianity? so the reason ID supporters are trying to get ID into science classrooms is to destroy evolution, in order to convert atheists? right?","goal-evolutionists","12:43 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","34"

"03-01-2011","15051",3,"marc9000","424990","That doesnt solve the double standards problem at all. Youre saying that abiogenesis is not science, yet since it has some, or fragmented evidence, according to some people, thats all the justification it needs for being studied in the public realm. ID gets a blanket disregard in the scientific community because its deemed not to be science. Some peer review submissions for ID do exist. One example is A.C. McIntosh, ""Information and Entropy -- Top-Down or Bottom-Up Development in Living Systems?,"" International Journal of Design & Nature and Ecodynamics, Vol. 4(4):351-385 (2009). (PDF) That was about 1/3 down the page at this link; CSC - Peer-Reviewed & Peer-Edited Scientific Publications Supporting the Theory of Intelligent Design (Annotated) This is ID research, it is not religion, it is scientific experimentation. Abiogenesis studies are not one bit more scientific than this. Yes, but education is an imperfect human endeavor. Being taught WHAT to think, not HOW to think, is suspected by many of being a problem with todays educational systems. Science isnt the only source of knowledge, especially when it comes to politics. I'm not jumping to conclusions, I've done some research on it. I've read a book called ""The Professors"" that shows proof of drastic anti-American leanings of 100 U.S. university professors. We just have to agree to disagree I believe, considering Darwins state of mind in 1859, and considering the subsequent works of Huxley, Spencer, and many others leading up to all the authors of the books I showed in post #24, evolution was founded upon the premise of atheism, to a comparable degree that ID was founded on the premise of religion. Both of them have been extended into secular science. Evolution has more, simply because it has had more time, and didnt have to face any entrance requirements to become science. Evolution was largely rejected by the scientific community when Darwin's non-peer reviewed book, 'Origin of Species' was released. Yet no one politically blocked it from the public scientific realm. Not everyone sees it as an attack, some see it as new scientific pathways. As falsification science, something that the open inquiry of science is supposed to embrace. That it doesnt make the slightest impact on the scientific community indicates that they may be atheists first, and scientists second. As Im only arguing in the defense of science, not religion, and against the SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY BIG SHOTS, like Steven Weinberg, and the authors of all those books I referenced above. You seem to see a threat (a political threat?) from ID big shots. I fear a political threat from scientific community big shots. I believe that, at least in the U.S., my fear is more justified than yours. If youre not from the U.S., then our discussion on it is probably going to have to be limited. Not because I respect you less than I do a U.S. citizen, (I dont at all) but because of the ignorance both of us have about the political structure of the other ones country. Unless scientific community big shots like Steven Weinberg claim that it should be used to by the scientific community to destroy religion, and the rest of the scientific community doesnt criticize in any way. Not forcibly. If the scientific discoveries it makes about pathways and origins of information in the cell cause that to happen, its not religions fault. If noted scientists say it should be, and other scientists wink and nod at that statement, its common sense to believe that it is. Double standard. No one responding to me has yet to address the double standards. Its just that ID proponents dont worship Johnson like you do Darwin. Those credentialed scientists who took his idea and applied actual science to it, left Johnsons religion in the dust. Similar to the way that modern biology left Darwins ideas of the simplest forms of life in the dust. SETI Institute SETI stands for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. Nothing found yet. Nothing testable, repeatable, observable, falsifiable. Yet it automatically became science, with no entrance qualifications like ID has demanded of it. Yes modern, as in recent discoveries about the staggering complexity in the simplest forms of life. About modern comparisons of design, about similarities in human designed systems (one part missing, entire system ceases to operate and in biology, one part missing, entire system ceases to operate.)

Its purpose for existence is to provide balance to atheism, to teach new entrants in the field HOW to think, not WHAT to think.","Bennedict","425015","i never said abiogenesis wasnt science... i said its not yet an accepted scientific theory. heres the difference between abiogenesis and ID in terms of scientific acceptance: abiogenesis has theoretical and empirical evidence to support the theory, not enough for the scientific community (SC) to accept it just yet, the abiogenesis people are still working on it.

We have a hypothesis:If intelligent extraterrestrial life exists, we should be able to detect EM signals if we look in the right place at the right time. What do we do then? We go looking for it. We test it. There is nothing unscientific about this. Maybe one day we will find it, maybe we never will. For ID the hypothesis is:God created everything so there must be a way to prove alternate theories false since a belief we hold as true is ultimately uncontradictable. That is what ID is and that is why it is unscientific. The former starts with an actual hypothesis. ID starts with nothing more than a bold statement. The mission of the SETI Institute is to explore, understand and explain the origin, nature and prevalence of life in the universe. We believe we are conducting the most profound search in human history to know our beginnings and our place among the stars. Look at IC. The hypothesis here is:IC structures cannot evolve by a stepwise process required by the TOE because any subsequent version would be nonfunctional. Again, no hypothesis but instead a bold statement taking advantage of the chaotic nature and non-repeatable history of evolution. You can't test it and it's therefore non-scientific. Further, it has been debunked by actual science that proposes the opposite and then supports it with observation. To sum it up, ID supporters need to quit crying about their non-acceptance into the scientific community. If you want to be accepted you must be scientific. If you want to be scientific, you have to come up with answers that make sense and have something to back them up. Until you do, you will continue to look nothing more than religious.","marc9000","425433","Thats exactly identical to ID. Its a hypothesis, recent discoveries about the simplest forms of life show decreased likelihood that it arose by random, unguided processes. Maybe the information in DNA was there from the beginning (top down, from the peer reviewed paper that I linked). What do we do then? We go looking for it (if were not an atheist) We test it, if were not an atheist. Theres nothing unscientific about this. Thats not what ID is, and most in the scientific community know it. From the SETI website; You dont see bold statements there, and I do. What is a bold statement and what is a thoughtful hypothesis is completely subjective. Different worldviews see them differently. Where do you get that hypothesis? Wouldnt may be nonfunctional be more accurate? Like abiogenesis, I know.

As is evidence for naturalistic origins of life. Even if todays scientific community finally manages to create life from non life in a test tube, it doesnt mean it had to have happened that way originally on earth. Evidence for a designer and evidence for naturalistic origins are equally findable/unfindable. They dont complain because they get public funding! ID studies do not. They dont complain because the scientific community is looking over their shoulder and encouraging them every step of the way, all the while shouting that ID will never be science no matter what it does. They don't complain because they're free to write about their speculation in public school science textbooks, and don't have to worry about being hauled into court. Not every piece, just some pieces. Much of that evidence was collected by Darwin, and many others, who thought that the cell wasnt much more than a simple blob of protoplasm. Things have changed, in our knowledge of the simplest forms of life. The scientific community doesnt like anything that lessens the chances of something happening in nature that isnt the result of blind, undirected processes. It cant prove wrong what Behe and a few others have found, but it can ignore/downplay it. I referenced a Nobel Prize winning scientist. He, however indirectly, lavished praise on those books. I prefer books by Behe and Dembski, and the movie Expelled. It caught Steven Jay Gould, and others like him, without their normal talking points as handy as they usually are. Yet in another thread, you said this; Looks like YOU said modern science has left Darwin in the dust. Which of the above two paragraphs you wrote do you actually believe? ""Very little modifications"", or ""advanced Darwin's original theory to the point where it can no longer be referred to as ""Darwin's theory"". we call it the ""Modern Synthesis""? What could potentially be found by it? How is that defined? How could it be more objective than what could be found by ID, concerning pathways of information in keeping with known laws of thermodynamics? So when will that be what are the timelines? I can't find the 'SETI dissolve date' anywhere on their website. Ive shown you ways they follow the scientific method. thus religion taught in schools, youre shutting your eyes and holding your ears.

Dembski is not a scientists. Ben Stein is not a scientist. most ID supporters are not scientists, yet you trust them in doing science over the overwhelming majority of scientists who support evolution based on nothing more than your predepositions. you would prefer to essentially bring down an entire field of scientific study (biology) for no purpose other than to satisfy your religious bigotry. well done, scientist. notice: Sir Weinberg recommended those books as an atheist . you are confusing the man's personal life with his professional life. if you wish to reference books on science, i suggest avoiding atheist books. they are not scientific writings, despite a scientist writing them. you are again confusing Darwin with Darwinian evolutionary theory. Darwin as a scientist is well respected by the SC, and in no way is he left in the dust. his original theory is also not left in the dust, but rather modified so much that we can no longer call it ""Darwinian evolution"". his theory is also not left in the dust, because the foundation of the modern synthesis is his original theory, if you trace it back.","goal-evolutionists","10:07 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","56"

You wouldn't know the truth if it bit you on your nose. As for ""Hearsay..."" But just for fun, would the Rules of Evidence exclude statements within the Bible as hearsay? The answer is no. One class of statements excluded from the hearsay are statements contained in an ancient document. Fed.R.Ev. 803(16) provides this exception for Statements contained in ancient documents. ""The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule . . . Statements in a document in existence twenty years or more the authenticity of which is established."" Rule 901(8) sets out the method for authenticating ancient documents. ""Evidence that a document or data compilation, in any form (A) is in such condition as to create no suspicion concerning its authenticity, (B) was in a place where it, if authentic, would, likely be, and (C) has been in existence twenty years or more at the time it is offered."" Carrying the absurd one step further, lets anachronize and subject the Bible authors to the hearsay rules to see if they'd be competent to testify to the things they recorded. The fact is that many statements recorded in the Bible would be admissible under any one of several hearsay exceptions. Let's take a look at some oft-challenged elements of the Gospels and see how they would fare under the rules pertaining to hearsay. Jesus' genealogies Matthew 1, Luke 3: Admissible? Yes. Rule 803(13) ""The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule . . .Statements of fact concerning personal or family history contained in. . . genealogies, charts . . .or the like."" Miracles; Statement of the Blind Man in Mark 8:24 ""I see men, as trees walking."" Admissible? Yes. Rule 803(3) """"The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule . . . Statement of the declarant's then existing . . . physical condition. . . "" Statement of the disciples after Jesus calms the storm in Matthew 8:26, 27 ""But the men marvelled, saying, what manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him! Admissible? Yes. Rule 803(2) ""The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule . . . A statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition."" Statement Identifying Jesus after a Resurrection Appearance John 21:5-7 Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus. He called out to them, ""Friends, haven't you any fish?"" ""No,"" they answered. He said, ""Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some."" When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish. Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, ""It is the Lord!"" As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, ""It is the Lord,"" he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water. Admissible? Yes. Rule 803(1) ""The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule. . . A statement describing or explaining an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving the event or condition, or immediately thereafter."" Skeptic Richard Packham, also an attorney dismisses all resurrection accounts except Paul's as objectionable hearsay. Under the Federal Rules, this statement is admissible as a present sense impression, although in all fairness to Packham, this exception is not as widely accepted as the rest. Thus, as we can see, many of the most controversial parts of the NT are admissible under exceptions to the hearsay rule.

Yet you arrogantly claim to have all the answers. Instead of thumping that Bible, you should study it.","Easyrider","459567","You really are brain dead to think Jesus Christ is in the same category as Santa Claus. (from a previous post) First of all, Jesus is presented as an historical figure by reputable people in both secular and sacred historical writings. Santa Claus is simply presented as a fictional character. Second, Jesus is presented as a real person who claimed to be divine and who performed miracles. These accounts are attested to by reputable witnesses and have been transmitted to us reliably; the New Testament documents are 99.5% textually pure. Santa Claus is intentionally, and knowingly, presented as a fictional character who lives at the North Pole. Third, the intention of the gospel writers was to convey the physical reality of Jesus to responsible adults, whereas the accounts of Santa are intended to entertain the wild imaginations of children. This is why the vast majority of healthy, mentally competent adults do not believe in a real person known as Santa who can travel through air being pulled by several flying reindeer, who can carry in his sled enough presents for all the good children in the entire world, and who can descend and ascend through chimneys even though he is quite overweight. Fourth, the writings concerning Jesus exhibit an historical, cultural, religious, and political context with verifiable names, events, and places being an integral part of the record of that context and reality. Santa Claus stories do not contain any such integral contextualization, except to state that there is a north pole and that there are cities and countries where Santa visits at night. Fifth, the facts are that parents buy, wrap, and deliver presents to children, and we know of no documented occurrences where Santa Claus has been caught breaking and entering, tripping home alarm systems, caught on film, vanishing up a chimney, and riding a sleigh through the air pulled by flying reindeer. This latter point is worth commenting on, since we additionally have no evidence at all that reindeer can fly. This further adds to the irrationality of the Santa Claus story. Additionally, if a large sleigh (sufficient to carry millions of toys) approached the Washington D.C. area (surely there are at least some good children there), we would expect to hear of military fighter jets being scrambled to intercept the intruder. No records of this have yet surfaced. Sixth, given that the gospel accounts were written by individuals who knew Jesus personally (or were under the guidance of those who knew Him), that the gospels are historically accurate, superbly transmitted to us through the copying method, we can then assume at the very least that Jesus was an actual historical person. But, we have no hard evidence to establish the validity of Santa Claus. We have found no reindeer tracks on the roofs of millions of snow-covered homes on Christmas Eve. There are no video accounts of Santa roaming throughout peoples' homes. We know of no flying reindeer, and no one has yet established how Santa can live at the North Pole for hundreds of years without being detected -- particularly in this technologically advanced culture. Add to that the lack of Santa Disciples going about the world, risking their lives, being ridiculed by religious and political adversaries, writing inspirational text, performing miracles, etc., and you really don't have much evidence at all that Santa exists, except in the minds of children. Finally, it really comes down to whether or not either one can be reasonably supported to exist. Very few people deny the historic reality of Jesus, and though millions of children affirm the existence of Santa, we know well that the minds of children are not capable of differentiating between fantasy and reality -- particularly when the parents they are trusting tell them Santa is real. For an atheist to reject Jesus' existence based on arguments found against Santa Claus demonstrates the inability for the atheist to distinguish between historical verifiable documents and known constructed childrens' stories. Jesus was an actual historical figure. Santa, of course, is not.

I know what you mean, but in context use of the term 'naturally' is ambiguous because it is universally admitted that life uses structures and systems which allow it to exist in ways and places that other life lacking those systems and structures could not. The extent of life a billion years after the fact gives us no basis on which to differentiate between conditions favorable to abiogensis and those conditions which are indeed hostile to primitive life but which were adapted to later. My moon example illustrated this perfectly, we as life spread to somewhere that would not have supported life before our adaptive structures made us capable of inhabiting it. The same is possible for every extemophile or even what we think of as normal conditions.

"10-22-2012","15051",17,"Freedom","464947","The question is why don't I use references like you think they should be used. Your problem is insufficient education in basic epistemology. Simply piling up people who parrot what you may cut it for your college term papers but it does not constitute truth. As steeve likes to point out logic gets you from A to B and as databed loves to point out without point A (evidence) you can't get anywhere. What they both fail to see is the big picture. To arrive at truth one needs true premises and good logic. Two people can have the exact same premises and still disagree provided at least one's logic is faulty. It's also possible to disagree because of disagreement on premises. Here's the problem most premises are themselves the conclusions of other arguments with other premises. The pattern repeats again and again until at a certain point very deep in the tree there is no more logic, the premises come from observations and axioms. Where are references appropriate? When observations are being challenged, the references serve to establish the validity of these first premises. This is essentially raw data, eye witness reports, etc.... People asserting the same thing is not appropriate, even if they back it up with arguments; because the debate is about the arguments. Referencing someone elses argument is like voting present, if you think it's good repeat it in your own words so your opponent knows that you understand it at least enough to do that. In the rare event that first premises are challenged, I have posted references; I recently posted a link to geo-radiative data from NOAA. Most of the time none of my premises are even challenged, in fact most of the time my logic is not challenged either. My conclusions are ridiculed, dismissed, and little more. Evolution is an excellent example by the way, I have been accused of denying evidence but no one can find any evidence I deny. There isn't any, but that does not mean we agree; I have a problem with the analysis of the evidence, and that is a problem with logic. So the answer is, I don't post references because I know better . Didn't you just admit twice that this isn't true? Can you explain to me why I have been accused (multiple times and recently) on this forum of blindly believing what I am told (by Ayn Rand for instance) while at the same time you say no one else in the world believes the things I do?

Population & distribution Many gorilla populations have declined or completely disappeared over the past few decades. The lowland subspecies are more numerous and widespread than the upland and mountain subspecies. Mountain gorillas are the only gorillas to show an increase in numbers, but the overall population size is still very low. The western lowland gorilla is the most widespread, possibly numbering 100,000. The Cross River gorilla is currently the worlds rarest great ape, with a population of only around 250-300 restricted to a small area of highland forest on the border of Cameroon and Nigeria. There is no reliable estimate of the eastern lowland gorilla population; however at one time it could have reached 17,000 individuals. The total population of mountain gorillas is around 786 individuals, split into two separate groups.","Accipiter","465212","WWF - Gorillas So you guys have never made an estimate?","goal-evolutionists","05:19 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","293"

I do, however, believe in the possibility of an undiscovered bipedal great ape in North America. If I had to make an estimate I'd say maybe 1500 individuals. Isn't the population in The States concentrated in the urban areas? 311,000000 people sounds like a big number but if they're concentrated in the metropolitan areas and along river systems or the coast. That leaves some truly enormous areas without people. If researchers are correct in thinking that this animal actively avoids human contact, would it be so hard for such a tiny, isolated population might exist? I did a little sum and found that there are roughly 28 people per square mile in The US, in the UK there are 788 people per square mile and you can still get lost in the wilderness and die. I haven't included the area of Canada where they are said to exist as well. I'm not here to say YES there are definitely Bigfoot walking around. But people are definitely seeing something. Yes, people hoax footprints, but many of them show movement of the foot and non uniformity and other traits which would be difficult to fake. There are hair samples which defy categorisation, but have similarities with both apes and humans.

Judge Jones is a conservative church goer wrote in his conclusion: "" The proper application of both the endorsement and Lemon tests to the facts of this case makes it abundantly clear that the Board's ID Policy violates the Establishment Clause. In making this determination, we have addressed the seminal question of whether ID is science. We have concluded that it is not, and moreover that ID cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents. [...] The citizens of the Dover area were poorly served by the members of the Board who voted for the ID Policy. It is ironic that several of these individuals, who so staunchly and proudly touted their religious convictions in public, would time and again lie to cover their tracks and disguise the real purpose behind the ID Policy. With that said, we do not question that many of the leading advocates of ID have bona fide and deeply held beliefs which drive their scholarly endeavors. Nor do we controvert that ID should continue to be studied, debated, and discussed. As stated, our conclusion today is that it is unconstitutional to teach ID as an alternative to evolution in a public school science classroom."" Further Kenneth Miller, the lead expert witness for the Plaintiff's is also renowned for writing "" Finding Darwin's God, which argues that a belief in evolution is compatible with a belief in God; and Only a Theory, which explores ID and the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District case as well as its implications in science across America.""

It always surprises me when folks like Easyrider and Markle call themselves ""Christians"", you know, ""What Would Jesus Do"" (something I as an agnostic try to live by) and then they show their true colors. They care nothing of Jesus' example.. I think if Jesus was in heaven he'd be doing a major double face-palm at Easyrider and Markles hatred and vitriol.","Easyrider","472414","What would you know about all that, EnderBean? Did you preach the Gospel and help feed and clothe the poor on the street and at a run-down rescue mission for years and years like I did, and for ZERO pay? And if I get on somebody's case around here then just remember (if you have ever read and studied the Bible) that Jesus ripped a lot people's butts himself, and they weren't all pharisees. Is that on your ""What would Jesus do"" list? Why not? You might want to study up on John chapter 8 for starters. And for the record, the heathens I rip around here are dedicated Christ-bashers and Christ deniers, some of whom use extremely vile language in describing Jesus and Christians. You approve of that? So think before you jump. OK?","goal-evolutionists","02:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","305"

Matthew 6:2 So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honoured by others.

Love the way you say you preached the gospel and fed the poor all in the same sentence. I've seen a lot of that from so called Christians... bread in one hand and Bible in the other.

And I don't mean to lump all evolutionists into the same category so please feel free to speak on behalf of yourself unless of course you do claim to represent the whole of the evolutionary body of believers.","BarryDesborough","473721","Truck drivers drive their trucks along the road in order to deliver their loads.
