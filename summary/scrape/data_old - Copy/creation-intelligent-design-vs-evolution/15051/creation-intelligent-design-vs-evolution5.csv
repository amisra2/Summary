And what should we do about that? Let's declare some bad business practices good business, in the name of fairness to those who think capitalism sucks. Perhaps the prevalence of left-wing attitudes among university faculty is no more biased than the prevalence of right-wing attitudes among business people. Perhaps its not a matter of one side being smarter than the other and has nothing to do with conspiracies. Perhaps it's simply the case that people with different personality types, different interests, and different values tend to pursue different career paths?... Just a thought.","goal-evolutionists","12:32 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","61"

And I don't mean to lump all evolutionists into the same category so please feel free to speak on behalf of yourself unless of course you do claim to represent the whole of the evolutionary body of believers.","Einlanzer","437475","If your question is indeed sincere, then I don't mean this to be rude, but I will give you a dose of brutal honesty. The reality is that most ""evolutionists"" (i.e. most people with a halfway decent education in biology) care little about religion one way or another. Your question is asinine - what purpose would they have in ridding the world of religion? For most nonreligous people, religion doesn't even blip on their radar because they have other things to concern themselves with. A sane, educated person sees the wealth of information supporting evolution, and they see enough data to draw a conclusion with over 99% probability - nothing more, nothing less; a creationist sees the same information and thinks ""why do scientists hate jesus"", which is of course laughably irrational. The reality is that creationists are trying to rid the world of science, because it continuously makes them look foolish. This is a debate that creationists lost a long time ago and are still (for whatever reason) having trouble coping with.","goal-evolutionists","10:36 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","62"

Behind most threats, there is motive. The problem is that a creationist believes that truth lies in something that is ultimately untrue. As science puts more and more of their beliefs in the untrue file, it becomes a bigger and bigger threat. As far as a motive behind a scientist disproving Biblical creation etc etc, I think most scientists and/or atheists do hide a little smirk when they issue a good theory that flies in the face of religion. Why not? My truth is better than your truth!","goal-evolutionists","04:11 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","63"

And, I believe that nonreligious ""evolutionists"" really don't give a damn about religionists, certainly not enough to bother to defecate either on them or their rights. However, people who love science and the scientific method are distraught by religonists who rabidly hate science, and scientists. Fortunately, religionists are no longer permitted to persecute scientists and scientists and they are no longer allowed to waterboard or burn scientists at the stake. I honestly feel that you are projecting the evil and sins of the relgionists onto science and scientists because you feel guilty about your own feelings of hatred.","goal-evolutionists","05:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","65"

Markle","451283","To the creationist; Why do you spend your time and energy debating where you came from, seeking out conflict, when you could be looking forward, towards where you're going? To be lost in conflict is to be loosing sight of the message left to us, and it is the evolution of the soul that leads us beyond the confines of prejudice, beyond the conflict, the division, and towards maturity, leading us to the peace and unity of Spirit that the Lord has promised. Creation is evolution; evolution is creation. Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. The worth of a soul will only be measured by how much it has loved, nothing more, nothing less.","goal-evolutionists","11:09 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","66"

So, I would say that evolutionists are not about denying anything but instead, studying the proof of what was.","goal-evolutionists","07:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","71"
