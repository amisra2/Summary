I do get it, the whole concept of debate is truly foreign to you, you might even have thought what the presidential candidates have been doing is arguing. No, they were asserting their positions right next to each other and sneaking in subtle insults and mockery. That is you without the subtle part. In your world there can be no rightful winner because you were never taught what makes something right, all that's left is counting followers and clever language. You haven't entertained the idea that I could be right about anything based on the merits of my arguments since day one. Don't try to claim you just didn't think the arguments were good, you barely even read them much less addressed them. The only time you have taken any of my positions seriously is when they happen to mirror a movement you're familiar with (such as creationism) at which point you promptly assumed that I had nothing novel and I was equivalent to that movement in every respect. All the evidence fits and points to this epistemological failing in your psyche.","goal-evolutionists","10:08 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","261"

The only wages of ignoring things is ignorance. You built your own prison out of arrogance just as surely as religious people do with faith. You can neither expand your knowledge nor correct others because you are disgusted by open debate. If debating something you don't agree with makes you as ""bad"" as those you disagree with; I have to ask who do you debate? People you agree with? Perhaps this explains why you never seem to debate Gansao just asked ""So whos the dumbass that debates religion and believes its bunkum?"" He named you but he's wrong, you don't debate religion you ridicule it. In this you are consistent, by your own delusional choice you manage to be just as intellectually useful as easyrider telling people they are going to the pit.","goal-evolutionists","01:23 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","266"
