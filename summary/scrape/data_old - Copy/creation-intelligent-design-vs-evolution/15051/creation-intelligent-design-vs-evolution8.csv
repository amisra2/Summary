People purporting to be scientists present conclusions beased on incomplete testing and by not following the scientific method all the time. In a captialist system, especially in america, what is accepted as backed by science has more to do with what the media promotes as true than what has been actually verified by the scientific method. Regardless of how much another scientists refutes the claim based on real science, it is the acceptance by the public that allow multi-million dollar corporations to commit fraud and get away with it. And because they can control what the media says through money, they can financially benefit through the manipulation of the public to accept their claims.","Freedom","453252","A conclusion is not a tested verified hypothesis, it is merely the statement whose truth value is claimed to be dependent on supporting statements in an argument. You're telling me, AGCC irrational evolution, absurd diets, everything causes cancer. This is a cultural problem, people think science is an authority that must be blindly accepted. Corporations control the media? rofl. The media controls the media, and they are left wing lunatics who would rather cut the throat of a successful corporation than lie for them. They have their own agendas and when companies spring up to take advantage of the falsehoods they spread do not confuse cause and effect. Yet you still have made no progress towards explaining why a financially motivated scientist can't practice science.","goal-evolutionists","01:21 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","106"

I said a scientific conclusion cannot be derived because of financial motivation. You cannot pay a scientist to come up with a conclusion that scientific testing can't verify.","goal-evolutionists","05:16 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","107"
"04-23-2012","15051",8,"unkerpaulie","453115","The financial motivation didn't cause you to come to your conclusion, your financial motivation caused you to persevere with your original vision. Scientific conclusions can never be ""motivated"" by anything other than facts. Persistence is a quality that can very strongly associated with financial gain, and for a scientist, persistence is a valuable trait. However, the financial motivation cannot make a hypothesis true, regardless of how much money is at stake.","Databed","453307","Ok..............

"04-24-2012","15051",8,"Freedom","453309","You said: You have changed the claimed relationship. Now you are claiming that financial motivation cannot make non-science science. This is obvious. Before you were claiming that financial motivation could make science non-science, you have not supported this. In the above quote you do not mention anything about the conclusion except that it was the source of financial motivation. Since you did not include any other conditions your statement must apply to cases in which the scientific method is followed as well as those in which it is not.","unkerpaulie","453365","What? Financial motivation cannot make an unverified conclusion into a scientifically verified conclusion. That's what I've been saying all along, in both instances that you quote me. I never said otherwise, neither do I need to support a claim I never made. Now I have no idea where the disagreement even is, because you've confused what I've said, along with interjecting your own ideas of what I've implied, that I don't even know what the point of the dabate is anymore.","goal-evolutionists","03:48 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","114"

The bold is mine. Let me explain what he said with an example. Suppose that I am a research scientist tasked with the scientific investigation of the efficacy of a new drug. Now suppose that the drug manufacturer offers me $1,000,000.00 to report that the drug does what it claims, and does so without serious side effects. If I accept the money, then my work has not been science. This is true no matter what the actual outcome of my research was. The fact is, I was paid to reach a ""particular conclusion,"" whether my research supported that conclusion or not. This is not science. Apparently you are the only one of that opinion. The point is the you have failed to understand. You may be quite sure, but you seem to be alone in that opinion. You just don't pay attention.

I've had other ""discussions"" with the subject in question, and even been chastised by the moderators for my lack of courtesy and respect. I am fully aware that any attempts to bring the subject to any sort of reason or logic is futile. But I'm not trying to convince a single, delusional poster. I post for others who might otherwise see her arguments as rational.","goal-evolutionists","01:00 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","117"
"04-25-2012","15051",8,"None","None","None","Winston Smith","453437","if a scientist is paid to reach a particular conclusion, then we have three different possible outcomes: a) he knows beforehand that the conclusion desired by his employers was correct. If he knew beforehand that their employers were correct, it means the experiment had already been done either by him or other scientists . So he replicates the experiment others have already done, why not ? makes his employers happy and takes their money. This is not science for this was no experiment as the result was known beforehand. b) he doesn't know if his employers are correct for no one has tried to prove if his employers hypothesis is right or not. So he runs the experiment and guess what? they were right. Phew! so he reports to them the good news and takes their money with a clean conscience. This is science to me. c) he runs the experiment and nope! his employers were wrong. This is also science. He submits to them his results and returns their money. d) same as c) but he fudges the results (this is not science) to please his employers, takes the money and runs knowing that sooner or later he will be discredited by honest scientists.
