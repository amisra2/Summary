"04-25-2012","15051",9,"Freedom","453366","Scientist A is hired by a company to research subject B. They tell him he will only be paid if he reaches conclusion 1. Using the scientific method, and repeatable and conclusive experiment he arrives at conclusion 1. Your statement applies to this scenario because it is a scientist who is motivated by financial gain to arrive at a particular conclusion. Why is it not science?","unkerpaulie","453495","The scientist arrived at conclusion 1 because he followed the scientific method and it verified that conclusion 1 is supported by the research. He did not reach the conclusion because he was paid to. The presence of money or any other reward is irrelevant to the evidence supporting the conclusion. You cannot pay a scientist any sum of money to arrive at a scientific conclusion that science in itself cannot support. Any such occurence is unscientific. Which is what I've been saying from the onset.","goal-evolutionists","04:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","121"
"04-25-2012","15051",9,"Freedom","453476","all four cases fall within the domain of unkerpaulie's statement, since you said two of them were science you disagree with unkerpaulie and agree with me. So I guess pandion has three delusional posters to convince now","unkerpaulie","453507","Here you display a perfect example of your lack of comprehension and inability to follow semantic structure, even in an example as simple and broken down as this one. The 2 instances where Winston conceded that the scientist in question was actually following the scientific method b and c. In case b, the hypothesis (which is what Company A offered; it can only be a conclusion after scientific testing and verification) that Company A hoped would be reached was actually reached, incidentally, and not due to money being presented. The scientist followed the scientific method, and turned out to be correct. This happens. Nothing unscientific about it. In case c, the scientist tests the hypothesis and finds that it is not correct (which also happens), and presents the correct conclusion to the company, turning down the payment. Financial gain cannot be a factor in arriving at a scientific conclusion. The hypothesis is either true or false, based on what the test reveals, and not based on whether there is personal motivation for the scientist himself.","goal-evolutionists","04:44 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","122"
"04-25-2012","15051",9,"Freedom","453520","You are modifying your statement, which did not contain a causal condition but merely a condition. Not: I agree, which is why I said that if a scientist is reports a particular conclusion because it will give him financial gain , then its not science. Neither pure nor true nor any other type. Even that would not be sufficient, because it could be argued that he followed the scientific method because he was paid to; and thus financial motivation is still in the causal chain. You would have to say: I agree, which is why I said that if a scientist is reports a particular conclusion only because it will give him financial gain , then its not science. Neither pure nor true nor any other type. All hypotheses are the conclusions of the experiments which will support them. Note in Winston's example the money is returned if the tests fails, thus the money was not offered for mere testing, but for a particular result.","unkerpaulie","453542","In other words, you disagree with what I said, then rewrite what I said, then agreed with it. Fair enough. Agreed. However, you cannot know whether the test will support the hypothesis until the test is run, at which time it becomes a conclusion. These semantics games are boring. No disagreement here either. You said that 2 of the 4 scenarios Winston mentioned entailed real science (patting yourself on the back), when Winston just reiterated the point that if the scientist came to the conclusion that the company wanted him to because they were paying him to do so, then that's not science, which is what we have all been saying from the beginning.","goal-evolutionists","10:36 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","124"

The conclusion refers to the statements relationship in logical expression, it's label is not dependent on the truth of the premises or even the quality of the logic. So no, it is a conclusion before and after. You said more than that, you said that those two scenarios weren't scientist either.","goal-evolutionists","11:09 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","125"
"04-26-2012","15051",9,"amirsdaddy","424446","I'm just curious as to whether it is the intention of evolutionists to try to rid the world of religion and defecate on the rights of the religious or are you really trying to advance the scientific truth via discourse and evidence? And I don't mean to lump all evolutionists into the same category so please feel free to speak on behalf of yourself unless of course you do claim to represent the whole of the evolutionary body of believers.","simone","453604","Too many people are emotionally dependent upon religion to get them through the night. People who believe in evolution simply want the freed om to do research and to follow that research to its logical conclusions, subject of course to correction if later research disproves earlier conjectures and theories. It must be conceded, however, that faith is not allowed in these researches. Proofs. Material proofs.","goal-evolutionists","06:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","126"

"07-17-2012","15051",9,"Winston Smith","453437","if a scientist is paid to reach a particular conclusion, then we have three different possible outcomes: a) he knows beforehand that the conclusion desired by his employers was correct. If he knew beforehand that their employers were correct, it means the experiment had already been done either by him or other scientists . So he replicates the experiment others have already done, why not ? makes his employers happy and takes their money. This is not science for this was no experiment as the result was known beforehand. b) he doesn't know if his employers are correct for no one has tried to prove if his employers hypothesis is right or not. So he runs the experiment and guess what? they were right. Phew! so he reports to them the good news and takes their money with a clean conscience. This is science to me. c) he runs the experiment and nope! his employers were wrong. This is also science. He submits to them his results and returns their money. d) same as c) but he fudges the results (this is not science) to please his employers, takes the money and runs knowing that sooner or later he will be discredited by honest scientists. So he abandons his career in science and joins Goldman Sachs and become a multi multi billionaire investment banker knowing well that the company is 'too big to fail""","pandion","459316","Balderdash! If a ""scientist"" accepts money to influence him/her to reach a particular conclusion, he isn't doing science.
