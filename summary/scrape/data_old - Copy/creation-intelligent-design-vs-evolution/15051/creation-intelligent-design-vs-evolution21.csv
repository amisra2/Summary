"04-17-2013","15051",21,"None","None","None","TheEnderBean","472404","Its interesting that brought up the Kitzmiller v Dover trial. Judge Jones is a conservative church goer wrote in his conclusion: "" The proper application of both the endorsement and Lemon tests to the facts of this case makes it abundantly clear that the Board's ID Policy violates the Establishment Clause. In making this determination, we have addressed the seminal question of whether ID is science. We have concluded that it is not, and moreover that ID cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents. [...] The citizens of the Dover area were poorly served by the members of the Board who voted for the ID Policy. It is ironic that several of these individuals, who so staunchly and proudly touted their religious convictions in public, would time and again lie to cover their tracks and disguise the real purpose behind the ID Policy. With that said, we do not question that many of the leading advocates of ID have bona fide and deeply held beliefs which drive their scholarly endeavors. Nor do we controvert that ID should continue to be studied, debated, and discussed. As stated, our conclusion today is that it is unconstitutional to teach ID as an alternative to evolution in a public school science classroom."" Further Kenneth Miller, the lead expert witness for the Plaintiff's is also renowned for writing "" Finding Darwin's God, which argues that a belief in evolution is compatible with a belief in God; and Only a Theory, which explores ID and the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District case as well as its implications in science across America."" This kinda puts small kink your ""The evil liberal atheist evolutionists are out to get us!!!"" hypothesis, no? Judge Jones was appointed by George W. Bush. But of course he must really be a liberal atheist/evolutionist activist judge.. right?","goal-evolutionists","01:07 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","304"

Did you preach the Gospel and help feed and clothe the poor on the street and at a run-down rescue mission for years and years like I did, and for ZERO pay? And if I get on somebody's case around here then just remember (if you have ever read and studied the Bible) that Jesus ripped a lot people's butts himself, and they weren't all pharisees. Is that on your ""What would Jesus do"" list? Why not? You might want to study up on John chapter 8 for starters. And for the record, the heathens I rip around here are dedicated Christ-bashers and Christ deniers, some of whom use extremely vile language in describing Jesus and Christians. You approve of that? So think before you jump. OK?","goal-evolutionists","02:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","305"

"05-28-2013","15051",21,"amirsdaddy","424446","I'm just curious as to whether it is the intention of evolutionists to try to rid the world of religion and defecate on the rights of the religious or are you really trying to advance the scientific truth via discourse and evidence? And I don't mean to lump all evolutionists into the same category so please feel free to speak on behalf of yourself unless of course you do claim to represent the whole of the evolutionary body of believers.","BarryDesborough","473721","Truck drivers drive their trucks along the road in order to deliver their loads.
