From this is is pretty easy to infer you think taxation is moral.","pandion","459440","Don't be stupid. Warren Buffet has told you that his income is in the millions each year and yet he has a lower tax rate than his secretary. Taxation isn't immoral. But there should at least be some equity. Why do you republicans require the poor and middle class to finance the country while you reap the profits?","goal-evolutionists","12:26 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","153"
"07-19-2012","15051",11,"Rafi","459417","As I said, your mind is like concrete, all mixed up and permanently set. And it's obvious that you're a dittohead - your talking points and your signature are pure D El Rushbo cult jargon. Of course it's embarrassing to admit that, credibility and all... But then credibility doesn't matter to you 'baggers - just who can yell the loudest. You're so used to suppressing the truth it's a reflex. Thus, the difference between science and magical thinking. The word ""Evolutionists"" in this thread should read ""Scientists,"" because science looks at the evidence and adjusts its theories, whereas you wingnut fundies worship the your so-called ""theory,"" and dismiss the evidence. Good luck with your magical blood drinking and flesh eating, I hope it helps comfort your fears of your concocted imaginary ""Hell.","Easyrider","459457","If I'm a dittohead then you're Rosie O'Donnell or Nanci Pelosi. You're also an antichrist according to 1 John 2:22. No doubt your pristine ""scientific"" mind can identify for me and provide the conclusive DNA evidence for the specific hominid who is man's immediate, direct line ancestor? That's bs. On the other hand, I think you lilly-livered heathens need to go to the store and buy a hat before someone stretches a prophylactic over your heads.","goal-evolutionists","08:46 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","154"
