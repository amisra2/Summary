The Puritans in New England. But christians have always been very selective as to which particular Bible verses they prefer to inforce at any given moment. Love thy neighbor seems to have always been at the bottom of the list.","gansao","459904","What do we discern from that? That Christianity is a religion of torture or that torture has been used in the name of religion? A massive generalisation that asserts your experience of Christians is the definitive one","goal-evolutionists","10:11 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","211"
"10-19-2012","15051",15,"None","None","None","Squatch","464645","I like to think of myself as an evolutionist and ask myself the question, what is my goal as an evolutionist? The answer would have to be, the advancement of the understanding of evolution and to widen the catalogue of species of animals that have lived. I have no desire to disprove religion or belittle people of faith. If creationists choose to beleive that is their right, but it should be made clear that it is a BELIEF, a way of coping with a purposeless life in a random universe. It is something to get your head around if you've been doctrinated at an early age. I grew up in a semi Christian/Atheist household and went to a Church of England primary school. We had a prayer in the morning assembly and had R.E. like any other state school. But there was no pressure to believe, we were taught evolution as well. As I got older and was educated enough to read what I liked I began to learn more and came to realise by myself that the most logical answer to where we came from was evolution. I really cannot see how the fundamentalists can be so blinkered to reams of evidence which back up the theories that have come to be known as science. If we pride ourselves on logic and reason then God has no place in the universe. We should give ourselves credit for evolving into animals with the ability to develop morals and compassion and love.","goal-evolutionists","09:56 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","212"

Spiritual solace can come from a belief in any deity you like. Maybe it is good for people psychologically to believe in some form of higher power. I don't see why that belief negates the validity of evolution as the mechanism responsible for our existence. As for identifying the hominid species which might be our direct forebear, thats not possible to answer at this point in time. For a couple of reasons 1) For all we know two species may have interbred ie Neanderthal and Homo Habilis so we would have two direct line ancestors 2) We most certainly have not discovered every species of hominid that has ever lived.","goal-evolutionists","03:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","219"

But evolution (godless) must rely on its own miracles - the mathematically implausible occurrence of abiogenesis. Plus a whole universe suddenly appearing out of nowhere.

Yes it is mathematically implausable for abiogenesis to occur but not impossible. When you look at the fact that the planet is in the right place for liquid water. Couple that with the fact that we have a magnetic field to divert dangerous solar activity. Many many things are in place to make abiogenesis on this planet inevitable. There is no need for these conditions to have been engineered. The parameters for life to exist widen every time we discover a new extremophile.","goal-evolutionists","05:51 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","223"

Before life there was no adaptation, you have no idea whether the first cells were extremophiles or not. Secondly, how do you get from mathematically implausible to inevitable?
