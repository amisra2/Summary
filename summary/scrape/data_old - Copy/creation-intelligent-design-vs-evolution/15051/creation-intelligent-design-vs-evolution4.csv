You have a way of getting off track when you read something that you think might be tricky to respond to. I will ask again, ID could also indicate that technologically advanced aliens designed then planted the seeds of life on earth. If that turns out (lets say they contact us) to be true how would you feel about ID then? The simple fact is your outlandish ferry tail is much much more unlikely to be true then the alien scenario.","goal-evolutionists","08:05 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","48"

"03-07-2011","15051",4,"Bennedict","425015","i never said abiogenesis wasnt science... i said its not yet an accepted scientific theory. heres the difference between abiogenesis and ID in terms of scientific acceptance: abiogenesis has theoretical and empirical evidence to support the theory, not enough for the scientific community (SC) to accept it just yet, the abiogenesis people are still working on it. ID has no empirical evidence to base their theoretical assertions on, and minimal work is being done to find any, because as jyoshu said, evidence for a designer is unfindable. a peer reviewed article means nothing if you are writing based on assertions and not evidence. the SC will reject it based on that alone. so, both abiogenesis and ID are not accepted by the SC as of yet, the people working on abiogenesis dont complain, but rather work their arses off getting more evidence, whereas ID people whine and complain that their measely excuse for a ""scientific theory"" without any evidence whatsoever to support, is ignored by the SC based on that alone... evolution was not founded on atheism, in fact Darwin was not an atheist when he came up with his theory - he only became such afterwards. evolution was founded on the same principles as other scientific theories of its time - evidence, reason and inquiry. he spent 20 years collecting evidence and refining his theory to the best of his abilities before publishing ""Origin"", and no, it was not rejected by the SC. it was rejected by the public on religious bounds, but the theory was hesitantly accepted by the SC. heres the major problem with ID being accepted: if it is, evolution must be false, in part or in whole. and considering the amount of evidence, that is nearly impossible. every piece of evidence collected in 170 years + must either be a hoax, or an incorrect assessment. interesting how none of the books youve mentioned are scientific publications - but rather atheist publications. if you plan to argue against the SC big shots, as you say, i would suggest referencing scientific publications as opposed to books on atheism. if you truly cared about science, you wouldnt care about atheist books, and you wouldnt be against the scientific community (you would be on their side, afterall), but you would pay attention to scientific literature and the basis on which the SC judges accepted theories. maybe if you did that, you would realize why ID is rejected. check out some books by Stephen Jay Gould. do you honestly think modern science has left Darwin in the dust? every biologist ive ever asked has said that the best scientist in the world was Darwin, and for good reason. his theory has stood over 150 years with very little modifications, and additions made as technology developed. the man was a genius! every year my department celebrates his birthday (which coincidentally is my birthday yea, i share my birthday with Darwin!!!) with a community dinner. thats how much the SC appreciates the work he did, and still accepts him as a brilliant scientist. nobody acknowledges ""Darwinian evolution"" as being the forefront of evolutionary theory. we have constructed and advanced Darwin's original theory to the point where it can no longer be referred to as ""Darwin's theory"". we call it the ""Modern Synthesis"" now or modern biological synthesis - something along those lines referrs to the current evolutionary theory. SETI is an experiment. it isnt taught as scientific fact, for the reasons you said. students may be shown how it works, and what could potentially be found by it, but it isnt even a scientific theory - its an experiment. aliens are not taught in classrooms, or accepted by the SC, because there is no evidence for them - just like ID. and again, its SETI who is progressing and continuing to search - ID continues to attack the evolution-accepted SC for not accepting their rubbish ""theory"" on the basis that there is NO EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE. lets pretend SETI is a scientific theory that doesnt have any evidence to support it. would it be right for the SETI people to protest the SC for not accepting them based on them not finding anything yet? no, they will continue to look until they find something, and if they dont find anything, the SETI theory goes in the trash. ID is slightly different, in that it claims to be a theory, however its a ""theory"" founded upon nothing empirical. how can one start a theory without any evidence to begin with? thats an epic assertion that deserves no recognition from the SC or schools right off the bat. find some evidence first, then conduct a theory - thats how its worked ever since Galileo's time, but ID proponents ignored this in their struggle to get ID and thus creationism and thus religion taught in schools and printed in textbooks. they dont care for science! if they did, they would follow the scientific method.","marc9000","425427","With public funding/grants. Because it has no public funding/grants. Violates the constitutionally mandated separation of church and state, donchaknow. As is evidence for naturalistic origins of life. Even if todays scientific community finally manages to create life from non life in a test tube, it doesnt mean it had to have happened that way originally on earth. Evidence for a designer and evidence for naturalistic origins are equally findable/unfindable. They dont complain because they get public funding! ID studies do not. They dont complain because the scientific community is looking over their shoulder and encouraging them every step of the way, all the while shouting that ID will never be science no matter what it does. They don't complain because they're free to write about their speculation in public school science textbooks, and don't have to worry about being hauled into court. Not every piece, just some pieces. Much of that evidence was collected by Darwin, and many others, who thought that the cell wasnt much more than a simple blob of protoplasm. Things have changed, in our knowledge of the simplest forms of life. The scientific community doesnt like anything that lessens the chances of something happening in nature that isnt the result of blind, undirected processes. It cant prove wrong what Behe and a few others have found, but it can ignore/downplay it. I referenced a Nobel Prize winning scientist. He, however indirectly, lavished praise on those books. I prefer books by Behe and Dembski, and the movie Expelled. It caught Steven Jay Gould, and others like him, without their normal talking points as handy as they usually are. Yet in another thread, you said this; Looks like YOU said modern science has left Darwin in the dust. Which of the above two paragraphs you wrote do you actually believe? ""Very little modifications"", or ""advanced Darwin's original theory to the point where it can no longer be referred to as ""Darwin's theory"". we call it the ""Modern Synthesis""? What could potentially be found by it? How is that defined? How could it be more objective than what could be found by ID, concerning pathways of information in keeping with known laws of thermodynamics? So when will that be what are the timelines?

"03-07-2011","15051",4,"Databed","425025","This is actually a good example of what science is. We have a hypothesis:If intelligent extraterrestrial life exists, we should be able to detect EM signals if we look in the right place at the right time. What do we do then? We go looking for it. We test it. There is nothing unscientific about this. Maybe one day we will find it, maybe we never will. For ID the hypothesis is:God created everything so there must be a way to prove alternate theories false since a belief we hold as true is ultimately uncontradictable. That is what ID is and that is why it is unscientific. The former starts with an actual hypothesis. ID starts with nothing more than a bold statement. The mission of the SETI Institute is to explore, understand and explain the origin, nature and prevalence of life in the universe. We believe we are conducting the most profound search in human history to know our beginnings and our place among the stars. Look at IC. The hypothesis here is:IC structures cannot evolve by a stepwise process required by the TOE because any subsequent version would be nonfunctional. Again, no hypothesis but instead a bold statement taking advantage of the chaotic nature and non-repeatable history of evolution. You can't test it and it's therefore non-scientific. Further, it has been debunked by actual science that proposes the opposite and then supports it with observation. To sum it up, ID supporters need to quit crying about their non-acceptance into the scientific community. If you want to be accepted you must be scientific. If you want to be scientific, you have to come up with answers that make sense and have something to back them up. Until you do, you will continue to look nothing more than religious.","marc9000","425433","Thats exactly identical to ID. Its a hypothesis, recent discoveries about the simplest forms of life show decreased likelihood that it arose by random, unguided processes. Maybe the information in DNA was there from the beginning (top down, from the peer reviewed paper that I linked). What do we do then? We go looking for it (if were not an atheist) We test it, if were not an atheist. Theres nothing unscientific about this. Thats not what ID is, and most in the scientific community know it. From the SETI website; You dont see bold statements there, and I do. What is a bold statement and what is a thoughtful hypothesis is completely subjective. Different worldviews see them differently. Where do you get that hypothesis? Wouldnt may be nonfunctional be more accurate? Like abiogenesis, I know. Like SETIs sightings of space men, I know.","goal-evolutionists","09:08 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","54"
"03-07-2011","15051",4,"None","None","None","Accipiter","425437","It's not like people are somehow motivated by a mysterious evil compulsion to defend the grand and powerful evolutionary dogma with some giant conspiracy against your religion. Nobody cares about your religion. You are the guy jumping up and down yelling, hey you people are wrong, and then you get all upset when some one takes a pot shot at you, what did you expect? The people involved are motivated by reason, by a series of ideas that seams to make the most sense. When you and your people can provide something that appeals to the reason of people in a substantial way then you will just need to learn to deal with rejection. Every idea you have offered on this subject is tainted by the fact that they are all underpinned with the motivating force of your religion. If you werent religious you wouldnt care about any of it one bit and you would probably believe in evolution like most other people for the same reasons.","goal-evolutionists","09:45 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","55"

Dembski is not a scientists. Ben Stein is not a scientist. most ID supporters are not scientists, yet you trust them in doing science over the overwhelming majority of scientists who support evolution based on nothing more than your predepositions. you would prefer to essentially bring down an entire field of scientific study (biology) for no purpose other than to satisfy your religious bigotry. well done, scientist. notice: Sir Weinberg recommended those books as an atheist . you are confusing the man's personal life with his professional life. if you wish to reference books on science, i suggest avoiding atheist books. they are not scientific writings, despite a scientist writing them. you are again confusing Darwin with Darwinian evolutionary theory. Darwin as a scientist is well respected by the SC, and in no way is he left in the dust. his original theory is also not left in the dust, but rather modified so much that we can no longer call it ""Darwinian evolution"". his theory is also not left in the dust, because the foundation of the modern synthesis is his original theory, if you trace it back.","goal-evolutionists","10:07 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","56"

They have to show that their claims are science before teaching it in class.. and part of their claims is that there is an intelligent designer. Got any way to test for that.. since I.C. has been falsified as 'evidence' of a designer? You see, the I.D. people don't make any predictions, nor do they have any way to test their claims, or falsify the basics. That's why the 'battlle' for i.d. is in the courts, not the science journals.. because they don't have anything.","goal-evolutionists","11:43 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","57"
