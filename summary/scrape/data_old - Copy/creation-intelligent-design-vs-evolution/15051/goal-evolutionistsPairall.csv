"10-21-2012",1,"15051","244","Freedom","464824","If you narrow the parameters for an unlikely event you are merely changing the distribution of unlikelihood not it's sum. For instance if I said finding a statue of liberty on the surface of an alien planet was unlikely, and you said it is inevitable because there was a statue of liberty building rock formation right next to it; you merely shifted the improbability to a statue of liberty building rock formation. The overall odds did not get better. Similarly assuming that conditions were right for abiogensis does not reduce the unlikeness of abiogensis because it's specificity also makes conditions that cause it extremely unlikely. Furthermore you are at risk for going far beyond the evidence, nothing even close to abiogensis has been observed under any conditions no matter how specific. Even the experiments which have observed the formation of amino acids and nucleotides have been limited only by what those conducting them found possible for a pre-biotic earth, not on any real evidence for what pre-biotic environment looked like.

"10-22-2012",2,"15051","254","Freedom","464947","The question is why don't I use references like you think they should be used. Your problem is insufficient education in basic epistemology. Simply piling up people who parrot what you may cut it for your college term papers but it does not constitute truth. As steeve likes to point out logic gets you from A to B and as databed loves to point out without point A (evidence) you can't get anywhere. What they both fail to see is the big picture. To arrive at truth one needs true premises and good logic. Two people can have the exact same premises and still disagree provided at least one's logic is faulty. It's also possible to disagree because of disagreement on premises. Here's the problem most premises are themselves the conclusions of other arguments with other premises. The pattern repeats again and again until at a certain point very deep in the tree there is no more logic, the premises come from observations and axioms. Where are references appropriate? When observations are being challenged, the references serve to establish the validity of these first premises. This is essentially raw data, eye witness reports, etc.... People asserting the same thing is not appropriate, even if they back it up with arguments; because the debate is about the arguments. Referencing someone elses argument is like voting present, if you think it's good repeat it in your own words so your opponent knows that you understand it at least enough to do that. In the rare event that first premises are challenged, I have posted references; I recently posted a link to geo-radiative data from NOAA. Most of the time none of my premises are even challenged, in fact most of the time my logic is not challenged either. My conclusions are ridiculed, dismissed, and little more. Evolution is an excellent example by the way, I have been accused of denying evidence but no one can find any evidence I deny. There isn't any, but that does not mean we agree; I have a problem with the analysis of the evidence, and that is a problem with logic. So the answer is, I don't post references because I know better . Didn't you just admit twice that this isn't true? Can you explain to me why I have been accused (multiple times and recently) on this forum of blindly believing what I am told (by Ayn Rand for instance) while at the same time you say no one else in the world believes the things I do? Either I don't listen to or agree with anyone or I am dangerously gullible, I can't be both. I'm sure you do.

What I mean is, where we find life naturally on this planet , we went to the moon and we are life therefore life can exist on the moon. What kind of logic is that? That does not mean that life can exist on the moon it means that we went and that's that. Once we thought that life could exist under certain circumstances, whether that's between a minimum and maximum temperature or particular acidity. So as we've explored the planet and reached places where we didn't expect to find life because it was too cold, we found life. Whenever we've looked and not expected to find life, there it is. Now when we look at abiogenesis it is unknown how it might occur, I'm not claiming to know or trying to guess how it occurred.
