"02-26-2011","15051",3,"marc9000","424859","Its not a stretch at all. The fact that the scientific community shuts out the open inquiry of a science like Intelligent Design is proof that they seek to weaken the hold of religion. Scientists deal in the absolute of evolution/abiogenesis, of Darwinism. Its a faith exactly the same as religion, and is just as jealously guarded as any religion. The proof is that they use corruptable courts to block any scientific challenges to it. Much has been put forward by Michael Behe, and others, concerning scientific methods of detecting and exploring design in nature. The main atheist method to take exception to it seems to be to hear it, get angry about it and call names, then come back in a day or a week, and demand that it all be explained to them again, as if theyve never heard it.

Religion is believing in age old fairy tales simply because you've been told to believe. No evidence, no proof, nothing, nada.. Evolution is not religion...

Yet it is considered science, is studied as science in the public realm, and is funded in the public realm. The reason for the double standard? Atheists like it, and atheists control science. Its not a stretch at all. The fact that the scientific community shuts out the open inquiry of a science like Intelligent Design is proof that they seek to weaken the hold of religion. It shows that many of the people in universities may in fact not be more intelligent than those outside of them. That educated people like Ward Churchill have knee jerk reactions and emotions just the same as anyone else. Haha, he is relevant to your point regardless of your ignorance of his existence or actions. His outrageous statements, with his subsequent invitations to speak at dozens of universities by like minded university administrations, served as a wake up call to much of the U.S. general public, of just what may be going on at the ivory towers of higher learning, that are in many ways insulated from the realities of useful products and services that are a large part of survival in the real world. Scientists deal in the absolute of evolution/abiogenesis, of Darwinism. Its a faith exactly the same as religion, and is just as jealously guarded as any religion. The proof is that they use corruptable courts to block any scientific challenges to it. Uh, the first one wasnt an assertion about any kind of threat at all, it was actually an assertion that there is no threat, in one particular case. As far as the second one goes; Students' Research Proves Liberal Bias in College Faculties | Campus Reform There is so much clear proof that U.S. universities administrations have, teach and promote far left political views, that no one with even an elementary knowledge about the subject seriously disputes it. If you do, Im not going to discuss it with you until youve shown that youve attempted to learn something about it. Its not what this thread is about anyway. Much has been put forward by Michael Behe, and others, concerning scientific methods of detecting and exploring design in nature. The main atheist method to take exception to it seems to be to hear it, get angry about it and call names, then come back in a day or a week, and demand that it all be explained to them again, as if theyve never heard it. Im not interested in contributing to an atheist derailing of a thread, so Ill just say again, its not what this thread is really about. I dont refer to the U.S. only because Im a U.S. citizen, though thats part of it. I refer to it largely because one of its founding documents states that its people are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights. As the people in the U.S are now witnessing an atheist establishment in their government, (the required, public teaching of students in science classes that there is no creator) they also seem to be witnessing a government that no longer recognizes any unalienable rights. Many of us believe that those two changes are related to each other. Another reason I sometimes specify the U.S. in ID discussions is because, as far as I know, the concept of ID originated in the U.S. Yet atheists are freely allowed to use evolution/abiogenesis as an atheist tool, and have no fears about losing their jobs and being blacklisted. The double standards are crystal clear. If I show that they can get a Nobel prize for their scientific achievements, and clearly proclaim that the entire scientific community should be contributing to society by destroying religion, and arent criticized in any way by the scientific community, then were getting back on topic, and the opening posters question is getting closer to actually being answered. Why would it have to be Darwin? Why couldnt it be his friend Huxley, or other philosophers like Herbert Spencer, or todays Richard Dawkins? Why couldnt it be countless thousands of others that have extended Darwinian thinking into atheism, and made the two terms almost entirely synonymous? Like the authors of the books I showed above, in my post #24? If Johnson created ID to destroy the evolution accepted science world, with Behe and Dembski following suit, why is that different than Darwin creating common descent evolution with the intent of getting back at the possible God that took his teenaged daughter from him? With Huxley and Spencer following suit? The list of books I showed above, combined with the statement from Nobel prize winner Steven Weinberg, show that it can be a tool to bring down religion. How thoroughly, how often that tool is used goes a long way to answering the question that is the subject of the thread. But, being experienced in these debates, knowing that no matter how thoroughly and often I can show atheists using that tool, I know that MORE MORE MORE proof will always be demanded. This time, I believe I can most thoroughly, and yet briefly answer his question by clarifying the DOUBLE STANDARDS that clearly exist in evolution/atheism. I brought up the double standards issue in my previous posts, and as we see, no one has touched it yet. ID was meant to explore scientific avenues that have thus far gone unexplored in the atheist scientific community. It was meant to provide a challenge to the public establishment of atheism being taught in public science classes that has gradually taken place in the U.S over a period of several decades, in spite of its complete failure to provide any real scientific theories of naturalistic origins of life. As it happened, the atheist scientific community went ballistic about Intelligent Design, putting together a criteria for it to meet to become science, and keeping that criteria just out of its reach. In doing that, they inadvertently realized that abigenesis, and other sciences like SETI, didnt fit the criteria that they themselves established! The keeping of abiogenesis and SETI established as science has had no choice but to quickly spiral into a web of lies, deceit, and most importantly, using the U.S. court system with its ACLU warchest, not public opinion, to maintain the atheist status quo in the scientific community. Natural origin, by means of evolutionary theory? Havent you heard the latest atheist talking points, that abiogenesis (natural origins) and evolution have NOT A THING to do with each other? ID is a thorn in the side of atheism . ID isnt about bringing down evolution, or religious sympathies. You would do well to read my posts, (#'s 3,5,9,10,11,19,21, and 23) in this thread to learn some basics about what ID actually is. That thread clearly exposes the astounding lack of knowledge most evolutionists have about what Intelligent Design actually is. After you check all that out, you can then decide if you'd like to come back here and contribute to a deeper exploration of DOUBLE STANDARDS throughout the scientific community.","Bennedict","424901","first of all, not directed at me, abiogenesis is not considered an accepted scientific theory. very little evidence exists for the theory more is being discovered and researched, and the theory is still being constructed - in no way is it considered by anyone to be accepted science. it is researched in universities which are publically funded, and theres a good reason for that. thats because there IS evidence to support the theory. thus, research will commence. thanks for sharing that information. but would a possibility also be that the more educated a person is, the more they will drift to the left? you musnt just jump to the conclusion that universities are politically biased based on these statistics, maybe they hire based solely on intellect and teaching ability, and those individuals are found to be politically left. afterall, university students are mainly liberal as well, and theres no way to tell where a person is politically by a university application, so the enrollment services have no way to bias their decisions. coincidence? maybe not. you said ""atheists are freely allowed to use evolution/abiogenesis as an atheist tool""... ok, but since when were we talking about atheists? i was referring only to science, and evolution is NOT a tool used by scientists to bring down religion. atheists will use certain pieces of information against religion, sure. thats what they do. and evolution can be used as such. but is that the premise which evolution was founded upon? absolutely not. is that the ""goal"" evolution has in the scientific community? absolutely not. evolution in the science realm is strictly scientific, as with all areas of study in the scientific realm. now, it is also true that the religious people use ID as an attack against evolution and atheism, but again, i dont care what these people use - they dont make any impact on the scientific community. i am only arguing in the defense of SCIENCE, not atheism, and against the ID BIG SHOTS, not just any old religious person or ID supporter. so, lets compare again: evolution in the science world is strictly science based. ID in the science world (or ID big shot world) is meant to bring down evolution and replace it with religious studies. evolution is not used by scientists to attack religion. ID is used by ID big shots to attack evolution-accepted science. it would have to be Darwin's writing because i was talking about the founding member of each ideology (Darwin and Johnson), devising their ideas based on either destroying religion or destroying evolution-accepted science, respectively. if Dawkins wrote about evolution being a tool against religion, i dont care. he would be speaking as an atheist, not a scientists, which ive stated before, i dont care about what atheists use against religion in this discussion. if it were Darwin, that would be an issue of concern, but his theory would still be correct nonetheless. about abiogenesis and SETI, abiogenesis is studied because there is a little bit of evidence for it, and more is being discovered. SETI is not studied in universities, its more of an after school project. and atheists have nothing to do with science. scientists are the ones focused on science, atheists are focused on religion. if you read what i had wrote, i said: ""a natural origin to modern biological entities by means of evolutionary theory"" MODERN... as in the biological organisms we have today. as in the ones that developed by means of evolutionary theory. so ID is a thorn in the side of atheism, correct? so it's purpose for existence is to convert atheists to christianity? so the reason ID supporters are trying to get ID into science classrooms is to destroy evolution, in order to convert atheists? right?","goal-evolutionists","12:43 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","34"

It could possibly identify some characteristics of a designer, and of course different people would interpret the identity of the designer in different ways. It would be like someone buying a house from a realtor, long after the designer(s)/builder(s) had left the scene, with the intent of gutting it, and remodeling/adding to it. He could, for example, take note of how the basic structural members seem overbuilt to him, while the trim, gutters, HVAC, etc, would seem careless and underbuilt. He could determine that the builder took the basics more seriously than the trim. Or he could determine that there were two different people, (or crews) that did each job. If he saw some structural members much better built than others, he could speculate that there was more than one person, or crew, doing the designing. Or that there was only one, but that one might have been an old guy, and was in a bad mood on some days. It wouldnt be anything more than speculation. But the facts of how it was built wouldnt be speculation.

"03-01-2011","15051",3,"marc9000","424990","That doesnt solve the double standards problem at all. Youre saying that abiogenesis is not science, yet since it has some, or fragmented evidence, according to some people, thats all the justification it needs for being studied in the public realm. ID gets a blanket disregard in the scientific community because its deemed not to be science. Some peer review submissions for ID do exist. One example is A.C. McIntosh, ""Information and Entropy -- Top-Down or Bottom-Up Development in Living Systems?,"" International Journal of Design & Nature and Ecodynamics, Vol. 4(4):351-385 (2009). (PDF) That was about 1/3 down the page at this link; CSC - Peer-Reviewed & Peer-Edited Scientific Publications Supporting the Theory of Intelligent Design (Annotated) This is ID research, it is not religion, it is scientific experimentation. Abiogenesis studies are not one bit more scientific than this. Yes, but education is an imperfect human endeavor. Being taught WHAT to think, not HOW to think, is suspected by many of being a problem with todays educational systems. Science isnt the only source of knowledge, especially when it comes to politics. I'm not jumping to conclusions, I've done some research on it. I've read a book called ""The Professors"" that shows proof of drastic anti-American leanings of 100 U.S. university professors. We just have to agree to disagree I believe, considering Darwins state of mind in 1859, and considering the subsequent works of Huxley, Spencer, and many others leading up to all the authors of the books I showed in post #24, evolution was founded upon the premise of atheism, to a comparable degree that ID was founded on the premise of religion. Both of them have been extended into secular science. Evolution has more, simply because it has had more time, and didnt have to face any entrance requirements to become science. Evolution was largely rejected by the scientific community when Darwin's non-peer reviewed book, 'Origin of Species' was released. Yet no one politically blocked it from the public scientific realm. Not everyone sees it as an attack, some see it as new scientific pathways. As falsification science, something that the open inquiry of science is supposed to embrace. That it doesnt make the slightest impact on the scientific community indicates that they may be atheists first, and scientists second. As Im only arguing in the defense of science, not religion, and against the SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY BIG SHOTS, like Steven Weinberg, and the authors of all those books I referenced above. You seem to see a threat (a political threat?) from ID big shots. I fear a political threat from scientific community big shots. I believe that, at least in the U.S., my fear is more justified than yours. If youre not from the U.S., then our discussion on it is probably going to have to be limited. Not because I respect you less than I do a U.S. citizen, (I dont at all) but because of the ignorance both of us have about the political structure of the other ones country. Unless scientific community big shots like Steven Weinberg claim that it should be used to by the scientific community to destroy religion, and the rest of the scientific community doesnt criticize in any way. Not forcibly. If the scientific discoveries it makes about pathways and origins of information in the cell cause that to happen, its not religions fault. If noted scientists say it should be, and other scientists wink and nod at that statement, its common sense to believe that it is. Double standard. No one responding to me has yet to address the double standards. Its just that ID proponents dont worship Johnson like you do Darwin. Those credentialed scientists who took his idea and applied actual science to it, left Johnsons religion in the dust. Similar to the way that modern biology left Darwins ideas of the simplest forms of life in the dust. SETI Institute SETI stands for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. Nothing found yet. Nothing testable, repeatable, observable, falsifiable. Yet it automatically became science, with no entrance qualifications like ID has demanded of it. Yes modern, as in recent discoveries about the staggering complexity in the simplest forms of life. About modern comparisons of design, about similarities in human designed systems (one part missing, entire system ceases to operate and in biology, one part missing, entire system ceases to operate.) Its purpose for existence is open inquiry. Its purpose for existence is to provide balance to atheism, to teach new entrants in the field HOW to think, not WHAT to think.","Bennedict","425015","i never said abiogenesis wasnt science... i said its not yet an accepted scientific theory. heres the difference between abiogenesis and ID in terms of scientific acceptance: abiogenesis has theoretical and empirical evidence to support the theory, not enough for the scientific community (SC) to accept it just yet, the abiogenesis people are still working on it. ID has no empirical evidence to base their theoretical assertions on, and minimal work is being done to find any, because as jyoshu said, evidence for a designer is unfindable. a peer reviewed article means nothing if you are writing based on assertions and not evidence. the SC will reject it based on that alone. so, both abiogenesis and ID are not accepted by the SC as of yet, the people working on abiogenesis dont complain, but rather work their arses off getting more evidence, whereas ID people whine and complain that their measely excuse for a ""scientific theory"" without any evidence whatsoever to support, is ignored by the SC based on that alone... ""Yes, but education is an imperfect human endeavor. Being taught WHAT to think, not HOW to think, is suspected by many of being a problem with todays educational systems. Science isnt the only source of knowledge, especially when it comes to politics. "" whoever says that has probably never set foot in a university. i cant think of an instance where i was taught what to think - i was shown the evidence and the theory with some principles and asked to write a paper on it. university education is the reason people can think laterally. evolution was not founded on atheism, in fact Darwin was not an atheist when he came up with his theory - he only became such afterwards. evolution was founded on the same principles as other scientific theories of its time - evidence, reason and inquiry. he spent 20 years collecting evidence and refining his theory to the best of his abilities before publishing ""Origin"", and no, it was not rejected by the SC. it was rejected by the public on religious bounds, but the theory was hesitantly accepted by the SC. heres the major problem with ID being accepted: if it is, evolution must be false, in part or in whole. and considering the amount of evidence, that is nearly impossible. every piece of evidence collected in 170 years + must either be a hoax, or an incorrect assessment. interesting how none of the books youve mentioned are scientific publications - but rather atheist publications. if you plan to argue against the SC big shots, as you say, i would suggest referencing scientific publications as opposed to books on atheism. if you truly cared about science, you wouldnt care about atheist books, and you wouldnt be against the scientific community (you would be on their side, afterall), but you would pay attention to scientific literature and the basis on which the SC judges accepted theories. maybe if you did that, you would realize why ID is rejected. check out some books by Stephen Jay Gould. do you honestly think modern science has left Darwin in the dust? every biologist ive ever asked has said that the best scientist in the world was Darwin, and for good reason. his theory has stood over 150 years with very little modifications, and additions made as technology developed. the man was a genius! every year my department celebrates his birthday (which coincidentally is my birthday yea, i share my birthday with Darwin!!!) with a community dinner. thats how much the SC appreciates the work he did, and still accepts him as a brilliant scientist. SETI is an experiment. it isnt taught as scientific fact, for the reasons you said. students may be shown how it works, and what could potentially be found by it, but it isnt even a scientific theory - its an experiment. aliens are not taught in classrooms, or accepted by the SC, because there is no evidence for them - just like ID. and again, its SETI who is progressing and continuing to search - ID continues to attack the evolution-accepted SC for not accepting their rubbish ""theory"" on the basis that there is NO EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE. lets pretend SETI is a scientific theory that doesnt have any evidence to support it. would it be right for the SETI people to protest the SC for not accepting them based on them not finding anything yet? no, they will continue to look until they find something, and if they dont find anything, the SETI theory goes in the trash. ID is slightly different, in that it claims to be a theory, however its a ""theory"" founded upon nothing empirical. how can one start a theory without any evidence to begin with? thats an epic assertion that deserves no recognition from the SC or schools right off the bat. find some evidence first, then conduct a theory - thats how its worked ever since Galileo's time, but ID proponents ignored this in their struggle to get ID and thus creationism and thus religion taught in schools and printed in textbooks. they dont care for science! if they did, they would follow the scientific method. ""Yes modern, as in recent discoveries about the staggering complexity in the simplest forms of life. About modern comparisons of design, about similarities in human designed systems (one part missing, entire system ceases to operate and in biology, one part missing, entire system ceases to operate.)"" no. modern as in cats and dogs, humans and turtles, koala bears and bluefin tuna. the MODERN animalia biosphere, which has developed by means of natural selection, not design. edit: not just animals, actually. bacteria, archaea, plants, and all other categories of life under go natural selection and evolution. we should talk about plants more on this forum - i think its easier to see evolution in action with plants than with animals.","goal-evolutionists","02:08 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","44"
