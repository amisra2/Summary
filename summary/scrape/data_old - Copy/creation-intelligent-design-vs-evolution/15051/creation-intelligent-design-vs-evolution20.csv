"10-25-2012","15051",20,"Accipiter","465170","Well, I guess I am not opposed to wasting a little time. How many big foot are there?","Squatch","465210","How should I know how many there are? How many Gorillas are there? We know for certain that they exist but they were myth until just over 100 years ago.","goal-evolutionists","04:32 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","292"
"10-25-2012","15051",20,"Squatch","465210","How should I know how many there are? How many Gorillas are there? We know for certain that they exist but they were myth until just over 100 years ago. Population & distribution Many gorilla populations have declined or completely disappeared over the past few decades. The lowland subspecies are more numerous and widespread than the upland and mountain subspecies. Mountain gorillas are the only gorillas to show an increase in numbers, but the overall population size is still very low. The western lowland gorilla is the most widespread, possibly numbering 100,000. The Cross River gorilla is currently the worlds rarest great ape, with a population of only around 250-300 restricted to a small area of highland forest on the border of Cameroon and Nigeria. There is no reliable estimate of the eastern lowland gorilla population; however at one time it could have reached 17,000 individuals. The total population of mountain gorillas is around 786 individuals, split into two separate groups.","Accipiter","465212","WWF - Gorillas So you guys have never made an estimate?","goal-evolutionists","05:19 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","293"
"10-25-2012","15051",20,"None","None","None","Squatch","465232","I haven't personally made an estimate on the potential number of bigfoot (another plural) as the existence of the animal hasn't been proven in my eyes. I do, however, believe in the possibility of an undiscovered bipedal great ape in North America. If I had to make an estimate I'd say maybe 1500 individuals. Isn't the population in The States concentrated in the urban areas? 311,000000 people sounds like a big number but if they're concentrated in the metropolitan areas and along river systems or the coast. That leaves some truly enormous areas without people. If researchers are correct in thinking that this animal actively avoids human contact, would it be so hard for such a tiny, isolated population might exist? I did a little sum and found that there are roughly 28 people per square mile in The US, in the UK there are 788 people per square mile and you can still get lost in the wilderness and die. I haven't included the area of Canada where they are said to exist as well. I'm not here to say YES there are definitely Bigfoot walking around. But people are definitely seeing something. Yes, people hoax footprints, but many of them show movement of the foot and non uniformity and other traits which would be difficult to fake. There are hair samples which defy categorisation, but have similarities with both apes and humans. There are sound recordings of strange vocalisations, these things need investigation.","goal-evolutionists","09:55 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","294"

"10-26-2012","15051",20,"Freedom","465239","How many bigfoots are there? So what do you think of the considerations in the FAQ? Some of the reports are almost certainly attributable to hysteria and miss identification, the question is how many (xfiles music) No, hijacking threads is a 4forums specialty. You can make another thread but accipiter's attention span isn't long enough to make the switch. He'll insult you and then lose interest.","Squatch","465347","I think that the FAQ on the BFRO site does address some things that your average man on the street might not consider. A lot of people under estimate the size of the areas concerned. We're talking about millions of square miles. Without a doubt some of the reports are down to hysteria or misidentification. When you look at a bear for instance, on it's hind legs, foraging in the woods where you can only see it from behind and can't make out it's head. You could be forgiven for thinking it was a Bigfoot, bears have similar skeletal structures to us, especially in the hands and arms. But what about the witnesses who are familiar with bears? What about the witnesses who see a bi pedal creature running across the road in front of them and clearing it in three steps? Well I've started one anyway in the open debate section.","goal-evolutionists","04:39 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","298"

The likelihood of Bigfoot being a man in a Bigfoot suit is damn near 100%. What you have is an untested hypothesis with a huge probability of being wrong simply because the proof would be so easy to generate.","goal-evolutionists","08:34 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","299"
