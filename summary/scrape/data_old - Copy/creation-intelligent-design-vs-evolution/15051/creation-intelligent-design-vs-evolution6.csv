"03-25-2012","15051",6,"G. W. Markle","451313","Hatred is merely a lack of love. If youd like a clinical definition of the personality that exists in that void, it would be: psychopath. These are people who lack a conscience, can never feel guilt, remorse or shame, never repent their transgressions, and can therefore never be forgiven. Doomed.","Penfold","451399","I see you know little of clinical psychiatry either. You ignorance is encyclopedic.","goal-evolutionists","04:55 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","79"

I never do it. It's a mindless cheap shot. I'm not saying that I have always been above such childish tactics.

"03-30-2012","15051",6,"G. W. Markle","451349","""You will know them by their deeds"" and by the words they preach. His words are divisive in nature, and don't lead to greater understanding. It's that false stance of his divinity that betrays him. Frankly, I think he hates me. I'm sure Jesus loves him, but everybody else thinks he's an XXX hole. Sorry Data, I still love you.","Databed","451594","Wow, I can't believe it was that easy to tear down that veil of love you hid behind in your first few posts. On the other hand, at least you are being honest now. Anyways, now that we get chance a chance to see who we are really dealing with, who's words carry more hatred? And more importantly, what does this hatred stem from? I think you might have made my point for me without even realizing it.","goal-evolutionists","10:56 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","87"

"04-19-2012","15051",6,"Databed","437812","Creationists see evolution as a threat, plain and simple. Behind most threats, there is motive. The problem is that a creationist believes that truth lies in something that is ultimately untrue. As science puts more and more of their beliefs in the untrue file, it becomes a bigger and bigger threat. As far as a motive behind a scientist disproving Biblical creation etc etc, I think most scientists and/or atheists do hide a little smirk when they issue a good theory that flies in the face of religion. Why not? My truth is better than your truth!","unkerpaulie","452800","The ""threat"" is only perceived as such by the person trying to hold on to their former belief. In the days when people believed that a mile could not be run in 4 minutes or less, did the person that set out to break that record have a motive in threathening the former belief? Anything that is an accepted belief can be ""threatened"" by facts. The issue is not the facts, nor is it the person pursuing the discovery of these facts. The issue is the person that is trying to hold on to the old false belief. There is no motive in the person pursuing the truth except to find the truth. All other side-effects are incidental. If the religious community must now feel ""threatened"" by the discovery of the truth, then so be it. But to question the motives of those seeking the truth, now that's just plain disengenous.","goal-evolutionists","12:46 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","90"
