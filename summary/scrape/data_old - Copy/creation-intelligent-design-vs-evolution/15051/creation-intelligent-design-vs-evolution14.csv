Were you ever able to name all those deist signers of the Declaration of Independence? I'll settle for just five. Remember when selecting your five that a deist was one who believed in a God who did not involve himself in the affairs of men and / or nations, and who did not give divine revelation to man (ala the Bible). Let's see your list. Otherwise the world will know you lied AGAIN !","Rafi","459734","Why Dittoboy? You, who are impervious to fact, who have already seen all the opposing evidence, you knower of all, with an answer for everything, don't need any more facts. You need a laxative. You also should get liposuction done from your head, and do something about that terrible redness in your neck. Oh, and get the vaseline, it's almost time for Rush!","goal-evolutionists","12:20 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","196"

So once again you're full of horse manure. One other thing - enjoy life while you can because you could very well be in Hell by morning. Or even next week, month, or year.

Let me. But first: So you get to define what a deist was in 1776? Here you go: John Adams - a Unitarian who denied the divinity of Christ. Technically not a deist but closer to deism than to christianity. George Clinton - a deist Benjamin Franklin - a deist and Free Mason John Hancock - a deist and Free Mason Stephen Hopkins - a deist Thomas Jefferson - a deist and possibly a Free Mason Lewis Morris - a deist Robert Treat Paine - a deist Benjamin Rush - a deist George Wythe - a professed deist when he signed Besides that: Robert Morris was a Free Mason, as were most deists. Also George Read - Free Mason Of course, there it the fact that many of our Presidents were not Christian: George Washington - deist and Free Mason John Adams - Unitarian Thomas Jefferson - deist James Madison - deist James Monroe - deist John Q. Adams - Unitarian Andrew Jackson - unknown until after his presidency when he became a christian Abraham Lincoln - atheist Ronald Reagan - spiritualist Others of our ""Founding Fathers"" who were deists: Ethan Allen - Free Mason Joel Barlow William Dawes (alarm rider) - Free Mason Rufus King - Free Mason James Madison - Free mason (Dolly was also a deist) George Mason James Monroe Gouverneur Morris James Otis Thomas Paine Elihu Palmer Charles Pinckney Charles Cotesworth Pinckney Edmund Randolph Paul Revere (alarm rider) Benjamin Rush Joseph Warren - Free Mason Nope. He didn't. The thing is that you are ignorant of the causes, politics, and philosophy of the Revolution. You seem to have bought into the ""christian nation"" stupidity that asserts that our founding fathers were christians. Some were. The major voices were not. They were educated at Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, William and Mary, Princeton, etc. At that time they were fed an intellectual diet of Enlightenment literature. It was a bit passe at the time, but it inspired the Revolution, the Declaration, and the Constitution. Educated men, christian or not, accepted the principles of the Enlightenment. As a result, the US is not a ""christian nation,"" but rather an ""enlightenment"" nation. ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;"" That's not christian since christianity has never had a problem with imposing christian faith by law and torture.","goal-evolutionists","02:25 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","203"
