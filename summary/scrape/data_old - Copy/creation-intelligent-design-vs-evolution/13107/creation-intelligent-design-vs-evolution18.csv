"08-30-2009","13107",18,"Archangel","367566","...people who constantly and condescendingly treat we believers like ignorant pariahs who lack the intelligence to appreciate the lies your secular humanist gospel represents... And of course you can't appreciate the blunt honesty of my assessment of your mental aptitude as you prefer the lie to the truth so readily, but how telling that I have never seen you criticize your cohorts for calling me and my allies stupid for not accepting your secular humanist religion of evolution. Like I have already said elsewhere, you are a hypocrite Matt, and I say that with love. It's interesting to me how you all just parrot me in claiming now that it is I who offers nothing substantive when that has been my repeated complaint about your side considering this thread has gone around 250 posts by now and I have stood against a number of you alone. ...you repeatedly insist that you are right and that I don't get it. But as for you actually producing ""real"" and ""verifiable evidence""? You haven't because there is none. And as for my declaring that nothing your side says convincing me of anything, I also made clear that the same problem applies to your side accepting my side of the debate, which is why we are at a stalemate. Do you find me admitting that we are at a philosophical stalemate to be disingenuous, or a completely honest assessment of our respective positions? And you prove yourself to be as disingenuous as your secular humanist and atheist cohorts as you accuse me of being intellectually dishonest when I am completely consistent and committed to my belief system, and never capitulate or compromise my personal convictions for the sake of being accepted by those I find to be wrong, lying, deceived or just plain hypocrites as they claim to believe one thing while they represent a completely diametrically opposing philosophy; you know, like you do!!!","Matthew","367577","Archie, you have ascribed to evolutionists the view that a fish crawled out of the ocean and survived long enough to turn into a mammal. You have demanded explanations about how lizards can turn into dogs or plants turn into insects. What that indicates to me is not a lack of intelligence, but it certainly qualifies as ignorance. You do not understand evolution. Ignorance is no sin. But the wise thing to do would be to correct it, as quickly as possible. Personally, I have never called you ""stupid."" I have called you deeply ignorant of what you are criticizing. Three instances are provided above. Your ""blunt honesty"" is used in defense of a basic misunderstanding. So what exactly am I supposed to ""appreciate?"" And this is where I simply don't believe you , Archie. In my experience, most people who are into ""tough love"" enough to make a big deal about it are waaaaaaay more into the ""tough"" than the ""love."" Archie, I spent a sizable portion of my afternoon yesterday composing responses to you. Those responses were substantive and specific. I explained exactly where I thought you were wrong. What I have received in return is an attack on my honesty. Just like the last time I tried to engage you. Archie, anyone who believes that evolution says a fish turned into a mammal, a lizard could turn into a dog, or a plant could turn into an insect does not understand evolution. Period. So what are you going to do about that? Just assert ""I do get it"" again? Get over the defensiveness and educate yourself about the thing you are criticizing! No, there's plenty of evidence. But ""there is none"" that you will accept . The issue of what constitutes acceptable evidence was another substantive matter discussed in my posts. And you have ignored it. I find that there is indeed a stalemate. But it results from the fact that one side simply does not understand evolution, yet criticizes evolution as if it did. How can we even have a serious debate, when there are such serious misunderstandings of the very issue to be debated? when any attempt to correct misunderstandings is treated as evidence of the sinful character of those attempting to do the correcting? This is a stalemate at the starting line. I have no doubt that you believe what you say you believe. I have never criticized you for a lack of commitment. The problem is, right now, any time something challenges your worldview, you attack the character of him who offered the challenge.

Instead, I've come back to find that Archangel has completely ignored my posts - even going so far as to repeat the same misunderstandings about macroevolution several further times. He has done equally to Matthew. As such, I see no point in doing the maths on something which he is either going to completely ignore, or going to dismiss because 'I set out to disprove Hoyles theory' or somesuch. So, Archie, two brief bits of commentary is all you're getting until you can prove that you will actually take what other people have written into consideration, rather than dismissing their responses for arbitrary reasons, attributing to them false characteristics or simply ignoring what they've posted. Firstly, your 'summary argument' of #242. After repeatedly asking for sources, citations and 'proof', this post contains not a one. It also reads far to much into non-scientific diagrams. The post also states your basic agenda - to quote, "" I don't care how you dress your philosophy up in a package to appear to be legitimate science, because it is still a fraud and a lie "". In short, you here state unequivocally that what ever we say, you will consider evolution to be wrong. Secondly, a snippet from a later post: I thought that you told us that 'evolution is NOT A SALVATION ISSUE'? This seems to be another example of you saying one thing while believing another...","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","01:27 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","259"

You know as well as I do that macro-evolution believes that all life evolved from an original single celled organism/protein/ enzyme which is all living creatures common ancestor. But you can't honestly accept my general statement of description for what it is. Like a typical dishonest advocate of this pseudo science you must interpret my statements literally and then assert that I don't understand the subject. This knowing full well that I do understand the subject very well, but since you can't answer the inconsistencies I point out to you, you must deflect from that reality by asserting that I don't get it. A dishonest and cowardly debating tactic since it prevents us from ever getting to the meat of the issues I raise. Agreed, but you and your secular humanist cohorts will never admit it's you who needs correcting. And I have shown that your criticisms above are either deeply ignorant or blatantly disingenuous as you attempt to use literal interpretations of general statements of the accepted cause and effect which accurately defines evolution as an example of my lack of knowledge of your pseudo-scientific religion. Balderdash. Speak for yourself. My blunt honesty is usually just posting bible passages which so convict the opposition because Gods word is a living breathing double edged sword of truth, that the recipients feel condemned by it. But rather than take that truth to heart, they respond by claiming I have condemned them. Here's a bit of wisdom you either missed or are also in denial of in your christian belief system Matthew, the word of God never comes back void. Here's how Gods Word puts it as evidence that His word never comes back void nor can we hide from HIM. Hbr 4:12 For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart. Hbr 4:13 And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do. I guess to you they were substantive, to me they were just opportunities to bluster and waste bandwidth one post at a time so you could feel like you were contributing substantial content. But no actual absolute scientific information was proffered at all and you. And your posts are still there for independent confirmation of that fact. As long as you claim to be a believer and follower of Christ, yet spend your time defending the exact opposite of what His word teaches, I am going to call you the obvious hypocrite that you are. If you come here and admit that you're an atheist or at least a dedicated secular humanist who rejects the judeo-christian teachings in the Old and New Testaments my respect for you will rise considerably since you will be debating from an honest position. But as long as you spew the same old Secular humanist party line which is in perfect harmony with the atheist perspective, as you dishonestly claim to be a christian believer, then I am going to continue to prove you're a liar and a hypocrite. Evolution does IN FACT say that these stages of evolution did occur in that all life on land eventually evolved from creatures which came from the Sea. And those seas creatures evolved from proteins and microbes which were allegedly formed in the primordial ooze by way of some spontaneous form of random mutation. And for you to all of a sudden become a literalist when you are a generalist in every other aspect of the debate is just more evidence of your dishonesty regarding this sketchy issue. I've explained it twice now, the question is, will you admit your dishonesty in attempting to interpret my statement as you have. I would say the same thing to you if I thought it would make a difference, but you seem totally sold out to this man made lie and fairy tale which seeks to explain our creation apart from a personal and intelligent God. The question I have is how can you claim to believe in that Creator God as you deny and reject HIS explanation for how you came to be here? He says you were planned while you say you were a random accident of nature. Wrong again, THERE IS NO ABSOLUTELY RELIABLE EVIDENCE, SO THERE IS NOTHING WORTHY OF ACCEPTING. You mean you spent a lot of time giving your useless and prejudicial opinion which is anything but informed, reliable or objective. Big deal; your opinion and a dollar and I still can't buy a lousy coffee. Blah blah blah... How many times will the guy who can't even supply absolute evidence for what he claims is a valid and authoritative science, continue to tell me that it is I who doesn't understand it? How about we start with the fact that the real problem is that I am dealing with people who refuse to accept that their whole evolutionist belief system is based on an unprovable, unrepeatable and unverifiable house of cards which is NOT based in any factual data at all! How about you admit that you are too blind to recognize how weak and impossible what you claim to be reality is in reality? Sure you did. You said I was intellectually dishonest which implies I don't really believe the things I say here in defense of the positions I defend. When the fact is that you are the intellectually dishonest one, and that is undeniable since you claim to be a christian believer and follower of Christ as you defend an undeniably secular humanist gospel which attempts to explain how man came to be without any active or personal participation from the Judeo Christian Creator God spoken of in the bible you CLAIM to accept. You are the only intellectually dishonest one between us Matthew, and sadly, you are too blind to recognize it in yourself. I'm not attacking you Matthew. I am pointing out the obvious hypocrisy which you represent here as you claim to be one thing and defend another. Remember what Matthew 6:24 says Matt, No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. It's speaking directly to you. And one more thing Matt. It took me a while to get back to you because unlike you, I went to church today to fellowship with like minded believers and to worship my heavenly Father. I realize that wasn't an issue for you based on the time your post was submitted.

You stated that 'a fish crawled out of the ocean and survived long enough to turn into a mammal.' That is not a ""general"" statement. It is a gross over-simplification that glosses over millions upon millions of generational changes in order to characterize evolution as ridiculous. And of course, you begin by insulting my intelligence. That's a real ""Christian"" thing to do. Real loving, real kind. This post is so full of personal attacks -- on my intelligence, my honesty, my courage -- that I'm not going to dignify most of it with a response. It isn't the Bible that calls your opponents ""mental midgets,"" Archie. It isn't God who's insulting them as dishonest and cowardly. It's YOU. I am not ""defending the exact opposite of what His word teaches."" I am defending the opposite of what YOU SAY His word teaches. You indicated in a post over on the abortion thread that you sincerely don't understand the distinction between these two things. And that, I think, may be the root of the problem. Archie, I don't believe that I am a ""random accident of nature."" My view -- not the view that you attribute to me, but the view I actually hold (do you understand the difference?) -- is that humanity evolved, and that this is compatible with the active participation of a personal God in that whole evolutionary process. Would you mind not telling me what I think? So, let me get this straight. In addition to everything else that you know about me other than what I post on these boards, now you know my church's schedule of available worship services, too? Good grief.
