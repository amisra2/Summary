And when you constantly apply energy to a closed system.. that energy gets stored... and builds up.. and if conditions are right can manifests as chemical bonds, and increasing systems of chemical complexity... which is life. So.. lucky us... our planet was just right. so both.. evolution and creation can be right... its just that creation is a 3000 year old description... and so. primitive. and modern evolution does not recognise that a closed system with applied energy of specific quality..(like the earth) can have a predestination to develop life forms for reasons other than, mutation.... again... see....> createvolutionism argue with that. If you take the time, you may see, that it will end all these other arguments. -Mosheh Thezion","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","05:25 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","436"

Oh wait, you can't explain it. Which is why you guys even theorize alien origins for the first signs of life on primordial earth via exogenesis. Origin of life: Alien origin taken seriously? Ghost of Francis Crick smiles wanly According to Matthew Hutson at Popular Mechanics, ""5 Projects Ask if Life on Earth Began as Alien Life in Space"" (December 16, 2008): For years, scientists have considered the possibility of exogenesis, the idea that life arrived on Earth from another planet, and not just the building blocks of life, but organisms that were ready to rock and roll when they arrived. Its a Rube Goldberg scenario, however, dependent on several successful steps. First, life has to evolve on an alien planet. Then it must be blasted into space on a rock, probably from a large impact. Assuming it survives a long journey through harsh conditionsand makes its way into our neighborhoodlife then has to resist fiery atmospheric entry and a brutal landing before trying to make a new home for itself. Five projects. I wonder if the ghost of Francis Crick is their patron saint? (The double helix guy believed, controversially, that life must have come from outer space.) Colliding Universes: Origin of life: Alien origin taken seriously? Ghost of Francis Crick smiles wanly You remember Crick from earlier in the debate don't you? The guy who said that a 747 self constructing from the parts in a junk yard is more likely than life spontaneously appearing in a harsh and uninviting primordial earth. HERE'S MORE ON THAT SUBJECT: Origin of life: There must be life out there! vs. There can't be life out there! Robert Deyes provides a helpful summary of the see-saw between the belief that life must exist on other planets (inevitablists) and that it cannot (impossiblists): 'Life, Life Everywhere' was the title of a 1996 article in Scientific American that focused on the crucial question of whether the origins of life were truly an inevitable consequence of some fundamental natural tendency in the universe towards great complexity (Ref 2). From our modern stand point, it was really Fred Hoyle that challenged this 'inevitablist' school by proclaiming vehemently that, ""the emergence of a living cell from an inanimate chemical soup is about as likely as the assembly of a 747 by a whirlwind passing through a junkyard"" (Ref 2). So the modern 'improbabilist' was born, taking on the contrasting inevitabilist view in a head to head intellectual battle. While the inevitabilists used the sudden appearance of the cell almost 3.85 billion years ago (Ref 3) as evidence of life's inevitability, improbabilists such as the late Francis Crick proposed that life was unlikely to have arisen on earth and must have been seeded from outer space (Ref 2). After all if life were truly a rare phenomenon, space transportation networks would have been required to spread it around hospitable planets. Hmmm. The middle ground between inevitable and impossible is about as solid as the middle of a Lifesaver. Colliding Universes: Origin of life: There must be life out there! vs. There can't be life out there! SO WHAT IS IT YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT MAGIC PINFOLD? ARE YOU ACTUALLY ARGUING THAT YOUR MYTHICAL AND FALSE RELIGION OF EVOLUTION IS NOT FOUNDED IN THE BELIEF IN MAGIC?","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:01 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","439"

You said it lacked substance or something like that... As to your question you keep harping about, science is not always testable, and there is no a criteria for it to be. The scientific method is a set of rules for running an experiment. It is not necessary, however, to perform science. Science has theoretical branches as well that can never be tested. Many beliefs that you hold true are not testable. We cannot, for instance, prove the sun is present at any present instance in time. We can only prove that it has existed. As for evolution, we can make it painfully obvious through scientific study that evolution happens, we can run experiments to back it up, we can literally read the unwritten historical evidence, we can CONTROL evolution to produce desired outcomes. We can tinker with genetics and create desired results. We have an understanding of how these mechanisms work. We're not XXXXXX as human beings. Science is about finding patterns in nature. We use rules that we have discovered to predict outcomes of events. We can predict what we will find when we unearth an area of land. We go looking for a missing link, sometimes we find it. Sometime we don't. But NEVER have we found even one iota of evidence that evolution is false. Don't you think its about time we did...i mean, if evolution is a fairy tail and all? Again I stress that the only reason you don't believe in evolution is because your blind faith does not allow it. I'm not saying its a conscious decision on your part, you simply don't realize your blinded.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","12:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","441"

So I waited till something worth responding to was posted. And accipiters post asking for scientific evidence for supernatural occurrences was sufficiently ignorant as to demand a response. Ahh, then why do you constantly insist that evolution is a reliable and tested science based on rational conclusions when you now admit that it is a theoretical branch which can never be tested or proven to be sound? Not very consistent, or even truthful of you Db. Maybe in your simple mind this is a valid opinion. But not in my mind which knows absolutely that our Sun is a literal and testable 93 million miles from earth and is as consistent as the day is long. Pun completely intended, if you can grasp it. Really? This is your definition of science? And you say we can control evolution to produce desired outcomes which support evolutions claim that macroevolution is real and simply speaking, has actually led to man evolving from fish as evolution teaches occurred in reality? Would you produce evidence of extra-species evolution which shows that one species/type/genus of animal has evolved from another species/type/genus? Forgive my redundancy, but I have learned that I must be very precise in order to not allow your side the wiggle room to purposely misrepresent what I am asking you to prove. Speaking of patterns in nature and their interpretation by both sides of this debate; this raises an argument I have repeatedly made which has been widely ignored by you in this debate, and before you appeared here, by your cohorts. And that is that we creationists don't ignore or deny any of the physical observations you evolutionists see, at all. From fossils to the layers of strata they are found in, to geology, cosmology or quantum mechanics and physics. What we do is interpret those observations differently than you do. We see the fossil record as evidence that the various layers of strata and fossils were laid down quickly, The 1993 Midwest Floods and Rapid Canyon Formation in fact rapidly which explains why they have survived intact where as we have, and I have posted time lapse film of animals being completely consumed into non existence in less than a week in the wild today. Be it by insect consumption and scavengers carrying off the remains as shown here: YouTube - Rabbit decomposition (time-lapse video) in post 123 of this thread. Here is that post so you can read my complete argument from it: http://www.4forums.com/political/366776-post123.html You evolution apologists have no response to these realities as you imagine that the ancient dead animals just laid there, never decomposing or being consumed by scavengers as the earth slowly buried them perfectly intact for us to find in the distant future. So I ask again Db, who is it that is preaching magic and outrageous fairy tales in insisting that what you preach is even the least bit rational or reasonable? Wrong again Db, my faith is not blind at all. I have personally tested and questioned every single aspect of my world view. And since we both rely on faith in holding to what we believe, I know that He whom I rely is faithful, true and trustworthy since He is real and all encompassing. You, on the other hand are placing your faith in fallen and flawed Man in accepting the man made religion of evolution which is so inconsistent and irrational as to ignore known decomposition rates as they insist that the fossil record as they define it is rational at all. Get a clue my friend, you are not only lying to yourself, you are believing the lies and deceptions of others.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","01:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","443"
