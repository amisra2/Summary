The problem is that it does not involve a creator and is not a complete enough hypothesis to discard a creator. Exogenesis doesnt explain how life originated . It just supposes that it didnt originate on this planet.","trebor","368493","Uh.. you don't know what you are talking about.

That is all there is to it. They are not interested in your explanation because if it denies God it is WRONG. The theory of Evolution is a hypothesis that seems undeniable but it is not complete.

"09-06-2009","13107",31,"Databed","368264","Sure, I apologize. But we have posted plenty of evidence that should at least be considered. The fact is that is is not being considered, and I believe it is due to the reason listed above. I pose to Arch, just as he does to us, Biblical creation cannot be true due to the fact that we see no evidence ANYWHERE. There is no evidence of a global flood. There's not enough water to flood the world. There is no evidence for Adam and Eve. In fact, the simple fact that we have found pre-homo sapiens hominids already disproves this account. We see fossil evidence for animals existing way before any humans. The Bible contains absolutely NO information that was not commonly known at the time it was written. It doesn't include anything about other galaxies, solar systems, or even anything about the other 75% of the globe that had not yet been explored. It also contains nothing about dinosaurs or any of the extinct animals that had not been discovered. Shouldn't have God accounted for these things? I realize that Christians have explained away the age of the Earth by saying God is not temporal. This is not in the Bible I might add, but even if it was, didn't it take definitive proof of the age of the Earth before this was used by creationists to account for an old Earth? Maybe not exactly on the subject of creation, but relevant still: There is no evidence that God carved any stone tablets. In fact, it makes sense that people were deceived by Moses who would have been quite good at carving stone. He did, after all, come from Egypt where most of the stone carvings from the time originate. He would have had plenty of time, even according to the Bible, to obtain and create these tablets. Where is evidence for God's hand in any of this? Haven't many of the accounts and interpretations of the Bible been COMPLETELY disproven? The Earth is not the center of the universe. The Earth is not flat. The Earth is older than the Bible claims (not just creation accounts). etc etc History and the Bible do not always agree. Accounts of historical events from other civilizations often contain similar stories, and it is easy to speculate they have common origins, but often the Bible is not consistent with older accounts of the same events. I'm not exactly the most knowledgeable of the details of the Bible (I consider it historical myth), but I do know the basics. I'm sure your defense will in part be to pick apart these statements looking for discrepancies. You will probably ask for specifics, knowing full well what they are or at least what I'm referring to. So, can you you offer any proof that anything I have stated above is not true?","Archangel","368552","You personally haven't posted one iota of evidence at all on this complete thread since showing up, so I don't know what you mean by this all inclusive ""WE"" you speak of. Also, I have read the so called evidence and refuted what was worthy of responding to. I have told these mooks on numerous occasions that I don't respond to Talk Origin links which exists solely for the purpose of responding to every Creationist perspective with evolution talking points which do nothing but promote the very lies I have effectively refuted to the frustration of you and your cohorts. This is another untruth which is promoted by secular humanists and is founded in willful ignorance that there is another way to interpret all of the same geological evidence we all have access to. In fact the complete fossil record and the strata it is found in is accepted by creationists as evidence of the Great Flood. Our disagreement is not in the available evidence but in the interpretation of it which you stubbornly claim as proving your perspective but what I insist proves mine. So lets begin this exchange by agreeing that we both claim the same physical evidence which we interpret differently. You have no upper hand here regarding the physical evidence we observe in the natural world Db. Really? There is no genetic evidence for a common ancestor who is much more recent than 3 1/2 million years ago when evolution claims the earliest humans broke off from primates? I suppose you have never heard of the Mitochondrial Eve and biblical Eve are looking good: criticism of young age is premature The problem with debating you evolutionists is that you never bother even looking at the other side of the story. The bible is chock full of information that wasn't readily known at that time. The problem is it's too voluminous for me to outline for you. It would require actually studying it and educating yourself in order to discover the truth for yourself. Also, how many solar systems do you believe exist within our universe? He did. You are just too ignorant to know the contents of what the bible actually says. Because it does mention dinosaurs. They just weren't called dinosaurs when the bible was written. They were called Leviathan, Behemoth and Beasts. Here are the passages which describe them. Dinosaurs and the Bible You should stick to defending your religion rather than mine because I don't know what you're talking about here. What I can say is that Jesus Himself said that man has existed since the beginning of creation, and here's the passage where he says it in defense of how God has always believed in the unity between a man and a woman. Mar 10:5 And Jesus answered and said to them, ""Because of the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept. Mar 10:6 But from the beginning of the creation, God 'made them male and female.' [fn] Mar 10:7 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, Of course Db, Moses is a scam artist now, rather than one of Israel's great Patriarchs. And he duped a whole generation of Jews to follow him for 40 years in the wilderness. And don't forget the fire which led them by night and the smoke which led them by day, and let's not forget the manna which fell from heaven to feed them. And let's not forget about when he struck a rock with his Rod and water flowed from it. That Moses was such a trickster Db. The 10 commandments were the least of Gods miracles through him sonny boy. And you obviously have no idea what his life represented for you to have made such a shallow and ignorant statement. No, in fact just the opposite is true. Here again, educate yourself: Archeological evidence regarding the Bible More generalizations and unsupported claims without even one bit of actual evidence. Rather than posting meaningless opinions, give me something to respond to, ok? I have offered proof refuting the specific claims you have raised here. But when you say you're not exactly knowledgeable about the bible, that's an understatement. Be specific and I will too.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:27 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","462"

Certainly not as comprehensively as the aristotlian view of the universe was disproved.
