You can see evidence of evolution everywhere form the animals we breed to the fossil evidence to bacteria which evolve resistance to antibiotics. No test to prove evolution takes place? Why test something that humans make happen every day?","Archangel","368097","How can I be expected to reason with someone with such a limited understanding of their own spiritual make up that they persistently just mouth ignorant atheistic drivel and talking points. You call God magic when God condemns all forms of magic and occult practices in His word. Evidently you don't appreciate the difference between the supernatural and magic. Great, now we're getting somewhere, just post where Darwin proved MICRI-EVOLUTION ever occurred at anytime and you win this whole debate. Isn't that easy accipiter? Or else you can go educate yourself about what evolution actually claims compared to what is evident in reality, and then either remain in ignorant denial or change your views like a grown up does when they leave childish things behind. Again my ignorant friend, just show any animals which are evidence of micro-evolution which we have observed evolve from one species into another, or produce evidence that we have engineered/bred into one species from another. Go on accipiter, you can win this debate in short order if you can only back up your claims according to what evolution claims has occurred, yet cannot prove or show in the real world. If humans make micro-evolution happen every day then your job is done and you will win this debate and finally shut this egregiously ignorant christian up. Just post a couple of links which prove science has genetically evolved a reptile into a mammal or a protein into an insect even, and you have exposed my ignorance. In other words accipiter, the goal is cross species pro-generation. Make it happen or prove that it has and you win the debate. But what you will find after an endless search is that none of that has happened because micro-evolution has never happened and never will. So that leaves the question, then how does the so called science of evolution claim that all life spontaneously evolved from the original protein/enzyme which miraculously appeared in that proverbial puddle of primordial ooze. Talk about MAGIC? Your secular humanist religion of evolution is founded upon it.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","02:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","375"

I have been discussing the impossibility of macroevolution occurring throughout this whole debate and have likened microevolution to rapid adaptation which does occur in nature. What hasn't occurred and never will is one species of animal evolving into another species which I did explain in the post in which I mistakingly used the term micro rather than macroevolution.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","06:00 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","66"

Two populations of fruit flys were separated and kept in separate environments and fed different food. After many generations these fruit flys were brought together and it was found that only flys from the same environment would mate. Given enough time they would become separate species unable to mate.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","08:16 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","68"

And by that I assume you mean that the fruit fly evolved into something other than a fruit fly, right? It was no longer a member of the same genus of creature at all, but had evolved into another type of fly other than a fruit fly? Is that what you're saying? In other words, Fruit flies are properly named Drosophila melanogaster, so their genus is Drosophila and their species is Drosophila melanogaster. There are a bunch of similar kinds of flies that are in different species, and so would have a different two-part name, but would all be Drosophila. Are you saying that after many generations one group of these fruit flies had evolved into a new and unique genus? If so, please produce evidence of this if you can.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","08:36 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","162"

Or do you already see the holes in your evidence? For example, doesn't your evidence show that all of the segregated fruit fly populations remained fruit flies at the end of the experiment? All be it flies which preferred other flies with the same diet? Diane Dodds fruit fly experiment suggests that isolating populations in different environments (e.g., with different food sources) can lead to the beginning of reproductive isolation. These results are consistent with the idea that geographic isolation is an important step of some speciation events. Evidence for speciation As you can see, the result of this experiment promotes the idea of reproductive isolation. The rest of the claims are nothing more than the idea that isolation might lead to some speciation events. But nothing is concluded in absolute terms at all. This just confirms the giant leaps made with little or no actual evidence upon which they are based, at all. With that said, I must ask you, in what valid science is an ""IDEA"" conclusive evidence of any absolute fact at all?","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:31 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","210"

We are mythbusters who refuse to allow you to propagate your religions lies and misrepresentations regarding the origin of life on earth. And that's no fun for you, is it! Macroevolution is an unprovable myth which cannot be supported by science since it has never occurred either in nature or in the laboratory.

Rather than just dealing with the alleged science they are supposedly discussing.

Here's a thought tq; what if T.O., being a legitimate source of scientific info as you assert, actually considered all interpretations of the scientific evidence on evolution with an open and objective mind and attitude as science is supposed to work? You know, instead of having the us against them attitude which they profoundly represent in such a condescending fashion in every page they write? They are no different than Hanoi Jane in their stated agenda to oppose, dismantle, demoralize and if possible defeat everyone who opposes evolution in the court of public opinion. That isn't science, it is advocacy, plain and simple. My falsehoods? I doubt that the opposing pro-evolution powers that be would create any site just to stand against lil ole me. No tq, they exist to stand against a complete school of thought which legitimately interprets the available observations we all make differently than your secular humanist interpretation allows for. Here is a list which T.O. calls ""Creationist Claims"" which they state before spewing their propaganda. An Index to Creationist Claims So you see; they don't exist to promote pure science at all, the exist to oppose any and all who question their results as is obvious by their dedicated goal of attacking the opposition in a condescending way before even discussing their stated so called science. You mean the other allegations they contrive in order to support the lies and myths they represent? Those citations? I'm not impressed tq. You actually believe that if five people come forward and support your lie then your lie must be true. That in a nut shell is what the evolution community represents in reality. You see, it doesn't matter how many advocates you dig up to support your myth of evolution, it will never succeed in erasing the living God from truly existing and having created all life as we know it, in reality. Here is an example of the crux of the circular reasoning T.O. represents. This link goes to the claim of Darwin's racism: CA005.1: Darwin's racism Notice how it links not to Darwin's book ever, to show the original referred to quotes as evidence that creationists claims are false, which the claims are based upon, but links back to other T.O. pages in a circular pattern which never gets you out of T.O. into any real objective scientific sources which supports their defense in any real or significant way. And where are those famous citations in that example, you refer to TQ? Cuz I don't see them because the links go no where at all. Weird huh? Or is it just typical and to be expected from this fraud of a propaganda site. Every time I have attempted to use T.O. in order to trace back to the actual roots of the so called evidence they are proposing, I have found myself in this endless loop of self supporting propaganda. But never have I been able to go deeper into scientific understanding which is founded in actual evidence. It is a smoke screen of shallow justifications which are self serving and bogus at their core. And what is truly scary is that you believers in T.O. and evolution are so dumbed down that you can't even recognize what this promoter and defender of a pseudo scientific fraud represents in reality. And I challenge you to confront and disprove what I am pointing out here by linking to a claim above and showing that it links to hard and fast evidence within its explanation of the question being investigated.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","675"
