The problem is that we KNOW where the ERVs came from. We see them being inserted into a host's DNA. There are many many examples I could have given here to show how DNA is related between species and also how evolution can explain these similarities and differences. The reason I chose this example is because it takes the creator out of the equation. To STILL claim the creator put them in species' DNA means that the creator must have recruited an army of viruses to go around to every species and implant the exact same DNA in the exact same spot within the species' genome and to do so to every animal that existed at the time in such a way as to make it appear that they are all related in such a way that the only explanation becomes isolated groups branching off and that they are no longer sharing genes, aka speciation . You must convince me that the ERVs are NOT the result of retroviruses. That is your only possible argument to debunk this as evidence for evolution, so that's what you have to do.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","05:49 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","541"
"09-10-2009","13107",37,"unkerpaulie","369073","One of the recurring themes of the creationist position is that since science doesn't provide conclusive proof for anything (or for most things), then we should reject science and accept what the bible says because the bible is equally incapable of providing supporting proof, but at least with the bible you tell yourself that you will go to heaven when you die (another view incapable of bein proven).","obvious_child","369126","Do you believe there is any value to talking to Archie other than to remind yourself of what happens when you stop using your brain and never get an education?","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","11:11 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","542"

Then why haven't you posted any absolute evidence of the bolded? You are confusing us just discovering that this indefinable Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) exist, with understanding why they work as they do, and why they exist at all in the order they exist in. This is the problem with every aspect of evolutionary science. We are constantly discovering new things via observation, but we are completely incapable of explaining how or why they work as they do which is why we can't replicate or recreate them in a lab. THEN DO IT AND STOP TALKING ABOUT IT. SHOW ME WHY RATHER THAN JUST INSIST THAT EVIDENCE EXISTS. They can explain what happens in many cases but not how and why Db. And until you can offer me more evidence than just your opinion, all you are giving me is lip service like the other evolutionists around here. You are rambling again, and speaking convoluted gibberish Db. Let me offer a metaphor which will clarify my point. Imagine that every different form of life is a different type and quality of computer designed and created by God. Where as insects have the computing power of simple calculators, the more advanced the creature, the more advanced the computing machine leading to the human being which is represented by a super computer. Now, every computer which serves to define every varied type of life on earth have many of the same components in them. It's just that those more complex life forms have more components which the simpler life forms don't have. I mean, even a calculator has a memory chip and a chip to organize its functions, not to mention a simplified yet definite motherboard. Just as a super computer does and an intermediate level computer. Well, so it is with Gods creation. Many of the same genetic components which define the lower animals also define we human beings. But what matters and counts in the end is that we are the apex of life on earth and no other creature, though by your own theory are what we evolved from which means that they were here first. Yet here we are as the ultimate life form on earth. The question is, why haven't these creatures which existed long before primates ever walked on 2 legs ever advance as we have to become higher, complex thinking creatures with imaginations and creativity as humans have. Surely they have had the time. Now I know those who preach the evolution party line will take offense to my description of evolution, and God knows they hate it when I ask common sense questions like these, but when all is said and done, humans/homo anything were the last and latest forms of life to evolve in the form of primates. So my simplified summation for the sake of time, stands and the question remains, why only human beings have the higher functions which only we possess, again just as Genesis says we were created to have? Chew on this and get back to me.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","11:23 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","543"

"09-11-2009","13107",37,"Databed","369202","You clearly do not understand this enough to refute it in a way that makes sense. I simplified this into - The reason I made it this simple is because it is so extremely likely that ERVs are the result of retro-viral DNA polluting the genome of its host. The DNA sequences known as ERVs match those that result when a retrovirus inserts its DNA into a host cell DNA. The burden of proof falls to you. I have my evidence, where is yours? This one is so incredibly easy. Have you never heard of homo-erectus? Homo Habilus? Homo Ergaster? Neandertal? There are many others. These are all human! We have found non-homo sapiens bones of hominid ancestors...these are DIFFERENT SPECIES OF HUMAN! They existed, there is no way out of it, we found their bones, We found tools (1) they made and evidence of complex social interactions (1) . We even find evidence of interactions between Neandertals and modern humans. Now comes in survival of the fittest. They were not as fit to survive as modern humans and were pushed to extinction. This is perfectly inline with evolution. Further, given the extremely selfish nature of modern human and the fact we want to kill people for having different beliefs, different interests or just so we can take their stuff, it makes a lot of sense that we would kill off an entirely different species just for being different. You know what this is? Think again, it is not homo sapiens! Maybe you look (and possibly think) something like this guy, but not me. (1) Just to emphasize, this is a sign of intelligence","Archangel","369248","This is what I find so humorous about you guys. And this picture is a perfect example of it. You consider all of these different classes of HOMO-whatevers to be different stages of human evolution. Well they aren't. What they are is extinct apes/monkeys which you evo mooks classify as different levels of human evolution. But once again, you can't prove it either. These are just more evolutionist claims which are unsupported by any real and verifiable evidence what so ever. In fact even your evidence refutes your claim. Here is a link which speaks to the DNA retrieved from your uncle Neanderthal, which you spell neandertal in order to sound more informed and intelligent. http://www.jqjacobs.net/anthro/paleo/neanderthal.html Here's an excerpt: DNA was extracted for the type specimen and the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence was determined. This sequence was compared to living human mtDNA sequences and found to be outside the range of variation in modern humans. Age estimation of the Neanderthal and human divergence is four times older than the age of the common mtDNA ancestor of all living humans. The authors suggest that the Neanderthals went extinct without contribution to the present mtDNA of modern humans. So why again do you claim that Neanderthal is a human ancestor? And show me with genetic evidence that all of those other classifications of homos are actually our evolutionary ancestors if you can. I am just so sick of the unproven claims and insistence that you guys are right when nothing you say actually survives the most basic scrutiny of a christian who is unschooled in the sciences just as you are. And no comment regarding my beautiful metaphor regarding the computer components explaining the genetic similarities between all life forms I see.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","04:51 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","551"

"09-11-2009","13107",37,"None","None","None","Databed","369259","Nice try Arch. Actually, since you brought it up, the mitochondrial DNA extracted from the Neandertal that you speak of shows conclusively that Neandertal and modern humans do indeed share a common ancestor. They even estimate that the common ancestor existed around 600,000 years ago. Im sure now that you know the science behind it goes against your argument, you will refute the science instead of using it for your purposes as you attempted above. Neandertal DNA Also, we never believed that modern humans evolved from Neandertals. Even without DNA comparisons it was obvious that we evolved along parallel lines. I think you knew this and if you didn't, then you are ignorant to things you don't want to understand. I'm still waiting on any evidence that ERVs are not the result of retroviral insertions. I also expect you will of course show some scientific evidence which shows that the DNA we found in Neandertals does not indicate a common ancestor with modern humans.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:16 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","553"
