"09-04-2009","13107",29,"gansao","368272","Point taken....but to Christian creationists somethings are not negotiable .Man was created by God and the Bible is the word of God. They will state quite correctly that science is an approximation..and that is as easy for them to demonstate as disproving the Bible as a true account of the creation is for science. What happens during these 'debates' is that a bitchfest starts, tempers fray and insults abound. Also the Bible does not state that the Earth is flat, nor that it is the centre of the universe neither does it state the age of the Earth. Dont you know that?","trebor","368294","Well, yes, the bible does state the world is more like a bowl, and the stars are stuck in a dome covering the earth. As for what the creationists want to believe, what the bible said, and what is reality are three distinct things. The denial of reality by the creationists is very telling.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","04:43 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","421"

"09-05-2009","13107",29,"Archangel","368358","Beside that, you would think trebor would know better by now than to just post a source that rips verses out of context in order to make claims the bible never meant to make. For example, does the earth tumble through space with no direction, or has He fixed the earth firm, immovable. on its path, just as 1 Chronicles 16:30 says?","Penfold","368377","From the author's limited viewpoint, the earth WAS ""fixed and immovable"", while everything else revolved around it. From your limited viewpoint, cherrypicking snippets which tangentially coincide with reality does not convince anyone but yourself.

Can you supply any evidence that is not connected to the bible in some way? I think not.","Archangel","368401","The reason why we require different standards of evidence for evolution as compared to the Genesis account of Creation is because Creation is a spiritual explanation which admittedly required supernatural intervention, where as your evolution claims to be an actual science which is based upon real and verifiable evidence which claims to proves that when people like me reject your supposedly proven evidence, then that in itself is allegedly solid evidence of our ignorance. WHY? Because we are allegedly denying real and true evidence which you evos have supplied. AGAIN, I SAY ALLEGEDLY!!! Because throughout this debate your side has not only not provided any real and verifiable evidence of your supposed science, but you have run away from every valid question I have asked in regards to the massive gaps and holes which permeate its very fragile facade. Not one of you has answered why your science doesn't follow the established rules of science as outlined here: Scientific Method Uses Experiments and Controls: Good Experiments and Controls Generate Valid Scientific Conclusions | Suite101.com in spite of me asking for the 4th time now. All I get is more ignoring of my questions. Why? Because you really don't care about meeting real and true scientific standards. NONE OF YOU!!! Neither have you dealt with the undeniable FACT that the modern day conclusions you have built your complete philosophy on cannot be supported by any facts regarding what you assume, imply and assert occurred 4.5 BILLION YEARS AGO when you CLAIM original life first SPONTANEOUSLY APPEARED ON EARTH. Nor can any experiments in any lab reproduce with repeatable consistency any experiments, WITH CONTROLS, which confirm any of the claims evolution makes. Yet you all sit here and continue to insist that what you are promoting is based in FACT! Well I would like to see some actual evidence that what you claim is true today, is based on anything real that actually occurred this alleged 4.5 billion years ago. Until then, all you are spouting is an unprovable man made myth which cannot be verified by science or else you guys, and I don't mean you accipiter because you have no clue about what is even being discussed. But your cohorts would have actually answered my questions if they had answers. But they don't so the issue is moot at this point. I am wasting my time attempting to reason with people who are so blinded by the lies they have adopted, it appears useless to even try.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","04:14 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","435"
