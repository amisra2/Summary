It was a statement of fact which defined the shallowness of your insults and the ignorance of their substance. It is your insulting response which is childish.

"08-14-2009","13107",4,"Archangel","365405","I already did explain the obnoxious childs dishonesty accipiter. You really need to read the posts before embarrassing yourself asking ridiculous questions. The ignorance that child contributes here is enough for any 5 forums, much less this ONE. You notice that this liar never actually supported his claim that I ever ARGUED THAT GOD IS AN EPIC LIAR!!! But that never stopped him from making the dishonest claim, did it? So my question for you is this; why would you even rely on such a liar to make any type of valid point at all when he isn't even connected to reality which he proves in every single post in which he corrupts and perverts what another member says by completely misinterpreting what he says?","Accipiter","365408","Has god left signs of himself in the physical world that we humans can see aside from the bible?","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","06:43 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","51"

"08-14-2009","13107",4,"Archangel","365305","You call your statements above, arguments? Why can you post nothing more than insulting and nonsensical drivel yet when I comment on it I am just making childish insults? Why the hypocrisy and double standards in every debate with you deniers of God and His truths? Why can you make the most ignorant and irrational statements from the spiritual perspective, and feel intelligent for it, yet when I call your statements ignorant and shallow, I am being childish and insulting? This just proves that your side has no sense of fair play, honor or justice as you blindly assume that your thinking is correct when you deny the spiritual aspect of your own nature, and actually believe that you are intelligent for doing that. Talk about denying ones own nature and reality, you people epitomize it. Yet it is supposedly me who is lacking arguments?","unkerpaulie","365412","This is funny. YOU are the one who assumes that your thinking is correct. Your knowledge of the universe is no more advanced than that of ancient goat rustlers because you choose to stop learning anything beyond what they knew, just as accipiter pointed out. You sound foolish when you debate these topics because you know nothing about science, just like these ancient wanderers did. You don't even have the ability to articulate proper arguments because you're trained to resort to ""goddidit"" and ""my god can beat up your god"" because that's all you know. And yet you feel snug and happy in your ingorance because you tell yourself that your god likes his people to be dumb mindless childish sheep that are unable to think, because those are the kind of people he wants with him in heaven, just like his mythical angels are nothing but dumb drones that follow him around constantly bow before him. If that's the kind of people heaven will be populated with I'm glad I won't be going there.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:46 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","54"

Yet in his bible he says that the world is only a few thousand years old. That's a big fat lie.

What you will be so shocked to learn one day is that it is your interpretation which is corrupted and a perversion of Gods truth so you will be held responsible for that, not God who has given you the truth. We believers in Him and His word interpret the available evidence very differently than you atheists and secular humanists do, so there is a rational opposing option to your interpretation. But your side doesn't see or recognize that as valid or even worth considering. In your arrogance you just assume that we are in denial of the facts which appear so obvious to you.

Then, that old stone age passage which says that ""the wisdom of God is foolishness to Man"" will finally make sense to you as it sinks in that you were that foolish man who denied Gods truths in favor of your preference for the big lie and the spiritual darkness which blinds you into believing that your finite intellect trumps God eternal knowledge and wisdom which He has so graciously shared with you in His word. You have proven that your thinking is no more rational than obvious childs in that you are defending his position that God is a liar based on your incorrect interpretation of the available observations Man deduces through science. Especially since nothing at all has been proven absolutely according to anyone. You fail to acknowledge that you place as much faith in your secular beliefs as I do in my spiritual beliefs. The only difference is My faith is in the eternal God of Creation while yours is placed in fallen and finite Man. That is why you're on the losing side of this issue when all is said and done.

"08-14-2009","13107",4,"None","None","None","Matthew","365426","May I chime in here a moment? I'm a religious person, and a theist. On the other hand, I'm not a creationist and I'm deeply opposed to Biblical literalism in general. Two things. First, why has Archie been allowed to hijack this thread? Accipiter's original request has been drowned out among the hoopla. We shouldn't fall for this, any more than a congressman or senator should fall for the disruptive tactics being employed at town hall meetings. Put him on ignore if you have to, but whatever you do, don't take the bait. Second, as to that original point, my own experience has been rather ironic on this score, I suppose: the single most effective thing to use in arguing against creationism is the Bible itself . After all, creationists typically claim a Biblical basis for the views. So rather than confronting them with something external to that basis -- which is all too easy for them to dismiss -- confront them with that basis itself. The fact is, the book of Genesis has two versions of the creation story, not one -- and they're not consistent with one another. In the first, humans are created after animals, and no temporal order is provided for the creation of the human sexes. In the second, Adam is created first, then all the animals (as God works through a trial-and-error process of making the first man a partner, without success), and then finally Eve is created. So were humans created last or (at least in part) first? It simply cannot be both. And then we have the historical information about the text. The second of the two stories was actually the first to be recorded, during the reign of Solomon in the 10th century BCE. It has a stunningly anthropomorphic conception of God in many ways -- God breathes, he walks, he has to call out to Adam and Eve to find them. And he creates in very ""hands-on"" fashion, pulling Adam from the earth and Eve from Adam The first story was recorded much later, following the period of the Babylonian Exile. Jewish identity was maintained in Babylon through such practices as circumcision, inter-marriage rules, and the rigorous observance of the Sabbath -- and this last practice is provided theological justification in the retelling of the creation story. God himself is depicted not as a manual craftsman, but as speaking things into being. (And if any creationist ever provides a mechanism for how that could work, they'd at least be on the way to creation ""science."" I'm not holding my breath.) Historically speaking, one thing that is also abundantly clear is that the the books of the Pentateuch, including Genesis, and including the two creation accounts, were not written by Moses, despite tradition. And of course, if one wants to make that authorial attribution, then one has the additional problem of explaining why a single author would compose two mutually inconsistent accounts of the same event. I have seen people get very uncomfortable with this. Most, I think, aren't even really aware of the problems, and when confronted with it they get defensive. What I try to do is point out to them that even though these stories cannot both be literally true, they can still reveal truths about God in relation to the world, rooted in personal experiences of ancient believers and expressed in terms pertinent to those experiences. I try to point them to a middle path, where giving up literalism doesn't mean giving up faith. Obviously, those who are atheists or agnostics won't necessarily want to encourage people to hold on to their religious beliefs! But I would recommend that, even if you don't wish to promote Christianity in particular or religion more generally, observing that abandoning literalism isn't equivalent to abandoning religion altogether can still be an effective tactic at overcoming their creationist views. Even if it doesn't work right away, it may bear fruit later. It might also be good to remember that much of the scholarship on which non-literalist interpretation is based pre-dates Darwin and occurred within the Church, not without. Throughout the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Biblical scholars in European universities (especially in Germany) delved into the textual and historical issues pertaining to the holy scriptures, and many theologians explored their consequences. It is that exploration that we can thank for liberal theology on the one hand, but also for literalism on the other. Darwin was, in a sense, just the icing on the cake. Just my two cents.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","11:56 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","58"

Its not an atheist vs theist issue. Its a bias vs honesty issue. Its called bias, and its almost always irrational. Snce you already believe you are right in advance, you don't need to be rational. Your ""facts"" are merely what you read in the bible, which you presume is the word of God because you also read that in the bible. Even theists know better than to assume that what's written in the bible can be more factual than cold hard reality. Speaking of which, why do you love to end your arguments by talking about the ""reality"" that will befall us atheists ""one day""? What does reality matter anyway? If you're already convinced of what you believe in despite what reality is today, then being awakened ""one day"" should be a none issue to you. You're the one calling your god a liar. You say that god made the universe and the evidence we can observe around us. You say that god made the earth a few thousand years ago. These both things you derive from reading the bible. Yet these both things contradict each other, so both cannot be true.
