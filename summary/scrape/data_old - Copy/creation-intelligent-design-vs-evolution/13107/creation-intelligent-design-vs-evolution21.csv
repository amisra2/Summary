"08-31-2009","13107",21,"Matthew","367693","That's an example of technology, which works despite the fact that the scientific ideas upon which it rests are not ""absolute."" No science, including chemistry and physics, is ""absolutely"" proved. Newtonian physics is close enough to the truth that we got to the moon with it. ""Close enough"" -- but ultimately not ""absolutely"" true. And Einstein's ideas are closer still, especially at astronomically large scales but even at more everyday sizes. The thing is, the math is a lot more complicated, and at everyday sizes there's not enough difference between the Einsteinian and Newtonian calculations to be worth the headache. Beyond that, it's worth noting that even Einstein's principles are not ""absolutely"" true. In fact, they even conflict with the principles of Quantum Mechanics. And yet, both relativity and QM get used to make interesting technological devices that we use all the time, like GPS onboard maps and the computer that I'm typing at right now. You will counter that there is no such parallel in the world of evolutionary biology. I will counter in turn that -- for but one example -- evolution explains why the antibiotic Clindamycin, which kills bacteria, can also be used to kill the non-bacterial malaria parasite Plasmodium . For details, see yet another excellent book by Carl Zimmer, Parasite Rex . That makes four books from just that author alone that I've recommended to you in the past few days. There are others that could be mentioned. But here's the rub. Not one of them contains ""absolute"" proof of evolution. For that's not how science works -- not how any science works, not just evolution. If what you demand is ""absolute"" proof before acceptance, then as I pointed out the other day -- and it was not the juvenile point you characterized it as -- then you won't be able to accept any science. And especially not sciences that attempt to reconstruct the past, including archaeology and forensic science. You're setting the bar too high -- and higher, in fact, than scientists even claim to have set it. Of course, I don't think faith provides ""absolute"" proof, either. That's part of why it's a leap. But for what it's worth, I don't think this non-absolute leap must be incompatible with the non-absolute inferences of natural science, either. Which is why I accept evolution, despite the fact that I'm not a ""secular humanist.""","Archangel","367712","This is just plain and simply not true as you attempt to explain why you are unable to justify your modern day conclusions which attempt to establish evolution as a valid science while ignoring the FACT that it is built upon a foundation of unproven and unverifiable assumptions. In any scientific endeavors which have resulted in end products or workable theories which produce positive results such as your example, the moon landing, we know for certain that until scientists understood the core/foundational values upon which they built their program, they never went on to the next step and so on and so on. Each level of the science had to be tested, proven repeated and then built with multiple redundant systems in case of incremental failures. Tell me how any of these scientific practices have ever or can ever be practiced with evolution when it is impossible to even test how life spontaneously began since we can't even determine which chemical processes existed under which, if any conditions existed at that time more than this alleged 4 billion years ago which also can't be verified or confirmed for certain. What I am saying is that it is impossible to build a workable theory when the very foundation of the theory is non-existent. Why can't you, one who claims to respect the legitimate scientific methodology not recognize the obvious problems which undoubtedly and unquestionably exist with the so called science of evolution? And how can you even call it a science when its very foundation is built upon nothing more than the speculations and assumptions of scientists who can't test, reproduce, confirm or prove any of the basic functions upon which the final conclusions are based? It just doesn't work that way in the real world of legitimate science. Did Ford start to build the Model A before he had a working model which met the required level of reliability for that generation? Does any company produce any product based on the required science before they understand the core values of that science and prove that it results in a reliable product? Of course not. Yet here you are attempting to get me to accept this so called science when you have so much as admitted that nothing which evolution is based upon is provable at all. So my question is, why does tester say that it is I who is egregiously ignorant? Because that conclusion makes no sense based on all that we don't know and cannot even discern occurred at all as evolution science assumes it did.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","04:58 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","301"

That you don't understand this only further demonstrates how ignorant you are. Seriously! I've seen numerous posters try unsuccessfully to reach by analogy, but here goes: Prior to the 1950's, do you think there was enough scientific evidence to demonstrate Earth's annual revolution about Sun? Please recognize that nobody actually saw Earth hurling through space, yet the heliocentric model was well established based on inferences from many observations. The fact of biological evolution has been established by the same inductive scientific process. Sure the exact distribution of mass influenced how the planets came to be, but you don't need to know that to determine that they do indeed revolve around Sun (or strictly speaking, the center of mass, if you prefer).","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","06:10 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","303"

Because as far as I see it, the fundamental assumptions of evolutionary biology are no different than those of any other science. What specifically are you saying is problematic? True! But what you seem to be missing here is this: the scientists in question must ""understand the core/foundational values upon which they build their program"" only well enough to get that program to work. They do not need to understand it "" absolutely ."" Again, what do you mean by ""for certain?"" If what you are after is a conclusion that ""absolutely"" cannot , under any circumstances, ever be overturned, then that is something that the natural sciences cannot give you, nor do they claim to. Such is the nature of the inductive reasoning upon which they are based. It's always possible for new evidence to overturn an old idea. It's always possible for a new idea to explain more than an old idea. As I said, I think you've set the bar too high. Sciences don't produce absolute truths. What are these ""obvious problems which undoubtedly and unquestionably exist?"" Could you list a few? And if I sincerely think that there are problems with these problems, may I attempt to say what I think they are? Again, what do you mean by ""final conclusions?"" No conclusion offered by the natural sciences is ever ""final."" Anything can be challenged, and might someday turn out to have been wrong. And again, what are these speculations and assumptions? And what is the ""required level of reliability"" when it comes to scientific theories? ""Absolute"" irrefutability? Not to be had by any empirical science. I have not said that evolution is unprovable. I have said that it is not absolutely provable. After going through the post, and my responses thus far, there are two things I would like to know. 1. First, what do you mean by terms like ""proved"" or ""verified,"" ""certain"" or ""absolute?"" 2. Second, what are the ""assumptions"" or ""speculations"" -- or other faillings, whatever they may be -- that you think undermine evolutions claims to be a ""scientific"" theory? And are they related to the issues in point (1)?","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","304"
"08-31-2009","13107",21,"tester","367643","Thanks for sharing your perspective, marc9000. I think you make some valid points, and I've benefitted from reading your point of view. At the same time, however, my take is that Archangel consistently demonstrates such profound ignorance about science, coupled with bold arrogance, that I'm not surprised to see so many (myself included) exhibit exasperation. In my opinion, Archangel is in the minority in this thread for good reason: because he is ignorant and anti-rational. Whereas I'm typically sympathetic to the plight of those in the minority, precisely for the reasons you've described, I don't think individuals, such as Matthew, should remove themselves from the discussion just because they are in the majority. Rather than adding one more frustrated voice to the ""gang"" opposing Archangel, I think he has set a new standard on these forums. I sincerely believe I would feel the same way were he to argue a point with which I disagreed. (For example, I am indeed an atheist, yet I have no doubt that I would enjoy, and benefit from, reading his motives for being Christian.) Essentially, I don't understand your ultimate point: you seem to be saying that Archangel's discourse is superior to Matthew's because Matthew is part of the majority, rather than the value of his actual writing. Please correct me if I'm wrong.","marc9000","367724","Thanks. That's your opinion and that's fine. I don't completely agree because this is far from the only thread he (or I) have been in the minority in. We're in the minority because we're creationists . That he or I are ignorant about science may say more about your definition of science than it does about our ignorance. Who is really authorized to say where the line is drawn between science and philosophy? I don't know about setting a new standard (4forums has had lots of good posters - so many of them have disappeared) but I agree with you completely that he's a good poster. But not only in post 241, but in 250 and 253 also, he cozys up to posters that are here to do nothing but initiate flame wars. IMHO he would have better credibility if he didn't do that. The words he posts are by far good enough. Don't you think it's possible that attempts to harmonize with other posters could be a sign of weakness? I'm really saying their discourse is/could be equal, depending on the point of view of the reader. Matthew's (somewhat emotional) harmonizing with others gives lots of advantages. Another example - if Matthew quits posting, and Archangel keeps going at it with 5 or 6 others, no one declares that Matthew has ""lost"". Yet if Archangel quits posting, 6 or 7 posters then agree that he has ""lost"" that he couldn't refute their arguments. These are free-for-all forums and I'm not saying anything should be done about it, but it's something that I think needs to be pointed out from time to time.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:56 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","305"
"08-31-2009","13107",21,"None","None","None","iangb","367725","Archangel, if your claim is that evolution is not a science because it has no practical applications today, you're going to have to drastically redefine your definition of 'evolution'. Today, computer chips are designed by evolution - so-called ' genetic algorithms '. This article lists - and cites - some of the many further uses of genetic algorithms. More directly and biologically, the medical profession have to deal with drug-resistant or antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria, which have evolved to become immune to current medicines. All of these meet the basic tenant of evolution - that random variation followed by selection results in improvement. There are even more basic examples - the that we share a common ancestor is the reason that drugs can be tested on animals, and our understanding of hereditary effects allows us to make transplants that are less likely to be rejected. That evolution has many applications is a proven fact. We can't tell you the specifics about the precise location and composition of the first proto-life (though we're working on it), but that isn't too relevant - or necessary.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","08:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","306"
"08-31-2009","13107",21,"obvious_child","367651","And how do you define that? Arch makes a dumb argument, we refute it civilly and then he throws insults. That sounds like initiating incivility to me. Unless you think that Archie can do no wrong... You did. You accused the family who filed a lawsuit against a california county to remove a cross atheist. Except they were Jewish. And you had previously stated that Jews and Christians worship the same God. Therefore, as you stated that the family was atheist, then by association their God which is your God is not a God, and since it's not a God and you reject all others, you are an atheist by your own argument. I pointed this out and you later admitted you screwed up, which I commended you for. Notice how I backed it up. Archie never does this. Ever. Where did I say you said the sky was red? Perhaps you have mistaken my comments on the false dichotomies of Creationism for something else?","marc9000","367726","I don't think you can link me anywhere here where he was the first to insult, without being insulted first. If you can find a thread like that, I'll bet I could find another thread only a few days previous where he was receiving insults. Several years here have made him a more hardened poster. All anyone has to do is read the first 20 or 30 posts of the Why Homophobic thread to see exactly why. It is typical of so many of his (and my) opponents actual disdain for free speech.

"08-31-2009","13107",21,"obvious_child","367653","Oh God, not this stupid argument again . Solid arguments can destroy infinite number of opponents. And yes I know what your position is like. I was on a creationist board before and everyone who tried to argue with me and a few others was annihilated to the point where they pulled archie like insults and banned us because they could not deal with our arguments. This is typical of YEC boards. They gang up and they lose and they resort to banning. Do not attribute your failures to your opponent when the failures are clearly of your own design. That's massive rejection of personal responsibility. And this mattes how again? Archie makes bad arguments, as do you. You fail to recognize that the problem isn't the number of people posting against you, it's the number of bad arguments you give. If 50 people screamed at you that 5+5 was not 10, would that make you wrong when you could conclusive prove that you were right? The fact that your group has to resort to god awful insults that would get you banned on any other forum is a sign of just how weak your arguments are.","marc9000","367730","No links or references I guess. These are mainly worldview debates, not clear-cut matters of 5+5=10. Science is not the only source of knowledge. So you never insult?

"08-31-2009","13107",21,"Matthew","367654","Hi, Marc. Glad to see you again. I have to say, though, that I'm a little put off by this. In post 241, I didn't say that I found Archie stupid. Believe me when I say that I don't mean this at all facetiously, but I have given a great deal of thought over the last few years to the differences between unintelligence, ignorance, and stupidity, and how we use these terms. I have yet to call Archie either stupid or unintelligent. I do think that, based on what I see here, he is ignorant of evolutionary biology -- or perhaps, given some of the things he said earlier today, just extraordinarily careless about how he chooses to describe it. So Archie's attacks on me are my fault? Come on, Marc. I have never called Archie stupid. I have never questioned his Christianity -- though in reaction to his recent treatment of me, I have let him know that I don't find his behavior very Christian. I have tried my level best to treat him respectfully. I have tried to direct my criticisms at what he says and explain why I think what he says is wrong, not attack him. But what I get is constant accusations that I don't really believe in God. That I don't care about what the Bible says. That, ultimately, I am not a Christian. Heck, today, he hit a new low: He accused me, on the basis of God only knows what mode of remote cognition, of not going to church this morning. !!! I am, quite frankly, tired of it. Not true! I teach about ""appeal to popularity"" and ""appeal to force"" all the time. But there's a difference between appealing to populartiy and reasonably arguing in favor of a popular position. You mean like all those conservatives encouraging civil discourse at the town hall meetings? Yeah, they'd never dream about drowning out liberals' comments under an avalanche of boos....","marc9000","367739","I hope I've addressed most, or all of your questions in the above posts tonight. The ""theistic evolution"" vs. ""creationist"" positions are worlds apart, no question about that. You don't separate yourself from those who do, who have been doing it for years. It may not seem like a big deal to you, but you'd have to be on the receiving end of it to know what it's like. Not just once or twice, but for years . That's what so many atheists say - Christians are supposed to be just warm and fuzzy and QUIET as evolutionists tell them what's actually going on. Christianity is more than that. I'm not his spokeman or apologist, as I said above, I'm just pointing out a few things that so many seem to forget. I agree, but the lopsidedness of some of this can cloud things. I glanced through the ""Biblical Contradictions"" forum here and didn't see (in the titles) anything about the Genesis 1 & 2 contradiction. (there isn't one, by the way ) I'd like to expore that with you there sometime soon. No more time tonight. Those aren't exactly voluntary discussions, of two worldviews seeking the truth. They're more like two big money interests seeking victory/power.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","08:49 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","311"

But this way of putting it makes it sound like it's about you , at a personal level, when in fact it's about creationism itself, at the level of what it says . It's very much a matter of debate within the philsophy of science itself. Has been for decades. And I don't know that the dividing line can be made as sharp as many of us on each side of the debate sometimes state or imply. But of course, if the point is to criticize someone's distinction, then ""who's to say"" criticisms could go either way. Right? What can I tell you? I try to engage people, even when I don't necessarily agree with their conduct all the time. Should we construe your attempts to harmonize with other posters that way? Come now. Most of the reasoning you're dancing through here is thoroughly ad hominem. It's not rude, and far from insulting or offensive. But it's directed at me, not at what I say, which is ad hominem. If, as you say, ""the words I post are by far good enough,"" then why not address those instead of indulge in psychological speculations about me? But not to my arguments. What I say stands or falls on its own merits. Whomever I happen to agree or disagree with, or whatever emotions I may or may not motivate me, are completely irrelevant.

Or should we perhaps deal with you as an individual? I have been on the receiving end for years. Not at present, thank heavens. But I dealt with exactly this sort of thing within the church , primarily during my twenties. And my father, who is a minister, often had it worse. But of course, my large point is: none of this matters! What I believe, what my dad believes, what you believe, what Archie believes -- none of it is either true or false just because any of us objectively is or subjectively feels persecuted by the powers that be.

A concluding tangent: I do apologize for not getting back to you with regard to the other posts. At this point, maybe it's okay to let it go. I imagine we're going to have plenty of opportunity to cover similar territory. I would like to address the meaning of John 10:30, though. I did some research into it, and into the 82nd Psalm, to which Jesus refers in the surrounding verses. Maybe that's another topic we could explore over on the religion threads.

My repeated calling you out on your defense of the lie which evolution is as you oppose what your alleged God states actually happened in Genesis IS NOT A PERSONAL ATTACK ON YOU. IT IS A STATEMENT OF FACT REGARDING THE HYPOCRISY AND THE DOUBLE STANDARDS YOU REPRESENT IN EVERY DEBATE IN WHICH YOU OPPOSE PRECISELY THE SOURCE BOOK WHICH YOU OTHERWISE CLAIM TO BELIEVE IS TRUE. You can't have it both ways Matt. You either love the Lord or you hate Him, there is no middle ground. And that isn't my opinion, Jesus said it Himself. Mat 6:24 ""No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Mammon. Jhn 14:23 Jesus answered and said to him, ""If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him. Jhn 14:24 He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine but the Father's who sent Me. So please stop accusing me of attacking you when all I am doing is telling you the truth regarding the hypocrisy you represent here. Stop defending evolution in the name of Jesus as you continue to insist that you're a believer in Christ and I will stop calling you on the hypocrisy which you represent as you oppose the very spiritual truths you otherwise claim to believe in. Simply put, you don't represent Him well at all when you defend a lie in His name. I just don't know how many different ways to put it so you will get my point, but that's as clear as I can make it. Do you get it Matthew? Every time you argue in favor of evolution against the Genesis account you are calling the God you claim to believe in, a liar.
