It's all to be expected from this crowd. No real facts provided. Matthew just quoted statements I made and pretty much repeated the same mantra over and over as specifically as possible about how I just don't get it. But i do get it. I do understand that what you humanists cling to is a lie and a fairy tale created by men to explain the origins of life apart from an intelligent and personal Creator. I don't care how you dress your philosophy up in a package to appear to be legitimate science, because it is still a fraud and a lie. I find it especially sad that people who claim to possess the enlightenment of advanced intellect are so easily deceived into following such shallow drivel as this pseudo science represents. But I will never convince you secular humanists that you are wrong and that even though neither of us has all of the facts regarding how life came to be on Earth, that I am much closer to the actual factual truth than you are. So we are at a stalemate, if you will because nothing you say will convince me I have it wrong. What I really get a kick out of is that you, Matthew in particular in this most recent stream of criticisms critiques specific points in which he believes I am misled in my understanding of evolution when my constant complaint is that even evolution proponents don't agree with what evolution theory promotes. A perfect example/case in point is the tree of life I posted. I posted it from a pro-evolution source yet Matthew claims it is wrong. If we could get the opinions of the site contributers, they would strongly disagree with Matthew's critique of their tree of life of course, and they would tell him that he just doesn't get it as he tells me the same thing. I could probable dig up 4 or 5 Trees of Life or Timelines of evolution to post which all disagree with each other. What then do we surmise from this inconsistency? That it is just as I have been saying all along, EVEN THE GREAT PSEUDO SCIENCE OF EVOLUTION DOESN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IT BELIEVES. THAT'S WHY I SAY IT HAS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE. IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS VERSION OF IT, CHOOSE ANOTHER BECAUSE IT'S THERE FOR YOU. THIS IS WHY I CONSTANTLY GET CRITICIZED FOR WHAT I POST. I QUOTE FROM ONE PRO EVOLUTION SITE AND SOME EVOLUTIONIST STILL SAYS IT'S ME WHOSE WRONG. In closing, after going to the Apple Store for some shopping today and having an early dinner, we went to see Inglorious Bastards. It was an excellent film even though Tarantino is far from my favorite director. In spite of that, the film flowed, the plot snapped and the action and acting was fast paced and tight. Not to mention the story line had twists which he captured and followed through with beautifully.

What insults? What snipes? You're the one insulting everybody's intelligence for pointing out that you obviously don't know what the hell you're talking about. A fish crawling up on land and turning into a mammal? A lizard turning into a dog? A plant turning into an insect? It's quite obvious that you don't even have a grade school-level understanding of the ToE. Yeah, did I not call that right here? Because it's quite obvious you don't. Somehow, you (again) managed to miss the part where he explained what precisely you weren't getting. No, you don't, as has been pointed out numerous times. Seeing as how you don't even understand the basics of what you're arguing against, no, you never will. No, but you want to take a guess as to which side at least has facts? OK, once again-THAT IS ABIOGENESIS, NOT THE ToE! It's a really simple concept, you'd think you might be able to catch on after the 15th correction. Great, start a new thread, and lay out all these facts. No, you know what, let's make it easy-lay out five facts that support creationism. And this is the guy who routinely mocks those who disagree with him for being close-minded. Archie, you don't understand a single thing that you're arguing against, and you just said that there's no way you will ever attempt to correct this, so why bother? You posted it from a web site that supports social darwinism. Again, proof that you don't understand anything about the ToE, if you equate social darwinism with the ToE Oh, and since you never bothered to cite your source: About Us | www.ievolved.org Great, email them and ask them to post their support for the scientific complexity and accuracy of their tree of life diagram. FFS Archie, the title itself gives it away ""A simple timeline of evolution""! You probably could, and each of them serve the same purpose- to give a general idea of the relative relationships between different classes! They are not a complete and accurate representation, they merely serve to give a broad overview, which is why they are usually found in introductory text books! That once again, you don't know what you're talking about, and are taking a basic explanatory tool used to introduce a concept as the complete story. You're a lost cause.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","08:41 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","244"

If Russell claimed that 2 + 2 = 4 and Mathew cited him in a math argument, why would it matter what Russell believed in? I have no problem citing people of all beliefs if what they said is factually true and of value. Does that make me a believer and sharer of their religious views? What kind of logic is that archie? As for your high a mighty talk, your argument still concludes God is a liar. What I don't get is why you have no problem with a genocidal God, but lying is not acceptable. That doesn't make much sense. It is interesting how you reject the science that is used to make products that you use everyday, but many people are walking contradictions.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:28 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","246"

You insist that you are a Christian, yet I have yet to see you exhibit a single ounce of Christly love for one's enemies on any of these forums. Instead, you insult people as ""mental midgets."" And you offer nothing substantive in response to all those substantive posts. Instead, despite having accused others of being non-responsive to your posts, you now state (in the post prior to that quoted here) that you simply ""don't care"" what they will say to you. Based on what I see on these boards, if the choice is between you and Russell, I'd choose Russell every day of the week -- and twice on Sunday. For in terms of intellectual honesty and respect for other people, he strikes me as the better Christian.

"08-29-2009","13107",17,"None","None","None","obvious_child","367515","Oh boy. The ""tree of life"" or more appropriate, bush of life is never identical for a simple reason. Various people disagree with classifications. What Archie fails to understand is that they are all saying the same principle: that organisms evolved over time from common ancestors. The quibbles are over where species are suppose to be on the bush, not that evolution is wrong. It's like a bunch of historians quibbling about what the early English characters looked like. They aren't arguing that the language didn't exist, it's about the specific details. Archie's failure to understand that basic issue is highly disturbing.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","11:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","248"

I think the civil and respectful thing to do from this point forward is simply not to. It's funny. On the now-defunct New York Times ""Human Origins"" forum, my most frequent opponent was a Randian atheist. (As Archie likes to point out, I never criticize atheists. So obviously, I am making this up....) He understood diddly-squat about religion, theology, or philosophy. But with respect to the last, in particular, he was a self-styled expert. (Most Randians are, and their relationship to philosophy is essentially that of intelligent design theorists to biology.) I could get into it with him for round after round. I could show him that his interpretation of a given thinker or idea was flat wrong. In many cases, his interpretations were literally the opposite of correct, as if one had inserted or removed a ""not"" at a key point in the reasoning. On more than one occasion, I showed that his entire criticism was explicitly and accurately rebutted by the very people he claimed to have refuted. And I was far from the only poster who had this experience. None of it made any difference. He routinely ignored the substance of our criticisms and repeated his points as if no criticisms had been made -- and questioned our intelligence and/or honesty for not addressing him substantively. I eventually quit arguing with him out of sheer frustration. Whereupon he declared victory, of course. Awfully familiar.... In what I now consider to be the grand poobah of all coincidences that I have ever known, that poster's nom-de-NYT-forums was ""Good Old Lucifer."" (More often than not, I addressed him as ""Lucie."") Perhaps the lesson here is that anyone who decides to refer to himself as an archangel has too much certitude to be worth arguing with.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","12:24 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","249"
