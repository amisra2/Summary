I'm not the one asking moronic questions which have already been answered in posts which your side ignores. Also, my response makes perfect sense, you just aren't smart enough to grasp the concepts being discussed here which explains why you haven't contributed anything coherent in your own thread.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","11:37 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","364"

"09-03-2009","13107",25,"Accipiter","368079","You have mental problems.","Archangel","368081","You say that, but for once in your life how about proving it. Or at least offer some evidence of it. Especially since the allegedly mentally ill christian is producing arguments which your pseudo intellectual evolutionists cannot refute with any solid evidence at all. What does that say about your/their mental issues when so many cling to an irrational belief system which doesn't even follow the scientific methodologies which all legitimate science is based upon?","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","11:55 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","366"

For instance you say there are no observables for evolution but Darwins work was based on observation. You can see evidence of evolution everywhere form the animals we breed to the fossil evidence to bacteria which evolve resistance to antibiotics. No test to prove evolution takes place? Why test something that humans make happen every day?","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","12:21 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","367"

You call God magic when God condemns all forms of magic and occult practices in His word. Evidently you don't appreciate the difference between the supernatural and magic. Great, now we're getting somewhere, just post where Darwin proved MICRI-EVOLUTION ever occurred at anytime and you win this whole debate. Isn't that easy accipiter? Or else you can go educate yourself about what evolution actually claims compared to what is evident in reality, and then either remain in ignorant denial or change your views like a grown up does when they leave childish things behind. Again my ignorant friend, just show any animals which are evidence of micro-evolution which we have observed evolve from one species into another, or produce evidence that we have engineered/bred into one species from another. Go on accipiter, you can win this debate in short order if you can only back up your claims according to what evolution claims has occurred, yet cannot prove or show in the real world. If humans make micro-evolution happen every day then your job is done and you will win this debate and finally shut this egregiously ignorant christian up. Just post a couple of links which prove science has genetically evolved a reptile into a mammal or a protein into an insect even, and you have exposed my ignorance. In other words accipiter, the goal is cross species pro-generation. Make it happen or prove that it has and you win the debate. But what you will find after an endless search is that none of that has happened because micro-evolution has never happened and never will. So that leaves the question, then how does the so called science of evolution claim that all life spontaneously evolved from the original protein/enzyme which miraculously appeared in that proverbial puddle of primordial ooze. Talk about MAGIC? Your secular humanist religion of evolution is founded upon it.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","02:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","368"

It's also been posted numerous times on most other threads on this particular topic. You just refuse to actually read it. And no, I'm not going to comb through 250 posts on this thread and thousands of posts on other threads to once again present you with evidence that you'll only ignore again. You said how easy it is to review the posts made by each member, so go to it. Click on Iangb's posts. Read them over. Then go to Matthew's. Read them over. The fact that you ignore what you don't want to acknowledge is not a failure of the ToE, it's a failure of yours.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","02:44 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","369"

But no such evidence has been supplied on this thread, I have read alot of opinions and repeated insistence that evolution is a valid and reliable science. But no true and real evidence which is based on actual repeatable and verifiable experiments as other scientific discoveries have been based upon. You know, using this quality of scientific methodology: Scientific Method Uses Experiments and Controls: Good Experiments and Controls Generate Valid Scientific Conclusions | Suite101.com If you're going to insist that evolution does use this level of scientific methodology, then show the known controls and ingredients from 4.5 billion years ago which establish the building blocks for life which led to what we have evolved into according to this so called science, and the specific experiments which have proven evolution to be true and factual science.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","04:24 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","371"
"09-03-2009","13107",25,"None","None","None","Databed","368113","What about bacteria changing to become drug resistant? What about new breeds of dog arising all the time? (Human tinkering with evolutionary processes) What about the Swine Flu among many other NEW viruses? What about intentional breeding of fruit flies and plants to create desired traits? This is not including all the historical evidence there is. The mechanism is there and humans know enough about it to employ it. It IS happening and to deny it is stupid. Most creationist have come to accept micro-evolution because there is so much evidence for it. Their coping mechanism was to create a firm divide between micro and macro-evolution when there really is no difference. If you show this evidence to any person who was not brainwashed as a child into believing that the Bible was written by God and that Moses, an Egyptian who knew very well how to carve rock and did it everyday, didn't carve those stone tablets himself, they would agree.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","04:41 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","372"

Again, I'm not lying, and yes, you have. I posted a link to a talk origins page which laid out a lot of evidence for evolution-all cited, all easily verifiable. You didn't even acknowledge it. Yes, there has. Iangb posted about a few experiments proving evolution. You ignored them. And each of those opinions is based on the verifiable scientific evidence. yeah, except for the evidence that you continue to ignore. I have a question for you-yes or no, no waffling: Do you ""believe"" in the Theory of Gravity? Ok, how many times is this now Archie-that's abiogenesis, which is not even a theory. It's a hypothesis at this point, one that is being researched. You keep going on and on about how you know all about evolution, when you consistently say boneheaded stuff like the above that demonstrates beyond a doubt that you have clue zero as to what you are talking about.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","04:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","373"
