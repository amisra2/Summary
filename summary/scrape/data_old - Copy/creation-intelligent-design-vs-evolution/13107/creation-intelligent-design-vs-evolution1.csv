The (initial) common creationist response to this is that the speed of light 'must' have changed over time - however, there are several disproofs for this. The first is simple - there is a great amount of evidence that this is not the case: at the very most, it has not changed by very much. . Even better than that, however, is the case of Supernova 1987A . This supernova was surrounded by distant rings of gas which could be observed 'lighting up' as the light from the supernova hit it. The rings were big enough for an angular width to be measured (0.808 arcseconds diameter), and the time taken for the light to get from the central 'nova to the rings was measured. Basic trigonometry gives the result that, regardless of the current speed of light, the event took place 168,000 years ago. You might be able to get around this by making some headache-inducing assumptions, but (unsurprisingly, really) independent methods of distancing the supernova puts it at 168,000 light-years away, thus nicely supporting the observations made.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","06:43 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","2"

Simply put, I'll let this link answer your distance of stars claim. http://www.ibri.org/Tracts/lttmetct.htm But for a more practical answer, imagine this. In the beginning, space was a void which spanned all of eternity. Only one object/energy source encompassed all of it from one end of its massive emptiness to the other, and that person was my God Yahweh. And in one second or minutes time, he spoke all of the stars that have ever existed, at different intensities and strengths, which causes them to burn out at different times. But he placed them at the very inner and outer limits of time and space at that time. Liken it to a farmer with a hand full of seeds. He pulls back his arm and throws those seeds to the end of the plot of land he is sowing at that time. To the ants on the ground, if they measured the time it would take to reach the farthest seed, it would represent a great distance, but to the farmer it was just one arms throw in time to disperse hundreds of seeds at one time. Now here we are as finite creatures who can only see time from our linear perspective. Time is plastic. Our linear measure is man made for our convenience only. That you place what we call the measure of so called light years is arbitrary at best. But I am getting too deep for you and this discussion. The point is that our God has the ability to place the stars in every corner of not only what we again, arbitrarily call our universe, but throughout all of time and space. But to we puny finite humans who have invented telescopes, it appears that these stars we are seeing today are ancient based on the perceived yet arbitrarily arrived at distance you believe they are from us. But since you are unable to even grasp the hugeness of our God, you also fail to appreciate that light years are a measure of distance rather than time. So by that definition alone, it is foolish to equate it with Earth time rather than Gods ability to reach any distant place in time and space and place stars there.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","08:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","3"

They can't do it. Their entire belief is based on the false dichotomy that if evolution is wrong, therefore Creationism.

Archie, you should really read the links that you post, preferably before you post them.","pandion","365163","I thought that it was hilarious that Archie posted that link and then made really, really dumb arguments that had already been debunked by his own link. Do creationists even pay attention to their own arguments? As for a ""light year"" being a distance and not a time, that is correct. It is the distance that light travels in a year . You do understand that, don't you Archie? So if a stellar object is measured to be 170 million light years away, how long did it take the light from that object to get here? Can you answer that Archie? First you should probably read your own link. Pay especial attention to assumptions #1 and #2 before you embarrass yourself again.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:52 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","14"

God makes his believers look like complete XXXXXX. Did you really read what he wrote? Time is plastic? We finite humans measure time as linear for our convenience? Where do these ideas come from? What's more, it makes perfect sense to believers. The wisdom of man is foolishness to God. Its perfectly logical, and in fact mandatory, to support baseless incredulous claims by inventing more baseless incredulous claims. It would be foolish to do otherwise. I don't feel sorry for believers being duped into religious mentality. I don't even blame God for deceiving them. I blame believers for the choice they willingly made to abandon intellect in the hope that they will be invited to a nice invisible party some unknown time after they die. I say good for them. Whatever makes them happy I guess.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","10:33 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","15"
