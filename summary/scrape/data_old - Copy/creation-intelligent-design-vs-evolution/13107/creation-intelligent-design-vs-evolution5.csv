"08-14-2009","13107",5,"Archangel","365405","I already did explain the obnoxious childs dishonesty accipiter. You really need to read the posts before embarrassing yourself asking ridiculous questions. The ignorance that child contributes here is enough for any 5 forums, much less this ONE. You notice that this liar never actually supported his claim that I ever ARGUED THAT GOD IS AN EPIC LIAR!!! But that never stopped him from making the dishonest claim, did it? So my question for you is this; why would you even rely on such a liar to make any type of valid point at all when he isn't even connected to reality which he proves in every single post in which he corrupts and perverts what another member says by completely misinterpreting what he says? [/B]","obvious_child","365482","No you didn't. All you did was spam your same argument your originally made. Notice that as the same argument I pointed out results in a liar God. A god that made the universe very different from the universe we see today and hid all of the operating physical laws that were different along with all of the evidence. As your own link cites , your argument requires God to have given a fictious history, either in the Bible or the the natural world. Amusing coming from someone who falsely claimed another user misused the term ""light year."" If I am so ignorant, explain how your argument does not require exactly what I said: That God operated the named light sources on a very different set of physical laws and removed all evidence of their existence to meld them with the current set of physical laws that we know do not support young Earth Creationism. I'm betting you don't even understand your original argument. Prove me wrong. Explain how it does not result in God being a liar. On the contrary, I did just that. Under your argument, the conclusion is God is a liar. ""So God deceived us by creating a system that today works as we know it in a way that refutes Literal Creationism and has absolutely no evidence of being different at any time in the past but secretly made the named light sources abide to his secondary set of physical laws which he then removed from creation without a trace."" God does that not make God an epic liar? lol. Good luck proving that. You don't even understand your original argument.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","61"
"08-14-2009","13107",5,"unkerpaulie","365471","Yet these both things contradict each other, so both cannot be true. Is it the bible that's lying, or God?","obvious_child","365484","That would require Archangel to understand what he posts. As history shows, he doesn't. In fact we all know he just skims articles, thinks he understands them and posts them without understanding that they actually refute his claim. He's done this at least a dozen times. Hell, often all we need to do is read his own link to find the original author's argument against Arch's claim. I'll bet you that he cannot explain what his original argument means. He just assumes that since we reject it, he's correct without any understanding of just how ludicrous his post was. I challenged him to explain it. Want to be he'll either ignore that challenge entirely or completely fail?","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:41 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","62"
"08-14-2009","13107",5,"None","None","None","obvious_child","365486","Archangel , if you think you are so right, where is the evidence that the physical laws dictating how light behaves in a medium has changed in the past? That is what your argument comes down to. That there was a set of physical laws God applied to the named light sources to make them behave in a way contrary to modern physics. So where is the evidence of these different physical laws? This is how you destroy YEC. Force them to backup their claims. As YEC is complete garbage with nothing of worth, the backers will always flee.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:44 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","63"

You have made an argument that God had a secret set of physical laws or changed the laws of physics. Where is your evidence that this occurred? And what kind of spiritual person declares people of his faith not to be of his faith because they do not agree with his bigoted viewpoints? Pretend all you want you hold the high ground.

I assume that you don't believe in sin, forgiveness and christianity either?","Matthew","365539","Uh, no. I am a Christian. And I certainly believe in both the reality of sin and the importance of forgiveness. I don't believe in the doctrine of ""Original Sin,"" or in ""The Fall,"" if by such notions one means a literal description of actual events and their implications, however.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","10:50 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","65"
"08-15-2009","13107",5,"Accipiter","365072","Fellow atheists and agnostics, what are your most effective arguments for disproving biblical creation? If you are religious please do not post in this thread.","birdan","365579","If I may derail the derailment for a moment and respond to the OP ..... The most effective argument I've found is heat . I've read quite a bit of young earth creationist literature, and I have not found any arguments to counter thermodynamics. The argument is basically as follows: YECs agree that volcanic rock was produced by volcanoes, meteor craters were produced by meteors, tectonics occurred in the past, metamorphic rock was formed in the past, etc. They argue that all these processes were simply ""speeded up"" and occurred within the last 10,000 years. But all the above processes produce heat. Trying to reduce 4.5 billion years of thermodynamic history to a 10,000 year period results in a molten earth. Since the earth is not currently molten, the YEC argument fails. The nice thing about this line of argumentation is that the energy amounts can easily be calculated and demonstrated based on 19th century physics. If you can get a YEC to engage in this line of argumentation long enough, they will either: 1. say that volcanic rock is not from volcanoes, etc.; or 2. invoke a miracle that whisked the heat away. If they go the #1 route, then they must defend against the 'God is a deceiver' argument. If they go the #2 route, then (by invoking the miraculous) they have effectively shut the science classroom door on the teaching of creationism. A similar argument can be made for YEC cosmological stories, such as Humphrey's white hole cosmology: trying to reduce a 13.7 billion year old universe into a few years produces such a concentrated amount of energy that the solar system would not exist. I have argued with many YECs and most will simply 'disappear' from this argument. Of those that stay around, they respond as above.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","04:49 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","66"

I generally find it rare to find a YEC who actually understands basic science. There aren't any here.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","05:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","67"

Where is your evidence that this occurred?","Archangel","365602","HAD? Yes, He ""has"" done that on numerous occasions. If you understood his word you would know about them. And you wouldn't refer to the Maker of all that is in the past tense or as an IT!!! Just a few examples of this control of the physical laws was when Jesus walked on water, and when He turned water into wine, and when He calmed the Sea by commanding it with His words. And when He raised others and Himself from the dead. And don't forget how He healed the lame, blind and crippled. Also, have you forgotten how He commanded demons to come out of people whom their neighbors couldn't deny had afflicted them for years? And how about when He took a few loaves of bread and a few fish and fed 5000 to the amazement of His own Apostles. Isn't every single one of these examples evidence of changing, or controlling the physical laws in that they bent to His will rather than Him having to bend to theirs, as you do? But of course even though you will claim to be a christian, you will just come back now and assert that just because the bible says it, that isn't proof of anything. So why do you even ask a christian a question if you will never accept the answer from the source you know the answer will come from?

If you understood his word you would know about them.","obvious_child","365609","According to a book. A book that cites no actual empirical evidence for its claims of miracles. Essentially your argument is that God changed the laws of physics for miracles because the Bible said so and there are no actual pieces of empirical evidence showing that he did so. Well, if you make the argument that if someone took the time to write it, it must be true I'm totally convinced! Good job on failing to provide a shred of actual evidence to show that God actually changed the laws of physics. By the way, if I'm so dishonest about your claims making God a liar, why have you outright refused to explain your original argument? ""Archangel, if you think you are so right, where is the evidence that the physical laws dictating how light behaves in a medium has changed in the past?"" No reply. ""So God deceived us by creating a system that today works as we know it in a way that refutes Literal Creationism and has absolutely no evidence of being different at any time in the past but secretly made the named light sources abide to his secondary set of physical laws which he then removed from creation without a trace."" How does that not make God an epic liar?"" No reply. ""I'm betting you don't even understand your original argument. Prove me wrong. Explain how it does not result in God being a liar. "" No reply. I seriously doubt you even understand the original argument you gave especially since you cited a website that argued against YEC because it forces God to have deceived us either in the Bible or the natural world. Note that Birden said this: ""If they go the #1 route, then they must defend against the 'God is a deceiver' argument. If they go the #2 route, then (by invoking the miraculous) they have effectively shut the science classroom door on the teaching of creationism."" I see you lack the intellectual guts to deal with #1, and instead went for #2 on the grounds if Bible says = True! The problem is that you remove your argument from the realm of actual science and rely entirely upon Magic and the Supernatural. Neither of which are testable or teachable in the science classroom. Where have I ever claimed to be a Christian? More lies from the Lie Factory. Besides if such miracles happened, why is there no physical evidence left from the change in the physical laws? Oh wait I forgot. You can't answer actual science questions that rely upon empirical evidence. If the Bible says so therefore it is true! Obviously SOMEONE took the time to write it, therefore it HAS to be true!","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:48 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","69"

And not everybody necessarily needs to be forgiven if they haven't sinned, right?","Matthew","365649","Sin is a part of human nature. If ""Original Sin"" is taken as a metaphor for that, I don't see a problem. The fact is, every human being sometimes behaves as she shouldn't, in greater or lesser degree. This could be seen as a transgression of God's laws, but it could also be seen as a failure to emulate God's love. It could also be seen in any number of other ways, many of which would be compatible with one another. But human nature is not exclusively or even predominantly sinful. If ""Original Sin"" is taken to mean that it is, I do consider that a problem. For the fact also is, every human being sometimes does good, whether great or small. This could be seen as following God's laws, emulating God's love, or again, in any number of other ways, often compatible. Well, as I said above, I think everybody sins from time to time. It's certainly the case that some sin more than others. And some sins have more harmful and far-reaching consequences than others. But everybody sins. At some point, we all need at least a little forgiveness. I'm sorry if these answers weren't helpful! I confess that I wasn't entirely clear that I understood what the questions were driving at. And I hope that our discussion won't distract further from the OP's point! By way of reconnecting to it, let me just repeat that I think the best tool to use against creationism is the Bible. When people pay attention to what the Bible actually says and to the history of its composition -- and those who call ourselves Christians ought to be committed to such attention as a matter of religious principle! -- the idea of a literalized creation narrative doesn't make sense.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","10:06 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","71"
"08-16-2009","13107",5,"None","None","None","unkerpaulie","365663","Fair enough matthew. Maybe I'll get a chance later to hear more about the idea of christianity without a literal creation, but this is not the right thread for it. Personally, the evidence that put the biggest dent in my belief in creation (and, by extension, christianity) is the very obvious lack of supernatural activity in modern times (the last, say, 200 years or so). There is a trend in the bible concerning miraculous activity. The further back you go in history, the grander the miracle in terms of scale, power and effect on history. By the time we get the new testament, miracles seem to be diminished to local and personal performances. Today, the only miracles we hear about are those that no third party can witness. And the nature of the reports of these miracles make them seem dubious as they can almost be always written off as figments of one's imagination or explained naturally. So what happened? Did God's supply of power run dry? Is he saving up his miraculous reserves for some big showing? If God cannot create the miraculous today, then its clear that he never did it thousands of years ago, particularly at a time when superstition was at an all time high and scientific knowledge was at an all time low. And none of this requires excavations, telescopes or laboratories. Just looking at what's in front of me.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","01:11 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","72"
