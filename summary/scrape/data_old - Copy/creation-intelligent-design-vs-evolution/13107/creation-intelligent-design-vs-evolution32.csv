"09-06-2009","13107",32,"gansao","368553","We are not talking about Genesis as a story are we? We are talking about Bilbical creation. You really are thick arent you? I know there are religious people, deeply and otherwise who accept the story of Genesis as a story but that has no relevance to the thread. Undisputable is only stupid because you cant provide it. Certainly not as comprehensively as the aristotlian view of the universe was disproved. The horse evolution thread was fine...you have showed a little horse turning into a big horse and not one species actually evolving into another distinct species but i'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Now show exactly how life originated and you're home and dry.","trebor","368558","Why, now , Genesis IS the basis of 'biblical creation'. There is a difference between thinking that 'God started it all', and then 'biblical creation'. Do you realize how stupid you are making yourself look? Do you not know what the phrase 'Biblical creation' means?? Are you so totally and utterly ignorent/ Oh, never mind. You have already demonstrated that.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","11:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","467"

I reject talking points which prove nothing solid or real at all, which is the definition of what T.O. represents in the real world. You know you're dealing with a propaganda source when every single topic it covers starts with ""In spite of the fact that creationists oppose this point of evolution"" blah blah blah... Rather than just dealing with the alleged science they are supposedly discussing. I mean, if evo was real and true then a site like that which defended it would be marvelous, but since evo's a blatant lie and distortion of reality, that site is a tool of satan which is dedicated to turning people from the truth to the lie.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","12:38 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","469"
"09-07-2009","13107",32,"gansao","368500","Get back in your box troll. The is titled 'Effective Arguments For Disproving Biblical Creation '. So I am debating from that position. We have established that the theory of Evolution is a hypothesis and effectively cant be proven. I have nothing riding on this and so I am debating for the sake of it but I do see that when a few individuals cant prove a point they just start covering their tracks with insults.Like the last two..trebor and troll.","obvious_child","368565","Upon which criteria do you declare it cannot be proven? To rational people, using products derived from a science tangibly proves that science to be correct. This is partially a reason why we think YECs are totally insane as they reject the underlying science for a myriad of products they use daily. If we're using the ""proven"" criteria of absolute, sure it can't, but neither can anything else, including your own existence. It's rather pointless to walk around life never knowing if you exist or not. Most of us are just sick and tired of dealing with a certain user who plugs his ears and refuses to even acknowledge posts refuting him exist. You have to give TQ and Trebor some slack. If your opponent regularly denied things you could easily cite and called you awful names for merely disagreeing with him, do you think you'd be civil all of the time? Furthermore, you do appear ignorant about what evolution actually is, namely a-religious. Evolution does not reject nor accept or even mention supernatural. And you should also note that only literalists reject evolution in the context of their religion.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","01:38 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","470"

Oh yeah, ""to provide mainstream scientific responses to the many frequently asked questions (FAQs) that appear in the talk.origins newsgroup and the frequently rebutted assertions of those advocating intelligent design or other creationist pseudosciences."" So, you're basis for it being a propoganda site is that it's sole existence is to counter your falsehoods. As for the rest of your complaint:""Rather than just dealing with the alleged science they are supposedly discussing."" See those little numbers throughout each and every article? And how they are connected to the little sentences at the end of each article? Those little sentences are called citations. Those citations are the exact evidence you claim that you would accept if it was presented to you.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","02:32 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","471"

There are no room for doubt of the modern view of the solar system. I think therefore I am..you are again wrong. I do not have to give these people a thing.They were the first ones to insult me, maybe you should read the posts before the lectures. I am debating this issue independantly to anyone else. If you had read the previous posts you would know that . Maybe you are ignorant of my recent previous posts.

Saying that I dont understand or ignorant is just a sign of frustration and not an answer. I need proof of one species evolving into another distinct species with proof of the time evolved being millions of years and not the work of a divine creator over a much shorter period. You need to explain the origin of life too. If you cant, dont be too upset...no one else can either If some of the resident geniuses here read my posts they would know that I believe that evolution is correct, in fact it it is virtually undeniable but it is still a HYPOTHESIS and incomplete ( that doesnt mean to say it is wrong). I have not debated as an ally to Archangel although I may pick up on a response from his detracters. He also has not debated as my ally either but has picked up on points from my detracters. He , unlike some, read my posts and realised I was debating from the standpoint of the title of the thread...so trying to bash me with Archangel only showed the stupidity of the poster that did it. So dont tell me I am ignorant or have a stupid religion..it wont work. Either put up or shut up.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","05:01 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","474"

The post is adressed to gansao's last post above mine and does not account for the period in between) I know you do Gansao, you're not one of the closed minds. I was rather surprised at your latest posts, actually. I was quite glad to see you had not lost your mind after all The issue you raise is worth of interest. While scientific terminology is a bit more precies, with theory going beyond mere hypothesis, that's not of interest now. The idea of absolute proof is more interest. At the strictest sense, no past event is actually provable - we cannot observe it any more, we can only infer that it took place from it's consequences. One cannot prove the theory of evolution in this fashion, since it is already in the past and also can not be recreated on a realistic time scale. However, would not that same criteria make proving creation as impossible to prove? It is also in the past, after all... But then, this is a matter of ontology. Which opens all kinds of interesting questions, of course, but I must confess I am rather set in my ways when it comes ot it. I feel certain that it is essentially only a tradeoff - a trade of certainty for the knowable. The more certain one wants to be, the less is knowable, and opposite, the more we want to know, the less certain we can be of it. (One cannot in theory discount the possibility of a god creating a universe that just looks old, however, at that level, one also cannot discount the possibility that we are in a ""matrix"" virtual reality system - to us, both would appear the same - P.S. this does imply a ""trickster god"" - or, as some would put it, a ""liar"" god) To return to the subject at hand: I would state that as the sphere of certainity is expanded to allow for actual evidence, the amount of evidence that fits evolution begins to massively exceed the amount of evidence that fits creation. After all, creation WAS the norm in scientific thought for a long time - evolutionary thinking had to fight its way past the inertia before it became mainstream thought.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:13 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","477"

Get this through your head son, you are defending a secular humanist religion, NOT A SCIENCE AT ALL! EVOLUTION IS A MAN MADE MYTH WHICH HAS NO FOUNDATION IN PROVEN FACTS AT ALL.
