You constantly prove you are interpreting the bible/the creation account from a fleshly/liberal perspective rather than from a spiritual perspective.","Matthew","367993","I will respond to all of this in due time. But for the next few days, I have a ton of grading to do. Plus, I seem to have picked up some sort of bug. At the moment, I'm simply exhausted. In the meantime, I will merely offer a quick take on your very first sentence: Indeed I am adopting a ""fleshly"" perspective, albeit one that strives for the ""spiritual."" I find it rather perplexing that you didn't even quote, much less respond to, so much of what I had written. Among the points you left out is one that seems particularly relevant to our current issue: ""I don't think any amount of divine inspiration can eliminate our intellectual and moral finitude and fallibility -- not even in the case of the authors of the Bible."" Such is what separates us from the divine. In this life, we see through a glass darkly. Just some food for thought. I'd elaborate more, and more adequatley, but I'm only about half with-it. Right now, I need some good medicine and a good night's sleep.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","06:51 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","346"

From a 'scientific' point of view , all facts are provisional, but are considered 'facts' because the preponderance of evidence is so overwhelming as you would have to be insane or ignorant (or both) to deny it. You see, evolution is not a 'piece' of evidence (well, no you don't see). It is the convergence of evidence. Do you know what 'convergence of evidence' is? Somehow, I think convergence is too complicated a concept, because you have demonstrated you have trouble with the concept of 'evidence'.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:46 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","348"
"09-02-2009","13107",24,"Matthew","367742","Originally Posted by marc9000 We're in the minority because we're creationists. No doubt. But this way of putting it makes it sound like it's about you , at a personal level, when in fact it's about creationism itself, at the level of what it says . Originally posted by marc9000 Who is really authorized to say where the line is drawn between science and philosophy? It's very much a matter of debate within the philsophy of science itself. Has been for decades. And I don't know that the dividing line can be made as sharp as many of us on each side of the debate sometimes state or imply. But of course, if the point is to criticize someone's distinction, then ""who's to say"" criticisms could go either way. Right? Come now. Most of the reasoning you're dancing through here is thoroughly ad hominem. It's not rude, and far from insulting or offensive. But it's directed at me, not at what I say, which is ad hominem. If, as you say, ""the words I post are by far good enough,"" then why not address those instead of indulge in psychological speculations about me? But not to my arguments. What I say stands or falls on its own merits. Whomever I happen to agree or disagree with, or whatever emotions I may or may not motivate me, are completely irrelevant. Either my case is a good one, or it isn't. And either way, it's a matter of the reasons given, not any features about me.","marc9000","368009","I consider it to be more about the society I live in - the worldviews of future generations, or today's generation for that matter. Moral decline, increasing debt, increasing dependence on government, etc. I agree - It can't. We have a best selling book called ""How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist"", we have Kenneth Miller saying that science shows God more vividly than Bible study possibly can, and we have many scientists saying that science does not/cannot address the existance of God at all. Yet someone here (maybe not you - I don't remember exactly who) telling Archangel that he doesn't understand science. If we can't put an accurate finger on where the line is between philosophy and science, that's not a fair accusation. But they seldom do. Practically no one in the scientific community is going to accuse Victor Stenger of not understanding science. Is his book title a lie or isn't it? It's simply an equal response to your posts like #241, 250, or 253. They're not rude on your part, and not directly insulting or offensive to me, but they're positive comments to those few who do nothing (concerning me) other than making ad hominem posts. On a level distinctively higher than anything Archangel does against any one at any time. Archangel does not use vulgar language, for example. See above. I don't agree - there are psycological advantages/disadvantages in debating. They're a large part of the foundation of the ""logical fallacy"" lists. Not that I agree with them all, but ""argument by emotive language"" really can sway an observer.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","349"

"09-02-2009","13107",24,"Archangel","367984","Your conclusion is both ignorant and irrational smiley, but that's to be expected from you at this point. Especially since you have no real or actual experience of my scriptural interpretation of the bible being erroneous at all. You see, Beside the fact that our complete debate above is me defending the bible and Matthew opposing it, common sense would tell us that you would have a valid point if in fact it was Matthew who was defending the plain and simple version of what the Genesis account clearly says against evolution, and it was me who insisted that the secular humanist philosophy of evo was correct in opposition to the Genesis account of Creation. Then one could reasonably surmise that it is his interpretation which is spiritual and intelligent. But when he insists that a philosophy which has absolutely nothing in common with the spiritual account which I have shown repeatedly above, yet he claims it is complimentary to it, well that is just plain irrational. And what's really scary is that your spiritual insight is so nonexistent that this must be pointed out to you. But thanks for trolling once again.","smiley","368012","Why would your defense of the literal bible mean that Matthew is opposing the bible? He is merely stating that it should not be viewed literally. And why would that preclude his interpretation from being spiritual? Yet again, your only real position is that his interpretation is not spiritual because it is different from your own. At least Matthew is prepared to look at the evidence that surrounds him (ie 'The Truth', otherwise known as 'Reality') and interpret scripture in light of new evidence. You, on the other hand, completely ignore reality and stick to an interpretation that is clearly a pile of kaka. How spiritually dead can you get?","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","08:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","351"
"09-02-2009","13107",24,"Matthew","367753","Originally Posted by marc9000 The ""theistic evolution"" vs. ""creationist"" positions are worlds apart, no question about that. Well, no doubt! Though it should also be noted that sometimes, we're just sitting at opposite ends of the pew.... I'm not sure what the point of this criticism should be. You don't separate yourself from Archie, despite that so many of us here consider his behavior frequently rude. Should we judge you based on your association with him? Or should we perhaps deal with you as an individual? I have been on the receiving end for years. Not at present, thank heavens. But I dealt with exactly this sort of thing within the church , primarily during my twenties. And my father, who is a minister, often had it worse. But of course, my large point is: none of this matters! What I believe, what my dad believes, what you believe, what Archie believes -- none of it is either true or false just because any of us objectively is or subjectively feels persecuted by the powers that be. I was not suggesting that Christians should be quiet. I was suggesting that they should be respectful and kind. Marc, I would love that. (And there is so! ) Just let me know. A concluding tangent: I do apologize for not getting back to you with regard to the other posts. At this point, maybe it's okay to let it go. I imagine we're going to have plenty of opportunity to cover similar territory. I would like to address the meaning of John 10:30, though. I did some research into it, and into the 82nd Psalm, to which Jesus refers in the surrounding verses. Maybe that's another topic we could explore over on the religion threads. Like I said, let me know.","marc9000","368014","I don't know about that - the atheists aren't in the building, they're not even in the parking lot, and you sit very close to them sometimes! I'm dealt with from both of those positions quite a bit! I don't really care. But I'm talking about its debate , and how an observer can be swayed by things other than facts. Young, impressionable minds, that will be making political decisions soon. There is a time for everything. A time to be respectful and kind, and a time to overturn the tables of the moneychangers. Archangel has started it in this thread, so I'll make a brief reference to it here. Maybe we can continue it in the appropriate forum. No problem. That's fine, take your time, get well soon!","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","08:12 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","352"
"09-02-2009","13107",24,"Matthew","367888","The question is, in order for these truths to be revealed, must the depiction of the events be a literally true, historically accurate account? That's where my answer is, ""No."" The scriptures are allegory: literally false, but revealing the truth.","marc9000","368018","If scriptures are literally false, but spiritually true, what is evolution? Is it literally true? If evolution is literally true and scriptures are spiritually true, there's not much question about which is going to be the ruling realm in a society, and which will be the subordinate realm, is there? Or can we call evolution theoretically true? Would that put it above the level of truth as spiritually true? Politically, in a society where separation of church and state have been established, it probably would.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","08:24 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","353"
"09-02-2009","13107",24,"Archangel","367937","You constantly prove you are interpreting the bible/the creation account from a fleshly/liberal perspective rather than from a spiritual perspective. And your constant reference to the TWO allegedly contradictory versions of Creation in Chapters 1 and 2 are perfect examples of the truth of this assessment. Here is an admitted theological apologetics site which deals with this issue rather than me just insisting how wrong your fleshly perceptions are. Apologetics Press - Are There Two Creation Accounts in Genesis? Fifth, it is argued that Genesis 1 represents animals as existing before man (24-26), yet Genesis 2 has Adam created before the animals are formed (19). The text of Genesis 2:19 merely suggests that the animals were formed before being brought to man; it says nothing about the relative origins of man and beast in terms of chronology. The critic is reading something into the text that simply is not there. Genesis 1 is the account of the creation of the universe and life on planet earth as it happened in chronological sequence. Genesis 2 is simply an expanded explanation of the events that occurred at the end of the sixth creation day - when God created human beings. Genesis one provides virtually no details about the creation of human beings (other than the idea that humans were created in the image of God). For a book that is dedicated to the relationship between humans and God, four verses seems like a rather poor explanation for the creation of God's preeminent creature. This is because Genesis one was never intended to stand apart from Genesis 2 and 3. Genesis 2 describes God's preparation of a specific location on earth (Eden) for habitation by the first human beings. Part of the confusion results from our English translations, which use the term ""earth"" when the Hebrew would better be translated ""land.""","marc9000","368021","That's a good link, but a long one, probably beyond the patience of most evolutionists. I'll try to condense it in this post - it's really quite simple. (as my 9th grade algebra teacher used to say ) From that link; (boldface mine) Genesis 2 is not chronology, whereas Genesis 1 is. Most verses in chapter two begin with the word and. It does not say and then it just says and. It is outlining how things are, not in the order that they were created. Genesis two is about the first humans, and a description of the place of habitation for them. That's all Genesis 2 is. Another good, and brief, link on the subject; Ask.com Search Engine - Better Web Search Those who are quick to read an English translation of the Bible and declare a contradiction also should keep in mind how the original language was used in that day and time. Sometimes language translations cannot be done perfectly. References to Bible scholars who are fluent in the original languages can sometimes be very revealing.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","08:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","354"

This means that either you do truly do not understand very simple concepts, despite having had them explained over and over and over.. or you are purposely misrepresenting things. Analyzing Genesis 1 and 2 is only a scientific endeavor if people insist it is the literal and historical truth.. you know.. people like you and Archie. Now, if it is said to be an allegorical and spiritual story, then analyzing Genesis 1 and 2 becomes a theological, philsophical and literary endeavor.
