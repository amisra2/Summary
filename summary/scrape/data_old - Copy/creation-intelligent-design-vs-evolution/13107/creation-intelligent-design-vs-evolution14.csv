"08-27-2009","13107",14,"iangb","365121","My favourite would be the fact that we can see objects in space which are more than 8,000 light years away. The (initial) common creationist response to this is that the speed of light 'must' have changed over time - however, there are several disproofs for this. The first is simple - there is a great amount of evidence that this is not the case: at the very most, it has not changed by very much. . Even better than that, however, is the case of Supernova 1987A . This supernova was surrounded by distant rings of gas which could be observed 'lighting up' as the light from the supernova hit it. The rings were big enough for an angular width to be measured (0.808 arcseconds diameter), and the time taken for the light to get from the central 'nova to the rings was measured. Basic trigonometry gives the result that, regardless of the current speed of light, the event took place 168,000 years ago. You might be able to get around this by making some headache-inducing assumptions, but (unsurprisingly, really) independent methods of distancing the supernova puts it at 168,000 light-years away, thus nicely supporting the observations made.","Archangel","367132","What is not only very interesting, but incredible is that in this whole thread this is the only post which has even attempted to answer the OP question.

I refer you to this link from post 145 http://www.4forums.com/political/366906-post145.html which has been ignored by the opposition, as usual. It offers the statistical evidence against what evolution proposes being mathematically possible. This is a consideration evolutionists just hate to consider which is why they will attack it with some link to Talk Origin rather than disprove its validity with valid mathematical statistics of their own. Here's an excerpt. Science Debunks Evolution Tom Phillips There has been much propaganda regarding the ""intelligent design"" controversy. In truth, creation/design is the scientific position; evolution is unscientific. By definition, science is based upon what we observe in the physical world and logical inference from what we observe. While microevolution --change within a species-- is observed and scientific, macroevolution, what ""evolution"" customarily means, is not. It asserts life somehow arose from non-life by chance. Such ""spontaneous generation,"" disproven long ago, has never been observed. Instead, we always observe that life comes from previous life --and, as Scripture teaches, ultimately from an ever-living God. Evolution also asserts one life form can change into another, higher form --something also never observed, and thus unscientific. Instead, we always observe exactly what Genesis 1 states numerous times: life reproduces ""according to its kind"" (vv. 11,12,21,24,25,29) --i.e., cats beget cats, crickets beget crickets, etc. They never change into something else. With microbiology we understand why. All life contains DNA, a genetic blueprint containing information. But purely material processes cannot create information, which originates only from a ""mind.""(1) Evolution proceeds via chance, the antithesis of information. The DNA in simple bacteria has several million specifications; mans has several billion.(2) The DNA molecule, the most complex structure we know, and unquestionably the most efficient copying device, with self-correcting processes, prevents one life form from ""changing"" into another. We are all copies of a copy of a copy, etc., going back to the very first human parents. Genesis 3:20 says Eve was ""the mother of all the living."" Science proved we are descendents of one woman, whose genes are carried by all mankind. Newsweeks 1-11-88 cover article (""Searching for Adam and Eve"") states: ""all modern men and women descended from this relatively recent woman whom scientists have taken to calling Eve.""(3) Even evolutionists accept this finding, based on the DNA in our mitochondria, the cells powerhouse.(4) Mitochondrial DNA comes unmixed, only from the mother; ""it preserves a family record that isnt scrambled every generation.""(5) The fossil record disproves evolution. If the first life form changed into another, higher form by gradual gene changes, and so on down the line, accounting for all life, then, quoting Darwin, ""the number of intermediate and transitional links, between all living and extinct species, must have been inconceivably great.""(6) The whole world would be awash in the remains of ""infinitely numerous connecting links.""(7) It isnt. Darwin conceded that fact, calling it ""the most obvious and serious objection"" against his theory.(8) He attests the ""sudden appearance"" of species, complete and distinct, in the fossil record(9) --just as if God created all life individually. Evolution is scientifically preposterous. Laws of probability are real scientific laws. Our DNA is ""unique"" because the odds of another person having our exact DNA are so remote we can dismiss that possibility altogether. Likewise with evolution. Nobel laureate Francis Crick calculated natures chances of producing one small protein: 1 in 10 to the 260th power.(10) Crick reminds us there are only 10 to the 80th power (1 followed by 80 zeros) atoms in the whole universe(11); he concludes even the elementary components of life ""cannot have arisen by pure chance.""(12) Mathematician Emile Borel states an event will never happen when the odds are less than 1 in 10 to the 50th power.(13) Sir Fred Hoyle calculated natures chances of producing the 2000 enzymes found in life: 1 in 10 to the 40,000th power.(14) He states: ""The Darwinian theory of evolution is shown to be plainly wrong.""(15) He concludes: ""Life cannot have had a random beginning(16)...but must have come from a cosmic intelligence."" (17) Nobel laureate Ernst Chain said: ""To postulate that the development and survival of the fittest is entirely a consequence of chance mutations seems to me a hypothesis based on no evidence and irreconciliable with the facts.""(18) Einstein said, ""I want to know how God created this world.""(19) Einstein knew the universe didnt happen by chance. Atheism and evolution are dead. Science destroyed them. Those claiming evolution is ""scientific"" must demonstrate that life can come from non-life by purely material processes, and that one life form can turn into another, higher form. Science demands it. Put up or shut up! The Defender - Commentary I must also comment on this Tornado in a Junk yard analogy you have scoffed at in order to oppose my position against evolution which was originally coined by Sir Fred Hoyle, who used it in Evolution From Space: A Theory of Cosmic Creationsim (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1981), p 24. Hoyle said that the chance that life forms might have emerged in this way is comparable with the chance that ""a tornado sweeping through a junk-yard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein."" --Nature, Nov 12, 1981 p 105. Why doesn't anyone on your side show the statistical probabilities that such a miraculous event of evolution occurring as stated by your religious proponents? It's because the numbers are too vast for you to imagine, and you don't want to deal with that reality.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:55 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","209"
"08-28-2009","13107",14,"None","None","None","iangb","367220","Hey, wow, I missed a link. Unfortunately, Archangel, your timing is really bad. I'm about half an hour away from moving an hour up the motorway into a new flat, which is unlikely to have the internet for a week and a half or so. I may come back here after the weekend, but I probably won't be online until that point. Don't think I've forgotten you! Very quickly before I go, a brief post: To start with, could you respond to my previous post and define what 'macroevolution' means to you? The quoted article in your post above gives yet another definition, which I will rubbish shortly. Now... your link: a brief dissemination. I'll probably try and bulk it up a bit when I have time next week if needed, this is just some initial responses without research, calculations or nuthin'. First paragraph: Rambling without any proof. Presumably proof is to follow Second paragraph: This jumps straight into the 'misunderstandings' pool when it states that 'macroevolution means spontanious generation of life from non-life'. This is entirely false: life from non-life is abiogenesis, which is irrelevant to the truth of evolution. God could have created that 'life from non-life' in the first place, which then went on to evolve into us (not that I believe this; but it's hypothetically true). The second paragraph also mentions an animal evolving into another animal. Presumably it doesn't mean 'a new species emerging', as this has been documented. Instead, it must mean the second of my 'macroevolution' definitions in my above post - simply that the name has changed. It's a fairly silly argument: technically, the new species of mosquito had a name: ""Mosquito species B"" as opposed to ""mosquito species Z"". As did the panda shepherds, mutated from German shepherd (I seem to remember, no time to check). Furthermore, if the name did change you could simply go higher up the naming tree and claim that it hadn't met your standards: A wolf evolving into a dog is still a canine, or a monkey evolving into a man is still a mammal. Heck, you could go for ""a dino evolving into a bird is still a vertibrate, this changes nothing!"" In short, I still need that detailed definition of macroevolution from you, Archie. Third paragraph: This refers to the 'losing genetic information' argument that I was talking about two or three posts ago: arguing that each generation simply has less information than the previous one. As I said before, this is directly contradicted by the panda shepherds and their new, mutation-formed gene. There are a fair few other examples of new information being created, but again I don't have time to link to them. TalkOrigins would know, if you dare to look. Fourth paragraph: I even mentioned this argument in passing: it makes the claim that we should be finding more of what it dubs 'transitional fossils'. However, this ignores the fact that all fossils are transitional, between their parents and their offspring. It's simply that there are some gaping holes in the fossil record; unsurprising, when you consider how unlikely it is that an animal will become fossilised rather than eaten. Furthermore, the paragraph is out of date, especially with it's quotes; most of the evolutionary history of most of the animals existent today have been traced back through 'transitional' fossils. There have been a lot more fossils found recently, as techniques are improving and - more importantly - people are actually getting funding to go out and look for them (perhaps unsurprisingly, this boom in research grants came just after the first jurassic park film came out). Fifth paragraph: Now we come to the newer stuff, the maths. Ironically this is the paragraph that I'm going to have least time to do anything on, as the paragraph itself doesn't mention specific methodologies (though they may be mentioned in the citations), so I can't dispute them until I know what they are, which I will do when I get the chance. I can guess, though - the mathematician looked at the pattern of atoms in the carbon molecules and calculated the probability that, if he were to choose atoms at random from an appropriate sample size, he'd pick them in exactly the right order - which is vanishingly small. However, this ignores the fact that this isn't how the molecules formed. Like all carbon-based chemicals, they formed by a series of joinings, where each one was governed by physical laws. For example, I can react bromine with propene and be guarenteed to get propane 1-bromide (or something with a similar name, it's been a while since I did any chemistry) - despite the fact that all there are 11 atoms in propane 1-bromide, of 3 different types - and if I were to pick atoms at random like the mathematician did, that makes it a fairly small chance that I'd end up with the right molecule. Proof of God at work, or simply evidence of intramolecular forces? I'd just add to this that Hoyle, along with your other quotes, are back to discussion abiogenesis , not evolution . As pointed out earlier, there's a big difference. Fifth paragraph: Back to the rambling of the first paragraph, although the error here is that the author linked 'evolution' with 'atheism'. You can have atheistic creationists (Jakers), just as you can have theistic evolutionists (Matthew) - the two are independent of each other. Finally, your comment on the 'tornado in a junk yard'. That Hoyle came up with the wording is irrelevant: Hoyle is the bloke who did the maths above, so he was likely to say this. This simply further refutes Hoyle's maths - he assumes that there were no extra laws governing evolution (or abiogenesis, which is what the quote was originally pertaining to). Secondly, Hoyle used the 'tornado in a junkyard' analogy to suggest that order cannot come from disorder. The very analogy disproves that: what else is a tornado, if not an ordered coming-together of the winds which 'should' be impossible if approached from a purely mathematical angle which disregards all the other rules? Take all the air particles, calculate the chance that each individual one has the appropriate vector of motion and you will get a vanishingly small chance that tornadoes exist, just as Hoyle got a tiny chance that ammino acids would 'spontaniously' form. Both Hoyle and the tornado mathematician would be ignoring the fact that there are interatomic forces which can cause order to arise from chaos.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:00 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","210"
