"08-12-2009","13107",2,"Archangel","365155","[B]All you have revealed is your own idiocy by making this statement without supporting it with evidence. Here is my scientific link which clearly points out that a light year is a measure of distance, not time. So what is true idiocy is your incorrect criticism of me while ignoring Iangb's misuse of the term by using it as a measure of time rather than distance.","T.Q","365189","I need evidence to support my conclusion that you don't know what you're talking about? OK, fine, I submit every post of yours to support my assertion. We know, you numbskull. That's what makes this an example of your idiocy. You weren't correcting anybody-everybody knows a light year is a measurement of distance, not time-except you apparently, as you seemed proud as a peacock to point it out, even though no one had made the mistake. What will be really funny is watching you try to find that mistake by Iangb. Let's see it Archie!","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","01:12 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","17"

I have frequently seen creationists talk about a light year as a measure of time. They often tell us that it takes light years for light from stars to reach us. I think that Archie is confused because he has heard it from ignorant creationists so often that he accuses those here of making the error. I too would am interested in knowing where iangb misused the term, certainly not in this thread. Maybe Archie has a reading comprehension problem.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","02:29 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","18"

"08-12-2009","13107",2,"unkerpaulie","365168","It would be bad enough if God were just a liar. God makes his believers look like complete XXXXXX. Did you really read what he wrote? Time is plastic? We finite humans measure time as linear for our convenience? Where do these ideas come from? What's more, it makes perfect sense to believers. The wisdom of man is foolishness to God. Its perfectly logical, and in fact mandatory, to support baseless incredulous claims by inventing more baseless incredulous claims. It would be foolish to do otherwise. I say good for them. Whatever makes them happy I guess.","obvious_child","365219","Well, not quite. Some religious folk are so bound to their beliefs that they will engage in mental gymnastics to preserve such beliefs. Look at Archie. He's argued that oil is not a hydrocarbon, that tv props and modern art is proof of creationism and that plates don't move. It's nuts just how far some of them will go to preserve their interpretation, even to the point of declaring others of their faith who disagree not to be of the faith. What is more interesting is often that such sentiments lie in Social Conservatives who bash the same kind of faith that some have in politicians like Obama. They have no problem having such faith in a being with no evidence, but have nothing but contempt for people who have such faith in a real, living breathing man. I guess so. I just wish they'd keep it a private matter. Religion should be between you, your respective religious Earthly authority and your respective Deity or Deities. And no one else.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","04:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","21"
"08-12-2009","13107",2,"Archangel","365215","Gee, the secular humanists have been busy today. But if the light speed was only thousands of times faster early in human history than it is now, then Einstein's equation E = mc2 means that masses must have been millions of times smaller at that time in order for energy to be conserved. If so, then neither humans nor air would have been heavy enough to keep from floating away from our planet and life would have been impossible. This obviously was not the case, so it does not appear that the speed of light has changed in such a way as to avoid an old universe (Newman, 1991)...... Instead we see what it would have been doing if it had existed, but it didn't - fictitious history! Not just ""appearance of age,"" but a full, complex history of events that never happened. And not just for a few isolated objects, but for the vast majority of stars and star-clusters, and for all the galaxies and galaxy-clusters in the universe. To such extremes are we led if we are determined that we must interpret the Bible to teach a young earth, in spite of the evidence God has provided us in nature.","obvious_child","365222","Well, not compared your argument. You just argued God was a liar of celestial proportions. And you really outta to start reading your articles: By your own argument, you believe the Biblical God is a liar.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","04:36 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","22"

Hence why we laugh at it when it is presented as a viable alternative to testable fact. What is more interesting is that Archie who believed unless I'm mistaken that his God is perfect, is in fact a huge liar. Btw, did you read the link I posted? It took 20 pages before a Creationist took a stab at the arguments. Archie didn't even try.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","04:41 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","24"

The IBRI have an intimate relationship with god but dont understand that trying to explain gods magic with science is impossible? Its like they dont understand their own argument and makes me wonder if they know anything about god and science at all. For those reasons I feel that the IBRI is not worthy of our attention besides all you have to do is look at their web site to see they are small time.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","08:09 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","25"
"08-12-2009","13107",2,"None","None","None","unkerpaulie","365252","I still can't get over archie's response to the distance of stars objection to a young universe. It really puts into perspective the utter hopelessness and futilty in attempt to discuss anything with closed-minded fundamentalists. And his response is so authoritative, as though he could just as easily link us to an essay God himself wrote as evidence to back up what he's saying. This is really getting old. We come to a dilema that is much bigger than science vs the bible. How far off rational thinking is too far? What kind of mental bulimia must one undergo to reach this stage? Sometimes the metaphor is made to compare religion to a mind-altering drug, but its mostly tongue-in-cheek sarcasm. But I think there's a serious problem here. This is starting to resemble dementia. And I don't blame God, or the bible, or moses and the other israelite scribes who borrowed stories from other cultures to fill in their history and keep their people in check with myths and boogeyman tales. I blame the believers today, who have all the tools and information in front of them, and still make the decision to believe lies and folklore. And to decay their own brains in the process. Archie, get help dude. I'm not even bashing you or anything. This isn't me being snide or sarcastic. If you don't take a look at what you're saying and really try to figure out what is going on to make you come up with these kinds of responses, then I don't know what else to tell you.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","26"

"08-13-2009","13107",2,"Accipiter","365072","Fellow atheists and agnostics, what are your most effective arguments for disproving biblical creation?","obvious_child","365265","While I'm not an atheist, you actually can't disprove biblical creation to diehards because they do not listen to facts, reason or anything resembling rational discourse. And frankly speaking, anyone with a functioning brain can look at the facts themselves without me saying anything and conclude that literal biblical creationism is total XXXX. Look at Arch. We point out how his argument makes God a liar and what he does do? Insult us.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","12:01 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","29"
"08-13-2009","13107",2,"obvious_child","365264","Interesting coming from someone who just argued his God is a liar of epic proportions.","Archangel","365276","Really? I have argued that God is an epic liar? Can you point out me arguing that at all you EPIC LIAR? Once again you are interpreting what I have said through that sick and unbalanced mind of yours, and then extrapolating that I am now arguing in favor of calling my God an EPIC LIAR. Is it absolutely impossible for you to debate issues while actually responding to what we really say rather than reading into what we say and redefining it to fit your warped and perverse perspective? I mean, how sick and disturbed must your powers of reason and logic be for you to interpret my argument that Man, because of our linear view of time, is misreading the fact that God placed the stars in space at the same time much more recently than it appears to us to have occurred, that God is then an epic liar? Is God responsible for how we interpret the evidence when we attempt to do it apart from placing Him first and foremost into the equation? Is He the liar? Or are you who think like that deceiving yourselves by ignoring His place in the creation of time and space? It is just completely beyond you to think from an honest and objective perspective, isn't it obvious child! But for a more practical answer, imagine this. In the beginning, space was a void which spanned all of eternity. Only one object/energy source encompassed all of it from one end of its massive emptiness to the other, and that person was my God Yahweh. And in one second or minutes time, he spoke all of the stars that have ever existed, at different intensities and strengths, which causes them to burn out at different times. But he placed them at the very inner and outer limits of time and space at that time. Liken it to a farmer with a hand full of seeds. He pulls back his arm and throws those seeds to the end of the plot of land he is sowing at that time. To the ants on the ground, if they measured the time it would take to reach the farthest seed, it would represent a great distance, but to the farmer it was just one arms throw in time to disperse hundreds of seeds at one time. Now here we are as finite creatures who can only see time from our linear perspective. Time is plastic. Our linear measure is man made for our convenience only. That you place what we call the measure of so called light years is arbitrary at best. But I am getting too deep for you and this discussion. The point is that our God has the ability to place the stars in every corner of not only what we again, arbitrarily call our universe, but throughout all of time and space. But to we puny finite humans who have invented telescopes, it appears that these stars we are seeing today are ancient based on the perceived yet arbitrarily arrived at distance you believe they are from us. But since you are unable to even grasp the hugeness of our God, you also fail to appreciate that light years are a measure of distance rather than time. So by that definition alone, it is foolish to equate it with Earth time rather than Gods ability to reach any distant place in time and space and place stars there.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:04 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","30"
