The (initial) common creationist response to this is that the speed of light 'must' have changed over time - however, there are several disproofs for this. The first is simple - there is a great amount of evidence that this is not the case: at the very most, it has not changed by very much. . Even better than that, however, is the case of Supernova 1987A . This supernova was surrounded by distant rings of gas which could be observed 'lighting up' as the light from the supernova hit it. The rings were big enough for an angular width to be measured (0.808 arcseconds diameter), and the time taken for the light to get from the central 'nova to the rings was measured. Basic trigonometry gives the result that, regardless of the current speed of light, the event took place 168,000 years ago. You might be able to get around this by making some headache-inducing assumptions, but (unsurprisingly, really) independent methods of distancing the supernova puts it at 168,000 light-years away, thus nicely supporting the observations made.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","06:43 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","2"

Simply put, I'll let this link answer your distance of stars claim. http://www.ibri.org/Tracts/lttmetct.htm But for a more practical answer, imagine this. In the beginning, space was a void which spanned all of eternity. Only one object/energy source encompassed all of it from one end of its massive emptiness to the other, and that person was my God Yahweh. And in one second or minutes time, he spoke all of the stars that have ever existed, at different intensities and strengths, which causes them to burn out at different times. But he placed them at the very inner and outer limits of time and space at that time. Liken it to a farmer with a hand full of seeds. He pulls back his arm and throws those seeds to the end of the plot of land he is sowing at that time. To the ants on the ground, if they measured the time it would take to reach the farthest seed, it would represent a great distance, but to the farmer it was just one arms throw in time to disperse hundreds of seeds at one time. Now here we are as finite creatures who can only see time from our linear perspective. Time is plastic. Our linear measure is man made for our convenience only. That you place what we call the measure of so called light years is arbitrary at best. But I am getting too deep for you and this discussion. The point is that our God has the ability to place the stars in every corner of not only what we again, arbitrarily call our universe, but throughout all of time and space. But to we puny finite humans who have invented telescopes, it appears that these stars we are seeing today are ancient based on the perceived yet arbitrarily arrived at distance you believe they are from us. But since you are unable to even grasp the hugeness of our God, you also fail to appreciate that light years are a measure of distance rather than time. So by that definition alone, it is foolish to equate it with Earth time rather than Gods ability to reach any distant place in time and space and place stars there.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","08:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","3"

Do creationists even pay attention to their own arguments? As for a ""light year"" being a distance and not a time, that is correct. It is the distance that light travels in a year . You do understand that, don't you Archie? So if a stellar object is measured to be 170 million light years away, how long did it take the light from that object to get here?

Look at Archie. He's argued that oil is not a hydrocarbon, that tv props and modern art is proof of creationism and that plates don't move. It's nuts just how far some of them will go to preserve their interpretation, even to the point of declaring others of their faith who disagree not to be of the faith. What is more interesting is often that such sentiments lie in Social Conservatives who bash the same kind of faith that some have in politicians like Obama. They have no problem having such faith in a being with no evidence, but have nothing but contempt for people who have such faith in a real, living breathing man. I guess so.

"08-12-2009","13107",2,"Archangel","365215","Gee, the secular humanists have been busy today. But if the light speed was only thousands of times faster early in human history than it is now, then Einstein's equation E = mc2 means that masses must have been millions of times smaller at that time in order for energy to be conserved. If so, then neither humans nor air would have been heavy enough to keep from floating away from our planet and life would have been impossible. This obviously was not the case, so it does not appear that the speed of light has changed in such a way as to avoid an old universe (Newman, 1991)...... Instead we see what it would have been doing if it had existed, but it didn't - fictitious history! Not just ""appearance of age,"" but a full, complex history of events that never happened. And not just for a few isolated objects, but for the vast majority of stars and star-clusters, and for all the galaxies and galaxy-clusters in the universe. To such extremes are we led if we are determined that we must interpret the Bible to teach a young earth, in spite of the evidence God has provided us in nature.","obvious_child","365222","Well, not compared your argument.

But since you are unable to even grasp the hugeness of our God, you also fail to appreciate that light years are a measure of distance rather than time. So by that definition alone, it is foolish to equate it with Earth time rather than Gods ability to reach any distant place in time and space and place stars there.","Accipiter","365281","The problem with this idea is that once you arrive at the belief that god is magic no further learning is needed.

"08-14-2009","13107",4,"None","None","None","Matthew","365426","May I chime in here a moment? I'm a religious person, and a theist. On the other hand, I'm not a creationist and I'm deeply opposed to Biblical literalism in general. Two things. First, why has Archie been allowed to hijack this thread? Accipiter's original request has been drowned out among the hoopla. We shouldn't fall for this, any more than a congressman or senator should fall for the disruptive tactics being employed at town hall meetings. Put him on ignore if you have to, but whatever you do, don't take the bait. Second, as to that original point, my own experience has been rather ironic on this score, I suppose: the single most effective thing to use in arguing against creationism is the Bible itself . After all, creationists typically claim a Biblical basis for the views. So rather than confronting them with something external to that basis -- which is all too easy for them to dismiss -- confront them with that basis itself. The fact is, the book of Genesis has two versions of the creation story, not one -- and they're not consistent with one another. In the first, humans are created after animals, and no temporal order is provided for the creation of the human sexes. In the second, Adam is created first, then all the animals (as God works through a trial-and-error process of making the first man a partner, without success), and then finally Eve is created. So were humans created last or (at least in part) first? It simply cannot be both. And then we have the historical information about the text. The second of the two stories was actually the first to be recorded, during the reign of Solomon in the 10th century BCE. It has a stunningly anthropomorphic conception of God in many ways -- God breathes, he walks, he has to call out to Adam and Eve to find them. And he creates in very ""hands-on"" fashion, pulling Adam from the earth and Eve from Adam The first story was recorded much later, following the period of the Babylonian Exile. Jewish identity was maintained in Babylon through such practices as circumcision, inter-marriage rules, and the rigorous observance of the Sabbath -- and this last practice is provided theological justification in the retelling of the creation story. God himself is depicted not as a manual craftsman, but as speaking things into being. (And if any creationist ever provides a mechanism for how that could work, they'd at least be on the way to creation ""science."" I'm not holding my breath.) Historically speaking, one thing that is also abundantly clear is that the the books of the Pentateuch, including Genesis, and including the two creation accounts, were not written by Moses, despite tradition. And of course, if one wants to make that authorial attribution, then one has the additional problem of explaining why a single author would compose two mutually inconsistent accounts of the same event. I have seen people get very uncomfortable with this. Most, I think, aren't even really aware of the problems, and when confronted with it they get defensive. What I try to do is point out to them that even though these stories cannot both be literally true, they can still reveal truths about God in relation to the world, rooted in personal experiences of ancient believers and expressed in terms pertinent to those experiences. I try to point them to a middle path, where giving up literalism doesn't mean giving up faith. Obviously, those who are atheists or agnostics won't necessarily want to encourage people to hold on to their religious beliefs! But I would recommend that, even if you don't wish to promote Christianity in particular or religion more generally, observing that abandoning literalism isn't equivalent to abandoning religion altogether can still be an effective tactic at overcoming their creationist views. Even if it doesn't work right away, it may bear fruit later. It might also be good to remember that much of the scholarship on which non-literalist interpretation is based pre-dates Darwin and occurred within the Church, not without. Throughout the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Biblical scholars in European universities (especially in Germany) delved into the textual and historical issues pertaining to the holy scriptures, and many theologians explored their consequences. It is that exploration that we can thank for liberal theology on the one hand, but also for literalism on the other. Darwin was, in a sense, just the icing on the cake. Just my two cents.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","11:56 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","58"

If ""Original Sin"" is taken as a metaphor for that, I don't see a problem. The fact is, every human being sometimes behaves as she shouldn't, in greater or lesser degree.

It could also be seen in any number of other ways, many of which would be compatible with one another. But human nature is not exclusively or even predominantly sinful. If ""Original Sin"" is taken to mean that it is, I do consider that a problem. For the fact also is, every human being sometimes does good, whether great or small. This could be seen as following God's laws, emulating God's love, or again, in any number of other ways, often compatible. Well, as I said above, I think everybody sins from time to time. It's certainly the case that some sin more than others. And some sins have more harmful and far-reaching consequences than others. But everybody sins.

Maybe I'll get a chance later to hear more about the idea of christianity without a literal creation, but this is not the right thread for it. Personally, the evidence that put the biggest dent in my belief in creation (and, by extension, christianity) is the very obvious lack of supernatural activity in modern times (the last, say, 200 years or so). There is a trend in the bible concerning miraculous activity. The further back you go in history, the grander the miracle in terms of scale, power and effect on history. By the time we get the new testament, miracles seem to be diminished to local and personal performances. Today, the only miracles we hear about are those that no third party can witness. And the nature of the reports of these miracles make them seem dubious as they can almost be always written off as figments of one's imagination or explained naturally. So what happened? Did God's supply of power run dry? Is he saving up his miraculous reserves for some big showing? If God cannot create the miraculous today, then its clear that he never did it thousands of years ago, particularly at a time when superstition was at an all time high and scientific knowledge was at an all time low.

There is no ""arbtrary"" about it, it is a straightforward question of mathematics and geometry. No trickster gods necessary. "" In order to calculate how far away a star is, astronomers use a method called parallax. During Earth's orbit, near stars seem to shift their position against the farther stars. This is called parallax shift. By observing the distance of the shift and knowing the diameter of the Earth's orbit, astronomers are able to calculate the parallax angle across the sky. If you follow the line on the diagram from the Earth in January to the appearance of the star in January, then the line from the Earth in July to the appearance of the star in July, you will see that they intersect in the middle. This is the true location of the star. The distance of the star can then be measured using trigonometry. The smaller the parallax shift, the farther away from earth the star is. This method is only accurate for stars within a few hundred light-years of Earth, since when the stars are very far away, the parallax shift is too small to measure. The method of measuring distance to stars beyond 100 light-years is to use Cepheid variable stars. These stars change in brightness over time, with a regular period. This period is directly related to the luminosity of the star--brighter stars have a longer period of light variation. Comparing the apparent brightness of the star to the true brightness allows the astronomer to calculate the distance to the star. This method was discovered by American astronomer Henrietta Leavitt in 1912 and used in the early part of the century to find distances to many globular clusters. .... "" How do astronomers measure the distance to stars? Is it accurate? To persist in the stupidity of denying this, a method not found wanting in 100 years, and of fact that the unit of distance measurement of light YEARS can not be used to measure time, is frankly mad. One light-year is equal to 9,500,000,000,000 kilometers. That is the distance traveled by a photon in one year. If we triangulate the distance between two stars which are equally distant from us as being 9,500,000,000,000 kilometres, then we can confidently say that light from one of those stars will take one year to travel to the other one. It follows from this that stars one hundred times further apart will be 100 light years from each other, and so on. The distance can be a measure of the time light takes to get between two points. If two points are a million light-years apart, then light will take a million years to get from one to the other.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:24 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","83"

But I must compliment you pinfold, as much as you continue to miss the point I was making, at least you took the time to post a thoughtful response. Here's what I said though, and it's all about the FACT that just because stars appear to be hundreds, thousands, or even millions of light years away from us based on our Linear perspective of time and distance, that doesn't mean that the stars were actually placed there that long ago. Here again is what I said: But for a more practical answer, imagine this. In the beginning, space was a void which spanned all of eternity. Only one object/energy source encompassed all of it from one end of its massive emptiness to the other, and that person was my God Yahweh. And in one second or minutes time, he spoke all of the stars that have ever existed, at different intensities and strengths, which causes them to burn out at different times. But he placed them at the very inner and outer limits of time and space at that time. Liken it to a farmer with a hand full of seeds. He pulls back his arm and throws those seeds to the end of the plot of land he is sowing at that time. To the ants on the ground, if they measured the time it would take to reach the farthest seed, it would represent a great distance, but to the farmer it was just one arms throw in time to disperse hundreds of seeds at one time. Now here we are as finite creatures who can only see time from our linear perspective. Time is plastic. Our linear measure is man made for our convenience only. That you place what we call the measure of so called light years is arbitrary at best. But I am getting too deep for you and this discussion. The point is that our God has the ability to place the stars in every corner of not only what we again, arbitrarily call our universe, but throughout all of time and space. But to we puny finite humans who have invented telescopes, it appears that these stars we are seeing today are ancient, based on the perceived yet arbitrarily arrived at distance you believe they are from us.

Your theory about God ""throwing"" stars into the universe, yet allowing the light from all these stars to be visible on earth within a single day, requires God to have increased the speed of light by trillions of times.

Don't forget that possibility! Granted, there is no conceivable way to test either possibility anyway.... At least in the ancient Aristotelian/Ptolemaic cosmologies employed by most early and medieval Christian thinkers, the distances are not so vast as to raise the issue of God's honesty in the first place. That, for me, is why creationism is such a preposterous idea. Regardless of whether the untestable changing-speed-of-light idea or the equally untestable photons-created-in-mid-transit is how God did it, he's a deceiver either way. He gave us the power of reason, which serves us perfectly well for explaining any number of natural phenomena. But use it on some phenomena, and it gives us systematically false results -- even though God himself set things up that way, and (as Descartes noted) gave us no way to discern that falsehood.

I'm actually proud of you for your honesty. I listened to the audio twice. Some of the ideas I'm familiar with. Chuck offers quite a few theories, many of them which are plausible to a certain extent, but all of which have inherent problems. Apparently the idea is to have the listener pick one of the theories that seems to suit that individual the best. The theory that he mentioned that closely resembles what you are arguing here is that God created the earth only 6000 to 10000 years ago, but created it to look like an old planet, complete with fossils, degraded isotopes, varves, and other forms of evidence that suggests that the earth is much older. The reasoning extends from the idea that when God made Adam, he was already a grown and mature man even though he was created that same day. So if God could make a brand new 1-day old man complete with physical signs of age, he could also create a brand new planet and universe, complete with the appearance of being billions of years old. The good thing about this is that, in the creationist's mind, it explains the evidence of a very old earth while maintain that earth is actually young. But the bad thing is that it makes God out to be an epic liar. Why would God think it would be necessary to make the earth look old? Why would God think that he would have to lie to his creation? Couldn't God make a functional brand new planet look brand new? Were fossils miles below the surface of the earth really necessary details that God felt he had to create so that 6000-10000 years into the future his lies would be exposed? Couldn't God have prevented humans from learning the speed of light or principles of trigonometry? For all the years that man was ignorant of the evidence we now know, the biblical creation was completely unquestioned. But surely God would have known that the keeping lid on his deceptive scheme was running out of time. The evidence should never have been there, but it is. And if God made the world to look older than it really was, then surely he would have known that eventually this would have happened. Archangel, do you really believe, personally, that God actually created the earth 6000-10000 years ago, but also created multiple forms of evidence that would make the earth look like it is billions of years old?","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:49 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","111"

Some of the ideas I'm familiar with. Chuck offers quite a few theories, many of them which are plausible to a certain extent, but all of which have inherent problems. Apparently the idea is to have the listener pick one of the theories that seems to suit that individual the best. The theory that he mentioned that closely resembles what you are arguing here is that God created the earth only 6000 to 10000 years ago, but created it to look like an old planet, complete with fossils, degraded isotopes, varves, and other forms of evidence that suggests that the earth is much older. The reasoning extends from the idea that when God made Adam, he was already a grown and mature man even though he was created that same day. So if God could make a brand new 1-day old man complete with physical signs of age, he could also create a brand new planet and universe, complete with the appearance of being billions of years old. Archangel, do you really believe, personally, that God actually created the earth 6000-10000 years ago, but also created multiple forms of evidence that would make the earth look like it is billions of years old?","Archangel","366684","Actually, he is arguing that the remnants of Noah's flood which you interpret as evidence of an old earth actually supports the young earth belief system. For example, he points out that there are no recent fossil layers, nor are any recent strata being formed leaving evidence of recent events for future generations to observe as evidence that this time period existed at all apart from the after affects of floods. All fossils decompose into nothingness in todays world, yet you ignore this evidence since it doesn't fit with your perceived fairy tales. He points to trees standing upright or at angles through strata which your side estimates cover from hundreds of thousands to millions of years of evolution and he points out that you will ignore the reality that this evidence should kill your theory in its tracks for any rational thinkers. But that doesn't stop the evolutionist from making excuses and fallacious justifications in order to get around these realities. These are just a couple of the untold numbers of inconsistencies in evolutionary theory which your side will either ignore or explain away rather than face. But strangely enough, for the creationist who accepts the flood as a true historical event, all of these realities are completely consistent with multiple world wide fossil layers being laid down on top of each other as the waters of the Great Flood receded. Here's a modern day example of what I am saying: http://www.creationresearch.org/crsq..._2b/31_2b.html Especially since you can't even produce evidence that fossilization and stratification occurs today apart from major upheavals such as the great flood which lay down these layers immediately, rather than slowly over eons as evolution suggests. Although Adam was created mature and with the wisdom and knowledge to name every animal on Earth, God didn't lie or deceive at all in His creation of the Earth with its appearance of age in any way. The evidence of that is that we believers can still see Gods hand in what actually occurred based on our faith in Him and His word. It is all a matter of interpretation of the available evidence and your great error is in attempting to define the evidence while erasing God from the equation.

Basic probability tells you that the odds of a blob of primordial ooze morphing into a man, regardless of how much time has passed, are so remote that mathematicians regard it as impossible.

Yes, evolution is the faith of atheism because it replaces God with man.

Darwin's cousin, Francis Galton, was a pioneer in the early field of eugenics which was the study of skills by ethnic groups. While Galton's work was relatively harmless, Hitler's work -- to synthesize natural selection by exterminating a race of people -- was not.

"08-26-2009","13107",10,"iangb","366866","1: This claims that evolution is not a science, because it is not observable. However, what creationists term 'micro'-evolution has been observed - and used by humanity - for millennia. Breeting fatter pigs, faster horses or more hairy dogs, for example. More recently, engineering vaccines for the latest evolution of the flu virus. Furthermore, I doubt many creationists have difficulties with the concept of 'forensic science' - which, just like some parts of evolution, looks at the evidence left behind in order to figure out what happened. Forensic science sometimes leads people to the wrong conclusion, but for evolution our 'crime scene' is huge , and all of the evidence so far points in evolutions direction. 2: This is more a consequence of the first claim than a seperate argument. It runs ' If evolution is not a science, calling it as such devalues the real sciences'. See my answer to statement 1. I'd add that forensic science, just like evolution, is supported by work done in the fields of physics, chemistry and biology. 3. A rehash of the 'tornado in a junkyard' argument. It's an accurate analogy - as soon as you can find me a skyscraper that is subject to the same rules as evolving organisms (reproduction, mutation/variation, natural selection). Until then, it's all so much wasted words. 4. Another rehash of the 'tornado in a junkyard' argument, only this time comparing a bridge with genetic code, rather than a skyscraper with an organism. Nope, sorry, bridges don't reproduce either. 5. It's almost a rehash of the 'tornado' argument from above - it looks at the probability that a single object ('ancient slime') will 'morph' into, say, Fred Phelps. Perhaps a bad choice. As soon as you can find me a person who was once a blob of ancient slime, this analogy will, like the others, become a valid one. If you mean 'the probability that the slime evolved into us', then you run up against the mount improbable argument. It's unlikely that it happened in a single step, or even in a series of steps, if you ignore the fact that there are 'safety lines' in place - that is, if you ignore the fact that natural selection will kill off all those that start to go the wrong way. It's also fallacious thinking because of anthropism - it didn't matter what the slime evolved into, because whatever it did evolve into would still be sitting here arguing the point. As an example - consider your history, and the incredibly unlikely chance that you would be sitting right where you are today, with the clothes you chose this morning and the DNA which mixed from your parents just so. As Penfold says in your signature - if the universe was not as it is, it would be different. That doesn't mean that God has intervened specifically to make 'this' universe the one that has happened over, say, one where you were born a girl. Throw a million sided dice. The chances of it getting any specific side are tiny - but one side is guaranteed to be chosen. 6. Like #2 above it, this takes the conclusions of a previous argument (#5) and runs with them, stating that if evolution is mathematically impossible then it is a faith, which make evolution a religion. Apart from the fact that my response to #5 deals with this... on what basis are you claiming, Archangel, that because something is a religion then it is a fraud? 7. Evolution has been used as an excuse for atrocities such as racism, etc. Well, so has religion - no condoms to Africa, the Spanish Inquisition, rampant sexism, etc. So what? That doesn't affect the validity of the idea.","Archangel","366906","Like a narrator you comment on each point, offering your own opinion why you disagree with them. But in typical fashion you don't actually refute one point with solid evidence of anything. So let me give commenting on each point made, a shot. OK? I quoted your response above so others can see how utterly shallow your commentary is. Seven Reasons Why Evolution is a Fraud 1. It's not science. You cannot observe, test and repeat the ever-changing ideas that are little more than wild speculation. This is the true and accepted definition of a true science, yet you only refer to the observable aspect of it while ignoring the testable and repeatable aspect of a valid and true science. 2. It devalues real science. Chemistry, physics and biology don't have the same problems of legitimacy because they are real sciences, not philosophical wannabes trying to appear legit. Your attempt to make an excuse which disregards this critique ignores the very accurate claim that rather than being a science, evolution is more a philosophy which makes assumptions not in evidence according to real science. 3. Complex engineering. Do you ever drive past a skyscraper and think to yourself 'Gee, I guess billions of years of random chance could have just as easily assembled all of that glass, steel and concrete as well as a team of engineers, architects, construction workers working from blueprints? Of course not! But that's what evolutionists would have you believe in when it comes to living organisms. You offer cliches like ""Tornados in a junkyard"" to marginalize a valid point while once again never actually showing that the statistical claims made are false. Is all we will get from you nothing more than cheap lip service as you insist you're right? 4. Genetics. The programming code of life, according to evolutionists, is just a series of biochemical accidents and mutations. If you believe this, I have a bridge in New York that's for sale. The infinitely complex engineering of this code means that it did not come about via 'natural selection,' aka random chance. Again, you repeat nonsense while actually refuting or disputing NOTHING here with facts which prove this statement wrong or factually incorrect. 5. Mathematically Impossible. Basic probability tells you that the odds of a blob of primordial ooze morphing into a man, regardless of how much time has passed, are so remote that mathematicians regard it as impossible. Emile Borel and Fred Hoyle are just two mathematicians who reject evolution on statistical grounds. Again, you offer shallow platitudes while proving nothing at all which refutes what my link says. Why is this in every response? Because there is no actual factual evidence anywhere which is undeniable and absolute with which to refute what is being said here. The Defender - Commentary 6. Evolution is a religion. Yes, evolution is the faith of atheism because it replaces God with man. When you've conned yourself into believing that some kind of ancient slime morphed into progressively complex and directional life forms, you are in the realm of faith, not science. So basically what I am to take away here is that all you have as a refutation for these 7 reasons why evolution is a fraud is the cliche that these are nothing more than a tornado in a junkyard, right? Because that is all you have offered in almost every response. How imaginative paulie. 7. Racism. This is the ugly secret that evolutionists don't want to discuss; that Darwin, Huxley and many of the early advocates of evolution stated publicly that Asians, Africans, Australian Aborigines and other non-white, non-European groups were evolutionary throwbacks. Darwin's cousin, Francis Galton, was a pioneer in the early field of eugenics which was the study of skills by ethnic groups. While Galton's work was relatively harmless, Hitler's work -- to synthesize natural selection by exterminating a race of people -- was not. And here I get the response that religion has done bad things also, so it's ok that evolution was founded on the principles of eugenics, racism and white superiority. But you can't deny the truth of it and what the roots of this philosophy represent. So to summarize, no refutation of anything said here. Just excuses via apologetics as you continue to ignore reality.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","11:48 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","145"

"08-26-2009","13107",10,"iangb","366922","Quite. Which is one of the reasons why there are all these incredulous people standing around looking puzzled that YEC is still given credence. Well, that's not entirely true, not is it an entirely valid point. There's only four real arguments here - variants on 'tornado in a junkyard', variants on 'not a science', variants on 'mathematically impossible' and one count of 'founded on racism'. I addressed each of these, explaining why each one was either inaccurate or irrelevant and while I offered no evidence beyond my explanations, neither did the article (apart from a generic reference to two mathematicians). I'll go over them again, but this time I'll simplify them down to those four points. I bet I can even find you some semi-relevant talkorigins pages, too. Oh, and in your comments on point #6... I'm iangb, not unkerpaulie. Just so you know. ************ 'Not a science': This covers points 1 and 2. In my previous post, I gave many example showing that evolution is observable. That people have been carrying out such selective breeding for years also implies that evolution is repeatable. As for testable, I give one example below (see the 'watch' link). Another example would be the long-term evolution of E Coli . Evolution cannot be proven 'Tornado in a junkyard': This covers points 3 and 4 - both of these state that because an immensely complex organism has 'evolved', it must be possible for artificial structures to do so as well. The inference is that because the structures are designed, so must the organism be. However, this comparison is entirely void. As pointed out previously, evolution only works when three factors are present - reproduction, mutation/variation and natural selection (this should really be two key factors, as reproduction is simply the method by which mutation/variation tends to occur). An organism can become incredibly complex from these factors - variation/mutation will randomly make the organism more or less complex, and natural selection will tend to ensure that only the most complex survive, thus constantly increasing the complexity level. Seeing as buildings neither mutate nor are subject to natural selection, asking for evidence that one has spontaneously formed is a straw man challenge which cannot and does not need to be met. NB: Oh yes, you asked for proof despite not giving any. It's interesting to note then that, when those evolutionary factors are applied to something complex like, for example, a watch , the complex mechanism does spontaneously appear. Tornado in a junkyard . 'Mathematically impossible': This covers points 5 and 6. I went into quite a lot of detail on this in my previous post, all of which you ignored. To summarise: firstly, that something is hugely improbable does not make it impossible - especially if all the alternatives would have resulted in the 'alternative' evolved species questioning the probability of their own evolution, just as you are questioning ours. Secondly, the mathematical models used to make such 'improbable' calculations are often flawed and ignore the factors of variation and selection which I have mentioned above - see the section above for why these features lead to more complexity than could be predicted by a model ignoring them. Probability of abiogenesis 'Founded on racism': This covers the final point 7. You have made this claim, in fact - all the article says is that evolution has caused some people to have racist beliefs. I'll just respond to this with a set of talkorigins pages, on Darwin , Huxley , eugenics and generic racism . So, thats the general points covered - and before you attempt to discard my post on the basis that I've added a few TalkOrigins links, I remind you that you have pulled your arguments from a website, that most of my responses have come without the aid of TalkOrigins and that TalkOrigins has cited the vast majority of it's claims - something which you have not done. Next!","Archangel","366948","WOW, what a bunch of convoluted apologetic drivel. You may as well just throw out the Talk Origins talking points since they exist only to oppose any valid arguments against the lies which evolution promotes. What I did find interesting though was your posted experiment ""long-term evolution of E Coli"". I read the results and saw that no actual improvement or forward moving evolution resulted in a 20 year study spanning more than 40,000 generation. In fact, the results showed as many downsides resulting in the specimens. Here's the last paragraph of the results section of the page you quoted. Another adaption that occurred in all these bacteria was an increase in cell size and in many cultures, a more rounded cell shape.[5] This change was partly the result of a mutation that changed the expression of a gene for a penicillin binding protein, which allowed the mutant bacteria to out-compete ancestral bacteria under the conditions in the long-term evolution experiment. However, although this mutation increased fitness under these conditions, it also increased the bacteria's sensitivity to osmotic stress and decreased their ability to survive long periods in stationary phase cultures, so the phenotype of this adaption depends on the environment of the cells. These results speak for themselves and show that for 20 years work of manipulating these strains in laboratory conditions, all we had at the end was a weaker strain which was susceptible to osmotic stress which decreased their ability to survive long periods in stationary phase cultures. But never did the e coli evolve into a stronger or superior life form in any way. I marvel that you would even hold this example up as evidence that evolution is the least bit valid from a practical scientific perspective. Now had they taken these original strains and placed them in the wild, under totally natural conditions with no human intervention or manipulation at all, and they survived and changed in that completely wild and uncontrolled setting, now that would have been interesting. But you offer me a completely laboratory secure and a controlled setting which assures a perfect atmosphere, and in spite of those conditions we get no actual forward moving evolutionary results at all. Not that the results would have had any value if we had under those conditions. But hey, you will grasp at any straws to cling to your false religion. And one more thing. Micro-evolution is the adaptations and changes within a species while macro-evolution is the addition of new traits or a transition to a new species. Micro-evolution is a fact that is plainly observable throughout nature. Macro-evolution is a theory that has never been observed in science. The underlined is the great lie of evolution which we creationists reject. Macro-evolution is the great lie which proposes that one species of animal has evolved into other species of animals leading up to the evolution into human beings. This lie is what we oppose since we believe, no; WE KNOW that Man is above the animal kingdom since the point of creation as we were created in Gods image where as the animals were created to serve our needs.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:06 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","150"

Man may be involved in genetic manipulation, but not nature as each form of life stays with its own kind as animal life remains balanced and consistent as it was at the time of Creation. You people will post irrelevant and useless studies about e-coli supposedly evolving, yet after even 40,000 generations we see no evidence that it has evolved into anything more than another strain of e coli. Yet you posted it because you are impressed by its results when they prove nothing more than MICRO-EVOLUTION which we believers have referred to as ""Rapid Adaptation"" for years. And neither can you show that one species of animal has ever evolved into another species of animal even though you assert that macro-evolution is a reality. The same physical laws which God established when He spoke creation into existence still apply today. Now, you wont ever post actual positive observable or repeatable evidence that MACRO-EVOLUTION has ever occurred, yet you will respond to this post with your usual insults and mocking snipes which do nothing more than reveal your steadfast refusal to accept the true and real physical laws which are outlined in and have always applied in the Genesis account.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:14 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","165"

But in the second creation account -- which you have simply ommitted from consideration here -- God is clearly depicted as creating Adam before the other animals at Genesis 2:7. The two accounts are simply not compatible. So the burden of proof is on you to explain why people who think that the above is sheer nonsense when literalized should nonetheless accept it as literally true. Until then, I don't think you're going to have too many people accepting it as ""evidence."" I sometimes get the impression that the only evidence you and many other creationists would accept is thousands upon thousands of years of video, recording how species change over time. That is of course not going to happen. Ergo, evolutionists can't prove their case. QED Never you mind that this sort of ""problem"" would render history and archaeology and forensics impossible. It renders creationism impossible to verify as well. The epistemological bar has been set so high at this point that literally no account of the past could surmount it. No, that's what you say. The Bible merely states that animals reproduce ""after their kinds."" Which, of course, every evolutionist on earth will happily grant you. You don't seem very familiar with the ways in which evolution problematizes the whole notion of ""species"" in the first place. Each generation is sufficiently similar to both its ancestors and descendents that they could all interbreed (barring something very unusual). But over thousands or millions of generations, differences can accumulate such that a very early generation may bear little resemblance to a much later one, and the two may be unable to interbreed. Moreover, it is quite readily observable in nature that many organisms do not reproduce after their own kind. Unrelated bacteria engage in ""lateral gene transfer"" between species, and there is evidence that this may happen in eukaryotic organisms, as well. Many plants will quite naturally hybridize with plants of other species, and the hybrids that are produced are often fertile, capable of reproducing with one or both parent species or with each other. There is even evidence that fertile hybridization occurs more frequently than previously realized in the animal kingdom, especially among invertebrates and fish. So leave to one side the issue of continuity and change over time. The idea that organisms are naturally limited to reproducing ""after their kinds"" is simply false , and this is readily observable in the here and now. If you want to make a big deal out of that phrase, then you have a massive empirical problem on your hands. Because it's completely irrelevant. Evolution is not a religion. It's a natural science that seeks to understand the origins of organisms via natural processes based on empirical evidence from field and experiment. Does this have implications for religion?

All his other arguments have been stripped away from him - his response is either to pretend that they didn't happen (eg: claiming that the e coli never became stronger during the experiment) or to simply ignore the responses to them and repost his original text (eg: ignoring the entirety of this post and ignoring almost all of this one , which between them answer every problem he has come up with since his 'seven evidences of EvoFraud' post). In fact, I've even (in the first of those linked posts) explained the problem with demanding direct observations of 'macroevolution'. I'll do it again though in more detail, because it's an interesting tale. Right from the start, a big creationist argument against evolution was that it had never been observed. Then someone pointed out that selective breeding is a form of evolution, so the argument was quickly reduced to two forms, which persisted until quite recently (I have seen, and argued against, both). Firstly, there was an argument that selective breeding didn't actually produce any new genetic information. The theory ran that God had created wolves with loads of different genes for height, colour etc and all the breeders were doing was breeding dogs that eliminated some of those genes; making the dog more and more a 'pure-bred'. This argument was destroyed by the appearance of animals such as panda shepherds , where a new gene was specifically noted as mutating into existence between generations. The second argument was that all this 'evolution within a species' stuff was somehow irrelevant to the truth of evolution itself - what the creationists now demanded was direct observations of evolution from one species into another - a term dubbed 'macroevolution'. However, since that argument arose there have been several confirmed examples of speciation - both speciation in action (as exampled by the ring species linked to in my previous post) and examples of entirely new species arising. A decent list of some new species is here (yes, Archangel, it's TalkOrigins. However, please note that every single example is cited to an academic paper). So the creationist argument had to backpedal again. And now we find ourselves at Archangels last hope; that because 'macroevolution' - which now apparently means "" a reptile has evolved into a mammal, or that a mammal has evolved into a bird "" - has never been directly observed, evolution as a whole must be false. However, this is clearly an absurd demand. Macroevolution - evolution on a scale larger than a species, has been directly observed - see that link to the list of evidences of speciation . The greatly exaggerated demand for an observed case of 'reptile to bird' is very clearly a straw man, as the evolutionary model itself states that such changes occur over hundreds of thousands of years - and written records haven't been about for that long, never mind documented scientific studies. So rubbishing evolution on the fact that such large transitions have never been directly observed is pointless, because the theory itself states that such transitions occur over a longer period than humanity has been about for. It's like saying that Jesus doesn't exist because you can't find him in the 1908 census data for east London. 'Microevolution' has been directly observed. Speciation - as a result of prolonged microevolution - has been directly observed. The larger transitions are simply extentions of those two observed principles; and as I said in my previous (ignored) post, there is no argument that the extention is not a valid one. There is also fossil evidence of such large transitions, which has been linked to many times and which Archangel has, unsurprisingly, dismissed out of hand. You're out of arguments, Archangel.

Start another debate if you want to discuss the reason the two chapters say what they do, but for now, just offer proof that MACRO-EVOLUTION HAS OCCURRED, IN OPPOSITION TO WHAT THIS ALLEGEDLY CONFLICTING ACCOUNT SAYS, PERIOD!!!

You may consider the evidentiary bar to be set too high to reach but I have no doubts or problems at all with my evidence.

Which is it and support your answer with actual evidence rather than unsupported claims. You're speaking nonsense and gibberish which proves you have no idea what you are saying. All living organisms are composed of cells. A eukaryotic cell is a cell with a nucleus, which contains the cell's chromosomes. Plants, animals, protists, and fungi have eukaryotic cells, unlike the Eubacteria and Archaea, whose cells do not have nuclei and are therefore termed prokaryotic. In addition to having a nucleus, eukaryotic cells differ from prokaryotic cells in being larger and much more structurally and functionally complex. Eukaryotic cells contain subcompartments called organelles, which carry out specialized reactions within their boundaries. A eukaryotic cell may be an individual organism, such as the amoeba, or a highly specialized part of a multicellular organism, such as a neuron. Who are you trying to deceive Matt, yourself or me? Or is it the observers who read these threads? Beside the fact that once again you have just offered cheap lip service but evidence of nothing at all. You are apparently not smart enough to appreciate that all plants are of the same KIND of organism so for rapid adaptation to occur in the wild isn't macro-evolution by any standard of the term. Show me evidence that a plant has evolved into, let's say an insect and I'll be impressed. That is what macro-evolution claims has led to the advent of the human being after all. And that is the crux of this debate. Really? Then what other species of animals do the invertebrates evolve into? And what other species of amphibian, reptile or land mammal have fish evolved into? And why are you just claiming this rather than posting the evidence which will put this debate to rest forever? Why are you expecting me to take your unsubstantiated word for this in a debate where facts are required as evidence for your claims? And yet you haven't produced one iota of evidence to support your unsubstantiated assertions here. Real impressive brother. You're no better an advocate for your religion of evolution than you are for your religion of christianity. Balderdash!

This handy link might help you along your way - class is mammal/reptile/fish etc, order is different types of a certain class (eg different types of mammal), then family is different types of a certain order and genus is different types of a certain family. Finally, you get to species, which is different types of genus. For example, Canis is the name for a genus containing the different species wolves, jackels, dogs and coyotes - all of which are of the class 'mammal'. Macroevolution in the biological sense generally involves one species becoming another, not one class becoming another. In macroevolution, the species a mammal macroevolves into... is often another mammal, or a different species. For example, wolves almost macroevolved into the different breeds of dog ('almost' because wolves and dogs are a step further down the list as they are different subspecies, so it's not quite).

Timeline of evolution Timeline of evolution This timeline of the evolution of life outlines the major events in the development of life on the planet Earth. For a thorough explanatory context, see the history of Earth, and geologic time scale. The dates given in this article are estimates based on scientific evidence. In biology, evolution is the process by which populations of organisms acquire and pass on novel traits from generation to generation. Its occurrence over large stretches of time explains the origin of new species and ultimately the vast diversity of the biological world. Contemporary species are related to each other through common descent, products of evolution and speciation over billions of years. Basic timeline: The basic timeline is a 4.6 billion year old Earth, with (very approximately): * 4 billion years of simple cells (prokaryotes), * 3 billion years of photosynthesis, * 2 billion years of complex cells (eukaryotes), * 1 billion years of multicellular life, * 600 million years of simple animals, * 570 million years of arthropods (ancestors of insects, arachnids and crustaceans) * 550 million years of complex animals * 500 million years of fish and proto-amphibians, * 475 million years of land plants, * 400 million years of insects and seeds, * 360 million years of amphibians, * 300 million years of reptiles, * 200 million years of mammals, * 150 million years of birds, * 130 million years of flowers, * 65 million years since the non-avian dinosaurs died out, * 2.5 million years since the appearance of Homo, * 200,000 years since humans started looking like they do today, * 25,000 years since Neanderthals died out. Can you appreciate that all I want is actual evidence that this fairy tale is real and true?

The (initial) common creationist response to this is that the speed of light 'must' have changed over time - however, there are several disproofs for this. The first is simple - there is a great amount of evidence that this is not the case: at the very most, it has not changed by very much. . Even better than that, however, is the case of Supernova 1987A . This supernova was surrounded by distant rings of gas which could be observed 'lighting up' as the light from the supernova hit it. The rings were big enough for an angular width to be measured (0.808 arcseconds diameter), and the time taken for the light to get from the central 'nova to the rings was measured. Basic trigonometry gives the result that, regardless of the current speed of light, the event took place 168,000 years ago. You might be able to get around this by making some headache-inducing assumptions, but (unsurprisingly, really) independent methods of distancing the supernova puts it at 168,000 light-years away, thus nicely supporting the observations made.","Archangel","367132","What is not only very interesting, but incredible is that in this whole thread this is the only post which has even attempted to answer the OP question.

I refer you to this link from post 145 http://www.4forums.com/political/366906-post145.html which has been ignored by the opposition, as usual. It offers the statistical evidence against what evolution proposes being mathematically possible. This is a consideration evolutionists just hate to consider which is why they will attack it with some link to Talk Origin rather than disprove its validity with valid mathematical statistics of their own. Here's an excerpt. Science Debunks Evolution Tom Phillips There has been much propaganda regarding the ""intelligent design"" controversy. In truth, creation/design is the scientific position; evolution is unscientific. By definition, science is based upon what we observe in the physical world and logical inference from what we observe. While microevolution --change within a species-- is observed and scientific, macroevolution, what ""evolution"" customarily means, is not. It asserts life somehow arose from non-life by chance. Such ""spontaneous generation,"" disproven long ago, has never been observed. Instead, we always observe that life comes from previous life --and, as Scripture teaches, ultimately from an ever-living God. Evolution also asserts one life form can change into another, higher form --something also never observed, and thus unscientific. Instead, we always observe exactly what Genesis 1 states numerous times: life reproduces ""according to its kind"" (vv. 11,12,21,24,25,29) --i.e., cats beget cats, crickets beget crickets, etc. They never change into something else. With microbiology we understand why. All life contains DNA, a genetic blueprint containing information. But purely material processes cannot create information, which originates only from a ""mind.""(1) Evolution proceeds via chance, the antithesis of information. The DNA in simple bacteria has several million specifications; mans has several billion.(2) The DNA molecule, the most complex structure we know, and unquestionably the most efficient copying device, with self-correcting processes, prevents one life form from ""changing"" into another. We are all copies of a copy of a copy, etc., going back to the very first human parents. Genesis 3:20 says Eve was ""the mother of all the living."" Science proved we are descendents of one woman, whose genes are carried by all mankind. Newsweeks 1-11-88 cover article (""Searching for Adam and Eve"") states: ""all modern men and women descended from this relatively recent woman whom scientists have taken to calling Eve.""(3) Even evolutionists accept this finding, based on the DNA in our mitochondria, the cells powerhouse.(4) Mitochondrial DNA comes unmixed, only from the mother; ""it preserves a family record that isnt scrambled every generation.""(5) The fossil record disproves evolution. If the first life form changed into another, higher form by gradual gene changes, and so on down the line, accounting for all life, then, quoting Darwin, ""the number of intermediate and transitional links, between all living and extinct species, must have been inconceivably great.""(6) The whole world would be awash in the remains of ""infinitely numerous connecting links.""(7) It isnt. Darwin conceded that fact, calling it ""the most obvious and serious objection"" against his theory.(8) He attests the ""sudden appearance"" of species, complete and distinct, in the fossil record(9) --just as if God created all life individually. Evolution is scientifically preposterous. Laws of probability are real scientific laws. Our DNA is ""unique"" because the odds of another person having our exact DNA are so remote we can dismiss that possibility altogether. Likewise with evolution. Nobel laureate Francis Crick calculated natures chances of producing one small protein: 1 in 10 to the 260th power.(10) Crick reminds us there are only 10 to the 80th power (1 followed by 80 zeros) atoms in the whole universe(11); he concludes even the elementary components of life ""cannot have arisen by pure chance.""(12) Mathematician Emile Borel states an event will never happen when the odds are less than 1 in 10 to the 50th power.(13) Sir Fred Hoyle calculated natures chances of producing the 2000 enzymes found in life: 1 in 10 to the 40,000th power.(14) He states: ""The Darwinian theory of evolution is shown to be plainly wrong.""(15) He concludes: ""Life cannot have had a random beginning(16)...but must have come from a cosmic intelligence."" (17) Nobel laureate Ernst Chain said: ""To postulate that the development and survival of the fittest is entirely a consequence of chance mutations seems to me a hypothesis based on no evidence and irreconciliable with the facts.""(18) Einstein said, ""I want to know how God created this world.""(19) Einstein knew the universe didnt happen by chance. Atheism and evolution are dead. Science destroyed them. Those claiming evolution is ""scientific"" must demonstrate that life can come from non-life by purely material processes, and that one life form can turn into another, higher form. Science demands it. Put up or shut up! The Defender - Commentary I must also comment on this Tornado in a Junk yard analogy you have scoffed at in order to oppose my position against evolution which was originally coined by Sir Fred Hoyle, who used it in Evolution From Space: A Theory of Cosmic Creationsim (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1981), p 24. Hoyle said that the chance that life forms might have emerged in this way is comparable with the chance that ""a tornado sweeping through a junk-yard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein."" --Nature, Nov 12, 1981 p 105. Why doesn't anyone on your side show the statistical probabilities that such a miraculous event of evolution occurring as stated by your religious proponents? It's because the numbers are too vast for you to imagine, and you don't want to deal with that reality.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:55 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","209"
"08-28-2009","13107",14,"None","None","None","iangb","367220","Hey, wow, I missed a link. Unfortunately, Archangel, your timing is really bad. I'm about half an hour away from moving an hour up the motorway into a new flat, which is unlikely to have the internet for a week and a half or so. I may come back here after the weekend, but I probably won't be online until that point. Don't think I've forgotten you! Very quickly before I go, a brief post: To start with, could you respond to my previous post and define what 'macroevolution' means to you? The quoted article in your post above gives yet another definition, which I will rubbish shortly. Now... your link: a brief dissemination. I'll probably try and bulk it up a bit when I have time next week if needed, this is just some initial responses without research, calculations or nuthin'. First paragraph: Rambling without any proof. Presumably proof is to follow Second paragraph: This jumps straight into the 'misunderstandings' pool when it states that 'macroevolution means spontanious generation of life from non-life'. This is entirely false: life from non-life is abiogenesis, which is irrelevant to the truth of evolution. God could have created that 'life from non-life' in the first place, which then went on to evolve into us (not that I believe this; but it's hypothetically true). The second paragraph also mentions an animal evolving into another animal. Presumably it doesn't mean 'a new species emerging', as this has been documented. Instead, it must mean the second of my 'macroevolution' definitions in my above post - simply that the name has changed. It's a fairly silly argument: technically, the new species of mosquito had a name: ""Mosquito species B"" as opposed to ""mosquito species Z"". As did the panda shepherds, mutated from German shepherd (I seem to remember, no time to check). Furthermore, if the name did change you could simply go higher up the naming tree and claim that it hadn't met your standards: A wolf evolving into a dog is still a canine, or a monkey evolving into a man is still a mammal. Heck, you could go for ""a dino evolving into a bird is still a vertibrate, this changes nothing!"" In short, I still need that detailed definition of macroevolution from you, Archie. Third paragraph: This refers to the 'losing genetic information' argument that I was talking about two or three posts ago: arguing that each generation simply has less information than the previous one. As I said before, this is directly contradicted by the panda shepherds and their new, mutation-formed gene. There are a fair few other examples of new information being created, but again I don't have time to link to them. TalkOrigins would know, if you dare to look. Fourth paragraph: I even mentioned this argument in passing: it makes the claim that we should be finding more of what it dubs 'transitional fossils'. However, this ignores the fact that all fossils are transitional, between their parents and their offspring. It's simply that there are some gaping holes in the fossil record; unsurprising, when you consider how unlikely it is that an animal will become fossilised rather than eaten. Furthermore, the paragraph is out of date, especially with it's quotes; most of the evolutionary history of most of the animals existent today have been traced back through 'transitional' fossils. There have been a lot more fossils found recently, as techniques are improving and - more importantly - people are actually getting funding to go out and look for them (perhaps unsurprisingly, this boom in research grants came just after the first jurassic park film came out). Fifth paragraph: Now we come to the newer stuff, the maths. Ironically this is the paragraph that I'm going to have least time to do anything on, as the paragraph itself doesn't mention specific methodologies (though they may be mentioned in the citations), so I can't dispute them until I know what they are, which I will do when I get the chance. I can guess, though - the mathematician looked at the pattern of atoms in the carbon molecules and calculated the probability that, if he were to choose atoms at random from an appropriate sample size, he'd pick them in exactly the right order - which is vanishingly small. However, this ignores the fact that this isn't how the molecules formed. Like all carbon-based chemicals, they formed by a series of joinings, where each one was governed by physical laws. For example, I can react bromine with propene and be guarenteed to get propane 1-bromide (or something with a similar name, it's been a while since I did any chemistry) - despite the fact that all there are 11 atoms in propane 1-bromide, of 3 different types - and if I were to pick atoms at random like the mathematician did, that makes it a fairly small chance that I'd end up with the right molecule. Proof of God at work, or simply evidence of intramolecular forces? I'd just add to this that Hoyle, along with your other quotes, are back to discussion abiogenesis , not evolution . As pointed out earlier, there's a big difference. Fifth paragraph: Back to the rambling of the first paragraph, although the error here is that the author linked 'evolution' with 'atheism'. You can have atheistic creationists (Jakers), just as you can have theistic evolutionists (Matthew) - the two are independent of each other. Finally, your comment on the 'tornado in a junk yard'. That Hoyle came up with the wording is irrelevant: Hoyle is the bloke who did the maths above, so he was likely to say this. This simply further refutes Hoyle's maths - he assumes that there were no extra laws governing evolution (or abiogenesis, which is what the quote was originally pertaining to). Secondly, Hoyle used the 'tornado in a junkyard' analogy to suggest that order cannot come from disorder. The very analogy disproves that: what else is a tornado, if not an ordered coming-together of the winds which 'should' be impossible if approached from a purely mathematical angle which disregards all the other rules? Take all the air particles, calculate the chance that each individual one has the appropriate vector of motion and you will get a vanishingly small chance that tornadoes exist, just as Hoyle got a tiny chance that ammino acids would 'spontaniously' form. Both Hoyle and the tornado mathematician would be ignoring the fact that there are interatomic forces which can cause order to arise from chaos.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:00 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","210"

"08-28-2009","13107",15,"Archangel","367249","Actually it is. The end result of what abiogenesis claims is that from the basic original building blocks which came to exist in the primordial ooze through which all life on earth grew, to what is all modern proteins and complicated bacterium, allegedly resulted from those humble beginnings. So the calculation must include the journey from that beginning to the present result. I can't speak to the accuracy of this claim, but if it's correct, it works in the evolutionists favor since calculating a random infinite number of proteins would result in an even larger outcome, and not in their statistical favor at all. this makes perfect sense and also is necessary since nature would have also worked in incremental changes since evolution didn't jump from the simple original proteins to complex biological life forms by any means. Evolution was most definitely an incremental process if real, so by what standard would you expect billions of modern calculations being performed simultaneously to be expected as if the goal of abio was to result in complex life? Remember, it is you mooks who constantly argue that more complex life has never been the goal of natural selection by way of RANDOM MUTATION. Don't you remember that you claim it is a hit or miss proposition, this evolutionary scam of yours? And here is that sanctimony I mentioned above. Your side can't come up with a calculation which proves how reasonable your pseudo science IS, yet here you are claiming that my side isn't smart enough to comprehend the probability calculation which they did come up with. And you have a problem with this? Doesn't this mean, IF TRUE, that their calculated results work more in your favor rather than against it? If they worked with a larger number of functional enzymes/ribozymes present in a group of random sequences, the massive result they came up with would have been even larger, if the proposed claim is true that is.","T.Q","367257","No, it isn't. The end result of abiogenesis is a self-replicating molecule. The modern cell is a result of billions of years of evolution. I don't think you understand what they're saying here. You don't have to calculate the odds of the specific proteins presently found, merely any proteins which would serve a similar function, this substantially increases the odds. For example, what are the odds of me picking the ace of spade from a deck of cards? Now, what are the odds of me picking a spade from a deck of cards? Again, you're not understanding what they are saying. They are saying that there wasn't one interaction occuring every second/minute/hour(whatever time period you want to use), there were multiple interactions, probably numbering in the billions. A billion interactions taking place one after another takes a long time. A billion interactions taking place at once significantly shortens the time period, and increases the likelihood of a ""desired"" result-a self replicating molecule. And all it takes is one self replicating molecule. It's not sanctimonious to point out someone doesn't know what they're talking about when it's obvious they don't know what they're talking about. Nobody said anything about ""not smart enough"", that's your baggage. Again, you're not understanding what they are saying. Those who claim abiogenesis is impossible are stating ""only ribosomes x,y or z work"", because that is what is present now. The thing is, ribosomes a-z would probably work, it's just that x,y or z are the ones that were happened upon as a solution.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","02:59 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","216"

ARTIFICIAL GENETIC BREEDING. It isn't evolution through natural selection by way of random mutations. Don't you get that yet? Nobody on my side of this debate is denying that Man can manipulate genes and cross breed animals into new varieties within their kind. But have you ever seen man turn a LIZARD into a DOG? I think not. Nor will you see it. That is what macro-evolution is claiming what led to your existence, and evolution does claim it happened in reality in that before dogs were dogs, they were first reptiles which evolved from amphibians which evolved from fish and so on going back to proteins and bacteria in the primordial ooze. So the question being debated here isn't whether Man can manipulate genes in breeding certain traits into different types of animals. It's about whether macro-evolution has ever taken place as evolution claims which is how they perceive that every diverse type and variety of life on Earth today originally came from the same single celled protein which was somehow born into and survived in a molten lava environment of helium and sulfuric acid long enough to grow, replicate, and over a couple of billions more years in that environment until the earth slowly cooled, and life somehow formed into more complex organisms.

[Matthew:]and there is evidence that this may happen in eukaryotic organisms You're speaking nonsense and gibberish which proves you have no idea what you are saying. [Matthew:]and there is evidence that this may happen in eukaryotic organisms All living organisms are composed of cells. A eukaryotic cell is a cell with a nucleus, which contains the cell's chromosomes. Plants, animals, protists, and fungi have eukaryotic cells, unlike the Eubacteria and Archaea, whose cells do not have nuclei and are therefore termed prokaryotic. In addition to having a nucleus, eukaryotic cells differ from prokaryotic cells in being larger and much more structurally and functionally complex. Eukaryotic cells contain subcompartments called organelles, which carry out specialized reactions within their boundaries. A eukaryotic cell may be an individual organism, such as the amoeba, or a highly specialized part of a multicellular organism, such as a neuron. [Matthew:]Many plants will quite naturally hybridize with plants of other species, and the hybrids that are produced are often fertile, capable of reproducing with one or both parent species or with each other.

Beside the fact that once again you have just offered cheap lip service but evidence of nothing at all.

[Matthew:]There is even evidence that fertile hybridization occurs more frequently than previously realized in the animal kingdom, especially among invertebrates and fish. Really? [Matthew:]There is even evidence that fertile hybridization occurs more frequently than previously realized in the animal kingdom, especially among invertebrates and fish.

Why are you expecting me to take your unsubstantiated word for this in a debate where facts are required as evidence for your claims?

While I do plan to check in and see what others are saying, I won't be able to post for a bit. A temporary last hurrah of sorts. And in much of the rest of my post, my point was precisely that you won't accept any evidence that anyone offers. More in a minute. All due respect, Archie, but go back and look at the very first post on this thread. You want to accuuse me of ""derailing the discussion?"" Please. At least my comments on this score have the merit of referring to my substantive post in response to the OP. There are reams of evidence out there. Book after book after book. All I could really do is recommend that you take a look at that stuff. But I'm afraid that it won't really matter, because there is simply no evidence that you would be willing to accept. Again, More in a minute. Why is this ridiculous or juvenile? I cannot think of one sort of evidence you would accept. Except, perhaps, a direct observation of a member of Species X giving birth to a member of Species Y. Aside from the fact that this isn't going to happen, it displays a profound misunderstanding of what evolution says about the whole notion of species in the first place . You are asking for a sort of evidence that is neither possible nor relevant. That is my point. Such as?... I have yet to see you show any of my views to be inconsistent, on any topic. No, I don't. You are reinforcing my conclusion that you simply didn't understand what I was driving at. True, but in my defense, I'm only denying that's what I meant to say because I didn't say it at all. You have badly misunderstood me. I'm not saying -- either intentionally or in a Freudian slip -- that ""macro-evolution"" can't be proved. I'm saying there is no proof any evolutionist could offer that you would accept. Why is that ""balderdash and foolish bluster?"" If direct observation is an epistemological requirement for science, then no attempt to reconstruct the past could ever be scientific. This would apply to evolution, but also to archaeology, to forensics, and even to creationism itself, since no one can directly observe these purport to describe. And your lack of any doubt at all is precisely why I find your entire religious view so deeply flawed. You are a finite and fallible human being. It is not possible for you to know anything -- anything -- with that kind of certainty. Now who's offering mere ""bluster?"" If this is what you're going to say, don't just say it and declare it a ""no-brainer,"" as if those who disagree are simply stupid. Defend your claim. You can start by explaining what you mean by "" the Genesis account."" To which of the two are you referring?... No. Once again, I am trying to make plain that you do not understand how speciation works. It is very telling that you omitted what I said next. I explained there precisely how each individual organism does , in fact, reproduce ""after its kind."" The difference in kinds does not come about from one generation to the next. It is noticeable only after the great number of intervening generations between a far-distant ancestor and the current generation are no longer with us. Someone -- I think it was Iangb, apologies if it's not -- brought up ""ring-species,"" like herring gulls or certain California salamanders. These species are interesting because they illustrate in space how the process works through time. Travelling around the ring, each population breeds with its neighbors, until you get back to the starting point, where two distinct populations exist and don't interbreed. What keeps them the ""same species"" is the gene flow around the ring. But if the ring breaks -- if a population somewhere in the middle goes extinct and the ring doesn't reconnect -- then gene flow is cut off, and the single species will diverge into two. You really need to consider how all this works. Its not balderdash or bluster, I assure you. It's population genetics. Love the "" alleged Christian brother"" remark, by the way. Again, you simply don't understand the whole notion of what a species is -- or rather, you don't understand just how problematic the whole notion of ""species"" is. They are still bacteria, according to the way we use the term ""bacteria."" But are they still the same ""species"" of bacteria? I'm far from an expert, I'll readily admit. But if they've got new genes, are they ""the same"" as they were before? Perhaps if the new genes don't make much functional difference, we wouldn't recognize them as being at all different. But if they were to make a functional difference, then we likely would. And if there are still other members of the original species around that don't even have the new genes, then we've got divergence. Can ""actual evidence"" clarify matters? I doubt it. Like I said, I'm no expert on LGT in bacteria and its implications for evolution, so I can't give you all the details. But the issue isn't the mechanisms of LGT. What's at issue is what constitutes a ""species"" in biology. And the ""actual evidence,"" far from presenting a clear answer, is what creates the problem. I'm sorry, Archie, but that's simply not the case. I new quite well what I was saying. The last I had read, there was evidence of lateral gene transfer occurring between an epiphytic liverwort and Amorella trichopoda , a flowering plant believed to be the most primordial flowering plant alive today. Let's look at what ""you"" say next: A quick Google search reveals that these are not your own words. Thanks for the citatation. In any event, these things are all true. They are also completely irrelevant to whether or not LGT can or can't occur between eukaryotes. Maybe what's going on between the liverwort and the amborella isn't LGT after all. Or maybe it is. But that will certainly not be because of anything in what you've ""quoted"" here. Based on the facts that these aren't your own words and that they aren't relevant anyway, I'd say it wasn't me who had 'no idea what he was saying.' (You once wondered when I'd invoke my God-given Christian rights to rebuke others. This is typically a bit out of character for me. I hope the above qualifies -- ""my alleged Christian brother."") An interesting thing to ask, given what you did in ""your"" immediately preceding comments. But I digress. (And I shall not bring up the matter again.) Again, this merely displays how little you understand the entire nature of the problem here. ""Kind,"" as you are using it here, is absurdly vague. Can one species of moss ""rapidly adapt"" to changed conditions in such a way that it no longer resembles its own earlier generations living in the original conditions and could no longer breed with them if they were still around? Perhaps more pertinently, can one population of a species of moss ""rapidly adapt"" to changed conditions in this way, even as another population doesn't since it's local conditions don't change, thereby yielding two ""kinds"" that can no longer interbreed, despite sharing common ancestors? If your answer to either of these is ""yes,"" then you believe in macro-evolution . You just think macro-evolution happens quickly, and thus call it ""rapid adaptation."" And simply defining ""plant"" as the relevant ""kind"" isn't going to save you. And I'd be perplexed. This isn't what evolution says happened. Flowering plants evolved from seed plants that didn't originally have flowers. Seed plants evolved from vascular plants that didn't originally have seeds. Vascular plants evolved from land plants that didn't originally have vascular systems. Land plants evolved from algae that couldn't originally survive on dry land. Algae evolved from single-celled eukaryotes that weren't originally photosynthetic. A similar ancestral chain could be put together for insects. It is only somewhere at the level of staggeringly ancient non-photosythetic single-celled eukaryotes that evolution hypothesizes a common ancestor between plants and insects. To claim otherwise indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of evolution. That's not what evolution claims at all. If you want a good look at what evolution actually says about human evolution, check out Carl Zimmers Smithsonian Intimate Guide to Human Origins . Yes, there really is such evidence. Again, you miss the point. Nobody is claiming that contemporary fish are busy evolving into, say, amphibians -- though it would be doggone interesting to crystal-ball mudskippers and see where their descendents are 10 million years from now! Indeed, if a species or genus or family of fish does end up evolving land-dwelling descendents 10 million years from now, it is certainly not bound to be an amphibian, a reptile, a bird, or a mammal. It couldn't be, since the evolutionary lines of those other groups have already diverged from that of the fish lineage in question. You seem to think of evolution in terms of pre-given kinds into which an earlier species evolves. But this isn't how it works. And my point about hybridization is twofold. First, it shows animals not reproducing after their kinds, if by ""kinds"" one means ""species."" Second, it enables evolution by changing the gene flow. I've already brought up Zimmer, so let me mention a couple of his other books: Evolution , which is a general treatment of the subject, including its history; and At the Water's Edge , which is specifically concerned with how land animals evolved from fish, and also how whales evolved from terrestrial mammals. But of course that's just the tip of the iceberg. I will never ask you to take ""my unsubstantiated word"" for anything. I will, however, ask you to go out and do some investigating for yourself. Just be prepared for a lot of material. See above. It is not my fault if you won't look for the evidence on your own. There is so much of it that it is beyond pointless to try to reproduce it all here. If you are so inclined, you can look. Yes, well, it remains the case that evolution is not my religion (or anybody else's for that matter). As for advocating on behalf of Christianity, I'd say that you're not exactly doing a bang-up job on these boards. Maybe it's because of how you behave toward your opponents? Imperious declarations of ""balderdash"" and ""gibberish"" rather than explaining why someone is wrong, hypocritical demands that others stick to your topic even what that topic itself has entirely derailed a thread, name-calling, questioning people's intelligence, attacking their motives, and questioning the honesty of their claims to be Christian simply because they don't believe and behave as you do -- not exactly a model worth emulating, in my estimation. (Guess I'm on roll with that whole ""rebuke"" thing!) Sorry, but no. Like all natural sciences, it's based on drawing inferences from empirical evidence. It does this no differently than we all do in daily life. And it's not at all incompatible with monoetheistic faith. Or at least, not with all versions of it. No, the Bible is my Bible. Darwin's book is about an aspect of nature, not about God or our relationship to Him. And given its complicity with greed-enabling and poor-demonizing economic policies, a better criticism of conservative Christianity could not be made! It's the grand irony: Conservative Christians frequently bash Darwinian biological ideas for their connection to Social Darwinism -- but the economic policies they advocate are merely Social Darwinism with their erroneous Biblical rationalizations substituted for the Spencer's erroneous biological ones.

Matthew just quoted statements I made and pretty much repeated the same mantra over and over as specifically as possible about how I just don't get it. But i do get it. I do understand that what you humanists cling to is a lie and a fairy tale created by men to explain the origins of life apart from an intelligent and personal Creator. I don't care how you dress your philosophy up in a package to appear to be legitimate science, because it is still a fraud and a lie. I find it especially sad that people who claim to possess the enlightenment of advanced intellect are so easily deceived into following such shallow drivel as this pseudo science represents. But I will never convince you secular humanists that you are wrong and that even though neither of us has all of the facts regarding how life came to be on Earth, that I am much closer to the actual factual truth than you are. So we are at a stalemate, if you will because nothing you say will convince me I have it wrong. What I really get a kick out of is that you, Matthew in particular in this most recent stream of criticisms critiques specific points in which he believes I am misled in my understanding of evolution when my constant complaint is that even evolution proponents don't agree with what evolution theory promotes. A perfect example/case in point is the tree of life I posted. I posted it from a pro-evolution source yet Matthew claims it is wrong. If we could get the opinions of the site contributers, they would strongly disagree with Matthew's critique of their tree of life of course, and they would tell him that he just doesn't get it as he tells me the same thing.

What insults? What snipes? You're the one insulting everybody's intelligence for pointing out that you obviously don't know what the hell you're talking about. A fish crawling up on land and turning into a mammal? A lizard turning into a dog? A plant turning into an insect? It's quite obvious that you don't even have a grade school-level understanding of the ToE. Yeah, did I not call that right here? Because it's quite obvious you don't. Somehow, you (again) managed to miss the part where he explained what precisely you weren't getting. No, you don't, as has been pointed out numerous times. Seeing as how you don't even understand the basics of what you're arguing against, no, you never will. No, but you want to take a guess as to which side at least has facts? OK, once again-THAT IS ABIOGENESIS, NOT THE ToE! It's a really simple concept, you'd think you might be able to catch on after the 15th correction. Great, start a new thread, and lay out all these facts. No, you know what, let's make it easy-lay out five facts that support creationism. And this is the guy who routinely mocks those who disagree with him for being close-minded. Archie, you don't understand a single thing that you're arguing against, and you just said that there's no way you will ever attempt to correct this, so why bother? You posted it from a web site that supports social darwinism. Again, proof that you don't understand anything about the ToE, if you equate social darwinism with the ToE Oh, and since you never bothered to cite your source: About Us | www.ievolved.org Great, email them and ask them to post their support for the scientific complexity and accuracy of their tree of life diagram. FFS Archie, the title itself gives it away ""A simple timeline of evolution""! You probably could, and each of them serve the same purpose- to give a general idea of the relative relationships between different classes! They are not a complete and accurate representation, they merely serve to give a broad overview, which is why they are usually found in introductory text books!

I think the civil and respectful thing to do from this point forward is simply not to. It's funny. On the now-defunct New York Times ""Human Origins"" forum, my most frequent opponent was a Randian atheist. (As Archie likes to point out, I never criticize atheists. So obviously, I am making this up....) He understood diddly-squat about religion, theology, or philosophy. But with respect to the last, in particular, he was a self-styled expert. (Most Randians are, and their relationship to philosophy is essentially that of intelligent design theorists to biology.) I could get into it with him for round after round. I could show him that his interpretation of a given thinker or idea was flat wrong. In many cases, his interpretations were literally the opposite of correct, as if one had inserted or removed a ""not"" at a key point in the reasoning. On more than one occasion, I showed that his entire criticism was explicitly and accurately rebutted by the very people he claimed to have refuted. And I was far from the only poster who had this experience. None of it made any difference. He routinely ignored the substance of our criticisms and repeated his points as if no criticisms had been made -- and questioned our intelligence and/or honesty for not addressing him substantively. I eventually quit arguing with him out of sheer frustration. Whereupon he declared victory, of course. Awfully familiar....

But you can't honestly accept my general statement of description for what it is. Like a typical dishonest advocate of this pseudo science you must interpret my statements literally and then assert that I don't understand the subject. This knowing full well that I do understand the subject very well, but since you can't answer the inconsistencies I point out to you, you must deflect from that reality by asserting that I don't get it. A dishonest and cowardly debating tactic since it prevents us from ever getting to the meat of the issues I raise. Agreed, but you and your secular humanist cohorts will never admit it's you who needs correcting. And I have shown that your criticisms above are either deeply ignorant or blatantly disingenuous as you attempt to use literal interpretations of general statements of the accepted cause and effect which accurately defines evolution as an example of my lack of knowledge of your pseudo-scientific religion. Balderdash. Speak for yourself. My blunt honesty is usually just posting bible passages which so convict the opposition because Gods word is a living breathing double edged sword of truth, that the recipients feel condemned by it. But rather than take that truth to heart, they respond by claiming I have condemned them. Here's a bit of wisdom you either missed or are also in denial of in your christian belief system Matthew, the word of God never comes back void. Here's how Gods Word puts it as evidence that His word never comes back void nor can we hide from HIM. Hbr 4:12 For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart. Hbr 4:13 And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do. I guess to you they were substantive, to me they were just opportunities to bluster and waste bandwidth one post at a time so you could feel like you were contributing substantial content. But no actual absolute scientific information was proffered at all and you. And your posts are still there for independent confirmation of that fact. As long as you claim to be a believer and follower of Christ, yet spend your time defending the exact opposite of what His word teaches, I am going to call you the obvious hypocrite that you are. If you come here and admit that you're an atheist or at least a dedicated secular humanist who rejects the judeo-christian teachings in the Old and New Testaments my respect for you will rise considerably since you will be debating from an honest position. But as long as you spew the same old Secular humanist party line which is in perfect harmony with the atheist perspective, as you dishonestly claim to be a christian believer, then I am going to continue to prove you're a liar and a hypocrite. Evolution does IN FACT say that these stages of evolution did occur in that all life on land eventually evolved from creatures which came from the Sea. And those seas creatures evolved from proteins and microbes which were allegedly formed in the primordial ooze by way of some spontaneous form of random mutation. And for you to all of a sudden become a literalist when you are a generalist in every other aspect of the debate is just more evidence of your dishonesty regarding this sketchy issue. I've explained it twice now, the question is, will you admit your dishonesty in attempting to interpret my statement as you have. I would say the same thing to you if I thought it would make a difference, but you seem totally sold out to this man made lie and fairy tale which seeks to explain our creation apart from a personal and intelligent God. The question I have is how can you claim to believe in that Creator God as you deny and reject HIS explanation for how you came to be here? He says you were planned while you say you were a random accident of nature. Wrong again, THERE IS NO ABSOLUTELY RELIABLE EVIDENCE, SO THERE IS NOTHING WORTHY OF ACCEPTING. You mean you spent a lot of time giving your useless and prejudicial opinion which is anything but informed, reliable or objective. Big deal; your opinion and a dollar and I still can't buy a lousy coffee. Blah blah blah... How many times will the guy who can't even supply absolute evidence for what he claims is a valid and authoritative science, continue to tell me that it is I who doesn't understand it? How about we start with the fact that the real problem is that I am dealing with people who refuse to accept that their whole evolutionist belief system is based on an unprovable, unrepeatable and unverifiable house of cards which is NOT based in any factual data at all! How about you admit that you are too blind to recognize how weak and impossible what you claim to be reality is in reality? Sure you did. You said I was intellectually dishonest which implies I don't really believe the things I say here in defense of the positions I defend. When the fact is that you are the intellectually dishonest one, and that is undeniable since you claim to be a christian believer and follower of Christ as you defend an undeniably secular humanist gospel which attempts to explain how man came to be without any active or personal participation from the Judeo Christian Creator God spoken of in the bible you CLAIM to accept. You are the only intellectually dishonest one between us Matthew, and sadly, you are too blind to recognize it in yourself. I'm not attacking you Matthew. I am pointing out the obvious hypocrisy which you represent here as you claim to be one thing and defend another. Remember what Matthew 6:24 says Matt, No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. It's speaking directly to you. And one more thing Matt. It took me a while to get back to you because unlike you, I went to church today to fellowship with like minded believers and to worship my heavenly Father.

You stated that 'a fish crawled out of the ocean and survived long enough to turn into a mammal.' That is not a ""general"" statement. It is a gross over-simplification that glosses over millions upon millions of generational changes in order to characterize evolution as ridiculous. And of course, you begin by insulting my intelligence. That's a real ""Christian"" thing to do. Real loving, real kind. This post is so full of personal attacks -- on my intelligence, my honesty, my courage -- that I'm not going to dignify most of it with a response. It isn't the Bible that calls your opponents ""mental midgets,"" Archie. It isn't God who's insulting them as dishonest and cowardly. It's YOU. I am not ""defending the exact opposite of what His word teaches."" I am defending the opposite of what YOU SAY His word teaches. You indicated in a post over on the abortion thread that you sincerely don't understand the distinction between these two things. And that, I think, may be the root of the problem. Archie, I don't believe that I am a ""random accident of nature."" My view -- not the view that you attribute to me, but the view I actually hold (do you understand the difference?) -- is that humanity evolved, and that this is compatible with the active participation of a personal God in that whole evolutionary process. Would you mind not telling me what I think? So, let me get this straight. In addition to everything else that you know about me other than what I post on these boards, now you know my church's schedule of available worship services, too? Good grief.

"08-30-2009","13107",18,"Matthew","367577","Archie, you have ascribed to evolutionists the view that a fish crawled out of the ocean and survived long enough to turn into a mammal. You have demanded explanations about how lizards can turn into dogs or plants turn into insects. What that indicates to me is not a lack of intelligence, but it certainly qualifies as ignorance. You do not understand evolution. Ignorance is no sin. But the wise thing to do would be to correct it, as quickly as possible. Personally, I have never called you ""stupid."" I have called you deeply ignorant of what you are criticizing. Three instances are provided above. Your ""blunt honesty"" is used in defense of a basic misunderstanding. So what exactly am I supposed to ""appreciate?"" Archie, I spent a sizable portion of my afternoon yesterday composing responses to you. Those responses were substantive and specific. I explained exactly where I thought you were wrong. What I have received in return is an attack on my honesty. Just like the last time I tried to engage you. Archie, anyone who believes that evolution says a fish turned into a mammal, a lizard could turn into a dog, or a plant could turn into an insect does not understand evolution. Period. So what are you going to do about that? Just assert ""I do get it"" again? Get over the defensiveness and educate yourself about the thing you are criticizing! No, there's plenty of evidence. But ""there is none"" that you will accept. The issue of what constitutes acceptable evidence was another substantive matter discussed in my posts. And you have ignored it. I find that there is indeed a stalemate. But it results from the fact that one side simply does not understand evolution, yet criticizes evolution as if it did. How can we even have a serious debate, when there are such serious misunderstandings of the very issue to be debated? when any attempt to correct misunderstandings is treated as evidence of the sinful character of those attempting to do the correcting? I have no doubt that you believe what you say you believe. I have never criticized you for a lack of commitment. The problem is, right now, any time something challenges your worldview, you attack the character of him who offered the challenge. And the above is a case in point.","Archangel","367600","You call that selectively doled out drivel to my extensive post a considered and thoughtful response to the points I raised? You oughta be on stage Matthew. So I'll just let my prior post stand as evidence of what I'm dealing with here. If you have even half of the intelligence that I have given you credit for then you know darn well that I was making general statements of evolutionist conclusions rather than stating my view of the specific process which led to land mammals coming to exist. You know as well as I do that macro-evolution believes that all life evolved from an original single celled organism/protein/ enzyme which is all living creatures common ancestor. But you can't honestly accept my general statement of description for what it is. Like a typical dishonest advocate of this pseudo science you must interpret my statements literally and then assert that I don't understand the subject. This knowing full well that I do understand the subject very well, but since you can't answer the inconsistencies I point out to you, you must deflect from that reality by asserting that I don't get it. A dishonest and cowardly debating tactic since it prevents us from ever getting to the meat of the issues I raise. BOLDED FOR EMPHASIS! Agreed, but you and your secular humanist cohorts will never admit it's you who needs correcting. And I have shown that your criticisms above are either deeply ignorant or blatantly disingenuous as you attempt to use literal interpretations of general statements of the accepted cause and effect which accurately defines evolution as an example of my lack of knowledge of your pseudo-scientific religion. Balderdash. Speak for yourself. My blunt honesty is usually just posting bible passages which so convict the opposition because Gods word is a living breathing double edged sword of truth, that the recipients feel condemned by it. But rather than take that truth to heart, they respond by claiming I have condemned them. Here's a bit of wisdom you either missed or are also in denial of in your christian belief system Matthew, the word of God never comes back void. Here's how Gods Word puts it as evidence that His word never comes back void nor can we hide from HIM. Hbr 4:12 For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart. Hbr 4:13 And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do. I guess to you they were substantive, to me they were just opportunities to bluster and waste bandwidth one post at a time so you could feel like you were contributing substantial content. But no actual absolute scientific information was proffered at all and you. And your posts are still there for independent confirmation of that fact. As long as you claim to be a believer and follower of Christ, yet spend your time defending the exact opposite of what His word teaches, I am going to call you the obvious hypocrite that you are. If you come here and admit that you're an atheist or at least a dedicated secular humanist who rejects the judeo-christian teachings in the Old and New Testaments my respect for you will rise considerably since you will be debating from an honest position. But as long as you spew the same old Secular humanist party line which is in perfect harmony with the atheist perspective, as you dishonestly claim to be a christian believer, then I am going to continue to prove you're a liar and a hypocrite. Evolution does IN FACT say that these stages of evolution did occur in that all life on land eventually evolved from creatures which came from the Sea. And those seas creatures evolved from proteins and microbes which were allegedly formed in the primordial ooze by way of some spontaneous form of random mutation. And for you to all of a sudden become a literalist when you are a generalist in every other aspect of the debate is just more evidence of your dishonesty regarding this sketchy issue. I've explained it twice now, the question is, will you admit your dishonesty in attempting to interpret my statement as you have. I would say the same thing to you if I thought it would make a difference, but you seem totally sold out to this man made lie and fairy tale which seeks to explain our creation apart from a personal and intelligent God. The question I have is how can you claim to believe in that Creator God as you deny and reject HIS explanation for how you came to be here? He says you were planned while you say you were a random accident of nature. Wrong again, THERE IS NO ABSOLUTELY RELIABLE EVIDENCE, SO THERE IS NOTHING WORTHY OF ACCEPTING. You mean you spent a lot of time giving your useless and prejudicial opinion which is anything but informed, reliable or objective. Big deal; your opinion and a dollar and I still can't buy a lousy coffee. Blah blah blah... How many times will the guy who can't even supply absolute evidence for what he claims is a valid and authoritative science, continue to tell me that it is I who doesn't understand it? How about we start with the fact that the real problem is that I am dealing with people who refuse to accept that their whole evolutionist belief system is based on an unprovable, unrepeatable and unverifiable house of cards which is NOT based in any factual data at all! How about you admit that you are too blind to recognize how weak and impossible what you claim to be reality is in reality? Sure you did. You said I was intellectually dishonest which implies I don't really believe the things I say here in defense of the positions I defend. When the fact is that you are the intellectually dishonest one, and that is undeniable since you claim to be a christian believer and follower of Christ as you defend an undeniably secular humanist gospel which attempts to explain how man came to be without any active or personal participation from the Judeo Christian Creator God spoken of in the bible you CLAIM to accept. You are the only intellectually dishonest one between us Matthew, and sadly, you are too blind to recognize it in yourself. I'm not attacking you Matthew. I am pointing out the obvious hypocrisy which you represent here as you claim to be one thing and defend another. Remember what Matthew 6:24 says Matt, No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. It's speaking directly to you. And one more thing Matt. It took me a while to get back to you because unlike you, I went to church today to fellowship with like minded believers and to worship my heavenly Father.

I think you make some valid points, and I've benefitted from reading your point of view.

In my opinion, Archangel is in the minority in this thread for good reason: because he is ignorant and anti-rational. Whereas I'm typically sympathetic to the plight of those in the minority, precisely for the reasons you've described, I don't think individuals, such as Matthew, should remove themselves from the discussion just because they are in the majority. Rather than adding one more frustrated voice to the ""gang"" opposing Archangel, I think he has set a new standard on these forums. I sincerely believe I would feel the same way were he to argue a point with which I disagreed. (For example, I am indeed an atheist, yet I have no doubt that I would enjoy, and benefit from, reading his motives for being Christian.)

That's massive rejection of personal responsibility. And this mattes how again? Archie makes bad arguments, as do you. You fail to recognize that the problem isn't the number of people posting against you, it's the number of bad arguments you give.

I have to say, though, that I'm a little put off by this. In post 241, I didn't say that I found Archie stupid. Believe me when I say that I don't mean this at all facetiously, but I have given a great deal of thought over the last few years to the differences between unintelligence, ignorance, and stupidity, and how we use these terms. I have yet to call Archie either stupid or unintelligent. I do think that, based on what I see here, he is ignorant of evolutionary biology -- or perhaps, given some of the things he said earlier today, just extraordinarily careless about how he chooses to describe it. And the reference to Russell, well, that was a general observation, albeit one that the current exchange brought to mind. I suppose I could point out for clarity's sake that ignorance is no sin -- but being cocksure when you're ignorant, well.... So Archie's attacks on me are my fault? Come on, Marc. I have never called Archie stupid. I have never questioned his Christianity -- though in reaction to his recent treatment of me, I have let him know that I don't find his behavior very Christian. I have tried my level best to treat him respectfully. I have tried to direct my criticisms at what he says and explain why I think what he says is wrong, not attack him. But what I get is constant accusations that I don't really believe in God. That I don't care about what the Bible says. That, ultimately, I am not a Christian. Heck, today, he hit a new low: He accused me, on the basis of God only knows what mode of remote cognition, of not going to church this morning. !!! I am, quite frankly, tired of it. Not true! I teach about ""appeal to popularity"" and ""appeal to force"" all the time. But there's a difference between appealing to populartiy and reasonably arguing in favor of a popular position. You mean like all those conservatives encouraging civil discourse at the town hall meetings?

So thank you for placing me on ignore, you are just one less that I need to deal with on a regular basis. And no answer on the question I posed to tester, Matthew, the obvious child and TQ I see. Here it is again, and if you can't answer it, and you can't, then at least show me the fallacy of asking the proponents of biological evolution to support their conclusions by producing the known and allegedly proven foundational ingredients and processes upon which it is based.

For the life of me I can't comprehend how allegedly intelligent and educated people can swallow the evo drivel which you people do, hook line and sinker. I marvel at the incomprehensibility of it all. You have been deceived. You are believing a lie. You are adopting a false philosophy being sold as a science when it isn't even a valid or legitimate science. And what is worse you are attempting to defend something that you yourselves can't even find the absolutely undeniable evidence for, which proves that what YOU believe is an actual factual reality. How do you convince yourselves that a so called science is true, when you can't even prove it in absolute terms? Would you accept the science/mechanics that the internal combustion engine was real and valid if nobody ever actually got even one engine to run? I think not. You would say it's interesting in theory but the science doesn't work. And that would be a valid conclusion. But not with evolution. You will readily accept claims made about events which allegedly occurred starting @ 4.5 billion years ago. Events which can't be proven to have occurred at all, so they can't be repeated in a lab because the details of what allegedly occurred are unknown at every level of understanding. Can you tell me precisely what the temperature was back then? Precisely what chemicals made up the atmosphere, if any existed at all? Can you tell me the make up of the primordial ooze which your fairy tale asserts the first proteins or enzymes spontaneously appeared in? Or the temperature or chemical make up of the lava oceans which existed back then, from which the primordial ooze was synthesized over the first couple of billion years? And if I'm so egregiously ignorant tester, then how come I know enough to ask these questions of a subject I'm too ignorant to understand, which you giants of intellect have no hope of answering in another billion years? And if you don't know the answers to those initial, most basic questions regarding our origins of life on this planet according to your religions philosophy, then how egregiously ignorant is it of you to presume that the rest of the theory is at all rational? Now come back and tell me that I just don't get it tester. Tell me how ignorant I am as none of you can answer these questions from one source which will give absolute and verifiable evidence regarding the questions I have asked above. Now please forgive my ignorance. I hope I didn't embarrass myself again. Oh, and by the way; I know I wont get an answer from you since you can't answer my questions.

At the same time, however, my take is that Archangel consistently demonstrates such profound ignorance about science, coupled with bold arrogance, that I'm not surprised to see so many (myself included) exhibit exasperation. In my opinion, Archangel is in the minority in this thread for good reason: because he is ignorant and anti-rational. Whereas I'm typically sympathetic to the plight of those in the minority, precisely for the reasons you've described, I don't think individuals, such as Matthew, should remove themselves from the discussion just because they are in the majority. Rather than adding one more frustrated voice to the ""gang"" opposing Archangel, I think he has set a new standard on these forums. I sincerely believe I would feel the same way were he to argue a point with which I disagreed. (For example, I am indeed an atheist, yet I have no doubt that I would enjoy, and benefit from, reading his motives for being Christian.) Essentially, I don't understand your ultimate point: you seem to be saying that Archangel's discourse is superior to Matthew's because Matthew is part of the majority, rather than the value of his actual writing. Please correct me if I'm wrong.","marc9000","367724","Thanks. That's your opinion and that's fine. I don't completely agree because this is far from the only thread he (or I) have been in the minority in. We're in the minority because we're creationists . That he or I are ignorant about science may say more about your definition of science than it does about our ignorance. Who is really authorized to say where the line is drawn between science and philosophy? I don't know about setting a new standard (4forums has had lots of good posters - so many of them have disappeared) but I agree with you completely that he's a good poster. But not only in post 241, but in 250 and 253 also, he cozys up to posters that are here to do nothing but initiate flame wars. IMHO he would have better credibility if he didn't do that. The words he posts are by far good enough. Don't you think it's possible that attempts to harmonize with other posters could be a sign of weakness?

Yet if Archangel quits posting, 6 or 7 posters then agree that he has ""lost"" that he couldn't refute their arguments.

Today, computer chips are designed by evolution - so-called ' genetic algorithms '. This article lists - and cites - some of the many further uses of genetic algorithms. More directly and biologically, the medical profession have to deal with drug-resistant or antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria, which have evolved to become immune to current medicines. All of these meet the basic tenant of evolution - that random variation followed by selection results in improvement. There are even more basic examples - the that we share a common ancestor is the reason that drugs can be tested on animals, and our understanding of hereditary effects allows us to make transplants that are less likely to be rejected. That evolution has many applications is a proven fact. We can't tell you the specifics about the precise location and composition of the first proto-life (though we're working on it), but that isn't too relevant - or necessary.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","08:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","306"

Therefore, as you stated that the family was atheist, then by association their God which is your God is not a God, and since it's not a God and you reject all others, you are an atheist by your own argument.

"08-31-2009","13107",21,"Matthew","367654","Hi, Marc. Glad to see you again. I have to say, though, that I'm a little put off by this. In post 241, I didn't say that I found Archie stupid. Believe me when I say that I don't mean this at all facetiously, but I have given a great deal of thought over the last few years to the differences between unintelligence, ignorance, and stupidity, and how we use these terms. I have yet to call Archie either stupid or unintelligent. I do think that, based on what I see here, he is ignorant of evolutionary biology -- or perhaps, given some of the things he said earlier today, just extraordinarily careless about how he chooses to describe it. So Archie's attacks on me are my fault? Come on, Marc. I have never called Archie stupid. I have never questioned his Christianity -- though in reaction to his recent treatment of me, I have let him know that I don't find his behavior very Christian. I have tried my level best to treat him respectfully. I have tried to direct my criticisms at what he says and explain why I think what he says is wrong, not attack him. But what I get is constant accusations that I don't really believe in God. That I don't care about what the Bible says. That, ultimately, I am not a Christian. Heck, today, he hit a new low: He accused me, on the basis of God only knows what mode of remote cognition, of not going to church this morning. !!! I am, quite frankly, tired of it. Not true! I teach about ""appeal to popularity"" and ""appeal to force"" all the time. But there's a difference between appealing to populartiy and reasonably arguing in favor of a popular position. You mean like all those conservatives encouraging civil discourse at the town hall meetings?

I'm not his spokeman or apologist, as I said above, I'm just pointing out a few things that so many seem to forget. I agree, but the lopsidedness of some of this can cloud things. I glanced through the ""Biblical Contradictions"" forum here and didn't see (in the titles) anything about the Genesis 1 & 2 contradiction.

And I don't know that the dividing line can be made as sharp as many of us on each side of the debate sometimes state or imply.

If, as you say, ""the words I post are by far good enough,"" then why not address those instead of indulge in psychological speculations about me? But not to my arguments. What I say stands or falls on its own merits. Whomever I happen to agree or disagree with, or whatever emotions I may or may not motivate me, are completely irrelevant.

My repeated calling you out on your defense of the lie which evolution is as you oppose what your alleged God states actually happened in Genesis IS NOT A PERSONAL ATTACK ON YOU. IT IS A STATEMENT OF FACT REGARDING THE HYPOCRISY AND THE DOUBLE STANDARDS YOU REPRESENT IN EVERY DEBATE IN WHICH YOU OPPOSE PRECISELY THE SOURCE BOOK WHICH YOU OTHERWISE CLAIM TO BELIEVE IS TRUE. You can't have it both ways Matt. You either love the Lord or you hate Him, there is no middle ground. And that isn't my opinion, Jesus said it Himself. Mat 6:24 ""No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Mammon. Jhn 14:23 Jesus answered and said to him, ""If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him. Jhn 14:24 He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine but the Father's who sent Me. So please stop accusing me of attacking you when all I am doing is telling you the truth regarding the hypocrisy you represent here. Stop defending evolution in the name of Jesus as you continue to insist that you're a believer in Christ and I will stop calling you on the hypocrisy which you represent as you oppose the very spiritual truths you otherwise claim to believe in. Simply put, you don't represent Him well at all when you defend a lie in His name. I just don't know how many different ways to put it so you will get my point, but that's as clear as I can make it.

It's very much meant to refer to my character, rather than the truth or falsity of anything I say. See, Arch, here's the thing. If you want to tell me that I'm wrong to interpret the Bible non-literally, and explain to me why you think so, I'd have no problem with that. But you won't explain it. Instead, you tell me that I myself already know that I'm wrong, and that I'm saying otherwise anyway. Which is to say, that I'm lying. So it's entirely personal. It has nothing to do with presenting reasons why what I say is not correct, and everything to do with confronting my character (as you see it, of course). May I speak for myself here? Because the fact is, I am not saying this at all. You are saying it about me. I have already said, on multiple occasions, that the Bible expresses truths, but in a non-literal fashion. If you wish to argue against that position, fine. But it's not to impute lying even to the Bible's human authors, let alone to God himself. A non-literally expressed truth is not a lie. As I said earlier, it is becoming increasingly clear -- especially since some comments you made on the abortion threads -- that the root of the problem is this: you make no distinction between how you understand scripture, and scripture itself. It's why you present quotes, but never explain them. You simply declare that the scriptures never come back void -- and then presume that they always come back to others the way they come back to you. Since your opponents thus know what the scriptures mean, when they disagree with you, it's because they're dishonestly ignoring what they know to be the meaning of scripture. I'm not going to stop it, Archie. Because I honestly believe that God is our creator; that the Bible is not literally true, but nonetheless expresses spiritual truths; that life on this planet, including human life, evolved; and much else besides that is realated to these ideas. Honestly. I can see no reason to continue engaging someone who is going to construe any falsehoods I might assert not as honest mistakes but as hypocritical lies. It's a classic case of ""poisoning the well"": the very act of defending myself from the charge of dishonesty is just more evidence of my dishonesty.

I'll drive to work in a car fueled by gasoline derived from crude oil which is probably found by a study of evolutionary history as to where diatoms were millions of years ago. I'll go to work in a building designed using evolutionary algorithms in engineering. After work, I'll go to a bar and drink a special beer made by a millions of year old yeast that had properties and traits that were simpler in function and efficiency than yeast today that was discovered by a guy trying to get DNA out of millions of year old mosquitoes Jurassic Park style.

After I eat dinner, I'll wash the dishes and watch as denser items fall to the bottom of my sink faster then less dense items, exactly the opposite of what must have occurred for the global flood to have happened. After that, I'll take some medicine that big pharm used evolutionary principles to make. I may watch some TV after that with the presumption that the speed of light will remain constant as I watch TV, the exact opposite of an argument given by Archie. To power that TV, I'll rely on nuclear power which runs on the same principles as radiometric dating, something YEC adamantly rejects as a whole.

"09-01-2009","13107",23,"Archangel","367826","You cannot claim to believe God is God and that He is truly infallible while at the same time rejecting His explanation for how we came to exist. ... I mean, the theory [of evolution] asserts that 4.5 billion years ago all current life on Earth evolved from that original single celled organism which spontaneously sprang from the primordial ooze in a way which is unexplainable by evolutionists. How on Earth do you marry that origin up with God creating Man in His image for fellowship with the knowledge and understanding to name every creature on Earth which He also spoke into existence? Go on Matthew, explain that to me if you can!!! Then by all means it falls upon you to explain to me, the literalist, how you can marry the Genesis account for a personal and intelligently designed creation with your version of biological evolution by way of random mutation. ... So invest in one more post and answer my questions above if you can. I'm betting you wont even try... Or how about [Neil Shubins Your Inner Fish: A Journey into the 3.5 Billion Year History of the Human Body ]. This meshes perfectly with the Genesis account, doesn't it Matthew?","Matthew","367888","Archie, I do not believe the Genesis account is ""His explanation for how we came to exist."" I believe that the Genesis account s of creation are a pair of human expressions of what it means for God to be the creator of the universe and the world and life and humanity. I do not interpret it literally. Much of your post asks me to square scientific cosmological and biological ideas with Genesis. If one interprets Genesis literally , then I myself will happily acknowledge that this cannot be done! But to reiterate my point, I do not think Genesis must be or even should be interpreted literally. So all those demands are beside the point. They are asking me to do something I have never even claimed to do. What I do claim is that evolution is fully compatible with the spiritual truths expressed by the Genesis account(s): that God is; that all things depend upon him for their existence; that through him all things are made good; that our potential for understanding and for goodness make us ""like"" God; and much, much more. In fact, I would say that many such truths are probably expressed by Genesis even on a literal interpretation! The question is, in order for these truths to be revealed, must the depiction of the events be a literally true, historically accurate account? That's where my answer is, ""No."" The scriptures are allegory: literally false, but revealing the truth. Believe it or not, I even believe the Bible is divinely inspired. But as I once said to Marc, I don't think any amount of divine inspiration can eliminate our intellectual and moral finitude and fallibility -- not even in the case of the authors of the Bible. Sometimes, the all-too-human appears in the text. But I don't think that makes the authors liars, and still less would I hold God responsible for any of their failings. More importantly, it certainly doesn't lessen the profound impact that the scriptures can have in one's life, and in one's relationship to God. I was originally going to respond to your whole post, point by point. But I'm going to keep this shorter and cut most of that. Not, mind you, because I'm hypocritical or dishonest or lazy, but because I'm trying to avoid a needlessly repetitive response. You see, almost everything kept revolving around the same basic problem, and the above seems to illustrate it well. Namely: You keep asking me to reconcile evolution with the events depicted in Genesis, i.e., with the literal interpretation. But I've never even claimed to do this, Archie! What I claim is that evolution can be reconciled to the spiritual truths expressed in Genesis. And that's a different ball of wax entirely. There is, however, one spot that seemed to indicate a somewhat different difficulty. And it's what came next. Here the point seems not to be about the Genesis account specifically, but about the more general theological ""problem of evil."" Certainly, there are some evolutionists -- and Richard Dawkins springs readily to mind here -- who think that the realities of suffering are not compatible with a benevolent God. This seems to be what you're driving at by invoking ""design"" against ""randomness."" Forgive me if I've misconstrued the thrust of this particular comment. But on this score, I've never understood why evolution is any greater or lesser threat to religion than any other natural phenomenon. If one does not consider humanly unpredictable natural events like earthquakes and tsunamis to threaten supernatural design, then one shouldn't take humanly unpredictable natural events like genetic mutations to threaten it, either. All that evolution does is locate a great deal of unpredictable unpleasantness within the entire process of life itself. In fact, one could actually make a case for a certain convergence of the evolutionary view and the Biblical view in some respects. Consider stories like the Fall and its consequences, or the Book of Job. And is what these stories say about the human condition -- and how to deal with it -- really lessened by taking them non-literally? Personally, I think not. Well, I did try. But I'm pretty sure I can't answer those questions. Before you congratulate yourself too quickly, however, let me point out that this is not because I am the hypocrite you claim I am. It's because what you're asking simply doesn't make sense. I don't hold that the Bible is literally true, yet you keep asking me to reconcile evolution with the literal interpretation. What I claim is that evolution is not compatible with a literal interpretation of Genesis. And that, I'm guessing, is a point about which you and I agree! (Will wonders never cease? ) But I also claim that evolution is compatible with spiritual truths that can be revealed even by a non -literal interpretation. And I'm also guessing that this is where we disagree, at a fundamental level: I take it that spiritual truths can be revealed even if the literal depictions are false, whereas you think and correct me if I'm wrong that spiritual truths can be revealed only if the literal depictions are true. Sound about right? And finally, from your subsequent post: With the events literally depicted in Genesis? Of course not. But with the spiritual truths expressed by Genesis? Absolutely. Remember: I do not interpret the Bible literally. I may be wrong about that, and youre welcome to explain why. But Im not being inconsistent when I say that both evolutionary biology and Genesis are true. Evolution is true as an explanation of certain natural processes. Genesis is true as an expression of Gods relationship to all such natural processes. Theres nothing inconsistent about that.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","10:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","338"

Here is an admitted theological apologetics site which deals with this issue rather than me just insisting how wrong your fleshly perceptions are. Apologetics Press - Are There Two Creation Accounts in Genesis? And your deductive reasoning is fallacious on every level of rationale if you are serious about having a philosophical debate which comes to concrete conclusions. Your following statement defines the problem with attempting to reason with you. Here's the problem Matthew, you are copping out by declaring that just because you don't interpret Genesis literally that you don't have to even consider what it plainly and directly says in comparison to what your evolution perspective claims happened. We are debating what each philosophy promotes so discussing what they actually say is not only valid but required in order to objectively consider the consistency of each philosophy. You have stated that evolution is fully compatible with the spiritual truths expressed by the Genesis account even though it doesn't agree with it in specific terms. I have asked you to explain how that can be, but you refuse to explain yourself by saying that because you don't interpret the bible literally, you needn't consider it in those terms. Well that isn't the way debates work. You needn't agree with a literal interpretation of Genesis in order to observe and judge the differences which are glaring and obvious between the two belief systems. In other words, just because you don't interpret Genesis literally, that doesn't mean you can't discuss the obvious contradictions which exist between how I interpret it and how you interpret evolution, just as I have discussed it by pointing out the contradictions I observe between the two philosophies. These issues are fine and relevant in a discussion about moral principles and Gods values in the bible, but what do they have to do with what we are discussing in regard to the literal events of creation as compared to the literal beliefs of evolution? The answer is nothing. You are attempting to justify avoiding directly answering my challenge to explain how evolution can be married with the literal interpretation of Genesis just because you don't literally interpret Genesis. When the issue is that you have plainly said originally, that the two belief systems don't contradict each other. But of course they do, just as I said they do. This is irrational and inconsistent gibberish Matthew. There is nothing about the Genesis account of creation which is written in the allegorical style of writing. You are forcing that label on it where no literary evidence of that is evident at all. Tell me what it allegorical about this, in any way? Gen 1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Gen 1:2 The earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the Spirit of God was moving over the face of the waters. Gen 1:3 And God said, ""Let there be light""; and there was light. Gen 1:4 And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. Gen 1:5 God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day. Gen 1:6 And God said, ""Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters."" Gen 1:7 And God made the firmament and separated the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. And it was so. Gen 1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day. Gen 1:9 And God said, ""Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear."" And it was so. Gen 1:10 God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good. Gen 1:11 And God said, ""Let the earth put forth vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, upon the earth."" And it was so. Gen 1:12 The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. Gen 1:13 And there was evening and there was morning, a third day. Gen 1:14 And God said, ""Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years, Gen 1:15 and let them be lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth."" And it was so. Gen 1:16 And God made the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; he made the stars also. Gen 1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth, Gen 1:18 to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. Gen 1:19 And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day. Gen 1:20 And God said, ""Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the firmament of the heavens."" Gen 1:21 So God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. Gen 1:22 And God blessed them, saying, ""Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."" Gen 1:23 And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day. Gen 1:24 And God said, ""Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds."" And it was so. Gen 1:25 And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the cattle according to their kinds, and everything that creeps upon the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. Gen 1:26 Then God said, ""Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth."" Gen 1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. Gen 1:28 And God blessed them, and God said to them, ""Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth."" Gen 1:29 And God said, ""Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food. Gen 1:30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food."" And it was so. Gen 1:31 And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, a sixth day. No matter how you cut it, you are denying the truth of Gods version for His personal and very intelligent design and creation of Man in His image. He mentions nowhere that we grew from lower life forms over millions or billions of years. In fact He says just the opposite. You are attempting to compromise His explanation for creation with a man made secular view in which the only literal aspect I can surmise from it is your attempt to blend the two philosophies where none is possible in a rational or realistic way.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","12:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","339"

But this way of putting it makes it sound like it's about you , at a personal level, when in fact it's about creationism itself, at the level of what it says . Originally posted by marc9000 Who is really authorized to say where the line is drawn between science and philosophy? It's very much a matter of debate within the philsophy of science itself. Has been for decades. And I don't know that the dividing line can be made as sharp as many of us on each side of the debate sometimes state or imply. But of course, if the point is to criticize someone's distinction, then ""who's to say"" criticisms could go either way. Right? Come now. Most of the reasoning you're dancing through here is thoroughly ad hominem. It's not rude, and far from insulting or offensive. But it's directed at me, not at what I say, which is ad hominem. If, as you say, ""the words I post are by far good enough,"" then why not address those instead of indulge in psychological speculations about me? But not to my arguments. What I say stands or falls on its own merits. Whomever I happen to agree or disagree with, or whatever emotions I may or may not motivate me, are completely irrelevant. Either my case is a good one, or it isn't. And either way, it's a matter of the reasons given, not any features about me.","marc9000","368009","I consider it to be more about the society I live in - the worldviews of future generations, or today's generation for that matter. Moral decline, increasing debt, increasing dependence on government, etc. I agree - It can't. We have a best selling book called ""How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist"", we have Kenneth Miller saying that science shows God more vividly than Bible study possibly can, and we have many scientists saying that science does not/cannot address the existance of God at all. Yet someone here (maybe not you - I don't remember exactly who) telling Archangel that he doesn't understand science. If we can't put an accurate finger on where the line is between philosophy and science, that's not a fair accusation. But they seldom do. Practically no one in the scientific community is going to accuse Victor Stenger of not understanding science. Is his book title a lie or isn't it? It's simply an equal response to your posts like #241, 250, or 253. They're not rude on your part, and not directly insulting or offensive to me, but they're positive comments to those few who do nothing (concerning me) other than making ad hominem posts. On a level distinctively higher than anything Archangel does against any one at any time. Archangel does not use vulgar language, for example. See above. I don't agree - there are psycological advantages/disadvantages in debating. They're a large part of the foundation of the ""logical fallacy"" lists. Not that I agree with them all, but ""argument by emotive language"" really can sway an observer.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","349"

Especially since you have no real or actual experience of my scriptural interpretation of the bible being erroneous at all. You see, Beside the fact that our complete debate above is me defending the bible and Matthew opposing it, common sense would tell us that you would have a valid point if in fact it was Matthew who was defending the plain and simple version of what the Genesis account clearly says against evolution, and it was me who insisted that the secular humanist philosophy of evo was correct in opposition to the Genesis account of Creation. Then one could reasonably surmise that it is his interpretation which is spiritual and intelligent. But when he insists that a philosophy which has absolutely nothing in common with the spiritual account which I have shown repeatedly above, yet he claims it is complimentary to it, well that is just plain irrational. And what's really scary is that your spiritual insight is so nonexistent that this must be pointed out to you.

At least Matthew is prepared to look at the evidence that surrounds him (ie 'The Truth', otherwise known as 'Reality') and interpret scripture in light of new evidence.

Though it should also be noted that sometimes, we're just sitting at opposite ends of the pew.... I'm not sure what the point of this criticism should be. You don't separate yourself from Archie, despite that so many of us here consider his behavior frequently rude. Should we judge you based on your association with him? Or should we perhaps deal with you as an individual? I have been on the receiving end for years. Not at present, thank heavens. But I dealt with exactly this sort of thing within the church , primarily during my twenties. And my father, who is a minister, often had it worse. But of course, my large point is: none of this matters! What I believe, what my dad believes, what you believe, what Archie believes -- none of it is either true or false just because any of us objectively is or subjectively feels persecuted by the powers that be. I was not suggesting that Christians should be quiet. I was suggesting that they should be respectful and kind. Marc, I would love that. (And there is so! ) Just let me know. A concluding tangent: I do apologize for not getting back to you with regard to the other posts. At this point, maybe it's okay to let it go. I imagine we're going to have plenty of opportunity to cover similar territory. I would like to address the meaning of John 10:30, though.

And your constant reference to the TWO allegedly contradictory versions of Creation in Chapters 1 and 2 are perfect examples of the truth of this assessment. Here is an admitted theological apologetics site which deals with this issue rather than me just insisting how wrong your fleshly perceptions are. Apologetics Press - Are There Two Creation Accounts in Genesis? Fifth, it is argued that Genesis 1 represents animals as existing before man (24-26), yet Genesis 2 has Adam created before the animals are formed (19). The text of Genesis 2:19 merely suggests that the animals were formed before being brought to man; it says nothing about the relative origins of man and beast in terms of chronology. The critic is reading something into the text that simply is not there. Genesis 1 is the account of the creation of the universe and life on planet earth as it happened in chronological sequence. Genesis 2 is simply an expanded explanation of the events that occurred at the end of the sixth creation day - when God created human beings. Genesis one provides virtually no details about the creation of human beings (other than the idea that humans were created in the image of God). For a book that is dedicated to the relationship between humans and God, four verses seems like a rather poor explanation for the creation of God's preeminent creature. This is because Genesis one was never intended to stand apart from Genesis 2 and 3. Genesis 2 describes God's preparation of a specific location on earth (Eden) for habitation by the first human beings. Part of the confusion results from our English translations, which use the term ""earth"" when the Hebrew would better be translated ""land.""","marc9000","368021","That's a good link, but a long one, probably beyond the patience of most evolutionists. I'll try to condense it in this post - it's really quite simple. (as my 9th grade algebra teacher used to say ) From that link; (boldface mine) Genesis 2 is not chronology, whereas Genesis 1 is. Most verses in chapter two begin with the word and. It does not say and then it just says and. It is outlining how things are, not in the order that they were created. Genesis two is about the first humans, and a description of the place of habitation for them. That's all Genesis 2 is. Another good, and brief, link on the subject; Ask.com Search Engine - Better Web Search Those who are quick to read an English translation of the Bible and declare a contradiction also should keep in mind how the original language was used in that day and time.

In other words, that even one species has evolved into another species, eventually resulting in MAN. You can't even show that evolution relies on the strict and very established rules of running repeatable and verifiable experiments which define the scientific method in every other branch of science.

So how could you possibly run any accurate, credible, reasonable or valid experiments since you have no actual foundational facts to input into any controlled and repeatable experiments? And of course the larger question is how are you defending a theory in which no foundational information regarding its origins can be determined at all? Does that make sense to you or does it seem completely backwards to you as it does to me?

But it's apparent to me that until you can verify the foundational beliefs which allegedly occurred 4.5 billion years ago which you claim led to original life on Earth, then everything else you are claiming and placing your faith in is no different than trying to convince me that Aesop's Fables is a historical record.

"09-04-2009","13107",28,"Databed","368264","Sure, I apologize. But we have posted plenty of evidence that should at least be considered. The fact is that is is not being considered, and I believe it is due to the reason listed above. I must note that my previous posting was closer to the topic than the thread had been. We were not even speaking of Biblical accounts. I pose to Arch, just as he does to us, Biblical creation cannot be true due to the fact that we see no evidence ANYWHERE. There is no evidence of a global flood. There's not enough water to flood the world. There is no evidence for Adam and Eve. In fact, the simple fact that we have found pre-homo sapiens hominids already disproves this account. We see fossil evidence for animals existing way before any humans. The Bible contains absolutely NO information that was not commonly known at the time it was written. It doesn't include anything about other galaxies, solar systems, or even anything about the other 75% of the globe that had not yet been explored. It also contains nothing about dinosaurs or any of the extinct animals that had not been discovered. Shouldn't have God accounted for these things? I realize that Christians have explained away the age of the Earth by saying God is not temporal. This is not in the Bible I might add, but even if it was, didn't it take definitive proof of the age of the Earth before this was used by creationists to account for an old Earth? Maybe not exactly on the subject of creation, but relevant still: There is no evidence that God carved any stone tablets. In fact, it makes sense that people were deceived by Moses who would have been quite good at carving stone. He did, after all, come from Egypt where most of the stone carvings from the time originate. He would have had plenty of time, even according to the Bible, to obtain and create these tablets. Where is evidence for God's hand in any of this? Haven't many of the accounts and interpretations of the Bible been COMPLETELY disproven? The Earth is not the center of the universe. The Earth is not flat. The Earth is older than the Bible claims (not just creation accounts). etc etc History and the Bible do not always agree. Accounts of historical events from other civilizations often contain similar stories, and it is easy to speculate they have common origins, but often the Bible is not consistent with older accounts of the same events.

"09-04-2009","13107",28,"Databed","368275","It was generally understood that the Earth was flat at the time the Bible was written. There are plenty of statements that at least imply a flat Earth. The general church account of the universe was a geocentric one. This was the belief by all accounts until Galileo found contrary evidence at which time he was persecuted by the Christian church (they have since admitted that this was in error and apologized). So maybe the Bible doesn't say it specifically enough to use as absolute, but this was the interpretation at the time people were writing the Bible.. The Biblical account of genesis DOES imply an age to the Earth. Why do you think there are so many Christians that actually believe the Earth is thousands rather than billions of years old.","gansao","368276","Some ancient Greeks new that the earth was round but let us go to what I actually stated.The Bible does not state that the Earth is flat. The Catholic church adopted the Aristotlian view of the world for what may have been very cynical reasons. Please show me where in the Bible it says that the universe is a geocentic one.

If you trace the time line backwards as it is in the 1st testament, though there is no definitive way of doing this, you will find the Bible implies the Earth is only thousands of years old. If you were to make every assumption in such a way as to make the time line as long as possible, you still wouldn't be close, even though each generation is hundreds of years long. Just because one account leaves a window for you to add a few billion years, doesn't mean you can totally discount the one that doesn't. That leads me to another point: How do you explain the contradictions in dates, time lines, places that are presented in the different accounts within the Bible? I just read Genesis and found one within the first few pages. In one account, man comes before the animals. In another, the animals come first. I had never heard this one, so I'm sure creationists have a quick way to explain this away. I would like to hear it. Did I miss something?","gansao","368278","You tell me!

This means that at least part of the Bible is wrong which in turn gives reasonable doubt directed towards the entirety of the Bible. . This is not to mention the corruption within the Church clergy who compiled the Bible,. a primitive understanding of the world from people who would have observed and interpreted the stories which eventually made it into the Bible, the loss of accuracy from stories that would have been at least partially passed down through oral narrations, the possibility of people simply making things up, limited translation abilities etc etc. I could go on and on.","gansao","368280","Then there is no need to apportion incorrect statements where no statement has been made.

The Apollo moon shot calculations to get the spacecraft to the moon and back used Newtonian physics knowing that the General theory of relativity was a more accurate theory. I understand that Newtonian physics was quite accurate enough do the job. Newtonian physics was an approximation..nearly the correct explanation but was supplanted by Einstein.

Oh wait, you can't explain it. Which is why you guys even theorize alien origins for the first signs of life on primordial earth via exogenesis. Origin of life: Alien origin taken seriously? Ghost of Francis Crick smiles wanly According to Matthew Hutson at Popular Mechanics, ""5 Projects Ask if Life on Earth Began as Alien Life in Space"" (December 16, 2008): For years, scientists have considered the possibility of exogenesis, the idea that life arrived on Earth from another planet, and not just the building blocks of life, but organisms that were ready to rock and roll when they arrived. Its a Rube Goldberg scenario, however, dependent on several successful steps. First, life has to evolve on an alien planet. Then it must be blasted into space on a rock, probably from a large impact. Assuming it survives a long journey through harsh conditionsand makes its way into our neighborhoodlife then has to resist fiery atmospheric entry and a brutal landing before trying to make a new home for itself. Five projects. I wonder if the ghost of Francis Crick is their patron saint? (The double helix guy believed, controversially, that life must have come from outer space.) Colliding Universes: Origin of life: Alien origin taken seriously? Ghost of Francis Crick smiles wanly You remember Crick from earlier in the debate don't you? The guy who said that a 747 self constructing from the parts in a junk yard is more likely than life spontaneously appearing in a harsh and uninviting primordial earth. HERE'S MORE ON THAT SUBJECT: Origin of life: There must be life out there! vs. There can't be life out there! Robert Deyes provides a helpful summary of the see-saw between the belief that life must exist on other planets (inevitablists) and that it cannot (impossiblists): 'Life, Life Everywhere' was the title of a 1996 article in Scientific American that focused on the crucial question of whether the origins of life were truly an inevitable consequence of some fundamental natural tendency in the universe towards great complexity (Ref 2). From our modern stand point, it was really Fred Hoyle that challenged this 'inevitablist' school by proclaiming vehemently that, ""the emergence of a living cell from an inanimate chemical soup is about as likely as the assembly of a 747 by a whirlwind passing through a junkyard"" (Ref 2). So the modern 'improbabilist' was born, taking on the contrasting inevitabilist view in a head to head intellectual battle. While the inevitabilists used the sudden appearance of the cell almost 3.85 billion years ago (Ref 3) as evidence of life's inevitability, improbabilists such as the late Francis Crick proposed that life was unlikely to have arisen on earth and must have been seeded from outer space (Ref 2). After all if life were truly a rare phenomenon, space transportation networks would have been required to spread it around hospitable planets. Hmmm. The middle ground between inevitable and impossible is about as solid as the middle of a Lifesaver. Colliding Universes: Origin of life: There must be life out there! vs. There can't be life out there! SO WHAT IS IT YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT MAGIC PINFOLD?

Ahh, then why do you constantly insist that evolution is a reliable and tested science based on rational conclusions when you now admit that it is a theoretical branch which can never be tested or proven to be sound? Not very consistent, or even truthful of you Db. Maybe in your simple mind this is a valid opinion.

Really? This is your definition of science?

Would you produce evidence of extra-species evolution which shows that one species/type/genus of animal has evolved from another species/type/genus? Forgive my redundancy, but I have learned that I must be very precise in order to not allow your side the wiggle room to purposely misrepresent what I am asking you to prove. Speaking of patterns in nature and their interpretation by both sides of this debate; this raises an argument I have repeatedly made which has been widely ignored by you in this debate, and before you appeared here, by your cohorts. And that is that we creationists don't ignore or deny any of the physical observations you evolutionists see, at all. From fossils to the layers of strata they are found in, to geology, cosmology or quantum mechanics and physics. What we do is interpret those observations differently than you do. We see the fossil record as evidence that the various layers of strata and fossils were laid down quickly, The 1993 Midwest Floods and Rapid Canyon Formation in fact rapidly which explains why they have survived intact where as we have, and I have posted time lapse film of animals being completely consumed into non existence in less than a week in the wild today. Be it by insect consumption and scavengers carrying off the remains as shown here: YouTube - Rabbit decomposition (time-lapse video) in post 123 of this thread. Here is that post so you can read my complete argument from it: http://www.4forums.com/political/366776-post123.html You evolution apologists have no response to these realities as you imagine that the ancient dead animals just laid there, never decomposing or being consumed by scavengers as the earth slowly buried them perfectly intact for us to find in the distant future. So I ask again Db, who is it that is preaching magic and outrageous fairy tales in insisting that what you preach is even the least bit rational or reasonable? Wrong again Db, my faith is not blind at all. I have personally tested and questioned every single aspect of my world view. And since we both rely on faith in holding to what we believe, I know that He whom I rely is faithful, true and trustworthy since He is real and all encompassing. You, on the other hand are placing your faith in fallen and flawed Man in accepting the man made religion of evolution which is so inconsistent and irrational as to ignore known decomposition rates as they insist that the fossil record as they define it is rational at all.

"09-06-2009","13107",31,"Databed","368264","Sure, I apologize. But we have posted plenty of evidence that should at least be considered. The fact is that is is not being considered, and I believe it is due to the reason listed above. I pose to Arch, just as he does to us, Biblical creation cannot be true due to the fact that we see no evidence ANYWHERE. There is no evidence of a global flood. There's not enough water to flood the world. There is no evidence for Adam and Eve. In fact, the simple fact that we have found pre-homo sapiens hominids already disproves this account. We see fossil evidence for animals existing way before any humans. The Bible contains absolutely NO information that was not commonly known at the time it was written. It doesn't include anything about other galaxies, solar systems, or even anything about the other 75% of the globe that had not yet been explored. It also contains nothing about dinosaurs or any of the extinct animals that had not been discovered. Shouldn't have God accounted for these things? I realize that Christians have explained away the age of the Earth by saying God is not temporal. This is not in the Bible I might add, but even if it was, didn't it take definitive proof of the age of the Earth before this was used by creationists to account for an old Earth? Maybe not exactly on the subject of creation, but relevant still: There is no evidence that God carved any stone tablets. In fact, it makes sense that people were deceived by Moses who would have been quite good at carving stone. He did, after all, come from Egypt where most of the stone carvings from the time originate. He would have had plenty of time, even according to the Bible, to obtain and create these tablets. Where is evidence for God's hand in any of this? Haven't many of the accounts and interpretations of the Bible been COMPLETELY disproven? The Earth is not the center of the universe. The Earth is not flat. The Earth is older than the Bible claims (not just creation accounts). etc etc History and the Bible do not always agree. Accounts of historical events from other civilizations often contain similar stories, and it is easy to speculate they have common origins, but often the Bible is not consistent with older accounts of the same events. I'm not exactly the most knowledgeable of the details of the Bible (I consider it historical myth), but I do know the basics. I'm sure your defense will in part be to pick apart these statements looking for discrepancies. You will probably ask for specifics, knowing full well what they are or at least what I'm referring to. So, can you you offer any proof that anything I have stated above is not true?","Archangel","368552","You personally haven't posted one iota of evidence at all on this complete thread since showing up, so I don't know what you mean by this all inclusive ""WE"" you speak of. Also, I have read the so called evidence and refuted what was worthy of responding to. I have told these mooks on numerous occasions that I don't respond to Talk Origin links which exists solely for the purpose of responding to every Creationist perspective with evolution talking points which do nothing but promote the very lies I have effectively refuted to the frustration of you and your cohorts. This is another untruth which is promoted by secular humanists and is founded in willful ignorance that there is another way to interpret all of the same geological evidence we all have access to. In fact the complete fossil record and the strata it is found in is accepted by creationists as evidence of the Great Flood. Our disagreement is not in the available evidence but in the interpretation of it which you stubbornly claim as proving your perspective but what I insist proves mine. So lets begin this exchange by agreeing that we both claim the same physical evidence which we interpret differently. You have no upper hand here regarding the physical evidence we observe in the natural world Db. Really? There is no genetic evidence for a common ancestor who is much more recent than 3 1/2 million years ago when evolution claims the earliest humans broke off from primates? I suppose you have never heard of the Mitochondrial Eve and biblical Eve are looking good: criticism of young age is premature The problem with debating you evolutionists is that you never bother even looking at the other side of the story. The bible is chock full of information that wasn't readily known at that time. The problem is it's too voluminous for me to outline for you. It would require actually studying it and educating yourself in order to discover the truth for yourself. Also, how many solar systems do you believe exist within our universe? He did. You are just too ignorant to know the contents of what the bible actually says. Because it does mention dinosaurs. They just weren't called dinosaurs when the bible was written. They were called Leviathan, Behemoth and Beasts. Here are the passages which describe them. Dinosaurs and the Bible You should stick to defending your religion rather than mine because I don't know what you're talking about here. What I can say is that Jesus Himself said that man has existed since the beginning of creation, and here's the passage where he says it in defense of how God has always believed in the unity between a man and a woman. Mar 10:5 And Jesus answered and said to them, ""Because of the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept. Mar 10:6 But from the beginning of the creation, God 'made them male and female.' [fn] Mar 10:7 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, Of course Db, Moses is a scam artist now, rather than one of Israel's great Patriarchs. And he duped a whole generation of Jews to follow him for 40 years in the wilderness. And don't forget the fire which led them by night and the smoke which led them by day, and let's not forget the manna which fell from heaven to feed them. And let's not forget about when he struck a rock with his Rod and water flowed from it. That Moses was such a trickster Db. The 10 commandments were the least of Gods miracles through him sonny boy. And you obviously have no idea what his life represented for you to have made such a shallow and ignorant statement. No, in fact just the opposite is true. Here again, educate yourself: Archeological evidence regarding the Bible More generalizations and unsupported claims without even one bit of actual evidence. Rather than posting meaningless opinions, give me something to respond to, ok? I have offered proof refuting the specific claims you have raised here. But when you say you're not exactly knowledgeable about the bible, that's an understatement.

I was rather surprised at your latest posts, actually. I was quite glad to see you had not lost your mind after all The issue you raise is worth of interest. While scientific terminology is a bit more precies, with theory going beyond mere hypothesis, that's not of interest now. The idea of absolute proof is more interest. At the strictest sense, no past event is actually provable - we cannot observe it any more, we can only infer that it took place from it's consequences. One cannot prove the theory of evolution in this fashion, since it is already in the past and also can not be recreated on a realistic time scale. However, would not that same criteria make proving creation as impossible to prove? It is also in the past, after all... But then, this is a matter of ontology. Which opens all kinds of interesting questions, of course, but I must confess I am rather set in my ways when it comes ot it. I feel certain that it is essentially only a tradeoff - a trade of certainty for the knowable. The more certain one wants to be, the less is knowable, and opposite, the more we want to know, the less certain we can be of it.

'In other words gansao, you don't need scientific proof to believe in Gods Creation account by faith because you know that God is neither a liar nor an unreliable advocate' This is what I have been repeating throughout my posts..to prove a scientific point to a man of faith you may have to disprove god. So by definition, you cannot prove that point if that is the case. This has been described as madness, blind faith, stupidity etc etc but that is what happens to the faithful, they are constantly tested and tempted. You know why and you know the consequences. As I believe in evolution I can only respect the creationist view. actually, it gets even worse, I dont think that it matters! Whatever is, is. I wanted undisputable proof of evolution because I knew it didnt exist and the more that some become abusive and angry the easier it was to dismiss their arguments and to frustrate them but as soon as Iuris stated ..

Here's what I mean gansao; Let's imagine that the Genesis account told its story as it is up to a point and then described the process of evolution taking over and leading from lower life forms up to human beings who were the evolutionary pinnacle as evidence that life change stops at this apex creature which is a true reflection of God since we resemble His characteristics of reason, imagination and creativity. In other words, let's say God started out creating only the lower animals and allowed evolution to create the process of creation culminating with Human beings which are the final reflection of Him. If this were presented in Gods word then I would be its greatest advocate. The big lie of evolutionists is that we creationists have some axe to grind with evolution since we are somehow threatened by it. That is far from the truth. All I am concerned with is the absolute truth from the living Gods perspective. I don't care if it led to evolution at all as I would accept that without question if I had any inkling at all that it was true. The fact is that the bibles account doesn't read that way. And there is no way to rationally marry the two belief systems and remain scripturally consistent. Therefore I reject evolution in favor of the scriptural account without question and defend what I know is true and trustworthy in spite of what the opposition insists is their truth. Because I know that their truth is a manufactured lie of men. Where as my truth is from God, the maker of all that is. So it isn't necessary for me to have all the questions of the creation account answered in absolute terms in order to know and trust that as long as God knows the answers to these questions, then that knowledge is right, true and secure in Him as a worthy and perfect creator.

Here's a thought tq; what if T.O., being a legitimate source of scientific info as you assert, actually considered all interpretations of the scientific evidence on evolution with an open and objective mind and attitude as science is supposed to work? You know, instead of having the us against them attitude which they profoundly represent in such a condescending fashion in every page they write? They are no different than Hanoi Jane in their stated agenda to oppose, dismantle, demoralize and if possible defeat everyone who opposes evolution in the court of public opinion. That isn't science, it is advocacy, plain and simple. My falsehoods? I doubt that the opposing pro-evolution powers that be would create any site just to stand against lil ole me. No tq, they exist to stand against a complete school of thought which legitimately interprets the available observations we all make differently than your secular humanist interpretation allows for. Here is a list which T.O. calls ""Creationist Claims"" which they state before spewing their propaganda. An Index to Creationist Claims So you see; they don't exist to promote pure science at all, the exist to oppose any and all who question their results as is obvious by their dedicated goal of attacking the opposition in a condescending way before even discussing their stated so called science. You mean the other allegations they contrive in order to support the lies and myths they represent? Those citations? I'm not impressed tq. You actually believe that if five people come forward and support your lie then your lie must be true. That in a nut shell is what the evolution community represents in reality. You see, it doesn't matter how many advocates you dig up to support your myth of evolution, it will never succeed in erasing the living God from truly existing and having created all life as we know it, in reality. Here is an example of the crux of the circular reasoning T.O. represents. This link goes to the claim of Darwin's racism: CA005.1: Darwin's racism Notice how it links not to Darwin's book ever, to show the original referred to quotes as evidence that creationists claims are false, which the claims are based upon, but links back to other T.O. pages in a circular pattern which never gets you out of T.O. into any real objective scientific sources which supports their defense in any real or significant way. And where are those famous citations in that example, you refer to TQ? Cuz I don't see them because the links go no where at all. Weird huh? Or is it just typical and to be expected from this fraud of a propaganda site. Every time I have attempted to use T.O. in order to trace back to the actual roots of the so called evidence they are proposing, I have found myself in this endless loop of self supporting propaganda. But never have I been able to go deeper into scientific understanding which is founded in actual evidence. It is a smoke screen of shallow justifications which are self serving and bogus at their core. And what is truly scary is that you believers in T.O. and evolution are so dumbed down that you can't even recognize what this promoter and defender of a pseudo scientific fraud represents in reality. And I challenge you to confront and disprove what I am pointing out here by linking to a claim above and showing that it links to hard and fast evidence within its explanation of the question being investigated.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","499"

"09-07-2009","13107",34,"birdan","365579","If I may derail the derailment for a moment and respond to the OP ..... The most effective argument I've found is heat . I've read quite a bit of young earth creationist literature, and I have not found any arguments to counter thermodynamics. The argument is basically as follows: YECs agree that volcanic rock was produced by volcanoes, meteor craters were produced by meteors, tectonics occurred in the past, metamorphic rock was formed in the past, etc. They argue that all these processes were simply ""speeded up"" and occurred within the last 10,000 years. But all the above processes produce heat. Trying to reduce 4.5 billion years of thermodynamic history to a 10,000 year period results in a molten earth. Since the earth is not currently molten, the YEC argument fails. The nice thing about this line of argumentation is that the energy amounts can easily be calculated and demonstrated based on 19th century physics. If you can get a YEC to engage in this line of argumentation long enough, they will either: 1. say that volcanic rock is not from volcanoes, etc.; or 2. invoke a miracle that whisked the heat away. If they go the #1 route, then they must defend against the 'God is a deceiver' argument. If they go the #2 route, then (by invoking the miraculous) they have effectively shut the science classroom door on the teaching of creationism. A similar argument can be made for YEC cosmological stories, such as Humphrey's white hole cosmology: trying to reduce a 13.7 billion year old universe into a few years produces such a concentrated amount of energy that the solar system would not exist. I have argued with many YECs and most will simply 'disappear' from this argument. Of those that stay around, they respond as above.","obvious_child","368691","I do recall citing these very two posts before as evidence of solid effective arguments for disproving Biblical Creation: http://www.4forums.com/political/365144-post9.html http://www.4forums.com/political/365579-post66.html But as expected, thou who is not rational will ignore these two despite one being made three weeks ago and the other posted 4 days short of a month ago.

Turns out, even if two breeds cannot breed successfully, they can still be considered the same species because of the gene flow between the two breeds carried by intermittent breeds. This means in order for a new species to emerge, it cannot be able to breed with ANY of the breeds that fall in between. Since a chihuahua can breed with a dachshund which can breed with a hair terrier which can breed with a collie which can breed with a Labrador which can breed with a St. Bernard, you don't really have a new species. This is reasonable, but the solution is to simply kill all the in between dogs, in which case, without changing the two species being considered at all, you have now drawn a firm line between them and created a new species. Natural evolution works like this as well. Fast changes in a species forced by changes in environment and then the rapid weeding out of the changes that are not successful. This creates gaps in the fossil record and gives creationists a good weapon to refute evolution. A jump from one species to the next can be obscure since there is always a gene flow between them though the species that existed between are now extinct. You wont see this as dramatic as with dogs since man made conditions change much faster than natural conditions. You do see the same level of changes in genes, although fewer changes in physical characteristics. This is why we still can breed any two breeds of dog through artificial insemination. There just simply hasn't been enough time for the genome to diverge and you will only see physical characteristics resulting in impossible interbreeding. In enough time, any two breeds of dog and the new breeds bred out of them, will have incompatible DNA among other dogs.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","12:29 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","519"

I mention that just for clarity since referring to Him as God is quicker and easier. Now, you are making another absolute claim here which implies that ERVs, meaning useless genetic code isn't present in all animals. You assert this alleged inconsistency and makes it appear that animals were constantly evolving and branching off into new species. But as usual, you haven't posted any evidence at all that anything you have asserted is true in any way, in reality. Prove that useless genetic code isn't found in every single form of life on Earth, including plants, and that one species has ever evolved into another species thereby proving that macroevolution has ever occurred. Really? We know with irrefutable surety the source and reason why useless genetic code is found, but not in every form of life as you say above? Then why haven't you posted any source evidence of this? Because I disagree with this conclusion completely. I would, and I did which is why I am saying that useless genetic/dead end code has been found in every animal type studied in the ongoing genome project. But what is more inaccurate and deceptive, not to mention just one more example of the evolutionists ignorance is the claim in and of itself that any genetic material in any creature is JUNK DNA or useless material just because science is currently unable to explain its value to the whole gene, or to its interaction with the larger cellular system. The facts will eventually be realized by your side that what is currently undefined genetic material and therefore considered junk DNA, very specifically impacts gene transcriptions in cells which we currently see no connections between. This is why with an overall appearance that we share 96% of our DNA with chimps, it is that very junk DNA which we can't currently predict, visualize or explain that contributes to our very stark and superior differences to them, not to mention the value of the obvious 4% known genetic difference. So what can I say Db, you can't even prove that your sciences interpretation of what the genome project is learning is accurate in regards to their interpretation of the available results. Which is my whole complaint about evolution in a nutshell. Because you see, if the original premise upon which all legitimate science is based, is FALSE as it relies on the FALSE science of evolution which most assuredly is corrupted in its origins; then every single subsequent byproduct/conclusion derived from it will be corrupted, misleading and ultimately contaminated. That's why no science should ever be attempted with the goal of proving or validating evolution because that will only lead to corrupted results in the end.

Every genetic scientist out there admits that there is more they don't know about ERVs and junk DNA for that matter, than they do know at this time. But only in the science of evolution do they take unknowns which ERVs represent and attempt to offer them as conclusive evidence of evo. It doesn't matter what scientific questions are realized, or what discoveries are made, evolution will immediately jump on it and adopt it as evidence of its validity where none exists at all. As I have repeatedly said, it is all a matter of interpretation of the available evidence, so if evolution is false at its very core then how can ERVs be evidence of evolution? The answer is, it can't be.","Accipiter","369019","The old god is magic defense.

What archie and creationists in general fail to realize (or realize but pretend to deny), is that science isn't supposed to prove anything. All science does is tries to look at observable phenomena objectively, try to test reasons how these phenomena occur, and come to reasonable explanations based on these tests. Science is not a doctrine. Its a method. You can employ this method yourself and draw your own hypothses, test these hypotheses yourself, and use your own conclusions to make predictions about the phenomena. That's all there is to it. Evolution is a theory because the evidence suggests that evolution is a reasonable conclusion. Besides the events in genesis, which are not observable phenomena at all, there is no evidence that suggests that evolution is not true. And for all the evidence that casts doubt on the theory of evolution, the evidence that supports it far outweighs the counter-evidence. The reason you continually deny the validity of the scientific method on this particular issue (its actually quite hypocritical of you that you rely on the conclusions of science for over 99% of what you believe to be true) is because you begin with a foregone conclusion before you attempt to doing any testing. Because of this, it would be impossible for you to employ the scientific method. You are incapable of thinking scientifically because a prerequisite of the scientific method is objective observation, like I said above. So in order to defend your foregone conclusion you must pretend to deny the validity of the scientific method. You are going to attempt to refute this by demanding that I show proof of what I'm talking about, or evidence that supports evolution that outweighs the evidence against it. I'm going to deal with that objection in advance. I'm not going to post evidence, links, pastes or lists. This has been done exhaustively in the past on this forum, and will continue to be. More relevantly, that isn't what my post is about. I'm not arguing whether evolution is a valid conclusion or not. I'm discussing your incessant denial of the scientific method. The evidence for that is what you provide everyday here in every post you make. You have a very deep-rooted preconceived conclusion, which you regularly publish. You also assume that scientists (which you generally lump together as ""evolutionists"") also have a foregone conclusion in favor of evolution. This is a totally baseless assertion which you are incapable of supporting, and I suggest you either back up this accusation or keep your uninformed assertion to yourself. Because you inevitably must reject the scientific method, and because by necessity you must continue to pretend that you don't understand the concepts that lead to the conclusions other scientists come to, and because your own preconceived notion incapacitates you from making objective observations, then no matter how well explained and simplified the subject matter is presented, it will be always in vain.

Then why haven't you posted any absolute evidence of the bolded? You are confusing us just discovering that this indefinable Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) exist, with understanding why they work as they do, and why they exist at all in the order they exist in. This is the problem with every aspect of evolutionary science. We are constantly discovering new things via observation, but we are completely incapable of explaining how or why they work as they do which is why we can't replicate or recreate them in a lab. THEN DO IT AND STOP TALKING ABOUT IT. SHOW ME WHY RATHER THAN JUST INSIST THAT EVIDENCE EXISTS. They can explain what happens in many cases but not how and why Db. And until you can offer me more evidence than just your opinion, all you are giving me is lip service like the other evolutionists around here. You are rambling again, and speaking convoluted gibberish Db. Let me offer a metaphor which will clarify my point. Imagine that every different form of life is a different type and quality of computer designed and created by God. Where as insects have the computing power of simple calculators, the more advanced the creature, the more advanced the computing machine leading to the human being which is represented by a super computer. Now, every computer which serves to define every varied type of life on earth have many of the same components in them. It's just that those more complex life forms have more components which the simpler life forms don't have. I mean, even a calculator has a memory chip and a chip to organize its functions, not to mention a simplified yet definite motherboard. Just as a super computer does and an intermediate level computer. Well, so it is with Gods creation. Many of the same genetic components which define the lower animals also define we human beings. But what matters and counts in the end is that we are the apex of life on earth and no other creature, though by your own theory are what we evolved from which means that they were here first. Yet here we are as the ultimate life form on earth. The question is, why haven't these creatures which existed long before primates ever walked on 2 legs ever advance as we have to become higher, complex thinking creatures with imaginations and creativity as humans have. Surely they have had the time. Now I know those who preach the evolution party line will take offense to my description of evolution, and God knows they hate it when I ask common sense questions like these, but when all is said and done, humans/homo anything were the last and latest forms of life to evolve in the form of primates. So my simplified summation for the sake of time, stands and the question remains, why only human beings have the higher functions which only we possess, again just as Genesis says we were created to have?

I simplified this into - The reason I made it this simple is because it is so extremely likely that ERVs are the result of retro-viral DNA polluting the genome of its host. The DNA sequences known as ERVs match those that result when a retrovirus inserts its DNA into a host cell DNA. The burden of proof falls to you. I have my evidence, where is yours? This one is so incredibly easy. Have you never heard of homo-erectus? Homo Habilus? Homo Ergaster? Neandertal? There are many others. These are all human! We have found non-homo sapiens bones of hominid ancestors...these are DIFFERENT SPECIES OF HUMAN! They existed, there is no way out of it, we found their bones, We found tools (1) they made and evidence of complex social interactions (1) . We even find evidence of interactions between Neandertals and modern humans. Now comes in survival of the fittest. They were not as fit to survive as modern humans and were pushed to extinction. This is perfectly inline with evolution. Further, given the extremely selfish nature of modern human and the fact we want to kill people for having different beliefs, different interests or just so we can take their stuff, it makes a lot of sense that we would kill off an entirely different species just for being different.

These are just more evolutionist claims which are unsupported by any real and verifiable evidence what so ever. In fact even your evidence refutes your claim. Here is a link which speaks to the DNA retrieved from your uncle Neanderthal, which you spell neandertal in order to sound more informed and intelligent. http://www.jqjacobs.net/anthro/paleo/neanderthal.html Here's an excerpt: DNA was extracted for the type specimen and the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence was determined. This sequence was compared to living human mtDNA sequences and found to be outside the range of variation in modern humans. Age estimation of the Neanderthal and human divergence is four times older than the age of the common mtDNA ancestor of all living humans. The authors suggest that the Neanderthals went extinct without contribution to the present mtDNA of modern humans. So why again do you claim that Neanderthal is a human ancestor? And show me with genetic evidence that all of those other classifications of homos are actually our evolutionary ancestors if you can. I am just so sick of the unproven claims and insistence that you guys are right when nothing you say actually survives the most basic scrutiny of a christian who is unschooled in the sciences just as you are.

Jonah 2:6 says: "" I went down to the moorings of the mountains ; The earth with its bars [closed] behind me forever; Yet You have brought up my life from the pit, O LORD, my God."" Odd, doesn't say anything like ""I saw mountains on the ocean floor"". Instead, it says ""I went to the moorings of the mountains"". A rational person, ie anyone not looking to try and make a book of fables seem factual, would take this as a description of depth, down to the ""roots"" of the mountains. But no one ever accused Archie of being rational. or how about this: 10. The Bible states that God created life according to kinds (Genesis 1:24). The fact that God distinguishes kinds, agrees with what scientists observe namely that there are horizontal genetic boundaries beyond which life cannot vary. Life produces after its own kind. Dogs produce dogs, cats produce cats, roses produce roses. Never have we witnessed one kind changing into another kind as evolution supposes. There are truly natural limits to biological change. Typical creationist BS 11.=garbage. Read up Archie 12. Are you kidding me? 13. Apparently not. People really are that stupid 14. Yeah, let's ridicule the ToE (which we don't even attempt to comprehend), but the idea that we were made by magic out of dirt is realistically supported. How else to explain why all life is composed of elements found on this planet? 15. OK, now the stupidity is starting to hurt... 16. What was the water supported on? Where'd the light come from? He hasn't created the stars, moon or sun yet? How do you divide light from darkness? By definition, darkness is the absence of light. Woops, we're past the point that ""accurately express all known aspects of the creation"". Apparently, ""all known aspects of the creation"" consist of floating water and light. 18. Hate to be the one to break it to you, but a sphere is a tad different than a circle. And, while we're on Isaiah, if we're supposed to take ""circle of the earth"" to mean ""the earth is a large spheroid body"", then what are we supposed to make of the preceding verse's use of ""foundations of the earth""? Where are these foundations Archie? 19. OK, explain to me how ""I tell you, in that night there will be two [men] in one bed: the one will be taken and the other will be left"" is ""... a clear indication of a revolving earth, with day and night occurring simultaneously"" 20. XXX? Seriously, you would consider this as support for the factual nature of the bible? 21. Diffused light does not equal seperated light. Really, this is the best you can come up with? 22. Seriously? At this point, I can feel the stupid clawing at my brain. Gah...","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:23 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","568"

Beside your rant being factually incorrect in multiple area's, you just prove how little you actually know about the depth of knowledge the bible contains.

"12-03-2009","13107",39,"pandion","381329","More from ""Eternal Productions"" Pure nonsense. The Bible also says that the earth is a circle resting on pillars. It also says that the earth has corners. Furthermore, it doesn't free-float in space. It orbits the sun. The Bible also says that the earth is fixed and immovable: 1 Chronicles 16:30: ""He has fixed the earth firm, immovable."" Psalm 93:1: ""Thou hast fixed the earth immovable and firm ..."" Psalm 96:10: ""He has fixed the earth firm, immovable ..."" Psalm 104:5: ""Thou didst fix the earth on its foundation so that it never can be shaken."" Isaiah 45:18: ""...who made the earth and fashioned it, and himself fixed it fast..."" Bible thumpers can't have it both ways. They will even twist what their own Bible says to justify a belief in their own mythology. See? Twisting what the Bible says to support mythology. The referenced verse says: ""By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible."" Clearly, this means that the word of God is not visible. It doesn't mean atoms. That site is a laugh, Archy. One would have to be pretty mindless to actually think that it contained any scientific facts. The Bible isn't a book of science.","JPSartre12","381347","For all practical purposes, the earth IS fixed in space.

These guys will just cherry pick it and choose rigid interpretations which attempt to apply them literally.

When reminded of this contradiction these mental midgets will always change the subject and claim it is we who are incapable of understanding the science behind it all. Go figure, huh? Yet they are incapable of recognizing that it is we who point out the dead ends inconsistencies of their science and world view. The greatest lesson I have learned in my time here at 4forums is that it is impossible to actually educate the unteachable stubborn heart and mind of the unbeliever.
