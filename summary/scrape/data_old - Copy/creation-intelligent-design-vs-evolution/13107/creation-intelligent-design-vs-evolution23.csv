Now, I'll be off to eat genetically engineered food that was only possible through evolution. Then I'll wash it down with water managed by my local water supply using hydrology sciences that work on an evolutionary timetable. I'll drive to work in a car fueled by gasoline derived from crude oil which is probably found by a study of evolutionary history as to where diatoms were millions of years ago. I'll go to work in a building designed using evolutionary algorithms in engineering. After work, I'll go to a bar and drink a special beer made by a millions of year old yeast that had properties and traits that were simpler in function and efficiency than yeast today that was discovered by a guy trying to get DNA out of millions of year old mosquitoes Jurassic Park style. After the bar, I'll go home and eat dinner made of foods once again derived from evolutionary study of genetics. After I eat dinner, I'll wash the dishes and watch as denser items fall to the bottom of my sink faster then less dense items, exactly the opposite of what must have occurred for the global flood to have happened. After that, I'll take some medicine that big pharm used evolutionary principles to make. I may watch some TV after that with the presumption that the speed of light will remain constant as I watch TV, the exact opposite of an argument given by Archie. To power that TV, I'll rely on nuclear power which runs on the same principles as radiometric dating, something YEC adamantly rejects as a whole. Then it's off to start a new day where evolution is false and YEC is correct.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","10:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","337"
"09-01-2009","13107",23,"Archangel","367826","You cannot claim to believe God is God and that He is truly infallible while at the same time rejecting His explanation for how we came to exist. ... I mean, the theory [of evolution] asserts that 4.5 billion years ago all current life on Earth evolved from that original single celled organism which spontaneously sprang from the primordial ooze in a way which is unexplainable by evolutionists. How on Earth do you marry that origin up with God creating Man in His image for fellowship with the knowledge and understanding to name every creature on Earth which He also spoke into existence? Go on Matthew, explain that to me if you can!!! Then by all means it falls upon you to explain to me, the literalist, how you can marry the Genesis account for a personal and intelligently designed creation with your version of biological evolution by way of random mutation. ... So invest in one more post and answer my questions above if you can. I'm betting you wont even try... Or how about [Neil Shubins Your Inner Fish: A Journey into the 3.5 Billion Year History of the Human Body ]. This meshes perfectly with the Genesis account, doesn't it Matthew?","Matthew","367888","Archie, I do not believe the Genesis account is ""His explanation for how we came to exist."" I believe that the Genesis account s of creation are a pair of human expressions of what it means for God to be the creator of the universe and the world and life and humanity. I do not interpret it literally. Much of your post asks me to square scientific cosmological and biological ideas with Genesis. If one interprets Genesis literally , then I myself will happily acknowledge that this cannot be done! But to reiterate my point, I do not think Genesis must be or even should be interpreted literally. So all those demands are beside the point. They are asking me to do something I have never even claimed to do. What I do claim is that evolution is fully compatible with the spiritual truths expressed by the Genesis account(s): that God is; that all things depend upon him for their existence; that through him all things are made good; that our potential for understanding and for goodness make us ""like"" God; and much, much more. In fact, I would say that many such truths are probably expressed by Genesis even on a literal interpretation! The question is, in order for these truths to be revealed, must the depiction of the events be a literally true, historically accurate account? That's where my answer is, ""No."" The scriptures are allegory: literally false, but revealing the truth. Believe it or not, I even believe the Bible is divinely inspired. But as I once said to Marc, I don't think any amount of divine inspiration can eliminate our intellectual and moral finitude and fallibility -- not even in the case of the authors of the Bible. Sometimes, the all-too-human appears in the text. But I don't think that makes the authors liars, and still less would I hold God responsible for any of their failings. More importantly, it certainly doesn't lessen the profound impact that the scriptures can have in one's life, and in one's relationship to God. I was originally going to respond to your whole post, point by point. But I'm going to keep this shorter and cut most of that. Not, mind you, because I'm hypocritical or dishonest or lazy, but because I'm trying to avoid a needlessly repetitive response. You see, almost everything kept revolving around the same basic problem, and the above seems to illustrate it well. Namely: You keep asking me to reconcile evolution with the events depicted in Genesis, i.e., with the literal interpretation. But I've never even claimed to do this, Archie! What I claim is that evolution can be reconciled to the spiritual truths expressed in Genesis. And that's a different ball of wax entirely. There is, however, one spot that seemed to indicate a somewhat different difficulty. And it's what came next. Here the point seems not to be about the Genesis account specifically, but about the more general theological ""problem of evil."" Certainly, there are some evolutionists -- and Richard Dawkins springs readily to mind here -- who think that the realities of suffering are not compatible with a benevolent God. This seems to be what you're driving at by invoking ""design"" against ""randomness."" Forgive me if I've misconstrued the thrust of this particular comment. But on this score, I've never understood why evolution is any greater or lesser threat to religion than any other natural phenomenon. If one does not consider humanly unpredictable natural events like earthquakes and tsunamis to threaten supernatural design, then one shouldn't take humanly unpredictable natural events like genetic mutations to threaten it, either. All that evolution does is locate a great deal of unpredictable unpleasantness within the entire process of life itself. In fact, one could actually make a case for a certain convergence of the evolutionary view and the Biblical view in some respects. Consider stories like the Fall and its consequences, or the Book of Job. And is what these stories say about the human condition -- and how to deal with it -- really lessened by taking them non-literally? Personally, I think not. Well, I did try. But I'm pretty sure I can't answer those questions. Before you congratulate yourself too quickly, however, let me point out that this is not because I am the hypocrite you claim I am. It's because what you're asking simply doesn't make sense. I don't hold that the Bible is literally true, yet you keep asking me to reconcile evolution with the literal interpretation. What I claim is that evolution is not compatible with a literal interpretation of Genesis. And that, I'm guessing, is a point about which you and I agree! (Will wonders never cease? ) But I also claim that evolution is compatible with spiritual truths that can be revealed even by a non -literal interpretation. And I'm also guessing that this is where we disagree, at a fundamental level: I take it that spiritual truths can be revealed even if the literal depictions are false, whereas you think and correct me if I'm wrong that spiritual truths can be revealed only if the literal depictions are true. Sound about right? And finally, from your subsequent post: With the events literally depicted in Genesis? Of course not. But with the spiritual truths expressed by Genesis? Absolutely. Remember: I do not interpret the Bible literally. I may be wrong about that, and youre welcome to explain why. But Im not being inconsistent when I say that both evolutionary biology and Genesis are true. Evolution is true as an explanation of certain natural processes. Genesis is true as an expression of Gods relationship to all such natural processes. Theres nothing inconsistent about that.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","10:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","338"

And your constant reference to the TWO allegedly contradictory versions of Creation in Chapters 1 and 2 are perfect examples of the truth of this assessment. Here is an admitted theological apologetics site which deals with this issue rather than me just insisting how wrong your fleshly perceptions are. Apologetics Press - Are There Two Creation Accounts in Genesis? And your deductive reasoning is fallacious on every level of rationale if you are serious about having a philosophical debate which comes to concrete conclusions. Your following statement defines the problem with attempting to reason with you. Here's the problem Matthew, you are copping out by declaring that just because you don't interpret Genesis literally that you don't have to even consider what it plainly and directly says in comparison to what your evolution perspective claims happened. We are debating what each philosophy promotes so discussing what they actually say is not only valid but required in order to objectively consider the consistency of each philosophy. You have stated that evolution is fully compatible with the spiritual truths expressed by the Genesis account even though it doesn't agree with it in specific terms. I have asked you to explain how that can be, but you refuse to explain yourself by saying that because you don't interpret the bible literally, you needn't consider it in those terms. Well that isn't the way debates work. You needn't agree with a literal interpretation of Genesis in order to observe and judge the differences which are glaring and obvious between the two belief systems. In other words, just because you don't interpret Genesis literally, that doesn't mean you can't discuss the obvious contradictions which exist between how I interpret it and how you interpret evolution, just as I have discussed it by pointing out the contradictions I observe between the two philosophies. These issues are fine and relevant in a discussion about moral principles and Gods values in the bible, but what do they have to do with what we are discussing in regard to the literal events of creation as compared to the literal beliefs of evolution? The answer is nothing. You are attempting to justify avoiding directly answering my challenge to explain how evolution can be married with the literal interpretation of Genesis just because you don't literally interpret Genesis. When the issue is that you have plainly said originally, that the two belief systems don't contradict each other. But of course they do, just as I said they do. This is irrational and inconsistent gibberish Matthew. There is nothing about the Genesis account of creation which is written in the allegorical style of writing. You are forcing that label on it where no literary evidence of that is evident at all. Tell me what it allegorical about this, in any way? Gen 1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Gen 1:2 The earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the Spirit of God was moving over the face of the waters. Gen 1:3 And God said, ""Let there be light""; and there was light. Gen 1:4 And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. Gen 1:5 God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day. Gen 1:6 And God said, ""Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters."" Gen 1:7 And God made the firmament and separated the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. And it was so. Gen 1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day. Gen 1:9 And God said, ""Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear."" And it was so. Gen 1:10 God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good. Gen 1:11 And God said, ""Let the earth put forth vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, upon the earth."" And it was so. Gen 1:12 The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. Gen 1:13 And there was evening and there was morning, a third day. Gen 1:14 And God said, ""Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years, Gen 1:15 and let them be lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth."" And it was so. Gen 1:16 And God made the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; he made the stars also. Gen 1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth, Gen 1:18 to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. Gen 1:19 And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day. Gen 1:20 And God said, ""Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the firmament of the heavens."" Gen 1:21 So God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. Gen 1:22 And God blessed them, saying, ""Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."" Gen 1:23 And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day. Gen 1:24 And God said, ""Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds."" And it was so. Gen 1:25 And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the cattle according to their kinds, and everything that creeps upon the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. Gen 1:26 Then God said, ""Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth."" Gen 1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. Gen 1:28 And God blessed them, and God said to them, ""Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth."" Gen 1:29 And God said, ""Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food. Gen 1:30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food."" And it was so. Gen 1:31 And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, a sixth day. No matter how you cut it, you are denying the truth of Gods version for His personal and very intelligent design and creation of Man in His image. He mentions nowhere that we grew from lower life forms over millions or billions of years. In fact He says just the opposite. You are attempting to compromise His explanation for creation with a man made secular view in which the only literal aspect I can surmise from it is your attempt to blend the two philosophies where none is possible in a rational or realistic way.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","12:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","339"
