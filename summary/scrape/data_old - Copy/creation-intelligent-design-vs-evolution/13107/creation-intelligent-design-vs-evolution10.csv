We can accept an evolution based creation, if we can see that the development of species is less about natural selection and more about predestined natural progression in levels of complexity... based on the constant application of qualitive energy unto a closed system planet. All photons.. twist to the right... as do all proteins... all centroiles in cells.. all DNA and RNA... and growth patterns found in nature... all twist to the right... why? due to the constant pressure of right twisting photon energy from the sun to our closed system planet, which obsorbs it... and develops ever more complex versions of life forms to represent that ever growing progression in that right hand twisted way... see.........> createvolutionism as long as we drop the unfounded 6000 year senario... we would find that evolution actually fits with creation quite nicely... As there are no missing links.. between major species.. because they all evolved along different paths from fish which crawled onto land... over time... aided by each new mass extinction. -Mosheh Thezion","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","06:09 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","136"

You theorize that all animals and even humans evolved directly or with very few intermediary phases from fish that emerged from the sea. And then you attempt to connect this theory to genesis 1 , of course reinterpreting ""day"" to mean a long undefined period of time rather than a period of evening/morning cycle as the bible very clearly states. Nonetheless, the real problem I see with this theory is the lack of supporting evidence. You say that we have no reason to believe that man evolved from primates, because we have never found the missing link between species (even though we have many specimens that form a very gradual evolutionary chain). How do we then conclude that man must have evolved directly from fish species that walk out onto land? We have no signs of any such evolutionary chain at all. Your case is built upon the fact that human embryos resemble fish embryos, then rodent embryos, then humans, during fetal development. This is also the case with nearly all mammals, including apes, and very likely including extinct homonids. So the link between fish and man seems even more distant than that of man and ape. And it supports the idea, somewhat, that ALL lifeforms are derived from fish forms. However, it doesn't support your model. Imo, what you need to do is create a model that actually matches the real evidence we have, not create a model that matches your already formed beliefs, then only pick out pieces of evidence that fit with that model.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:53 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","142"

"08-26-2009","13107",10,"iangb","366866","1: This claims that evolution is not a science, because it is not observable. However, what creationists term 'micro'-evolution has been observed - and used by humanity - for millennia. Breeting fatter pigs, faster horses or more hairy dogs, for example. More recently, engineering vaccines for the latest evolution of the flu virus. Furthermore, I doubt many creationists have difficulties with the concept of 'forensic science' - which, just like some parts of evolution, looks at the evidence left behind in order to figure out what happened. Forensic science sometimes leads people to the wrong conclusion, but for evolution our 'crime scene' is huge , and all of the evidence so far points in evolutions direction. 2: This is more a consequence of the first claim than a seperate argument. It runs ' If evolution is not a science, calling it as such devalues the real sciences'. See my answer to statement 1. I'd add that forensic science, just like evolution, is supported by work done in the fields of physics, chemistry and biology. 3. A rehash of the 'tornado in a junkyard' argument. It's an accurate analogy - as soon as you can find me a skyscraper that is subject to the same rules as evolving organisms (reproduction, mutation/variation, natural selection). Until then, it's all so much wasted words. 4. Another rehash of the 'tornado in a junkyard' argument, only this time comparing a bridge with genetic code, rather than a skyscraper with an organism. Nope, sorry, bridges don't reproduce either. 5. It's almost a rehash of the 'tornado' argument from above - it looks at the probability that a single object ('ancient slime') will 'morph' into, say, Fred Phelps. Perhaps a bad choice. As soon as you can find me a person who was once a blob of ancient slime, this analogy will, like the others, become a valid one. If you mean 'the probability that the slime evolved into us', then you run up against the mount improbable argument. It's unlikely that it happened in a single step, or even in a series of steps, if you ignore the fact that there are 'safety lines' in place - that is, if you ignore the fact that natural selection will kill off all those that start to go the wrong way. It's also fallacious thinking because of anthropism - it didn't matter what the slime evolved into, because whatever it did evolve into would still be sitting here arguing the point. As an example - consider your history, and the incredibly unlikely chance that you would be sitting right where you are today, with the clothes you chose this morning and the DNA which mixed from your parents just so. As Penfold says in your signature - if the universe was not as it is, it would be different. That doesn't mean that God has intervened specifically to make 'this' universe the one that has happened over, say, one where you were born a girl. Throw a million sided dice. The chances of it getting any specific side are tiny - but one side is guaranteed to be chosen. 6. Like #2 above it, this takes the conclusions of a previous argument (#5) and runs with them, stating that if evolution is mathematically impossible then it is a faith, which make evolution a religion. Apart from the fact that my response to #5 deals with this... on what basis are you claiming, Archangel, that because something is a religion then it is a fraud? 7. Evolution has been used as an excuse for atrocities such as racism, etc. Well, so has religion - no condoms to Africa, the Spanish Inquisition, rampant sexism, etc. So what? That doesn't affect the validity of the idea.","Archangel","366906","Like a narrator you comment on each point, offering your own opinion why you disagree with them. But in typical fashion you don't actually refute one point with solid evidence of anything. So let me give commenting on each point made, a shot. OK? I quoted your response above so others can see how utterly shallow your commentary is. Seven Reasons Why Evolution is a Fraud 1. It's not science. You cannot observe, test and repeat the ever-changing ideas that are little more than wild speculation. This is the true and accepted definition of a true science, yet you only refer to the observable aspect of it while ignoring the testable and repeatable aspect of a valid and true science. 2. It devalues real science. Chemistry, physics and biology don't have the same problems of legitimacy because they are real sciences, not philosophical wannabes trying to appear legit. Your attempt to make an excuse which disregards this critique ignores the very accurate claim that rather than being a science, evolution is more a philosophy which makes assumptions not in evidence according to real science. 3. Complex engineering. Do you ever drive past a skyscraper and think to yourself 'Gee, I guess billions of years of random chance could have just as easily assembled all of that glass, steel and concrete as well as a team of engineers, architects, construction workers working from blueprints? Of course not! But that's what evolutionists would have you believe in when it comes to living organisms. You offer cliches like ""Tornados in a junkyard"" to marginalize a valid point while once again never actually showing that the statistical claims made are false. Is all we will get from you nothing more than cheap lip service as you insist you're right? 4. Genetics. The programming code of life, according to evolutionists, is just a series of biochemical accidents and mutations. If you believe this, I have a bridge in New York that's for sale. The infinitely complex engineering of this code means that it did not come about via 'natural selection,' aka random chance. Again, you repeat nonsense while actually refuting or disputing NOTHING here with facts which prove this statement wrong or factually incorrect. 5. Mathematically Impossible. Basic probability tells you that the odds of a blob of primordial ooze morphing into a man, regardless of how much time has passed, are so remote that mathematicians regard it as impossible. Emile Borel and Fred Hoyle are just two mathematicians who reject evolution on statistical grounds. Again, you offer shallow platitudes while proving nothing at all which refutes what my link says. Why is this in every response? Because there is no actual factual evidence anywhere which is undeniable and absolute with which to refute what is being said here. The Defender - Commentary 6. Evolution is a religion. Yes, evolution is the faith of atheism because it replaces God with man. When you've conned yourself into believing that some kind of ancient slime morphed into progressively complex and directional life forms, you are in the realm of faith, not science. So basically what I am to take away here is that all you have as a refutation for these 7 reasons why evolution is a fraud is the cliche that these are nothing more than a tornado in a junkyard, right? Because that is all you have offered in almost every response. How imaginative paulie. 7. Racism. This is the ugly secret that evolutionists don't want to discuss; that Darwin, Huxley and many of the early advocates of evolution stated publicly that Asians, Africans, Australian Aborigines and other non-white, non-European groups were evolutionary throwbacks. Darwin's cousin, Francis Galton, was a pioneer in the early field of eugenics which was the study of skills by ethnic groups. While Galton's work was relatively harmless, Hitler's work -- to synthesize natural selection by exterminating a race of people -- was not. And here I get the response that religion has done bad things also, so it's ok that evolution was founded on the principles of eugenics, racism and white superiority. But you can't deny the truth of it and what the roots of this philosophy represent. So to summarize, no refutation of anything said here. Just excuses via apologetics as you continue to ignore reality.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","11:48 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","145"

"08-26-2009","13107",10,"iangb","366922","Quite. Which is one of the reasons why there are all these incredulous people standing around looking puzzled that YEC is still given credence. Well, that's not entirely true, not is it an entirely valid point. There's only four real arguments here - variants on 'tornado in a junkyard', variants on 'not a science', variants on 'mathematically impossible' and one count of 'founded on racism'. I addressed each of these, explaining why each one was either inaccurate or irrelevant and while I offered no evidence beyond my explanations, neither did the article (apart from a generic reference to two mathematicians). I'll go over them again, but this time I'll simplify them down to those four points. I bet I can even find you some semi-relevant talkorigins pages, too. Oh, and in your comments on point #6... I'm iangb, not unkerpaulie. Just so you know. ************ 'Not a science': This covers points 1 and 2. In my previous post, I gave many example showing that evolution is observable. That people have been carrying out such selective breeding for years also implies that evolution is repeatable. As for testable, I give one example below (see the 'watch' link). Another example would be the long-term evolution of E Coli . Evolution cannot be proven 'Tornado in a junkyard': This covers points 3 and 4 - both of these state that because an immensely complex organism has 'evolved', it must be possible for artificial structures to do so as well. The inference is that because the structures are designed, so must the organism be. However, this comparison is entirely void. As pointed out previously, evolution only works when three factors are present - reproduction, mutation/variation and natural selection (this should really be two key factors, as reproduction is simply the method by which mutation/variation tends to occur). An organism can become incredibly complex from these factors - variation/mutation will randomly make the organism more or less complex, and natural selection will tend to ensure that only the most complex survive, thus constantly increasing the complexity level. Seeing as buildings neither mutate nor are subject to natural selection, asking for evidence that one has spontaneously formed is a straw man challenge which cannot and does not need to be met. NB: Oh yes, you asked for proof despite not giving any. It's interesting to note then that, when those evolutionary factors are applied to something complex like, for example, a watch , the complex mechanism does spontaneously appear. Tornado in a junkyard . 'Mathematically impossible': This covers points 5 and 6. I went into quite a lot of detail on this in my previous post, all of which you ignored. To summarise: firstly, that something is hugely improbable does not make it impossible - especially if all the alternatives would have resulted in the 'alternative' evolved species questioning the probability of their own evolution, just as you are questioning ours. Secondly, the mathematical models used to make such 'improbable' calculations are often flawed and ignore the factors of variation and selection which I have mentioned above - see the section above for why these features lead to more complexity than could be predicted by a model ignoring them. Probability of abiogenesis 'Founded on racism': This covers the final point 7. You have made this claim, in fact - all the article says is that evolution has caused some people to have racist beliefs. I'll just respond to this with a set of talkorigins pages, on Darwin , Huxley , eugenics and generic racism . So, thats the general points covered - and before you attempt to discard my post on the basis that I've added a few TalkOrigins links, I remind you that you have pulled your arguments from a website, that most of my responses have come without the aid of TalkOrigins and that TalkOrigins has cited the vast majority of it's claims - something which you have not done. Next!","Archangel","366948","WOW, what a bunch of convoluted apologetic drivel. You may as well just throw out the Talk Origins talking points since they exist only to oppose any valid arguments against the lies which evolution promotes. What I did find interesting though was your posted experiment ""long-term evolution of E Coli"". I read the results and saw that no actual improvement or forward moving evolution resulted in a 20 year study spanning more than 40,000 generation. In fact, the results showed as many downsides resulting in the specimens. Here's the last paragraph of the results section of the page you quoted. Another adaption that occurred in all these bacteria was an increase in cell size and in many cultures, a more rounded cell shape.[5] This change was partly the result of a mutation that changed the expression of a gene for a penicillin binding protein, which allowed the mutant bacteria to out-compete ancestral bacteria under the conditions in the long-term evolution experiment. However, although this mutation increased fitness under these conditions, it also increased the bacteria's sensitivity to osmotic stress and decreased their ability to survive long periods in stationary phase cultures, so the phenotype of this adaption depends on the environment of the cells. These results speak for themselves and show that for 20 years work of manipulating these strains in laboratory conditions, all we had at the end was a weaker strain which was susceptible to osmotic stress which decreased their ability to survive long periods in stationary phase cultures. But never did the e coli evolve into a stronger or superior life form in any way. I marvel that you would even hold this example up as evidence that evolution is the least bit valid from a practical scientific perspective. Now had they taken these original strains and placed them in the wild, under totally natural conditions with no human intervention or manipulation at all, and they survived and changed in that completely wild and uncontrolled setting, now that would have been interesting. But you offer me a completely laboratory secure and a controlled setting which assures a perfect atmosphere, and in spite of those conditions we get no actual forward moving evolutionary results at all. Not that the results would have had any value if we had under those conditions. But hey, you will grasp at any straws to cling to your false religion. And one more thing. Micro-evolution is the adaptations and changes within a species while macro-evolution is the addition of new traits or a transition to a new species. Micro-evolution is a fact that is plainly observable throughout nature. Macro-evolution is a theory that has never been observed in science. The underlined is the great lie of evolution which we creationists reject. Macro-evolution is the great lie which proposes that one species of animal has evolved into other species of animals leading up to the evolution into human beings. This lie is what we oppose since we believe, no; WE KNOW that Man is above the animal kingdom since the point of creation as we were created in Gods image where as the animals were created to serve our needs.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:06 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","150"
