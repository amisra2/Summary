Your ignoring the evidence does not make your case any stronger.","Archangel","368679","We are approaching 500 posts on this thread and no one on your side has posted one iota of solid irrefutable evidence at all, much less huge mountains of it. If you check all of the posts from your cohorts, (and here they are: Who Posted? - 4Forums.com Political Debates and Polls ) you will find that no less than 95% of all of their posts are off topic personal attacks against me which specifically and directly ignore my on topic post they are responding to, and the other 5% are personal opinions where they insist how right evo is. No facts just excuses and bluster. And God knows I have asked very specific and detailed questions yet none of them have been answered directly, specifically or scientifically at all. Just excuses as to why asking for actual evidence that the alleged 4.5 billion year foundation of spontaneous life magically appearing on earth is just mean of me and asking way too much of you poor abused evolutionists. I mean, it's only science after all. How dare I expect you to support your allegations with actual evidence which has been tested and repeated in a lab with controls which assured an honest outcome. But nooooo! you don't know the chemical makeup or anything else about the real time atmospheric, gelogical or physical conditions which existed on earth that alleged and randomly picked age of 4.5 billion years ago. Yet you want to claim mountains of evidence exists for a theory which has no proven factual foundation at all? And I'm the one relying on a sky fairy when I have the whole world with its complimentary, self sustaining and interdependent chain of life as my evidence that my world, from the single celled organisms up to we human beings were intelligently designed by a loving and personal Creator. Remember smiley, denying that God exists, or ignoring Him doesn't make Him go away or cease to exist.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","498"
"09-07-2009","13107",34,"T.Q","368573","Let's see, what was the point of T.O again? Oh yeah, ""to provide mainstream scientific responses to the many frequently asked questions (FAQs) that appear in the talk.origins newsgroup and the frequently rebutted assertions of those advocating intelligent design or other creationist pseudosciences."" So, you're basis for it being a propoganda site is that it's sole existence is to counter your falsehoods . As for the rest of your complaint:""Rather than just dealing with the alleged science they are supposedly discussing."" See those little numbers throughout each and every article? And how they are connected to the little sentences at the end of each article? Those little sentences are called citations. Those citations are the exact evidence you claim that you would accept if it was presented to you.","Archangel","368684","And just because having my posts ignored has become so rampant around here smiley, I thought I would repost this argument from post 475 which sent TQ scampering away. Here's a thought tq; what if T.O., being a legitimate source of scientific info as you assert, actually considered all interpretations of the scientific evidence on evolution with an open and objective mind and attitude as science is supposed to work? You know, instead of having the us against them attitude which they profoundly represent in such a condescending fashion in every page they write? They are no different than Hanoi Jane in their stated agenda to oppose, dismantle, demoralize and if possible defeat everyone who opposes evolution in the court of public opinion. That isn't science, it is advocacy, plain and simple. My falsehoods? I doubt that the opposing pro-evolution powers that be would create any site just to stand against lil ole me. No tq, they exist to stand against a complete school of thought which legitimately interprets the available observations we all make differently than your secular humanist interpretation allows for. Here is a list which T.O. calls ""Creationist Claims"" which they state before spewing their propaganda. An Index to Creationist Claims So you see; they don't exist to promote pure science at all, the exist to oppose any and all who question their results as is obvious by their dedicated goal of attacking the opposition in a condescending way before even discussing their stated so called science. You mean the other allegations they contrive in order to support the lies and myths they represent? Those citations? I'm not impressed tq. You actually believe that if five people come forward and support your lie then your lie must be true. That in a nut shell is what the evolution community represents in reality. You see, it doesn't matter how many advocates you dig up to support your myth of evolution, it will never succeed in erasing the living God from truly existing and having created all life as we know it, in reality. Here is an example of the crux of the circular reasoning T.O. represents. This link goes to the claim of Darwin's racism: CA005.1: Darwin's racism Notice how it links not to Darwin's book ever, to show the original referred to quotes as evidence that creationists claims are false, which the claims are based upon, but links back to other T.O. pages in a circular pattern which never gets you out of T.O. into any real objective scientific sources which supports their defense in any real or significant way. And where are those famous citations in that example, you refer to TQ? Cuz I don't see them because the links go no where at all. Weird huh? Or is it just typical and to be expected from this fraud of a propaganda site. Every time I have attempted to use T.O. in order to trace back to the actual roots of the so called evidence they are proposing, I have found myself in this endless loop of self supporting propaganda. But never have I been able to go deeper into scientific understanding which is founded in actual evidence. It is a smoke screen of shallow justifications which are self serving and bogus at their core. And what is truly scary is that you believers in T.O. and evolution are so dumbed down that you can't even recognize what this promoter and defender of a pseudo scientific fraud represents in reality. And I challenge you to confront and disprove what I am pointing out here by linking to a claim above and showing that it links to hard and fast evidence within its explanation of the question being investigated.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","499"

"09-07-2009","13107",34,"birdan","365579","If I may derail the derailment for a moment and respond to the OP ..... The most effective argument I've found is heat . I've read quite a bit of young earth creationist literature, and I have not found any arguments to counter thermodynamics. The argument is basically as follows: YECs agree that volcanic rock was produced by volcanoes, meteor craters were produced by meteors, tectonics occurred in the past, metamorphic rock was formed in the past, etc. They argue that all these processes were simply ""speeded up"" and occurred within the last 10,000 years. But all the above processes produce heat. Trying to reduce 4.5 billion years of thermodynamic history to a 10,000 year period results in a molten earth. Since the earth is not currently molten, the YEC argument fails. The nice thing about this line of argumentation is that the energy amounts can easily be calculated and demonstrated based on 19th century physics. If you can get a YEC to engage in this line of argumentation long enough, they will either: 1. say that volcanic rock is not from volcanoes, etc.; or 2. invoke a miracle that whisked the heat away. If they go the #1 route, then they must defend against the 'God is a deceiver' argument. If they go the #2 route, then (by invoking the miraculous) they have effectively shut the science classroom door on the teaching of creationism. A similar argument can be made for YEC cosmological stories, such as Humphrey's white hole cosmology: trying to reduce a 13.7 billion year old universe into a few years produces such a concentrated amount of energy that the solar system would not exist. I have argued with many YECs and most will simply 'disappear' from this argument. Of those that stay around, they respond as above.","obvious_child","368691","I do recall citing these very two posts before as evidence of solid effective arguments for disproving Biblical Creation: http://www.4forums.com/political/365144-post9.html http://www.4forums.com/political/365579-post66.html But as expected, thou who is not rational will ignore these two despite one being made three weeks ago and the other posted 4 days short of a month ago.
