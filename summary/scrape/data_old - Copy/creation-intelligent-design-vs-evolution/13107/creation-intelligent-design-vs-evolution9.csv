"08-25-2009","13107",9,"unkerpaulie","366754","This is not true. We have brand new petroleum and coal deposits forming under the earth even today. We have very well preserved remains of animals and humans in peat bogs and other environments that dramatically slow down decay. It takes a very long time for an anaerobic swamp to become petrified into solid rock, but to say that no fossils are being formed is a plain case of denying reality. This argument is so weak I'm surprised you even bother to mention it, as it has been debunked to death. Animals and plant remains that are found deep in the earth got that deep not because the animals burrowed into the ground, but because sand and sediment settled above them slowly, layer by layer, over many many years. Of course a vertical structure would take many many years to be completely buried by layers that are being formed horizontally. This is under the assumption that the flood even occured, for which there is no evidence that it did, nor that noah built a boat big enough, nor the he could possibly have all the animals survive in confinement for 3 years, nor that the planet has enough water for a worldwide flood. Do you REALLY want to tally the inconsistencies of genesis and compare that to the inconsistencies in the scientific theories you argue about? Here is where you really excel at avoiding the issue. We have evidence that the universe is very old, such as visible stars millions of light years away, varve formations that can be counted for over 2 million years, subterranian strata formations with fossils of extinct creatures, multiple radiometric dating methods that all independently date the earth to over 4 billion years. On the other hand, you have a book written by an old superstitious guy who borrowed cultural folklores and myths from other communities and wrote them down, adding his own religious bias. And of course you have faith, which, by definition, is the belief in something for which you have no supporting evidence for. All I can say is, what you claim to believe speaks volumes about the nature of your god.","Archangel","366776","Really? What alleged massive fields of animal remains/fossils are currently being turned into future oil deposits, and where did they come from? How recent in geological terms were they deposited? Why must I always be subjected to unproven claims from your side as you sanctimoniously make these statements as if they are facts. It's your side which claims it takes millions upon millions of years for Oil and Coal Deposits to form, yet here you are pointing to them forming now as you expect me to take your unsubstantiated word for it. Really? And you have the nerve to claim to be the intelligent one between us? See the bolded? This is evidence of your denial of true reality as you make ridiculous assumptions which have absolutely no basis in fact at all. You are asserting than an animal has died, and slowly survives decomposition as a corpse, unmolested by scavengers long enough to be naturally covered by a naturally occurring layer of sand and earth which eventually become a distinct layer of strata. Then tell me paulie how this rabbit which was protected from scavengers didn't last past 8 days in reality in order to become a fossil? YouTube - Rabbit decomposition (time-lapse video) It is also undeniable which this link proves, The 1993 Midwest Floods and Rapid Canyon Formation that the very circumstances we are discussing have and do occur in very short periods of time via the flood process. I have shown from both ends with contemporary and undeniable evidence why my flood and decomposition perspective works in the real world as all you have offered is unsubstantiated insistence that you are right. And based on my evidence, your claims don't even pass the smell test. Not at all. When will you get it through your head that the very same evidence you observe which you believe supports your beliefs in an old earth, I observe as evidence that the Great Flood occurred, and a young earth is valid? We both have the same evidence paulie, I just interpret it differently than you do. So don't you dare attempt to claim some upper hand of scientific proof which I lack. All you have is your interpretation which erases God from the equation. Wrong again paulie, you have observations which you interpret to suggest those outcomes. Not one scientist who is expert in those fields would state categorically without question that the results which come to these conclusion are absolute and unchangeable. Or wont be redefined next month or next year based on new information. The very age of the Universe we inhabit has gone from 2 billion years old to the current estimate that it's 14.5 billion years old today, and just over the last 50 years. And it will inevitably change again as it is realized that more time is required for the theorized evolutionary process to result in we human beings as we exist today. And how interesting that it allegedly took hundreds of millions of years for us to evolve up to the level of Neanderthal according to your pseudo science, yet only between 40,000 and 100,000 years to evolve from the Neanderthal whom it has been shown that we share DNA with, to where we stand today as the apex life form on Earth which we are today. No practical answer for that inconsistency, huh paulie? It's incredible how many discrepancies and inconsistencies you can just ignore when they conflict with your preferred religion of secular humanist evolution.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","06:08 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","123"

I could have sworn that your post above was a repost from a few hours ago - in fact, both Obvious Child and TQs posts refer to it, despite them coming sooner in the thread. And yet your earlier post has vanished. What happened? Oh, and that we share DNA with Nethandertals doesn't mean that we are descended from them. We share DNA with bananas , not to mention monkeys. Factual inaccuracy aside, that it took much less time to get from Neanderthal-type organisms to today's humans than it took to get the Neanderthals in the first place should hardly come as a shock.

Christian doctrines have a history of change. Most Christians themselves fail to realize this, since they barely know present doctrine, let alone its historical developments. And of course, despite all the changes, most theologians and preachers claim that the ideas they espouse on the page and from the pulpit are based on something unchanging like scripture, natural law, or God himself, which also helps to obscure the historical dimensions of doctrine. But it's undeniably there, just as it is for science. And insofar as the human beings who formulate both religious doctrines and scientific theories are just as changeable now as in times gone by, I'd say that future changes are inevitable. History isn't finished. Which makes the point cited above utterly irrelevant.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:42 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","126"

"08-25-2009","13107",9,"unkerpaulie","366681","Instead of telling us there's abundant evidence, why not actually present the evidence? What energy are you talking about? What was it applied to? Try reading your bible. The evening and the morning were the first day. God mad the sun to rule the day and the moon to rule the night. Genesis makes it very clear that these creation days were regular 24-hour periods. You sound like you're not even sure what you believe. And this is very unbiblical. Did God create man by hand-molding him out of clay and breathing into his nostrils? Or did man emerge over millions of years of evolution from lesser primate ancestors? Which is it? Cool, I think we should really start annihilating species out of existences to make more room for us. Overcrowded planets suck, don't they? Like I said, try actually read your bible. The bible personifies God, not us. And you know so much about science? You don't even know your own bible. And you have shown that you know absolutely nothing about science either.","Mosheh Thezion","366810","did you check the link? or did you assume I am not ready to back this up? lets try again.... createvolutionism now... i could paste alot of stuff... but since I already wrote a free online book about it.. i think it is easier and saves bandwidth if i just post a link. -Mosheh Thezion","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:35 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","129"

That means that all the world's petroleum and fossils must have been formed within that short period. You need to provide evidence that these things occur rapidly. Yeah, you're telling me that the peat bog man doesn't exist? According to your bible, the flood occured just about 4000 years ago. We have been drilling for oil over 150 years ago. So all the world's petroleum reserved must have took no more than 3700 years to form from the original dead matter. Where's the evidence that this is remotely possible? Not to mention rapid fossilization of bones... So we should always interpret new information with the conclusion that God exists, regardless of what the evidence actually suggests? This is why nobody takes creation science seriously. And you call us close-minded... that's right, all categorical assertions and unquestioning statements are reserved for theists like yourself. Scientists always disclaim that ""the evidence suggests"" or ""we can conclude"", not ""we are absolutely right because God told us in his infallible word"" Classic lack of reasoning. You are comparing the process of neanderthal evolving from primordal cells, and humans evolving from neanderthals. There are obviously many many more evolutionary phases to get to the neanderthal stage, and just one stage from there to homo sapien. A child could tell you that many phases of evolution would take much longer than one phase. Like I said, let's tally the difference between biblical discrepancies and scientific differences. I'll probably start a new thread for it.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","10:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","130"

So.. just because the bible.. and interpeters of it.. may have the dates wrong.... the story is still good. a mass extinction, killed off all the other types of humans, except one family of... numbering several 1000... and they spread across the globe. we have to rememeber.. the Bible is a 3000 year old primitive version or discussion of what we now know in modern terms.

"08-26-2009","13107",9,"None","None","None","Archangel","366849","Seven Reasons Why Evolution is a Fraud 1. It's not science. You cannot observe, test and repeat the ever-changing ideas that are little more than wild speculation. 2. It devalues real science. Chemistry, physics and biology don't have the same problems of legitimacy because they are real sciences, not philosophical wannabes trying to appear legit. 3. Complex engineering. Do you ever drive past a skyscraper and think to yourself 'Gee, I guess billions of years of random chance could have just as easily assembled all of that glass, steel and concrete as well as a team of engineers, architects, construction workers working from blueprints? Of course not! But that's what evolutionists would have you believe in when it comes to living organisms. 4. Genetics. The programming code of life, according to evolutionists, is just a series of biochemical accidents and mutations. If you believe this, I have a bridge in New York that's for sale. The infinitely complex engineering of this code means that it did not come about via 'natural selection,' aka random chance. 5. Mathematically Impossible. Basic probability tells you that the odds of a blob of primordial ooze morphing into a man, regardless of how much time has passed, are so remote that mathematicians regard it as impossible. Emile Borel and Fred Hoyle are just two mathematicians who reject evolution on statistical grounds. 6. Evolution is a religion. Yes, evolution is the faith of atheism because it replaces God with man. When you've conned yourself into believing that some kind of ancient slime morphed into progressively complex and directional life forms, you are in the realm of faith, not science. 7. Racism. This is the ugly secret that evolutionists don't want to discuss; that Darwin, Huxley and many of the early advocates of evolution stated publicly that Asians, Africans, Australian Aborigines and other non-white, non-European groups were evolutionary throwbacks. Darwin's cousin, Francis Galton, was a pioneer in the early field of eugenics which was the study of skills by ethnic groups. While Galton's work was relatively harmless, Hitler's work -- to synthesize natural selection by exterminating a race of people -- was not.
