As this makes clear, according to this fairy tale, we human beings are a genetic combination and result of all of the species of life which allegedly came before us on the tree of life. On the one hand you will argue that evolutions intent is NOT to lead towards higher, more complex life forms, yet you will ignore that the APEX CREATURE on Earth, Human Beings holds the place of the highest branches on the tree.

The big lie about evolution is that it claims that human beings evolved from single celled organisms over a 4+ billion YEAR period. There is no way to compromise with such a corrupted philosophy or find a happy medium with it. In other words, we can't both be right. So don't give them the respect of saying that any aspect of micro-evolution is valid if only they will give God the credit for starting the process, because they will never do that either.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","06:58 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","189"

What is written appears to be English, but is meaningless when analysed. Energy might be described as potential, or kinetic, or perhaps electrical, or gravitational, indicating the source, but not as ""qualitative"" What qualities might such an energy possess, magical ones perhaps?","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","191"

"08-27-2009","13107",13,"Archangel","367021","What is the logic or reason behind this ridiculous post accipiter? This is a debate forum kid. I am posting evidence which conflicts with your religion of evolution at every turn. The bible is my source of evidence. If it is so weak a source then you should have no problem refuting it with scientific sources which prove without doubt that macro-evolution has occurred in the animal kingdom. I'm not asking you to accept my evidence without giving you the opportunity to prove it's wrong with scientific sources. I'm asking for scientific sources which actually prove your repeated yet unproven claims that evolution is real. So for once in your life can you accept my challenge and just produce evidence that one species of an actual animal has evolved from one species to another which would prove that macro-evolution is possible? I am showing you that the bible directly and specifically states that macro-evolution cannot naturally occur in nature. If you want to prove the bible is an ancient sheep herders book of myths then I have made your job very easy by placing my cards face up on the table. Just prove with real evidence that any combination of any species of animal has evolved into any other species of animal and you win the debate. BTW, sorry if this frustrates you, but I'm repeating my prior post which still has been ignored by all of your religious evolutionists who worship at the alter of Darwin; which by the way is Idolatry, not atheism","Accipiter","367123","If no one is going to accept the bible as proof then submitting scripture is not going to be seen as proof of anything other than your inability to recognize that fact.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","07:55 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","194"

Tell me though since I'm just dying to learn from you; which lower life form which still eats its own dung is more evolved than us? And if you can tell me, at what point in human history did we decide it was no longer cool to do that?","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","08:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","195"
