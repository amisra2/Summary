Every post should add relevant information to the thread. Need proof? Here are all 26 of your posts on this thread alone. I dare you to post one which adds on topic relevant information to the thread as the rule requires. 4Forums.com Political Debates and Polls - Search Results So tell me pinfold, since you break into threads where I am not speaking to or about you at all, but am debating an on topic subject, and you see the need to troll around with your pathetic and condescending insults as you put on that superior air. Yet you very rarely contribute anything of value to any thread. What's up with that? Why is a guy who thinks he is so superior to those he disagrees with, afraid to actually share what he believes? Now come on back with some usual inane retort which has nothing to do with what I've asked you at all, as evidence that attempting to actually communicate with you is a complete waste of time.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","01:41 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","288"

"08-31-2009","13107",20,"None","None","None","T.Q","367666","It's Archie's attempt at being clever. As usual, it's a massive fail. Hey Archie, since you have the absolute truth on your side, I was wondering if you could answer a couple questions for me: 1) What was the precise makeup of the clay that God molded Adam from? 2) When he breathed life into him, what was the chemical makeup of the air that he was breathing? 3)At precisely what time of day was Adam formed? 4) How long (hh:mm:ss) did the entire process take? 5) What precise rib was Eve formed from? Now, while you ponder those questions (and I do expect verifiable sources, just as you asked for), think about this: The evidence that you demand to support the ToE is, as pointed out by Matthew, at the level where nothing is that supported. If we used your measure of evidence, no one would ever be convicted of a crime. No historian would be believable, no archaeologist would be capable of doing their job. To simplify-the level of evidence you demand is non-existent. So, get cracking on those questions! Since, as you stated, you are in posession of the absolute truth and have all the evidence to back you up, those should be easy-peasy.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","02:03 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","291"

NEVER. Haven't I argued in defense of the bible which says that God spoke creation into existence? Your questions and the premise you raise is totally fallacious, as usual. Especially since you have constantly argued the science of evolution as reliable but I have never argued that Creation needs to be confirmed via scientific evidence since it's a spiritually induced event. So rather than playing cheap games of semantics and bait and switch tactics, answer the questions unless you disagree with me that the very weight of what evolutionary theory claims to be true rests on the foundation of what occurred 4.5 billion years ago on this so called primordial earth. If you agree with that premise, and you must unless you want to lose all credibility as an objective student of science, Then this allegedly ignorant christian who doesn't understand the process of evolution at all, this egregiously ignorant believer according to tester, has asked relevant and worthy questions which deserve an answer if you are going to defend this so called science which you claim is legitimate. Because if you can't support and defend the very foundations upon which evolution is founded, then how can you claim that the modern conclusions are based in fact at all? It's your science TQ, I'm just asking the questions.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","02:34 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","293"

You act like I lie in wait to attack every poster that dares to approach me with a compliment or supports me in a debate. And sorry, but there are too many members here who know differently where Archangel is concerned. Like 33 friends I have for one thing; friends I never attack and who never attack me in debate. 4Forums.com Political Debates and Polls - View Profile: Archangel But you know what else is true about my friends? You can poll all of them individually and you will find that I have never used our friendship to ask them via PM to aid me in attacking or ganging up on any other poster or posters in any debates I have ever been involved in. Can you make the same claims about your little clique of rabid secular humanists? I think not. So let us be clear here that we are speaking about a small and rabid group of haters of anything right and good which position I represent and defend to the hilt here. So thank you for placing me on ignore, you are just one less that I need to deal with on a regular basis. And no answer on the question I posed to tester, Matthew, the obvious child and TQ I see. Here it is again, and if you can't answer it, and you can't, then at least show me the fallacy of asking the proponents of biological evolution to support their conclusions by producing the known and allegedly proven foundational ingredients and processes upon which it is based. And I promise that if you just answer the question posed without attacking me and insulting my intelligence for daring to ask questions your side can't answer, that I wont insult you or be mean at all. I will respond with kid gloves, if you will. just remember trebor, turn around is fair play on a debate forum. Archangel to tester: If you believe my posts on evolution are egregiously ignorant, then we have something else in common because that is precisely what I think of your pro evolution beliefs. For the life of me I can't comprehend how allegedly intelligent and educated people can swallow the evo drivel which you people do, hook line and sinker. I marvel at the incomprehensibility of it all. You have been deceived. You are believing a lie. You are adopting a false philosophy being sold as a science when it isn't even a valid or legitimate science. And what is worse you are attempting to defend something that you yourselves can't even find the absolutely undeniable evidence for, which proves that what YOU believe is an actual factual reality. How do you convince yourselves that a so called science is true, when you can't even prove it in absolute terms? Would you accept the science/mechanics that the internal combustion engine was real and valid if nobody ever actually got even one engine to run? I think not. You would say it's interesting in theory but the science doesn't work. And that would be a valid conclusion. But not with evolution. You will readily accept claims made about events which allegedly occurred starting @ 4.5 billion years ago. Events which can't be proven to have occurred at all, so they can't be repeated in a lab because the details of what allegedly occurred are unknown at every level of understanding. Can you tell me precisely what the temperature was back then? Precisely what chemicals made up the atmosphere, if any existed at all? Can you tell me the make up of the primordial ooze which your fairy tale asserts the first proteins or enzymes spontaneously appeared in? Or the temperature or chemical make up of the lava oceans which existed back then, from which the primordial ooze was synthesized over the first couple of billion years? And if I'm so egregiously ignorant tester, then how come I know enough to ask these questions of a subject I'm too ignorant to understand, which you giants of intellect have no hope of answering in another billion years? And if you don't know the answers to those initial, most basic questions regarding our origins of life on this planet according to your religions philosophy, then how egregiously ignorant is it of you to presume that the rest of the theory is at all rational? Now come back and tell me that I just don't get it tester. Tell me how ignorant I am as none of you can answer these questions from one source which will give absolute and verifiable evidence regarding the questions I have asked above. Now please forgive my ignorance. I hope I didn't embarrass myself again. Oh, and by the way; I know I wont get an answer from you since you can't answer my questions. But I'm the ignorant one for asking them, right? And your side will once again come back and explain why Archangel is the dumb one around here to reject what any intelligent adult can plainly see is a fairy tale and a lie.","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","09:53 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","295"

Would you accept the science/mechanics that the internal combustion engine was real and valid if nobody ever actually got even one engine to run?","Matthew","367693","That's an example of technology, which works despite the fact that the scientific ideas upon which it rests are not ""absolute."" No science, including chemistry and physics, is ""absolutely"" proved. Newtonian physics is close enough to the truth that we got to the moon with it. ""Close enough"" -- but ultimately not ""absolutely"" true. And Einstein's ideas are closer still, especially at astronomically large scales but even at more everyday sizes. The thing is, the math is a lot more complicated, and at everyday sizes there's not enough difference between the Einsteinian and Newtonian calculations to be worth the headache. Beyond that, it's worth noting that even Einstein's principles are not ""absolutely"" true. In fact, they even conflict with the principles of Quantum Mechanics. And yet, both relativity and QM get used to make interesting technological devices that we use all the time, like GPS onboard maps and the computer that I'm typing at right now. You will counter that there is no such parallel in the world of evolutionary biology. I will counter in turn that -- for but one example -- evolution explains why the antibiotic Clindamycin, which kills bacteria, can also be used to kill the non-bacterial malaria parasite Plasmodium . For details, see yet another excellent book by Carl Zimmer, Parasite Rex . That makes four books from just that author alone that I've recommended to you in the past few days. There are others that could be mentioned. But here's the rub. Not one of them contains ""absolute"" proof of evolution. For that's not how science works -- not how any science works, not just evolution. If what you demand is ""absolute"" proof before acceptance, then as I pointed out the other day -- and it was not the juvenile point you characterized it as -- then you won't be able to accept any science. And especially not sciences that attempt to reconstruct the past, including archaeology and forensic science. You're setting the bar too high -- and higher, in fact, than scientists even claim to have set it. Of course, I don't think faith provides ""absolute"" proof, either. That's part of why it's a leap. But for what it's worth, I don't think this non-absolute leap must be incompatible with the non-absolute inferences of natural science, either. Which is why I accept evolution, despite the fact that I'm not a ""secular humanist.""","effective-arguments-disproving-biblical-creation","11:17 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","297"
