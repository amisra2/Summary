The only tangible product of creationist belief I know of is the book of Genesis (not that I believe a word of this fantastic story, mind you). Sorry, that's all I can come up with... Oh wait, then there's that creationist museum, for what it's worth. Well, I'm all out of ideas now.

Since no one has put forth any product of creationism then we have to say there are none that are notable. Why do so many of these discussions alway turn into the same thing. I would like to see more facts not name calling. What good does it do me to see each side calling each other names. If you believe someone is wrong have facts to back you up on it. For those that think creationism has been why science has advanced check your history. When christianity because the one official religion of the Roman empire all advanced medical knowledge was lost within a few decades and it wasn't until the church started losing influence in the governments of Europe that science began to advance again. That alone tells me that creationism does nothing to advance knowledge. Therefor it can in no way lay claim to any type of commerical product.","commercial-products-creationism","06:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","47"

If this is the case, then why are you (and proportions of the US bible belt) arguing that YEC should be taught in science classrooms? With regards to your article - science was around long before Christianity. The name Archimedies sound familiar to you? It is correct, however, in that there should be no clash between faith and observable reality. Marc: List away...","Archangel","333976","The only reason they want it taught in science is because that's where evo is taught and they are opposing views about how we got here.

"11-23-2008","11843",4,"Archangel","333970","Also a great point marc. like I said, the thread is based on a loaded question and a false premise in order for child and his buddies to feed their very needy egos. Now, if you consider the contributions to science made by creationists rather than through the study of creationism, the contributions are innumerable.","obvious_child","333984","Your delusionality knows no bounds. Nice fallacy of changing the subject there. No one argued that someone who believes in Creationism yet practiced actual science can't contribute to world knowledge. This is entirely about creationism as a science and its fundamental failures to produce anything outside of print. Thanks for citing a link that specifically discusses theists who have accepted modern science. Now getting away from your blatant fallacy, name me something other then print that creation science has commercialized","commercial-products-creationism","08:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","54"

If there is a difference between evolution and atheism, then the same difference exists between biblical creation and intelligent design. Not until you show me some commercial products from evolution. Commercial products, not search methods, or water. The point is, worldviews do not create commercial products.","commercial-products-creationism","09:16 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","55"

Secondly, your question is loaded since you wont accept inventions or scientific discoveries by christians based on their faith in God. From the George Washington Carver link above; here is what it say's about him. A devout Christian, Carver considered his laboratory ""God's Little Workshop."" He discovered that peanuts and soybeans would restore soil fertility, but farmers complained that they had no market for these products. To provide markets, Carver developed 300 products from peanuts and 118 from sweet potatoes. By 1940 peanuts had become the South's second largest crop. During World War II he developed 500 dyes. Archangel It is fair to say that had he not been a believer in God, ie a creationist, he may never have had the curiosity or the creativity to see the 300 products which came from Peanuts and 118 from sweet potatoes, hundreds of uses for soy Soybeans, George Washington Carver or the 500 dyes he invented. And remember, this was a second class citizen who rose above his station in life and accomplished more than the vast majority of whites who had unlimited opportunities in life. In 1916 he was honored by being appointed to the Royal Society of Arts in London. In 1923 he received the NAACP's prestigious Spingarn Medal. In 1938 a feature film, Life of George Washington Carver , was made. Before his death in 1943, he received the Roosevelt Medal for Outstanding Contribution to Southern Agriculture. The Hall of Fame for Great Americans inducted him in 1977. The National Inventors Hall of Fame included him in 1990. Carver's dedication to God and his people led him to patent only three of his 500 agricultural inventions because he wanted his products to benefit all. He left his life savings to Tuskegee Institute. So I don't know how you can say that these inventions aren't the result of creationism since the man who invented those products lived his life according to the principles of creationism, the bible and the God he believed was the author of life.","commercial-products-creationism","09:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","58"
