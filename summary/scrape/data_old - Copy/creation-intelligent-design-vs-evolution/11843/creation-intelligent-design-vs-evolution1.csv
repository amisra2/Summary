Surely if they believe in literal creationism there must be some tangible product that was derived from creation science!","commercial-products-creationism","04:32 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","2"

Exactly how many forums do you belong to? I would hope you wouldn't be too surprised that others sometimes ignore you. Is this your main activity in life?","T.Q","330202","So your answer to the question then is ""Nothing"", Marc?","commercial-products-creationism","08:37 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","4"

Is this your main activity in life?","obvious_child","330210","Actually other forums have intelligent people adding new products. Frankly, I just consolidating their posts. Amusingly, I have yet to find a single creationist who can offer a single tangible, non-print product. If your belief was true, why is there absolutely no commercialization of it aside from books and print related material? Maybe because your belief is absolute total garbage?","commercial-products-creationism","10:12 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","6"

I am surprised that the creationist aren't saying everything that is is because their god created it though the people who have invented the products.","commercial-products-creationism","05:53 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","7"

If they said that, they'd be admitting that evolution is correct and that literal creationism is wrong as what we see today was built off of the sciences that support evolution.","commercial-products-creationism","10:14 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","8"

Way to ignore the issue here. All of those products stem from applying the various sciences within evolution together through an evolutionary view. Creationism however, has absolutely nothing outside of publishing. A key determinant of validity in science is whether or not it can be made tangible. Creationism has nothing in that sense while evolution has hundreds.","commercial-products-creationism","10:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","13"

If creationism had any validity, they would have long ago given an example.","commercial-products-creationism","10:12 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","15"
