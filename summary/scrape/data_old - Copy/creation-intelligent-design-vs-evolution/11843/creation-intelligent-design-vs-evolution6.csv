"11-27-2008","11843",6,"marc9000","334278","(Regarding micro/macro evolution) Do you honestly not know about the elaborate set of models and ideas, or are you glossing over it? Im not necessarily singling you out personally - you seem to be one of many who prefer to speak of biological evolution as one process. As Wikipedia tells us; The idea that there could be two 'kinds' of evolution has long baffled me. The horizontal hopping of evolution has produced things like flu vaccines. The vertical hopping of common descent has produced nothing. "" Almost certainly""? (no cells around like those which first evolved into multicellular creatures) Almost is good enough in handgrenades, horseshoes, and evolution? (rewinding and winding chimps into humans via common ancestor) So if you start with the assumption of a common ancestor and work backwards from that, micro vs macro is moot? It gets more and more dominating all the time doesnt it? Is the day almost here when we can throw out the word biology like we largely have with micro and macro, and just call it all evolution? The more broad the term, the easier it is to use it as a weapon against religion, right? Todays computer chips are not designed? Did you really say that? No wonder everything we see and do is evolutionary. I shudder to think of what life on earth would be like if we didn't reject the book of Genesis. fossil hunting is all you have? The word commercial involves business, profits, sales to the general public etc, not methods of study. Is the answer youre looking for a commercial product of creationism? Everything Archangel showed you has been thrown out? In post #67, you said you were teetering between accepting/rejecting what Archangel proposed about George Washington Carvers creationist products. Since my post #70 (that you are responding to with this post) may have upset you to some degree, did that figure in your decision to reject what AA said about Carver? Would it be safe to say that being upset with someone or some group could increase the chances of rejecting something that they would favor? That evolutionists being upset with creationists could influence their decision to reject ID as science, more than it would if there was an unemotional interest in scientific inquiry? A completely unbiased interest in finding out what the truth is? But on to your question about a commercial product of creation, how about this one Wine. To close, I can show you what is probably the most influential, highest dollar commercial product of evolution of all, This report describes and evaluates animal biotechnology and its application in veterinary medicine and pharmaceuticals as well as improvement in food production. Knowledge of animal genetics is important in the application of biotechnology to manage genetic disorders and improve animal breeding. Genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics are also being applied to animal biotechnology. Transgenic technologies are used for improving milk production and the meat in farm animals as well as for creating models of human diseases. Transgenic animals are used for the production of proteins for human medical use. Biotechnology is applied to facilitate xenotransplantation from animals to humans. Genetic engineering is done in farm animals and nuclear transfer technology has become an important and preferred method for cloning animals.","Peeling","334496","I appreciate your helpfulness, but I think maybe I wasn't sufficiently clear earlier: You spoke of micro and maco evolution as if they represented motion in two independent axes - you even used analogies to that effect: But micro and macro evolution are matters of degree, not direction. That's why I said there aren't two 'kinds' of evolution. That's why I said there's no micro/macro divide. That's why I said I could rewind/wind a chimp into a human without you ever being able to stop me and say that the change I just made was ""unobserved macro evolution"". Do you understand? I'm not sure what you want from me here, or why you think this is significant. There may be cells around very similar to those ancestral to multicellular organisms, but it seems unlikely given the timescales and mutation rates involved. Not being personally acquainted with every single-celled organism on the planet I feel it would be presumptuous to claim absolute certainty No, that's not it at all. I was just being careful not to propagate the myth that chimps evolved into humans. You demanded commercial applications for evolution. I gave them to you. Now our understanding of evolution has been... too useful? I'd call it paranoia if I didn't know you only say these things to wind me up I appreciate that the debunking of Genesis looms large on your personal horizon, but it's hubris to suppose that was anything other than an incidental by-product. You're like the guy stuck in a traffic jam railing against the police cars and ambulances up ahead who are making you late. As for computer chips, the latest 'designs' really are the product of evolutionary algorithms. Their complexity is so high and the tolerances so fine that - short of actually building them - simulating them at a very low level is the only way to judge their performance. In order to reflect reality accurately enough, the computer model of the chip becomes so complex that the only way to predict if it's going to be good is to simulate it working - and the effect of small changes are also so subtle and complex that the only way to predict the result of making them is, again, simulation. In other words, the notion of trying to work out how to make the chip better evaporates because that 'working out' inevitably becomes a process of simulating alternatives. Does a map have commercial applications? Not according to you it doesn't. The time and fuel it saves lorry drivers because they don't have to drive down every road in the country looking for their delivery address doesn't count, apparently Yes. Yes. And you'll note the conclusion I reached: that while his creationist beliefs could be credited with fostering within him an enquiring mind, it is not equivalent to the credit due to the principles of aerodynamics for commercial air travel. Specifically, Aerodynamic theory has to be right in order for commercial air travel to be possible. Carver's creationist beliefs did not have to be right in order for his investigations to yield the results they did. No. I didn't even reject it; I merely drew what I think is a valid distinction between theories that need to be right in order to yield useful results, and those that need not. The credit due to the theory in each case is, I hope you would agree, of a different nature. Of course. I thought I'd agreed as much long ago! What I disagree with are the illogical leaps you proceed to make from that observation: that because emotion can influence decisions the decision to reject ID as science must be entirely emotional and, furthermore, must be wrong . Neither is true. A decision made for emotional reasons can still be, upon sober reflection, logically correct. Also, a person can be emotionally motivated to logically disprove something, which provides a sink for the emotions you claim run so high in the 'evolutionist camp' without compromising the validity of their arguments. I don't think you appreciate almost all of the negative emotion provoked by creationism and ID within the scientific community is professional rather than philosophical in nature. You simply assume that because you are primarily angered philosophically by evolution, the same must apply in reverse. The raison d'etre of science is to produce theories that work. It doesn't matter how much you love or hate an idea, or why, your emotions can't force it to yield good predictions. It will only work if it's genuinely a good theory. Right now, ID doesn't work, and that's why it's excluded from the science classroom. The fact it ticks emotional boxes for you, while evolution might tick emotional boxes for some hypothetical idea-of-god-hater, is irrelevant. And I'm not, by the way. An 'idea-of-god' hater, I mean. It's just that none of the gods I've heard about make any kind of sense when put in context (as a real thing, that is; they make perfect sense as conjured reflections of our own nature), and I think if there is such a thing as god it should make sense. I think this falls into a similar category as AA's examples: the bible doesn't have to be right in any important respect (Genesis least of all) in order for it to have influenced the sales and development of grape-based beverages. It was at the very outside an inspiration for more people to apply what are, in the end, scientific methodologies to the improvement of wine-making. Funny, but not even close : I'm sure Dawkins would have loved to clear $10,000,000,000 from The God Delusion, though As I said before, you only think of this issue's impact in terms of religion, so all the stories you construct to explain it are also in terms of religion. You're front and centre in the coming Apocalypse, and you love it Far more exciting than the reality.","commercial-products-creationism","09:00 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","86"
"12-02-2008","11843",6,"marc9000","334733","If there was no micro/macro divide, talkorigins wouldn't have referred to an elaborate set of models and ideas about it. If micro/macro was as simple (indeed, nonexistent) as you say, what could possibly be elaborate about it? No. If youre doing the rewinding, youre an intelligent force, not the natural, non-intelligent force that evolution needs. In addition, saying you can do something doesn't result in me actually observing it, you would have to actually do it for me to observe it. Is anybody actually winding chimps into humans these days? If they are, it's gotta be somewhere on youtube - link me. I'd like to see some clear proof that they were from evolution , that they would not have been developed with biology alone - Darwinless biology. You won't of course Speaking of ""saying things to wind you up"" - it can go both ways. Do you think the debunking of Genesis looms large on the personal horizon of the starter of this thread? Of the authors of the books I named? Of the website no answers in Genesis ? Of talkorigins? Of the NCSE ? Our 4000 members are scientists, teachers, clergy, and citizens with diverse religious affiliations. Of the education community ? The Coalition for Excellence in Science and Math Education (CESE) is composed of interested citizens throughout New Mexico and the nation, including scientists, engineers, educators, university faculty, members of the clergy, and parents. CESE is non-partisan and non-sectarian, and welcomes members of all religions and political philosophies. This coalition works to improve science education and science literacy for all citizens. My personal horizon, the ID movement, the ""wedge strategy"" - most of the Christian opposition to the evolutionist philosophy is reactionary. Destroying religion is the not an incidental by-product of evolution - it's in first place on evolutions 'to do' list. (evolutionary design in industry) And we would have never been able to figure this out without a belief in common descent of living things? Hunting LEADS TO maps. If youre giving evolution sequential leeway like that, I wouldnt have problems coming up with products that the creation story has come up with in the Bible. Gods creating things led to mans motivation to create things. Noah built a pretty impressive ship. Without the creation story, would we not know how to build ships? Thats just a s ridiculous as your implication that we wouldnt be able to build computer chips without billions of year biological evolution. The Wright brothers didnt have to know a thing about evolution to make their first plane fly. Neither did those who improved on it over the future decades. If evolution inspires the development of a commercial product, the evolutionist who was inspired didnt have to know for sure if it was right - all it may have been was an inspiration to try it. And it could have been just an ideological inspiration that didnt really require the first hypothesis to be right. Billions of year evolution doesn't have to be right for small changes to be utilized in the development of computer chips. I don't think it's that easy to draw that distinction. I think were coming to the conclusion that a belief in evolution can inspire commercial products to a very comparable extent to the way a belief in creation can inspire commercial products. Ive never said they must be, Ive said they may be. No, I see it in evolutionists, and I provided the proof above. If I continue to provide evidence of self motivated (not reactionary) political action by evolutionists, Different people have different definitions of what works. The Biblical account of creation, male and female - how they relate to each other - works pretty well. Its a worldview thing. That all the good and bad, the twists and turns, the complications of this one little planet happened as a cosmic accident with no purpose doesnt make a bit of sense to me at all.","Peeling","335006","I apologise; I spoke unclearly. There is no micro/macro divide in the sense you used earlier, in terms of genetic or phenotypic changes: there is no 'lateral' and 'vertical' evolution of which we see one but not the other. I refer you to the same diagram as I did with AA: Macroevolution concerns changes at the species level and above. That doesn't mean it refers to genetic changes that turn organisms into new species. Do you appreciate the distinction? When part of species 'A' migrates, becomes reproductively isolated, and undergoes microevolution to the point it no longer can or does interbreed with other descendents of 'A' even when they encounter each other, speciation is said to have occurred, and that whole process constitutes macroevolution. One might as well ask why it took so long to come up with something as simple as E=MC2 It might seem obvious after the fact, but a lot of careful science lies behind our current understanding of the processes of speciation and the vital role played by factors like reproductive isolation. That's irrelevant. I wouldn't need to make one single change of a type not already observed occuring naturally in the lab. I would be 'intelligently' mimicking natural events - the outcome would be the same either way. That's absolutely fair comment - which is why I tried to remember to say 'in principle' I have no idea what the series of microevolutionary changes would be to rewind a chimp and wind the common ancestor forward into a human being. However, we do know that 1) none of the differences are impossible to achieve naturally, and 2) there's overwhelming evidence that parallel evolution from a common ancestor did in fact happen. Imagine you're shown the following evidence: two guys going into a room carrying a deck of cards and a wad of cash each. Then several snapshots from inside the room, showing the guys playing poker and one of them with a bigger and bigger stack beside him. Finally, you see both guys leave, one with all the cash and the other with none. You know perfectly well what has happened, even if you can't reconstruct every single hand dealt. That's analogous to the situation we find ourselves in with human evolution: we see an inarguable fossil convergence of human and primate lineages, backed up to the hilt by analysis of genetic differences between us and the other great apes. Well, no, because it's an impossible demand and a meaningless exercise to boot. DNA evidence helps convict murderers who might have been convicted on the strength of other evidence anyway. It's not possible to say for sure exactly which convictions depend utterly upon DNA evidence, but we can say it leads to more successful convictions. Similarly, would our knowledge of biology be as advanced as it is now without an understanding of evolution? No. Having read hardly any of the books you listed, I couldn't say - although if The God Delusion is a representative example I'm happy to go along with the premise that analysing the shortcomings of religion is a central theme. Even so, they too are little more than a corollary; a sideshow - just like our discussion here. There the focus is clearly upon rebutting creationism in its various pseudo-scientific guises, not upon pulling apart Genesis. As are the others you linked: Of course it's reactionary. But it's not a reaction to a philosophy, it's a reaction to the published results of a methodology and the fact those results are contributing to lots and lots of successful science. It's often said evolution encroaching on religious territory, but that's not true. It merely falsifies narratives of natural history you've decided to entangle with your spiritual beliefs. Science doesn't get to choose which theories agree with the universe, and it doesn't get to choose what is written in the bible. If the universe contradicts the bible, there's only one possible source of error. If the bible had contained an accurate narrative of the natural history of Earth, science would have confirmed it - or at the very least, it would have confirmed that it was within the bounds of possibility. Has the bible's inaccuracy proved a boon for atheists? Yes, but I don't think it's justified in the final analysis. God's existence (or otherwise) does not depend upon the accuracy of what we believe about him or about the way he's done things. I think the human race will eventually come to terms with the reality of common descent, and everyone will carry on much as they did before, no doubt downplaying the significance of the whole embarrassing affair, much as we do now with Galileo. It's impossible to say 'never' with certainty, but I think it very unlikely. Would we have developed flight if there were no birds or winged insects to put the idea in our heads? A truly vast proportion of what we now take for granted as 'human inventions' can be traced back to the observation of a natural phenomenon, which tends to suggest that inspiration from nature was required for our development of evolutionary algorithms. I think you're wandering off topic here. You demanded a commercial application for common descent. I pointed out that our knowledge of common descent saves paleontologists time and money by helping them focus their efforts. That's a direct consequence of a very specific bit of knowledge, which has to be right in order to achieve the benefit it does. It doesn't matter what 'lead to' the creation of maps; the point is that maps have direct commercial application. I'm not invoking any sequential leeway at all. One could as easily say that man's habit of creating of things motivated him to invent a god who created things. Even if we don't go that far, it's only necessary to believe god greated things in order to be inspired to emulate him. That belief, unlike the contents of a map or our knowledge of common descent, does not have to be correct to yield the benefits described. That wasn't my implication. Evolutionary principles allow us to make modern computer chips, just like relativity enables us to make accurate GPS. The exact same universal principles Darwin perceived operating in nature. True up to a point - but not any more. These days plane designs are modelled, varied, filtered - evolved in a simulator, in short, before ever going into production. Evolution is a way of making things better than we can design them to be via other methods. I even explained why in our other recent thread. Now you're getting the hang of it You're correct that we don't need to have evolved, although we do have to be able to evolve - evolutionary principles do have to work - in order for better computer chips to emerge from the same process. But I never claimed that computer chips were a direct spin-off from our understanding of common descent, only a commercial spin off of evolutionary theory. I'm sure you'd love to come to that conclusion, but in reality there is a clear and straightforward distinction between beliefs that need to be correct in order to bear fruit, and those that do not. So far, every single 'product of creation' has been a 'product whose development was inspired by a belief in creation'. I'm not detracting from the value of that in the slightest - I'm quite prepared to be convinced that belief in god has inspired humanity. But inspiring is not the same as enabling . Aerodynamics enable the construction of working aircraft. Evolutionary principles enable the design of modern computer chips. Our understanding of common descent enables efficient paleontology, as well as inspiring the discovery of evolutionary principles. On the contrary, on several occasions you have laid down your reasoning as to why it's 'clear' that ID is not being excluded on merit, and that reasoning has explicitly excluded any consideration of ID itself. To you, ID is a black box, and it only matters who thinks its empty, not what's actually inside. 'Continue'? When did you start? Books by atheists pulling apart religion don't count at all. If you sincerely believe your neighbour is selling snake-oil, isn't it a reaction to attempt to warn people off? In what sense? You mean in the sense that woman was created for no other purpose than to keep man company? That she wasn't worth creating in her own right? Sorry, I'm just not following what's supposed to 'work' about that particular narrative. Does it continue to 'work' when you factor in the gill slits we develop as embryos, or the tail we grow and (usually) reabsorb? And that's absolutely fine - I wouldn't dream of claiming that you are certainly wrong. Now, me personally, I don't see that postulating a god for whom we serve a purpose solves anything, because it only begs the question: if you need to be created for a purpose in order to have one, what's god's purpose? After all, a common anti-atheist slippery-slope argument is to say that if there's no god, then all our works are ultimately purposeless so we might as well not bother. But our works serve our purposes; if that isn't good enough, then us serving god's purpose isn't good enough either, unless he has a purpose, defined by something else - and so on. And if you say it's sufficient for us to have a purpose, that so long as there's a rung higher than us on the ladder, we can be happy in our place - well, society occupies that higher rung, just as you occupy the rung above the individual cells of which your body is composed. The core issue, though, is that all this philosophical 'worldview' stuff regarding purpose has nothing to do with the literal truth of genesis, which is a (so far as we can tell, fictional) narrative of natural history . Let's forget evolution for a moment, and stop pretending that it's a black-and-white choice between it and biblical literalism. Just examine genesis on its own. I'm sure you'll agree that as a narrative it could be wrong in every respect, and yet god could still be responsible for our existence, still take a personal interest in our lives, still judge our behaviour, still have sent Jesus to us. So why should the fact that it is wrong in most respects give you a moment's pause? I would hazard a guess that you simply like believing you possess an infallible spiritual manual, by which you can live your life and everything will be OK. I think that in the end it's that you're loath to abandon, and everything else is a convenient and plausible-sounding distraction.","commercial-products-creationism","08:05 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","89"
