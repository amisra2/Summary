Way to ignore the issue here. All of those products stem from applying the various sciences within evolution together through an evolutionary view. Creationism however, has absolutely nothing outside of publishing. A key determinant of validity in science is whether or not it can be made tangible. Creationism has nothing in that sense while evolution has hundreds.","commercial-products-creationism","10:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","72"

Those products could still have been applied without the belief that all life evolved from a common ancestor.

Btw, thanks for proving that creationists rely on dishonesty. Except that those fields of science in which those discoveries were made didn't exist without evolutionary theory. Many came from interdisciplinary fields united by evolutionary theory. Without that tie, we don't have those discoveries. Not to mention that many of those sciences are directly contradictory to literal creationism. The search for gas and oil deposits follows that of evolution, where diatoms lived, evolved and died in large concentrations, where large ancient swamps and forests were. Literal genesis however, doesn't suggest hydrocarbon formation, it argues that such deposits were created by the the flood. Aside from the sheer idiocy of that argument as it completely ignores physics, oil and gas deposits should, under that theory, be randomly scattered or should be evenly distributed everywhere. Obviously that is untrue. Literal Genesis viewpoints reject the necessary sciences to come to such findings and commercial products. So, no, you are wrong. Wrong again. I see you refuse to post in the informal challenge. Not surprising from a coward creationist.","commercial-products-creationism","10:51 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","217"

Biological evolution can be studied independent of the belief that all life evolved from a common ancestor. Wrong. You're using false dichotomies. You're assuming that if literal creation is not true, then that validates the theory of evolution, something that you accused creationists of doing. Hypocrite. I have never stated that I believe in creationism in any shape, way or form.","commercial-products-creationism","11:21 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","83"

So the study of the change in species from one species to another can be done without the belief that species came from common ancestors? Really? The belief in a common ancestor is the study of biological evolution. It is simply an issue of how far one goes back. If two species evolved from one, and another species and that one evolved from a common one, how exactly are you going to propose we ignore history? Prove to me how geology is not contradictory to literal genesis. Explain to me how biology is not contradictory to literal genesis. Explain to me how astronomy is not contradictory to literal genesis. Show me a science that SUPPORTS literal genesis. The fabulous thing about evolution is that it can and has adapted to new finds in science. Modern evolution is very different from the ideas originally set forth by Darwin. But you, as a person who thinks that creationwiki is valid wouldn't know that. While it is possible that there is another alternative, the world was dominated by Literal Genesis. That does not support any of the sciences required. http://www.4forums.com/political/331779-post15.html try again.

You have yet to make a single statement that makes sense. all observed changes can simply be explained by changes in traits, without the belief of a common ancestor Wrong. evolution - Definitions from Dictionary.com learn your definitions and then post Fallacy of changing the subject. I never argued for literal genesis. You've ignored the fact that you've used a fallacy as well as multiple lies. Fallacy of changing the subject again. You have yet to show how the common ancestor belief has contributed in any way, shape or form to science or non-publication commercial products. You fail. You're ignoring the fact that you've used a false dichotomy, something you've accused others of doing. you're a hypocrite, and a bad one at that just because I disagree with talkorigins about an asinine list doesn't mean I disagree with them about everything. resorting to labelling is one of the most pathetic things you can do in a debate","commercial-products-creationism","11:46 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","183"

Except that you need to know the common ancestor, or ancestors to know which traits are new. How can you study biological evolution without knowing the ancestors? So no, you are wrong. LOL. You think that the dictionary definition of evolution is the same as biological evolution? TROLL ALERT. Name me a theory other then Evolution which is supported by current sciences. Or retract your statement. Yay! I'm going to pretend post #19 doesn't exist. I'm going to pretend that interdisciplinary sciences fused by evolution don't exist. I'm going to pretend that sciences on their own, not looking through evolution came to those conclusions! TROLL ALERT. Incorrect again. You claimed that those findings could have come outside of an evolutionary view. The problem is that there was no other view other then literal creationism. Therefore you are wrong as there was only two major players in town. As literal creationism wouldn't have resulted in them, you are again, wrong. Okay, what do you agree with them on? And why are you refusing to state that Literal Creationism is a factless science that has no products? You are so hiding.","commercial-products-creationism","12:08 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","239"

Epic fail. argument out of sheer ignorance not that I'm surprised, my expectations for you are so low I'm even surprised you can spell. you can study the change in something without knowing or studying where it originally came from. Your arguments = insanity My fault for assuming you know how to scroll down the page. I'm so sorry, I should've been clearer, I know how challenging it must be for you. Did you see the definition under biology? TROLL ALERT. IRRELEVANT. You assumed that literal creationism and the theory of evolution are the only possibilities. It can't be A, therefore B, which is what you accused of others of doing. You're a hypocrite. You fail. Try again when you PASS first grade. Your arguments = insanity, although that's an insult to the insane I never said anything about evolution as a whole, I said common ancestor belief. You're nothing but an ignorant 4 year old, aren't you? Congrats on learning to type so early! Show me where I claimed that. You're a liar. I accept that. but why do you still do it AFTER I've shown you to be a complete liar? I never argued for creationism. I'm arguing that your insane statement in your opening post is false. fallacy of changing the subject again, hypocrite you accused of others of doing the same thing","commercial-products-creationism","12:40 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","273"
