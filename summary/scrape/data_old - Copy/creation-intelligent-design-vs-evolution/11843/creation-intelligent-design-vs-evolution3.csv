You have yet to make a single statement that makes sense. all observed changes can simply be explained by changes in traits, without the belief of a common ancestor learn your definitions and then post Fallacy of changing the subject. I never argued for literal genesis. You've ignored the fact that you've used a fallacy as well as multiple lies. Fallacy of changing the subject again. You have yet to show how the common ancestor belief has contributed in any way, shape or form to science or non-publication commercial products. You're ignoring the fact that you've used a false dichotomy, something you've accused others of doing. you're a hypocrite, and a bad one at that ust because I disagree with talkorigins about an asinine list doesn't mean I disagree with them about everything.","obvious_child","331879","Translation: I can't deal with post #19, so I'm going to pretend whatever I wish to make myself feel better. Except that you need to know the common ancestor, or ancestors to know which traits are new. How can you study biological evolution without knowing the ancestors? So no, you are wrong. LOL. You think that the dictionary definition of evolution is the same as biological evolution? TROLL ALERT. Name me a theory other then Evolution which is supported by current sciences. Or retract your statement. Yay! I'm going to pretend post #19 doesn't exist. I'm going to pretend that interdisciplinary sciences fused by evolution don't exist. I'm going to pretend that sciences on their own, not looking through evolution came to those conclusions! TROLL ALERT. Incorrect again. You claimed that those findings could have come outside of an evolutionary view. The problem is that there was no other view other then literal creationism. Therefore you are wrong as there was only two major players in town. As literal creationism wouldn't have resulted in them, you are again, wrong. Okay, what do you agree with them on? And why are you refusing to state that Literal Creationism is a factless science that has no products?

Epic fail. argument out of sheer ignorance not that I'm surprised, my expectations for you are so low I'm even surprised you can spell. you can study the change in something without knowing or studying where it originally came from. Your arguments = insanity My fault for assuming you know how to scroll down the page. I'm so sorry, I should've been clearer, I know how challenging it must be for you. Did you see the definition under biology? TROLL ALERT. IRRELEVANT. You assumed that literal creationism and the theory of evolution are the only possibilities. It can't be A, therefore B, which is what you accused of others of doing. You're a hypocrite. You fail. Try again when you PASS first grade. Your arguments = insanity, although that's an insult to the insane I never said anything about evolution as a whole, I said common ancestor belief. You're nothing but an ignorant 4 year old, aren't you? Congrats on learning to type so early! Show me where I claimed that. You're a liar. I accept that. but why do you still do it AFTER I've shown you to be a complete liar? I never argued for creationism. I'm arguing that your insane statement in your opening post is false. fallacy of changing the subject again, hypocrite you accused of others of doing the same thing","commercial-products-creationism","12:40 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","33"

I never said that evolution as a whole is false. However, the real issue at hand is whether or not all life came evolved from a common ancestor. In creation vs. evolution debates, evolution is implied as the theory of evolution. The debates are about whether life evolved from a common ancestor or not, not about whether or not DNA mutates or about whether or not traits change. The simple fact of the matter is, that belief has not contributed, in any way, shape or form to any applicable scientific knowledge or commercial products. The theory of evolution has not contributed one iota to society as we know it today.","commercial-products-creationism","10:59 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","36"

"11-09-2008","11843",3,"iangb","331917","Not the issue of this thread, however. This thread implies that creationism is unscientific, because if it was not there would be some commercial product made based on it's ideas. Not true. Again, the 'theory of evolution' does not necessarily point to a common ancestor, although this is generally inferred. When creationists talk about the 'theory' of evolution, they tend to mean anything from carbon dating to abiogenesis via plate tectonics and biological change. However, they are incorrect in these assumptions. Darwin wrote about 'The origin of species by means of natural selection' '. Later, this would change (colloquially) to ""by means of evolution"". It's evolution you are talking about here, not neo-Darwinism - and in that, you will fail.","CashBurnRate","332044","The thread also implies that the theory of evolution has resulted in commercial products. Nothing can be further from the truth. Well, duh. The theory of evolution does suggest a common ancestor.

That is neither the issue nor the case. 'Darwinism' is the theory that all life comes from a common ancestor, and has since split into separate species by the mechanism of evolution. Evolution is the mechanism by which gradual improving change occurs. Biological evolution deals with the change in species - but even biological evolution does not state that all life came from a common ancestor. Oh, I know.

"11-12-2008","11843",3,"CashBurnRate","332044","The thread also implies that the theory of evolution has resulted in commercial products. Well, duh. The theory of evolution does suggest a common ancestor.","Peeling","332435","Which it has. One of its other products is the confirmation of common descent of all current life on earth. Actually no, it doesn't. Evolutionary theory makes predictions about what we should find if all extant life on earth had a common ancestor, and those predictions have been confirmed (ubiquity of base pairs etc). But consider a hypothetical situation where we find life on another planet. Evolutionary theory predicts what we should expect if life here and there had a common ancestor. If those predictions are confirmed, it would suggest some form of panspermia. If they are not, it would suggest life arose independently in different places. Evolutionary theory allows us to discriminate between common ancestry and independent appearance; it does not suggest either one. Saying that our understanding of the common descent of all life has had no commercial application strikes me as akin to saying that our understanding of how birds manage to fly has had no commercial application because we don't make birds. It's a little obtuse, yes? XXX-backward, even. The study of how birds flew led directly to our understanding of aerodynamics and all derivative commercial applications. Similarly, study of the compelling evidence for common descent led to the development of the theory of evolution and all its derivative commercial applications.","commercial-products-creationism","05:54 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","45"
