This is entirely about literal creationism as a science in regards of commercial applications. Your argument is entirely tangential. Furthermore, you make the poor assumption that being a Christian equates to believing in literal creationism. Numerous people have pointed out that your interpretation is not what Christanity is. And as I have already stated and you have deliberately chosen to ignore, that theists who practice actual science can contribute to world knowledge. This is about Literal Creationism Science . Stop with the fallacy of changing the subject. Come again? How did he live his life according to the principles of literal creationism. Where did he apply the notions of a flood? Where did he apply reasoning of a completely different physical set of laws? Carver practiced real science and happened to be a Christian. That immediately takes him out of the discussion as he was not practicing literal creationist science. Again, just because you are a Christian doesn't mean you believe in Literal Creationism, nor does it mean you can't use real science.

Genetics plays a big role in producing new vaccines. Furthermore, evolution directly impacts the production and design of new vaccines. One can even predict how bacteria and viruses can change based on evolution. Can't do that with creationism. You fail to seperate work from development. You just refuted yourself. You state that vaccines aren't made for specific viruses, yet you stated earlier that researches develop vaccines for strains they think will arise. And to further correct you, they develop the most based on the most common strain. Aka, specific development. Way to fail to understand evolution.

But For you to assume that because GWC did real science, that he couldn't have been a real creationist in his deepest convictions just confirms your condescending attitude toward creationists. It say's nothing at all about the truth of creationism and the eternal truths it is based upon. Throughout his life, Carver maintained that the master analyst needs no book; he is at liberty to take apart and put together substances, compatible or non compatible to suit his own particular taste or fancy. Nevertheless, his reliance on divine revelation instead of scientific methods often put him at odds with the scientific community. His deep religious faith was also important. In his speeches and interviews, he almost always referred to the Bible and divine guidance. His accomplishments, he was fond of saying, were not his doing but were the work of God. As he told a reporter for the Atlanta Journal who questioned him about the permanency of the clay paints he had developed: Why should they not be permanent? God made the clay in the hills; they have been there for countless generations, changeless. All I do is prepare what God has made, for uses to which man can put it. It is God's work-not mine. For him to make a statement like that, that God made the clay in the hills; he obviously believed that God made everything. Made it for mans use and all George did was utilize what God had given us. Had he not been a creationist, he wouldn't have thought that way and may have remained just another unknown oppressed ex-slave for his lifetime. My point is that as a result of his creationist convictions, the world of possibilities opened to him regarding the products he created from things like clay, peanuts, soybeans and sweet potatoes. And had he just invented a couple of products from each of these food sources, that in itself would have been impressive, and he still would be famous considering that he was born a slave. But he invented hundreds of uses for each product becoming an industry unto himself. No oc, to claim that Carvers creationism beliefs played no part in his inventions from natural products, or that he was a true scientist rather than a creationist, contradicts what he himself believed and said when he openly told anyone he lectured that he was only finding the uses God designed in creating the food products He gave us. That is the definition of a creationist at its most basic level. George Washington Carver","commercial-products-creationism","07:23 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","66"
"11-24-2008","11843",5,"None","None","None","Peeling","334039","That's a very interesting way of looking at it, actually. I don't think it's quite the same thing, but it's interesting. Carver undoubtedly interpreted everything he did and saw according to his creationist beliefs. It even seems likely that they inspired him to look for uses for things. Is that enough? Does that make his inventions commercial products of creationism? I'm teetering between yes and no, and here's why: Aerodynamic theory tells us what to expect if we construct an aircraft with a particular wingspan and profile etc etc - and it's a good theory because it works: we get the results we expect. Creationism led Carver to believe that if he looked he would find many applications for natural products, and that also turned out to be true. So in very, very general sense one could claim equivalency. On the other hand... if a belief that there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow leads you to spend all your time chasing them across fields, and as a result you spot a valuable Roman coin jutting out of the soil which turns out to be part of a vast treasure, is it correct to describe your find as a commercial application of a belief in pots of gold at the ends of rainbows? Sounds tenuous, doesn't it? Because if the Romans hadn't dropped a load of coins in that field, no amount of belief in fairy gold would have enabled you to find them. Conversely, you could have been in that field for any reason at all and still spotted the coin - or you could just as easily have found a dinosaur fossil instead of a coin. So the causal linkage between belief and outcome is really flimsy. About the most we can say is that if a belief encourages you to have an enquiring mind, it deserves some credit for what that mind achieves. Are those achievements commercial products of that belief, in the same way as planes are commercial products of aerodynamic theory? I think I have to say no: planes work because aerodynamic theory is in fact correct, whereas Carver's inventions were the product of him behaving as if his beliefs were correct. To put it another way, his beliefs didn't actually need to be correct in order for him to achieve what he did, whereas if aerodynamic theory were wrong planes built according to its principles would fall out of the sky. As I said though, very interesting - and if nothing else an argument that diversity of beliefs is a good thing (even if only accidentally )","commercial-products-creationism","10:58 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","67"

Just because you believe in literal creationism does not mean you cannot practice actual science. Name me a single commercial product derived from Creationist science. Carver obviously practiced actual science by looking at how the natural world worked. If he was practicing Creationist science he'd be looking at the world from a perspective of two different sets of physical laws, pre and post flood. He'd also be rejecting radioactivity, biological evolution, geology and a whole host of other sciences. Your argument is not addressing the subject as you are citing someone who believed in Creationism yet practiced something very different. Carver experimented with peanuts using the scientific method. That is NOT creationism science which assumes the outcome first and then looks for evidence. He looked and observed at the peanut's potential was and then experimented on what he thought it could do. And again you are engaging in the bull**** belief that your interpretation = Christanity.

I'm actually quite interested in the idea, because I don't actually know of any products that would be a development of evolutionary theory. The problem is that not all fields of genetics are inextricably linked to evolution. It can work for someone that doesn't believe in evolution and sees genetics only as a mechanism that has been created by god. So all the recombinant vaccines and similar are quite out. Only a product that would specifically be developed from, for example, evolutionary genetic links between different species and similar. Of course, by the same logic, the work of a creation believing scientist is not a product of creationism. Only a work that would specifically be developed from the premise of one creator would qualify. If, for example, someone were to map out strata by applying fluid dynamics and whatnot under the premise of a global flood.

"11-24-2008","11843",5,"marc9000","334149","We now have ONE suggestion of a commercial product from evolution - flu vaccines. They, like anything claimed to have been produced by evolution, come from micro-evolution, something that does not conflict with Biblical creation. Clever atheist scientists seem to do this often - blend micro vs macro evolution so they can seamlessly switch back and fourth to confuse facts from one to support theories for the other. Carl Wieland uses this example; Has AIDS evolved? ""Are the observed changes, on analysis, heading in the right direction? That is, are they the type of changes which, given enough time, would be capable of producing a massively complex organism like a horse from a one-celled creature?"" The horizontal hopping of evolution has produced things like flu vaccines. The vertical hopping of common descent has produced nothing. (so far in this thread anyway) There are worlds of difference between the two. To try to blend them is misleading. How long will the demands keep coming, while we see no examples of common descent evolution as a science being commercialized? Is this an indicator of how science in general makes demands of ID that are far above and beyond what they require of common descent evolution? Since evolution has been the dominant theory of biology for more than a century, it's a safe statement that all of the wonderful innovations in medicine and agriculture that we derive from biological research stem from the theory of evolution. Recent, exciting examples are humanized antibodies like Remicade for inflammation and Herceptin for breast cancer, both initially made in mice. Without our knowledge of the evolution of mice and humans and their immune systems, we wouldn't have such life-saving and life-improving technologies. Another specific example is resistant bacterial infections, one of the scariest threats to public health. The ones that are resistant to antibiotics are more reproductively successful than their non-resistant relatives and pass the new resistance genes on to more offspring. Just as Darwin said 150 years ago. The creationists have devised a tortuous work-around for this phenomenon, which endorses natural selection and survival of the fittest, but says that evolution doesn't explain the original development of species. The problem is, there are hundreds of genes that occur in both bacteria and humans. It's hard to see why a designer would do it that way, since having the same genes in bacteria and humans makes infections harder to treat: drugs that act on bacterial gene products act on the human versions as well, so those drugs could kill both the bacterium and the human host. Talk about throwing the baby out with the bathwater. So evolution has some pretty exciting applications (like food), and I'm guessing most people would prefer antibiotics developed by someone who knows the evolutionary relationship of humans and bacteria.","Peeling","334158","The idea that there could be two 'kinds' of evolution has long baffled me. The plain fact is that the chimp genome, for instance, and the human genome differ by a finite number of base pairs - or more correctly they both differ by finite numbers of base pairs from their common ancestor. What do you think would happen if we took chimp DNA, manually made all the individual changes so as to make it identical to human DNA, and grew an organism from it? That's right: you'd get a human . And since we also know for a fact that every single one of those changes can occur naturally, the idea that there could be a micro/macro divide is absurd. Yes. Single celled organisms have been observed to evolve 'clumping' behaviour in the lab, which is a plausible first step towards multicellularity. Even that is pretty remarkable, when you consider what Carl fails to take into account: that there are almost certainly no cells around today like those which evolved into multicellular creatures half a billion years ago. That ship has sailed and we're on it. On the contrary, to pretend that there is a difference is misleading. I could change chimp DNA into human DNA one base pair at a time, and at no point would you be able to stop me and say 'ah ah, that was macro evolution'. Of course, in reality chimp and human DNA both diverged from the DNA of a common ancestor; one did not change into another. But I could in principle 'rewind' the genetic changes experienced by chimps, one at a time, and then wind forward those experienced by humans, one at a time, and turn a chimp into a human via their common ancestor using 'micro' evolution alone. No, marc, it isn't. I explained quite a few posts ago the relationship between evolutionary theory and common descent. Mushing the phrases together into 'common descent evolution' is like demanding a commercial application for 'relativity GPS'. GPS has commercial applications, and its accuracy is made possible by our understanding of relativity and the speed of light. Similarly, evolution's commercial applications are possible because the appreciation of common descent - knowing what problem the theory had to solve - guided the development of the theory and led us down the right track. And in return, evolutionary theory made predictions that confirmed common descent and allowed us to make progressively better and finer judgements as to the shape of the tree of life. From the link above: Every modern product of biotech owes its existence to our appreciation of the fact of evolution. Every hardy or disease-resistant strain of crops, too. Not to mention the banana - although we didn't really understand what we were doing back then, we still grasped the basic principle of keep and breed what you want and discard what you don't. Nature supplied the tasty mutation, and in its environment - consisting of lots of hungry people - that mutation thrived and is now the world's most popular fruit. Spin-offs of evolutionary theory are rendering the graphics on your monitor as you read this text: today's computer chips are not designed, but evolved using the principles we observe in nature. But ok, let's try and find a commercial application for common descent specifically. It's actually not all that hard: paleontology. Fossil hunting is made more efficient in terms of both time and money by our understanding of common descent: it tells us where to look to stand a chance of finding the fossils we're interested in. I believe the challenge - delivered in lieu of an answer to the original question posed by this thread - has been well and truly met. Any chance of getting that answer now?","commercial-products-creationism","08:52 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","72"
