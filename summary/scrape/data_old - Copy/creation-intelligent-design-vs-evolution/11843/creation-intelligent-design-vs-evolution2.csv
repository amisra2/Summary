When asked again to provide a single example, what do creationists do? Insult. When asked again to provide a single example, what do creationist do? Flee. If creationism had any validity, they would have long ago given an example.","CashBurnRate","331829","you implied that evolution has contributed to society however, you have yet to provide a single example of how the belief that all life evolved from a common ancestor has contributed in any shape, way or form to any scientific or non-commercial product THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION HAS NOT MADE ANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO SOCIETY.

"11-08-2008","11843",2,"obvious_child","331818","I'd expect that from a dishonest creationist coward. Way to ignore the issue here. All of those products stem from applying the various sciences within evolution together through an evolutionary view. Creationism however, has absolutely nothing outside of publishing. A key determinant of validity in science is whether or not it can be made tangible. Creationism has nothing in that sense while evolution has hundreds.","CashBurnRate","331831","Typical answer from a dishonest socially-inept evolutionist coward. Ignoring the real issue. Those products could still have been applied without the belief that all life evolved from a common ancestor. But I already know you're nothing but a dishonest coward so I won't expect you to provide any meaningful response.","commercial-products-creationism","10:24 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","17"

The primary purpose of this thread is to find examples of commercialization of Creationist science. So far, no examples have been provided. The only thing you are doing is trying to change the subject, which by the way refutes your claim that creationists don't argue with fallacies as you are clearly engaging in that rather then discussing the original thread. I'm soon going to join the audience. You do a great job of refuting your own asinine arguments. See Post #1 for examples. You are wrong. Then explain how the examples in Post #1 aren't valid. Or are you going to just yell, say ""I'm right because I say so"" and generally fail to provide any reasoning?","commercial-products-creationism","10:47 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","18"

Btw, thanks for proving that creationists rely on dishonesty. Except that those fields of science in which those discoveries were made didn't exist without evolutionary theory. Many came from interdisciplinary fields united by evolutionary theory. Without that tie, we don't have those discoveries. Not to mention that many of those sciences are directly contradictory to literal creationism. The search for gas and oil deposits follows that of evolution, where diatoms lived, evolved and died in large concentrations, where large ancient swamps and forests were. Literal genesis however, doesn't suggest hydrocarbon formation, it argues that such deposits were created by the the flood. Aside from the sheer idiocy of that argument as it completely ignores physics, oil and gas deposits should, under that theory, be randomly scattered or should be evenly distributed everywhere. Obviously that is untrue. Literal Genesis viewpoints reject the necessary sciences to come to such findings and commercial products. So, no, you are wrong. Wrong again. I see you refuse to post in the informal challenge. Not surprising from a coward creationist.","commercial-products-creationism","10:51 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","19"

So the study of the change in species from one species to another can be done without the belief that species came from common ancestors? Really?
