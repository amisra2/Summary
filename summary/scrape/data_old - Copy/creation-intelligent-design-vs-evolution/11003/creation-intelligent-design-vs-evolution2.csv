"03-01-2008","11003",2,"Archangel","304135","If you personally understood what it means to be born again, Dane, you would never say such foolish things.","Dane","304144","AA, being Born again is to accept God by Faith, WITHOUT needing evidence, without needing tangible assurance. Your weak faith (little f) is desperately sending you searching for ""evidence"" in a black-and-white world that doesn't exist to begin with. So your being born again looks like it dumped you into some warped and off-track world. I wonder what you have been born again into, because it sure isn't into the World of Christ where hate, fear, scare mongering and bearing false witness is necessary. So you talking about being born again is frankly pathetic, as pathetic as your desperate seeking assurance of God's existence through evidence. If you TRULY were born again, you wouldn't need the evidence, Faith would simply be enough and would not be so threatened by Science or whatnot. However, for you that simply isn't enough. So I must wonder about your claim about being born again. You may have been tricked by Satan here and have been sidetracked into a world where you believe God condones False Witnessing. Perhaps you should take a look at that map of yours again, before you FURTHER sell your soul to the Devil with your endless bearing false witness.","only-one-god-does-exist-when-comes-politics-western-world","01:45 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","17"
"03-01-2008","11003",2,"Archangel","304137","So you're claiming as a christian that your God is the same God of the moslem Faith? Is that what you're saying brother Dane?","Dane","304146","I'm saying that Muslims are my brothers and sisters in Faith (capital F), just like the Jews are. YOU obviously are so stuck in your trying to get first in line to the afterlife (as described above) that you will fight everybody else to get in that line. AA, here is an analogy from my days in farming, an analogy that has been served up in the literature in the past as well. The example is that of little pigs at the feeding trough. There is always one that want it all for himself (or herself, but I'm going for brevity here) and try to chase all other piglets away from the trough. Unfortunately, while it chases one, all the others are still feeding, so in the end, all it got was a lot of self-righteous chasing of others away from ""his"" food, while everybody else got to eat their full. THAT piglet is the creationist movement and any self-righteous, excluding, scare- and hate-mongering theocratic ideology. You are to busy chasing off Muslims and anybody else you think that YOUR warped imagery of God are against, while the rest of us know that God loves everybody. So yes AA, Muslims are my brothers and sisters in Faith (capital F). And while all religions have their Bin Ladins and Fred Phelps, the treat to harmony comes from extremism, from fundamentalism, rather than from one Faith or another. That you don't see this and thus pathetically keep trying to find your physical god and fight to keep him/her for yourself because that is where your faith (small f) has led you, that frankly is sad.","only-one-god-does-exist-when-comes-politics-western-world","01:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","18"

The first hand personal evidence that God is real and always with us by way of his Holy Spirit comes with becoming born again, or saved as it is also referred to in the bible. Once one possesses Gods Holy Spirit, he also has that never ending personal assurance that God is, and always will be with him. That is my experience so it is much more than some dumb hope that I am right, but a fulfilled promise made by God and completed by the sacrifice Jesus made on the Cross when He died for the sins of every person who receives the free gift of salvation by submitting their lives to Him and trusting Him to guide and lead them as a Father guides and leads a child He loves. That is what it means to be saved Dane.","only-one-god-does-exist-when-comes-politics-western-world","02:09 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","20"

Are you now telling someone who was born a moslem what the correct term for describing ourselves is? Are you aware that prior to the rise of Islamofascism, there were two types of islamists. The Black Muslim movement in America, and the larger Arabic Moslem community around the World. Only since terrorism has become common have you gentiles corrupted the term moslem and use the generic term muslim which I refuse to ever adopt. So to directly answer your question, it is the term muslim that is offensive to Islamists of middle eastern descent.","only-one-god-does-exist-when-comes-politics-western-world","02:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","22"

"03-01-2008","11003",2,"Dane","304158","Combining posts for brevity and simplicity Ah, that's right, you insist on looking at the differences, just like a little kid insisting that ""mommy and daddy loves me more than you"" to their bothers and sisters. You want to be ""special"" in God's eyes. Well, AA, you very likely ARE special, but maybe not in a way you have thought of. A person like you who push so much false witnessing in ""defending"" god likely will get attention from God (capital G) Yeah, yeah. I get your simplistic, chest-beating ""Me good, them bad"" scare mongering. So that raises the question of how born again you are, with your insecure seeking approval from god (little g) through your false witnessing and insisting that God loves YOU more than God loves Muslims, f.ex.?????? Yes. So? Do you REALLY believe that God loves you less if God also love other people?","Archangel","304163","With every post you make you further prove you don't have a clue about Gods character or plan for our lives. No where did I say that my God doesn't love all moslems just as He loves all people on Earth, no matter what their religion. But that doesn't mean that He will receive moslems as they are under islamic law. God doesn't compromise Dane. And the only way to salvation is by accepting what Jesus did for us on the Cross. It is through Him that we are saved and not of ourselves at all. Jesus died for the sins of all of humanity, not just people who think they are saved because they are cultural christians. Take me for example, I was born MOSLEM. But only was I saved when I submitted my will to God through Christ who is the perfect sacrificial lamb who shed His blood so that we may live more abundant live. Nooooo... ME BAD, NEED SALVATION THROUGH LOVING MESSIAH WHO DIED FOR SINS. AND ALSO SINS OF ALL PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE FREE GIFT OF SALVATION HE OFFER TO EVERYONE. ME NOT EXTRA SPECIAL, I JUST RECEIVE GIFT. I seek to please my heavenly Father every day of my life. I worship Him, glorify Him and Magnify His Holy name for He is worthy of praise and worship. And I'm saddened that as one who claims to be a christian that you will mock me for that lifestyle. But let me be clear that no where did I ever say that God loves me more than anyone else at all. That is just your corrupted interpretation of what i said. And I challenge you to post where I said such a thing. Of course not Dane. If I didn't love you in spite of all of the hatred you have projected towards me, do you think I would have spent all of this time sharing the truth of how one must be saved with you? Wouldn't I just shut up and not even tell you how to avoid eternal separation from God? Your problem is, that you have no concept of what true love is. And that is your true loss my young friend.","only-one-god-does-exist-when-comes-politics-western-world","02:49 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","25"
