Only 5.2% claimed membership in a non-Christian faith, with Jews (1.4%) the leaders in that group. Only 0.6% of Americans are Muslim, 0.5% Buddhist, and 0.4% Hindu. The most rapidly growing segment in the survey involves those who say they have no religion or else identify as atheist or agnostic a group that now represents 15% of the total. Though these irreligious Americans certainly constitute a force worth respecting (after all, consider all the recent bestsellers theyve produced)......","marc9000","304056","The ""other gods out there"" aren't involved in how evolution is promoted in the US because they don't have any noticeable influence in US politics. No, America has never been a multicultural society Can you reference any Muslim, Buddhist, or Hindu legislation or customs that are sweeping the US? a little more from that link; Hmmm, rapidly growing, a force worth respecting, bestsellers they've produced, and of course, the court battles they have won since church and state were ""separated"" in 1947.....","only-one-god-does-exist-when-comes-politics-western-world","09:47 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","2"

Certainly, when Marc talks about validity of things mainly based on whether they ""sweep"" the country, then the rapid growth in interest in the FSM is amazing. After all, when so many people pay it credence, then it must be valid, right? Certainly, that's the argument creationists always seem to serve up.

He is the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and is the same Messiah who spoke all that exists into creation. As a son of Abraham, I too am a semitic person Trebor, only my mother is Hagar rather than Sarah. That is why I accept you as a blood brother and love the Jew as the people through whom salvation came into the World. How sad it is that you have no concept of who you really are according to the God who lovingly made you in His image. It truly breaks my heart for you.","only-one-god-does-exist-when-comes-politics-western-world","01:20 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","9"

"03-01-2008","11003",1,"None","None","None","Dane","304132","I think that listening to AA, Marc etc gives people a weird and warped image of Christianity. After all, it is NOT about evidence, it is about Faith. The moment we insist that we have ""evidence"" for God, or that God can be proven through events and things, then instead we see a God-of-the-gaps idea, a phenomenon so limiting of God that it blasphemously shrinking God to a primitive ""Gee, I don't understand, so it must be the gods"" idea. THAT is the lame and pathetic god that creationists promote, the god of physical observance. After all, Faith, the cornerstone of Christianity is completely disregarded by this crowd of creationists and other weak-faithed individuals. They are exactly like the Israelites in the desert, asking of a golden calf to physically evidencing God, their god (little g) is just their unimaginative impression of God (capital G). Creationists are desperately and panically seeking for their golden calf, and desperately speak against anybody who seek to have them look at their Faith instead. That really is what we are witnessing in these forum, a bunch of pathetic and weak-Faithed individuals pleading for something to build their faith (little f) on. And pathetic, weak-minded individuals clinging desperately to their warped and blasphemic God-of-the-gaps will say anything because they are driven by fear of losing their ""afterlife."" It doesn't matter what lies they have to tell us, because their concerns are solely directed at not going to their mythological version of hell (again seen by themselves as a physical location like everything else about God). And when such people of weak faith are afraid of Hell, telling falsehoods, spewing self-deluded ideas because all their worries are focused on somehow wanting to have a physical life after death, they of course show no concerns at all about bearing false witness and whatever else the faith in God (capital G) requires us to avoid. And they know it, they know that their grip on the elusive, self-deluded afterlife is slipping, so they get more desperate. Like people in a burning building who only see the door in the distance and will trample babies and their own mother to get through that door first. Now, does ANYBODY here think that such self-deluded, panicked creationists ever will show any concern to honesty and truth rather than whatever sophistry they believe will get them first in line?","only-one-god-does-exist-when-comes-politics-western-world","01:32 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","11"
