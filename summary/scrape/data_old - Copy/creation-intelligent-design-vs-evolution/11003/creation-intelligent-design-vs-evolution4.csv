"03-06-2008","11003",4,"Peeling","304640","...but does not prevent the bible containing truth. Something always niggles at me when statements like this are made. Hard to put into words as it is, I'll try. I get the feeling that science is perceived as persecuting religions by unearthing facts that disagree with them, like it's somehow science's fault those facts are there. The subtext of statements like the one above, and of the posts that contain them, often seems to be that science should be judged - and potentially found wanting in some vaguely moralistic sense - for bringing to our collective attention the ways in which some religious texts fail to jibe with reality. If we abandoned science here and now, and eradicated all its works, would that suddenly make Genesis accurate? No - so why shoot the messenger? Are we supposed to be angry with science for making it harder to be a Christian? Why? Shouldn't we be angry with the bible for making it harder to be a Christian by containing factual inaccuracies? Surely the lesson there is that if you're going to proclaim yourself the bearer of the unadulterated word of god, you'd better be damn sure you can read his handwriting first.","marc9000","304691","That's something I'd like to see you discuss with unkerpaulie. If youd reword it just a little, youd have it. I get the feeling that DARWINISM is perceived as persecuting religions Too many people today make a seamless blend between the two words science and Darwinism. Darwin is one path, (some would say a narrow path) of scientific exploration about the past. If all of science is funneled into Darwinism only, then its possible that other types of science could be left out. Science shouldnt be judged, and potentially found wanting, Darwinism should be judged, and potentially found wanting. Theories about millions and billions of years ago are not ""reality"" to many people. Meticulously preserved manuscripts of only a few thousand years old are reality to many. No but if we put Darwinism in its proper place, and didnt funnel most or all of science into it, maybe it would subject Genesis to less ridicule. No, we should be angry with the religion of Darwinism for making it harder to be a Christian. We should be angry that Darwinism shoots the messenger - the infallible word of God. Its only the atheist worldview that concludes that the Bible contains factual inaccuracies. Christianity presupposes that the Bible is infallible, and that anything man does is fallible. Atheism presupposes that Darwinism is infallible, and that the Bible, or anything else man does, is fallible. Thats the big disadvantage that Christians have in the debate with evolution. Christians have to be honest in their commitment to the Bible, yet evolutionists dont have to be honest in their commitment to Darwinism. They can claim that if something else comes along that scientifically proves Darwinism wrong, and shows a better alternative to it, that theyll abandon Darwinism like the plague, and enthusiastically support the new alternative. Darwinism is simply too politically entrenched to abandon, and we have at least one example, possibly more, that any alternative to Darwinism will NEVER see the light of day. And if Im in full agreement with those handwriting analysts who believe he doesnt exist , Im not going to be very sure Im reading it right!!

AiG doesn't merely support Christianity, it focuses on creationism. AiG's museums aren't about God's love or being righteous, they're about creationism proper. Catholics would have a problem with your saying that AiG is a good representation of their beliefs. I think most Christians would argue that you and Archie do an awful job of representing Christianity accurately.

Lyell argued that the earth was old before Darwin. Geology is not Darwinism. Cosmology is not Darwinism. Astronomy is not Darwinism. Yet you anti-science loudmouths pretend that it's all the same thing or that other disciplines are fudged to fit Darwinism. Geology is science. Cosmology is science. Astronomy is science. Biology is science. ""Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution."" --Theo Dobzhansky So you're saying that we shouldn't funnel other disciplines into Darwinism? Great. Now let me let you in on a secret. Geology is not Darwinism. Cosmology is not Darwinism. Astronomy is not Darwinism. Geology is science. Cosmology is science. Astronomy is science. Biology is science. ""Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution."" --Theo Dobzhansky All sciences should be judged against the evidence. So should all of our other ideas of truth. Science does this by definition. Biology is science. ""Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution."" --Theo Dobzhansky Evolution has been tested over and over and over, and is tested possibly more than most other sciences because of religious nutcases screaming that it isn't any good. It has been tested extensively and has not been found wanting. The only people who ""find it wanting"" are those that have a religious reason for ""wanting"" it not to be true. It's funny that you say this now. I've been begging you and Archie to get real pretty much since I started posting here. You guys really are off in your own reality and have no idea what the one that non-fundamentalists see is like. Science teachers can't fix willful delusion any more than they can fix willful ignorance. Not likely. Where's the geological evidence for a flood? How did light exist without the sun? Where did the energy for the plants come from if the sun didn't exist yet? I keep asking these questions, yet I never get an answer... Time for another hint: Geology is not Darwinism. Cosmology is not Darwinism. Astronomy is not Darwinism. Geology is science. Cosmology is science. Astronomy is science. Biology is science. ""Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution."" --Theo Dobzhansky Didn't I already kick your XXX on this topic? Darwinism is as much a religion as is my desire to play basketball when I get the chance. I've already played twice this week, so does that make me a devout follower of the religion of basketball? Do I practice Naismithism? Can you give any reason that we should be mad at science instead of being mad at Christianity for trying to pass off information that clearly is not true? Bullspit. Not many Christian cults worldwide take the Bible literally anymore. An inordinate proportion of Southern U.S. cults do out of sheer willful ignorance of the facts. This is funny: we're saying that the Bible is infallible, but that the Bible -- which is written by men -- is fallible. Have you ever heard of the Chicago Statement? If not, look it up. You're saying the same thing, and it's just as ridiculous. Lie. Retract that immediately. But you just said that atheists presupposed the infallibility of Darwinism. Does this mean that you've finally admitted that ""atheist"" and ""evolutionist"" are not synonyms, or are you just -- as it appears -- feeling so persecuted that your anger is preventing you from making a coherent argument? Or maybe it's an inability to make a coherent argument that's preventing you from making a coherent argument?","only-one-god-does-exist-when-comes-politics-western-world","10:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","52"

Good proof would be evidence that a mainstream Christian denomination has edited, or is considering editing, the book of Genesis from its Bible.

Most of mainstream Christianity chooses not to enter conflicts with Darwinists about it. I think atheism trying to separate Catholicism from AIG is incredibly arrogant. Why cant you focus on the Darwinism, and stay out of things that dont concern you? Unless of course, you agree with trebor and believe in an agenda to use Darwinism as a tool to destroy religion. Using books entitled How science shows that God does not exist, and flip flopping their meanings back and fourth at will is a big part of how it works, isn't it? AIGs creation museum set all kinds of attendance records in its first year. Guess who was a good percentage of its visitors? Did you guess Catholics? If not, maybe you should just focus on the Darwinism, and get away from subjects you know nothing about. I think you're making things up. Have the religious folk in your area edited the book of Genesis from their Bibles?","only-one-god-does-exist-when-comes-politics-western-world","03:24 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","56"
