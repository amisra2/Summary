In fact, it specifically describes nonrandom changes. Your blog author is a hack. What a shock. You specifically mention that the scientific community objected to the terms ""unsupervised"" and ""impersonal,"" and you some how think that helps your point? You don't think before you speak, do you?","Archangel","305185","As usual you ignore the actual point of the article, which is the quote of the Popes regarding evolution and Darwinism.

This website shows how much money the AIG kentucky is making http://lippard.blogspot.com/2006/12/...clines-by.html Of course, the 'money declinging' is due to the error of the person reviewing the 990 (a mistake he admits, since he is not an accountant), but it does show that AIG is whoring it's lies for money. The entire creation museum is built on lies. It misrepresents science from square one, and it presents itself AS science. This page here shows that the motivation is for 'the glory of God' http://blogs.answersingenesis.org/mu...reation-museum So, it has the guise of Christianity. It lies in the name of Christianity, It whores itself out sucking money from the Christians in the U.S. that are less educated ,making them think they are contributing to the 'glory of God'. This link here shows how they lie, and whore themselves out in the name of Christianity. You might want to hand wave it away as 'oh, just someone's opinion, but read up on it. It shows dishonesty on the part of AIG, for altering essays that refute them, taking out links to sources of information they find inconvinent http://www.noanswersingenesis.org.au...risy_henke.htm Now, those claims about the AIG have been documented.

"03-12-2008","11003",6,"pandion","305164","Nevertheless, Miller is a Christian and a Roman Catholic. He mentioned it in every speech that I have ever seen. And yet, you imply that you know more about Roman Catholicism than Miller does and that you know more about what Miller believes than Miller does. So, tell me. Do you know more about Roman Catholicism than I do? No he isn't. Do you actually read your own quotes? He was talking about ""scientism."" Given your poor understanding of the topic, I am not surprised that you believe that scientism is the same as science. Scientism is a particular philosophy to which I do not ascribe. In fact, I don't recall ever having met a single scientist who did. Read carefully and you should be able to understand that the Pope was presenting the view of science held by the philosophy of scientism. That is not the view of science held by most scientists that I have known or read. Yes. In fact he is. But you aren't a spokesman for Protestantism. Further, the Catholic Church teaches that parts of the Bible are not historical. Some examples are Genesis, Job, Jonah, Psalms and others. The Catholic Church was embarrassed by taking literal positions about the Bible in the past - the earth is not immovable nor is it the center of the universe. The Catholic Church prefers to stick to positions about faith and morals today. Creationism is not a dogma of the Roman Catholic Church.","marc9000","305488","Mentioning it and demonstrating it are two different things. There's no detail about Catholisicm in his book ""Finding Darwin's God"". His book that I took a lot of time to read shows no references to it. I couldn't say. You've made it clear in the past that you don't believe any of it - why do you take an interest in it? Unless of course, to downgrade it. Dawkins? Stenger? Talkorigins? Does the Pope agree with them all? Are you an American, does George W Bush speak for you? As an evolutionist, does Richard Dawkins speak for you? No, but outlines of Protestant beliefs about Biblical authority were in post #39, the one you ignored. How about Exodus, I wonder? Deuteronomy 34:7 says that Moses died at the age of 120 years, yet his eyes were not weak nor his strengh gone. I'm sure modern science can toss that out, does the Catholic church disregard that too? How about Genesis, 9:29 - ""Altogether, Noah lived 950 years, and then he died"". Does the Catholic church toss that one out? I'll bet Richard Dawkins, or electrolyte, could prove it false. Then there's this one, from Matthew 28:2; ""There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it. His appearance was like lightening, and his clothes were as white as snow"". Yes or no, what does the Catholic church think about that one? I'd just like to know where they draw the line - when to agree with atheists and when not to. Did Cardinal Ratzinger say that?

Is he the end all and be all of scriptural knowledge by any reliable standard at all? I agree that some parts of the bible are metaphorical, some are allegorical, and some are literal. There is nothing about the Creation account in Genesis that implies that it's anything but literal. God doesn't say things like and it was like the light was separating from the darkness, but that it happened. To deny the Genesis account of creation is to deny God Himself. At least that's how he will see it. He say's after all that we are either for Him or against Him; we either love Him or hate Him. You can't deny His word and claim to accept Him too.

Publicly professing one's faith is one way to demonstrate it. He also practices his faith openly, although he doesn't try to impose it on others against their wills like you do. The fact that there is no specific mention of Catholicism in his book is because the whole book is a reconciliation of his profession with his religion. He is an evolutionary biologist and he is a Roman Catholic. He has no perspective as a Protestant or a creationist. What he says about science and faith are from his perspective as a Roman Catholic. But since you have no idea of the tenets of Catholicism, you couldn't possible know that Miller is talking about his religious beliefs. He certainly isn't arguing for a literal Biblical interpretation or young earth creationism. He actually does a very good job of presenting the view of the Catholic Church in the matter, a view that is mainstream Christian and diametrically opposed to what AIG claims. And, of course, Miller also made it clear that he doesn't believe in any of it either. What I don't believe is your sort of claptrap. What I don't believe is that you are the purveyor of the one true faith. I attempt to downgrade attempts to present religious claptrap presented as if it were scientifically valid, or even reasonable. If you can't say, then how can you claim that you know more than Miller about Catholicism? That implies that you know more than I do. In fact, I probably know a bit more than Miller. Just how is it, do you think, that I came to have so many friends in the clergy of various religions? On some issues, certainly. One of those issues is the insanity of claiming that the earth is no more than 10,000 years old, that the report of the Garden of Eden or Noah's flood is anything more than an allegory, that the stories of Jonah or Job are more than mythological moral lessons. It just didn't happen. Certainly not. Does he speak for you? He is so stupid that he believes that the earth is about 6,000 years old and that there is no evidence for evolution. I agree with most American who feel that we are not as well off as we were 8 years ago. But 8 years ago, I was much better off than I was 16 years ago. Certainly not. Although he is an excellent author and has added new perspective to evolutionary biology, especially with his exchanges with Gould, I'm not all that into some of his ideas. The exchanges sharpened the ideas of both men and they had great respect for each other. But, of course, you are again being disingenuous. You are moving the goal posts. The question was whether Cardinal Ratzinger is the spokesman for the Catholic Church. Yes, he is. You can't escape you ignorance by pretending that the question was whether he spoke for me. By his position, Pope, he is by definition the spokesman for the Catholic Church. I am not the Catholic Church. Actually, I didn't see that post #39 needed a response since you posted my objections and then failed to answer any of them. Probably allegorical. Exodus certainly isn't historical, although there may be some basis in history. There doesn't seem to be any trace of Israelite slaves in Egypt nor any signs that a population as large as that claimed by the Bible ever wandered in the Sinai. Probably myth. Humans don't live that long. I bet they couldn't. There isn't any evidence one way or the other. It is common knowledge that the ages of ancient leaders were exaggerated to enhance their wisdom and authority. The Bible and Hebrew mythology isn't the only holy book where that took place. What does that have to do with the topic? Why do you keep moving to goal posts. Is it that you believe that if one word of the Bible is true, then it is all true? Is it that you believe that if one word if false then it is all false? So you don't know what allegories and morality stories are? Actually, the Catholic Church pretty much agrees with Matt 28:2. However, that isn't relevant to the whether any other book, chapter, verse, or phrase is literally true. The Catholic Church actually recognizes that Genesis represents the oral traditions of the Hebrews. That's why there are two creation stories. That's why there is some question about 2 pairs or 7 of any species. And, of course, the idea of clean v. unclean was defined in Leviticus, so it is reasonable to assume that Genesis was actually written after Leviticus and recounts older oral traditions. What does atheism have to do with this discussion? Why do you assume that science is the same as atheism? Actually, it is a matter of agreement with certain christian cults that hold that the Bible is all the truth that matters, religiously and scientifically. The line is actually drawn at reasonable and rational. You accept without evidence moral truths and ethics, and you accept reality that is supported by observation and testing. No. Actually it was his predecessor, John Paul II who admitted the error of the Catholic Church in claiming that the earth is the center of the universe. Took a few years, didn't it? But that is the nature of religion. Never admit an error even if you look foolish in not doing so. And John Paul II even said that evolution is more than a theory since it has been supported by observation, hypothesis, prediction, and testing to such an extent that it is no longer in doubt. Actually, that's pretty much what St. Augustin said about ignorant faith in the face of reality. But of course, St Augustin was a Roman Catholic and can be safely disregarded by more recent cults.","only-one-god-does-exist-when-comes-politics-western-world","12:50 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","86"
