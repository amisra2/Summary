I am responding to your posts with an iPhone so cut me some slack. As for the claim of necessarily too much gas to see a quasar, you're just wrong. That quasar would outshine the entire galaxy if it were actually part of it. You sound like a fool in here spouting these absurd claims. You clearly don't know what a quasar is and it is almost too funny to take that you are in here calling me an idiot. By the way, I take it from your tone you are starting to feel the sting a little bit. What's wrong, no longer the cool composed Zosimus you started out as? And as for Earth and Venus being tidally locked, that requires firstly, for them to be orbiting each other. Secondly, if there is a resonance that has developed due to billions of years of slight gravitational tugging, which i believe is likely the case, it still wouldn't be tidal locking. I realize this is likely semantics, but stop saying tidal locking when they clearly do not fit the definition. I don't care how many websites say they do, they're wrong.","Zosimus","471263","What does the method you are using to answer my posts have to do with anything? If you can't answer them well on an iPhone then don't use an iPhone. As for me being the ""...cool and composed Zosimus"" I think you need to go back and read my post #8 where I said flat out that I planned on being insulting. You think the quasar would outshine the entire galaxy if it were part of it. However your logic to reach this conclusion is severely lacking. Let's expand that logic. Quasars are extremely bright. How do you know they are bright? Because they are extremely far away and we wouldn't be able to see them if they weren't so bright. How do you know they are extremely far away? We know that because of the high redshift. But what about this galaxy that has a quasar in front of it? That quasar can't be in front of that galaxy. If it were, it would completely outshine the galaxy! How do you know it would outshine the galaxy? Because quasars are extremely bright (go back to the beginning). Wow that's some amazing logic, isn't it? Here's some logic for you:","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","12:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","361"

Never has there been an observed standard candle luminosity that did not agree with its red shift measurement. This is why we know quasars are far away, not because we know what their luminosity is. It really is this simple. So, if you want to refute Hubble's Law, you need to start here. This should be simple if the law is wrong. Find a single standard candle in the night sky that is not consistent with the law. You should also be able to do a better job of finding associated celestial objects that exhibit variable red shift, not using a few quasars which are well understood in terms of scale and mechanics, and then claiming that, ""See! There is a trail of dust there leading right to it!"" - all while ignoring the fact that there are trails of dust in many places with no quasars and many quasars that are not at the end of a trail of dust! The only thing that you have to use against Hubble's law is a few quasars that happen to fall behind galaxies. What about all the quasars that are high redshift and nowhere near any galaxy let alone a low red-shift one? If you really want to agree with Arp's argument and say that high red shift is associated with the young age of a quasar, then where did these other young quasars come from? Wouldn't you expect there to be a higher probability of finding one behind its parent galaxy rather than alone in space? How do they get away from their parent galaxies in this seeming defiance of gravity? How are they ejected in the first place? How does being young cause high red shift? The answer is, none of this makes sense and you have no answers for these questions. The only thing you have is a grudge against the Big Bang theory because it goes against your religious belief and you have a crush on some guy who's electrical fetish agrees with your beef against mainstream science. Give me a break, you look like a fool to everyone in here supporting things like comets being ejected by Jupiter. By the way, I noticed, just like many other subjects, you have abandoned your claim that Earth and Venus are tidally locked. What's wrong - you just get tired of looking like a fool? You don't want to continue to claim they are locked? Too funny! You would think that for someone to claim to know so much, with so much certainty, you would at least be able to be consistent with the definitions of what you are claiming to know so much about. You can't even get that right, let alone the minute mechanics of the subject required to win a debate. But seriously, I would like to see you try to answer the above questions about your understanding of what quasars actually are. This should be fun.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","09:19 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","362"

Smarter than you, smarter than him, smarter than anyone. One day you pay her a visit, expecting to be impressed. Outside her house you see a white car - only let's imagine you've never seen a car before. So there's this white box-thing with wheels and windows and mirrors and such. Inside you can see well-worn seats, pedals, a map book and a couple of empty crisp-packets. On the window the seats are facing away from are stickers depicting various attractions from around the country. The lady has a gravel driveway, and you can clearly see ruts leading from the wheels back down the drive and out of sight. Curious, you lift the flap at the front and see all kinds of complicated stuff connected to the wheels. Stepping back, you also notice that the bright sunlight is reflecting off the top of the thing through the leaded front window of the house and is making quite a fetching pattern on the ceiling. The lady comes out of the house. After exchanging pleasantries and feeling a little intimidated, you ask her what this white thing is. She replies: ""That's a thing for making pretty patterns of light on the ceiling of my front room."" Part of you feels obligated to believe her. Your friend, whom you trust, told you she's ten times smarter and a hundred times more knowledgable than anyone else, and the thing unquestionably does create quite a pleasing effect on the ceiling of her front room when it reflects the sunlight. But believing her would mean leaving so much else - all those features that only, say, some sort of passenger-bearing vehicle would have a reason to possess - unexplained. You would have to dismiss them as coincidence, believe that somehow, in building a thing to reflect light through a window, its maker had inadvertently created a stupendously detailed and consistent - yet wrong - impression of a highly specific and quite different function. Then a neighbour, overhearing your discussion, comes over. She explains to you all about different cars, about how the roads they travel on (and how those roads have changed over the years), aerodynamics, load-bearing, fuel efficiency and performance requirements impose constraints on their shape, size and weight - and how the attractiveness of a car to buyers can fight against those considerations sometimes. She shows you her collection of old cars - she doesn't have one of every model ever made, and the oldest are more rust than anything else, but you can clearly see how they've developed over time from the earliest to the latest. ""No,"" says the first lady, ""Don't listen to her. That's all just a theory. Nobody has ever seen one of these 'cars' move."" You're walking back from the neighbour's house at this point, and she has to raise her voice a little to be heard over the traffic. ""All the things she says make it look like a vehicle are just her biased interpretation. After all, I'm looking at the exact same facts and I see something for reflecting light through my window. And I've got these two books, and the first book says someone will do something one day, and in the second book it says a character who read the first book did the thing the first book said someone would do, and that proves the first book is magic and everything in it must be true, and one of the things it says is that the thing outside my house is for reflecting light through windows. Disprove that , if you can."" That's why I believe evolution from a common ancestor happened.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","06:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","363"
