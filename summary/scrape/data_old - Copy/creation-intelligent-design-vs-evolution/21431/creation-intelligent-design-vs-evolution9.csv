"12-21-2012","21431",9,"Easyrider","467700","If you're questioning the deity (or pre-incarnation deity) of Jesus Christ, I have reams of scriptural evidences to support it. Let me know if you want to see them. Jesus is "" THE (divine) Angel of the Lord"" in the OT, where Angel means messenger. Jesus is the ""I AM"" in the Burning Bush account in Exodus. Evidences of this in the following link. Angel of the LORD Justin Martyr declared ""Our Christ conversed with Moses out of the bush, in the appearance of fire. And Moses received great strength from Christ, who spake to him in the appearance of fire."" Irenaeus wrote ""The Scripture is full of the Son of Gods appearing: sometimes to talk and eat with Abraham, at other times to instruct Noah about the measures of the ark; at another time to seek Adam; at another time to bring down judgment upon Sodom; then again, to direct Jacob in the way; and again, to converse with Moses out of the bush."" 2 is fine with me. God said in advance in Genesis that he was going to create man in the image and likeness of God, and that a knowledge of good and evil was one of the goals. So I'll ask you a question: How do you create man with free will (as opposed to a pre-programmed robot) and at the same time not have evil as one of the behaviors that man can choose to do?","Zosimus","467796","I think you have a very black-and-white view of the world. For example, imagine that I run into a homeless man. What are the choices I have in regards to this person? I can aid him, I can ignore him, I can kill him and rob him of what little he has collected from begging, and probably a horde of other choices (such as trying to aid him without giving him money, etc.). So to claim that people cannot make choices without giving them the option to do evil is not true. But to make sure we're on the same page, let me sum up your argument: God (aka Jesus) exists, has always existed, and always will exist. For countless eons this being was completely alone without even a universe existing for him to do anything with. While doing nothing but thinking and using his eyes to regard the vast emptiness around him, he suddenly decided to create the entire universe out of nothing complete with angels and humans. His primary motive in so doing was to have these newly created fans cluster around his freshly-created throne and adore him for all eternity. Unfortunately due to a personality quirk he decided that these things must have ""free will"" and so he created evil so that they could decide not to adore him for eternity but rather spend their time plundering, raping, and murdering one another. Then, because of another quirk of his personality, he would decide to save some of them (but not others) but felt that there should really be a price to pay for all of their ""sins"" against which he had established laws to compel them not to do things he had previously created for them to do. So he had a part of his personality be born to a virgin in Jerusalem for the express purpose of showing off to them that he could do it perfectly whereas the rest of them (who he had created) couldn't do it perfectly. Then he arranged for his other personality to be brutally slaughtered and to suffer a horrible, degrading death including abandoning it in the moment of its cruelest suffering causing it to exclaim, ""My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"" And meanwhile whenever God isn't amusing himself by having bets with Satan over whether or not Job will curse him if he lets Satan kill his entire family, steal his life's work, and torture him with diseases (that God created so that Satan could have something to torture people with) he is putting the final touches on a lake of endless fire that he plans to cast those people who he created with an evil streak into in order to enjoy watching them suffer for all eternity for not having chosen to cluster around his throne and sing praises to him for endless eons. Now I ask you: Is the above an accurate or an inaccurate portrayal of your faith? If it is inaccurate, please state clearly why and make the appropriate corrections.

"12-21-2012","21431",9,"Databed","467707","You are taking a few examples from clinical studies of bad test methods as they apply to medical diagnosis and blanketing it across all of science as if one example of poor reasoning casts doubt on all reasoning. I hope you are capable of realizing how dumb that is. As far as the type of evidence for evolution, look at it this way. In a crime investigation, labs use tire impressions to prove that a particular tire was at a particular place within a particular time interval. Happens all the time. Now, say you have one thousand beat up, worn tires, each with distinctive cuts, gravel in the tread, wear patterns, etc. In order to prove a theory, you need to prove that any combination of one or more tires was at a particular place at a particular time, etc etc. So you set out to prove that any one of the tires was there and to your amazement, you prove that ALL the tires were there. That's the kind of evidence that we have for evolution. Now, evolution is a simple theory that explains a LOT of things we see in biology. You are going to find lots of studies related to evolution. However, there are no studies in modern times that serve to confirm or refute that evolution occurs as the process of descent from a single organism through natural selection. The studies you are looking for don't exist or if they do, they failed and never got submitted.","Zosimus","467797","I think you have a very bad view of 1) the purpose of this thread and 2) what science is and how it works. First of all, my argument is (and has always been) that you believe in evolution because you are atheist and for no other reason. You claim that there are mountains of evidence in support of evolution. Despite this, I have yet to see you post even one link. Are you certain that all of this evidence doesn't exist in your own mind and nowhere else? Second, let's examine science: What it is, what it aims to do, and how well it works. Science is a philosophy. Despite what many people have claimed, there is no specific scientific method. Science only stipulates that all information comes through the senses - they claim that the only way to know that swans are white, for example, is to go and look at a swan and to see it with your eyes. Now in the past science claimed that all swans were white because scientists had not seen swans of any other color. However, after many years they found black swans in Australia and they had egg on their faces. David Hume was among the people who had pointed out the logical defects in science. His observations are now known as the ""problem of induction."" How many white swans do you need to see before you know that all swans are white? There is no satisfactory answer to this question. Hume's proposed solution (abandoning logic) is science's true solution, but it doesn't have a nice ring to it so they just tried ignoring the problem. Karl Popper is the only one I know of who really seriously addressed the problem. He proposed ""falsificationism"" as the standard by which science should work. Since science can't prove anything true, science should stick to what it can do: proving things false. As such, he claimed, science should accept theories that are highly falsifiable in the sense that they make many testable predictions and then work to test them as rigorously as possible. Unfortunately for Popper, he criticized Darwinism heavily as being unfalsifiable (or nearly so). He was one of the most prominent people to claim that peacock's tails refuted Darwinism and when sexual selection was advanced as a solution to the problem he essentially said that with enough ad hoc hypotheses you can explain away any experimental finding at all. None of this sat well with those who needed evolution in order to have a coherent worldview. So they did what most empiricists do when they are in trouble: They turned to mathematics to help them out, ignoring the fact that mathematics isn't empiricial. So mathematics suggested statistics as a possible solution to science's shortcomings. Drawing from Bayes' theorm. That fine Presbyterian minister and avid pool player had suggested that you could determine if a line bisecting a pool table really was in the center by throwing billiard balls out on the table in such a way that they could land anywhere. He proposed starting by guessing that the line was in the center and adjusting based on probability. Frequentist statisticians were incensed at the idea of starting with a guess and those two camps have still never fully reconciled. To put it in layman's terms, imagine that you are running tests on, let's say, the speed of light. You have already tested it 4 times and you have come up with certain numbers. What are the chances that the next test will come out the same? Well, say statisticians, let's compare the test to fishing socks out of a sock drawer. Imagine we have 5 pairs of socks in a sock drawer and we fish them out one at a time. The first 4 times we have come up with a red pair - what are the chances that the last pair is another color? Well, figure the mathematicians, what we do is assume that the last pair is another color (red, for example), and calculate the chances that we would see the results we have seen. The chances will be the same (an assumption I consider dubious, but let's go with it for now). The chance of pulling out the first red pair is 4/5 or 80 percent. The chance of pulling out the second red pair is 3/4 so the chance of pulling out both is 3/5 (the 4s cancel). The chance of pulling out the third pair is 2/3 so now you are at 2/5 (the 3s cancel) and the chance of pulling out the last pair is 1/2 so now you are at 1/5 (the 2s cancel). So statisticians will now argue that there is an 80 percent chance that the next result (usually called the n+1) will be the same as those previously found. So we can say that we are 80 percent certain that the speed of light will be the same the next time we test it. Of course this doesn't fully solve the problem, does it? I mean if we test the half-life of uranium 100 times and we find it consistent we can say that the chances of the half-life changing on the 101st time is only 1 percent, right? Assuming we agree with the assumptions (I personally don't) will that enable us to say that the half-life will stay the same for the next 4.5 billion years? Or that it was the same for 4.5 billion years in the past? Work out the math on that and you'll find it not particularly impressive. Imagine that you have a sock drawer with 4.5 billion socks in it and the first 100 you pull out are red. Does that guarantee that ALL the socks in the drawer are red? Hardly. So science now uses the believed-magical 95 percent statistical confidence level to work these problems out. Why 95 percent? Why not 94 percent or 96 percent? Well, really there's no reason: It's just an arbitrary number that exists to permit science to announce victory with nothing much backing it up. Of course there are various problems with this method. The first one I have already pointed out - it doesn't work. The 95 percent statistical confidence level results in 80 percent of published research findings being false and later refuted. This would be embarrassing to me, but science doesn't care as they have politicians and the press in its pocket. The second problem is a more theoretical one: Bayes insisted that the ball should go out onto the pool table in such a way that [b]it could land anywhere[b] but obviously science can't take samples of, for example, the half-life of uranium in such a way that we might randomly get the results for the half-life of uranium as it was 2 billion years ago in the same way that socks pulled out of a sock drawer could come out in any order they wanted - willy nilly. Science attempts to solve these problems by putting 5 or 10 percent on something based on statistical assumptions. I'm still not impressed. Finally your tire sample metaphor is really flawed and shows that not only do you not understand science, nor Darwinism, you don't even understand forensics (which is another seriously flawed scientific endeavor). Let's look at fingerprints, for example. Science assures us that no two people have the same fingerprints and that science can easily identify if you were at the scene of a crime by getting your fingerprints and matching it with fingerprints at the scene of the crime. How does this work? First of all, you should know that there are as many as 150 ridge characteristics in your fingerprint. Fingerprint experts examine the fingerprint against your fingerprint in order to obtain a match. Assuming that science is right, 150 points of match would be very, very good, wouldn't it? Sure. But experts rarely find that many matches. In fact, there is no established standard on how many points of coincidence there should be. At one time Scotland had a requirement that a print should show at least 16 matching points (see BBC NEWS | UK | Scotland | Court fingerprint system scrapped ) but that's been scrapped and the US doesn't require that anyway. Experts often claim a match on as little as 6 coinciding points. So what are the numbers? How many people in a city the size of Los Angeles (4 million plus) are there that would have fingerprints with as much as 6 matches with yours? Or seven, ten, or any other number you can pull out. What are the odds? The answer is simple: No one knows because no studies have ever been done. Nevertheless experts will go on the stand and say that they are certain the fingerprints belong to the accused and then the guy goes to jail. So don't come to me saying that some expert can ""prove"" that the fingerprints belong to you or the tire tracks or whatever. That's the kind of stuff you see on TV for entertainment rather than in the real world. Fingerprints, tire track matching, and other supposed forensic methods have never been exposed to the kind of scrutiny that DNA had to undergo (see Faulty Fingerprints ). ""Since 1995, Collaborative Testing Services, a company that evaluates the reliability and performance of fingerprint labs, has administered an annual and voluntary test. It sends fingerprint labs a test that includes eight to twelve pairs of prints that examiners confirm or reject as matches. The pairs usually consist of complete, not partial prints, making identifications easier than the real situations examiners face. Nevertheless the error rate has varied from 3% to a dismal 20%."" ------------------------ Isn't that sad? Even under idealized situations forensic science finds it very hard to reach what I would call a ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" scenario. Fortunately for the US justice system people who know these things are usually excluded from jury pools. Otherwise the US would be hard pressed to have the highest per capita incarceration rate in the world. P.S. I reiterate my request that you post some kind of links to back up your claim that the evidence for evolution is like finding all the tire tracks in the world at the scene of the crime.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","12:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","129"
