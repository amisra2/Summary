Say you cut down a tree. You can count back rings to determine that it sprouted in 1840. Tree 1 1840-2013 Now look at some older wood, possibly some that was used in an old turn of the century lodge. You match its rings up with the new tree to determine its outermost rings correspond to the inner rings of Tree 1 and determine its life spanned from 1757-1905. Any time you have a severe drought or any climactic event it leaves an impression in the tree rings. You need quite an overlap to develop a reliable fingerprint and you need similar wood from similar areas (obviously). You don't have to start the process by going out and cutting down a tree. There are countless sources of old wood that have a known origin that you can start with. In the case of a violin which you are trying to date as opposed to connecting two chronologies together, you have no way of knowing at which stage of the tree's life the rings you find are from. It could be from the beginning or from the end of the tree's life. Since tree can grow for a long time, centuries, this can result in very uncertain measurements. However, one thing you do know is that it can't be older than any year-ring it contains. That's why it is absurd when the first article Zosimus posted claims to have dated the violin to within a span of just a few years.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","03:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","287"

Now with a trained eye you might be able to filter out the noise with enough samples, but that's skill not science. You can write a program to do any procedure you can objectively define, and if a dendrochronology program can't be written there is no objective procedure known to filter the noise.

Your growth rings always overlap. Otherwise, you get lost and can no longer work your way back any further. There will inevitably be some areas that are easier to identify than others. Many chronologies can be constructed and sometimes you need to fill some gaps with missing data - maybe you even make a couple of guesses just so you can keep going, but you will always associate with your chronology a level of confidence and you will always connect you data in the end or your older dates will not be valid. Keep in mind too, these are not just purely linear sequences. Many ""stacked"" chronologies can be associated with each other to provide a better basis for comparison. You are right. There are many factors that come into play. This is why when you present a case study where you get a range of possible dates as Zosimus has done, I don't count that against the science itself. The dating was poorly performed with several chronologies and too many assumptions. However, there are many sources of reliable data out there. Several of the great lakes have old growth logs that have sunk to the bottom from 300 to 400 years ago. They are the same wood, from the same area and even cut at the same time. This is a reliable source of growth rings to study. There are many old structures that also contain a wealth of data within the growth rings of the timbers used top construct them. There is a small variety of tree which can grown in upper elevations and in addition, wood is preserved well in low oxygen, cold climates. If you count all over the world, there are many many sources out there to obtain reliable data from to use in creating calibration curves for carbon dating.

I issue you yet another challenge I am sure you will ignore. Explain to me why ERV's are not good enough to support evolution. PLEASE, don't talk any more about clinical studies. I wish you would understand that the evidence for evolution is nothing like the statistical evidence used in trials studies.

Popperian falsification is far superior to Bayesian statistics and it can be proved that most claimed research findings are false. The high rate of nonreplication (lack of confirmation) of research discoveries is a consequence of the convenient, yet ill-founded strategy of claiming conclusive research findings solely on the basis of a single study assessed by formal statistical significance, typically for a p-value less than 0.05. However, it appears you'd rather talk about ERVs and nested hierarchies. Specifically you have theory (E) that predicts findings (F). When you locate said findings you think the theory has been confirmed. Really, however, the only thing you have done is engaged in a classic logical fallacy - to wit: E=>F, F, therefore E. This is a classic example of the ""affirming the consequent"" fallacy. Well, let's pretend that your theory is scientific and think for a few moments on what things might be found that might disprove your theory. Imagine, for example, that we found an ERV in humans and another ape (not chimpanzee) that were very similar. Yet when we checked in chimps they did not have the same ERV. If that were found, we would easily be able to seriously question the theory that similar ERVs are the result of sharing a common ancestor. Can such a thing be found? Certainly - all we have to do is to go to Spread Of Endogenous Retrovirus K Is Similar In The DNA Of Humans And Rhesus Monkeys where we find that humans and rhesus monkeys share a very similar ERV that cannot be found in chimpanzees. As you can read in the article, Rhesus monkeys supposedly seperated from chimpanzees some 25 million years ago and chimps and humans supposedly seperated some 5-7 million years ago. Yet this finding throws a spanner in the works. Why don't chimps have the same ERV that we share with rhesus monkeys? Well, of course, Darwinism is never to be foiled. Suddenly we'll find that we're not descended from chimps at all, but rather we are descended from rhesus monkeys. Or there will be two theories claiming to be Darwin's true path - both refuting each other, but united in insisting that evolution is unquestionably correct. Darwinism will never be seriously questioned because it's not a scientific theory - it's an article of faith for true believers (like you). All this finding shows to me is what I've already said - evolution relies on constant ad hoc hypotheses to avoid falsification and therefore cannot lay claim to being an evidence-based theory of life.

Palmer has since documented a similar problem in several other contested subject areas. 'Once I realized that selective reporting is everywhere in science, I got quite depressed,' Palmer told me. 'As a researcher, youre always aware that there might be some nonrandom patterns, but I had no idea how widespread it is.' In a recent review article, Palmer summarized the impact of selective reporting on his field: 'We cannot escape the troubling conclusion that someperhaps manycherished generalities are at best exaggerated in their biological significance and at worst a collective illusion nurtured by strong a-priori beliefs often repeated.'""

You make this claim, but this claim is unverifiable and suspect. Considering that science cannot accurately measure and demonstrate things we can easily see in front of our eyes on a daily basis, how in the world can you seriously make the claim that you can know about things that were going on 5,000 years ago? The bottom line is simple: The theory made certain predictions. An experiment was done. The results were surprising, i.e., not in line with the predictions. Later the predictions were modified in such a way as to make it seem that it was in line with the theory when it wasn't. Now you want to claim victory but sorry - I'm not buying it. P.S.

In a recent review article, Palmer summarized the impact of selective reporting on his field: 'We cannot escape the troubling conclusion that someperhaps manycherished generalities are at best exaggerated in their biological significance and at worst a collective illusion nurtured by strong a-priori beliefs often repeated.'"" Finally, you claim that humans have been purging ERV-K because you have 5000+ year old DNA. The answer is, of course, that you think you have 5,000+ year old DNA. You make this claim, but this claim is unverifiable and suspect. Considering that science cannot accurately measure and demonstrate things we can easily see in front of our eyes on a daily basis, how in the world can you seriously make the claim that you can know about things that were going on 5,000 years ago? The bottom line is simple: The theory made certain predictions. An experiment was done. The results were surprising, i.e., not in line with the predictions. Later the predictions were modified in such a way as to make it seem that it was in line with the theory when it wasn't. Now you want to claim victory but sorry - I'm not buying it. P.S. I still think you're missing the point. I'm not here trying to disprove evolution - I'm here trying (and I believe, succeeding) in proving that you believe in evolution because you made up your mind before any of this evidence came around. All findings that have been made are inconclusive about evolution. P.P.S. Science doesn't need to develop new antibiotics or vaccines. Garlic annihilates all comers, as humans have known for thousands of years. Even super antibiotic resistant MRSA is killed instantly.

Let's ignore the fact that the above isn't a sentence and delve into this logic more deeply. Let's do so by imaginging a devout Marxist who is reading a newspaper next to me. He says, ""Millions have tried to disprove Marxism, but no one has succeeded."" He then proceeds to go to every news story in the paper and he easily draws out from the stories how the story is evidence of the class bias of the newspaper. Even the stories not printed are confirmations for the theory of Marxism, in his estimation. Everywhere he looks he sees confirmations of his theory. There has never been any observation that does not fit with the theory of Marxism. What does that prove, really? Nothing except that his theory accommodates all data. Let's compare this theory to Einstein's Theory of Relativity, which predicted gravitational lensing of light. This situation is quite different because the outcome was predicted ahead of time, people unenlightened by the theory would have predicted something else, and so when lensing was observed people were understandably far more impressed by that than by a Marxist (or evolutionist) twisting every finding into support for his pet theory through the use of ad hoc hypotheses. From Sir Karl Popper ""Science as Falsification,"" 1963 The most characteristic element in this situation seemed to me the incessant stream of confirmations, of observations which ""verified"" the theories in question; and this point was constantly emphasize by their adherents. A Marxist could not open a newspaper without finding on every page confirming evidence for his interpretation of history; not only in the news, but also in its presentation which revealed the class bias of the paper and especially of course what the paper did not say. The Freudian analysts emphasized that their theories were constantly verified by their ""clinical observations."" As for Adler, I was much impressed by a personal experience. Once, in 1919, I reported to him a case which to me did not seem particularly Adlerian, but which he found no difficulty in analyzing in terms of his theory of inferiority feelings, Although he had not even seen the child. Slightly shocked, I asked him how he could be so sure. ""Because of my thousandfold experience,"" he replied; whereupon I could not help saying: ""And with this new case, I suppose, your experience has become thousand-and-one-fold."" What I had in mind was that his previous observations may not have been much sounder than this new one; that each in its turn had been interpreted in the light of ""previous experience,"" and at the same time counted as additional confirmation. What, I asked myself, did it confirm? No more than that a case could be interpreted in the light of a theory. But this meant very little, I reflected, since every conceivable case could be interpreted in the light Adler's theory, or equally of Freud's. Now you claim that there are several methods of radioactive dating that are accurate out to the 5,000 year old timescale. I assume that you refer to carbon dating since we are unlikely to find radioactive argon in DNA samples. A simple look at Is Carbon Dating Accurate? shows that the answer is basically no. Scientists refer to C-14 dating if it supports their preconceived (aka biased) notions, but otherwise they just ignore it. And as for your claim that 5,000 years is nothing, I picked that date to cater to the young earth advocates (if any) in the forum. As for refuting evolution - I hardly need do that. The mere existence of the peacock refutes Darwinism outright. Finally, as for poking fun at garlic, and ignoring medical studies like Antibacterial activity of allicin from Allium sativum against antibiotic resistant uropathogens - ISPUB the mechanics of garlic administration is simple: Taking garlic pills is problematic because stomach acid destroys alliinase, the simple solution has been to pair the garlic with an acid neutralizer. There are already several products on the market (for example Garli-eze ) that can produce the active ingredient in simulated tests.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","11:10 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","796"

The collection of 66 books that the Christian Church recognized as being inspired speaks as the very words of God in many places. ""Thus says the Lord"" occurs over 400 times in the Old Testament.

I said the prayer, became Christian and then went to their church where they spent their time babbling, frothing and rolling around on the floor. I thought, These guys are crazy, and I never went back. Now despite having told me before that I was saved (forever, and that nothing could separate me from the love of God) they later told me I was going to hell. Does that make me Christian? You decide. I do not believe that God created the entire universe out of nothing in six days time. Even if God had done such a thing, that would make him responsible for all the evil in the world since by that act of creation he would be responsible for the acts of all things he created unless someone is implying that God tried to create everything perfectly, but failed.","Easyrider","467413","Looks like you never got ""born again"" in the Holy Spirit (John chapter 3).

If you had received the Holy Spirit you would have known it and there wouldn't have been any doubt in your mind. I doubt you're saved.

I meant Rev. 4:8 not 18. In this we find that in heaven everyone stands round the throne of God praising him. While that may sound like great fun to you, it's not up my alley. You didn't like the link for bara. Fine. Try Old Testament Word Studies in which we find that bara means ""create, cut, shape, perforate, and strengthen, make well, make grow"" Now perhaps you think that it means to create out of nothing. Fine - believe as you wish. However, you cannot claim that the Bible supports this meaning. In the beginning of the creation story, for example, the spirit of the LORD is moving upon some waters and he exclaims, "" Sea la luz! "" (which for some reason you translate as ""Let there be light"" as if light was always going to be and he just let it happen. Strange...). Nevertheless it indicates that before God created there was something there that he was creating from. Now maybe you can argue that God created those waters before the story of creation really gets going. Still, you can argue anything you want. Now in Genesis 1:27 we see that God created man (also with the word bara) yet we see that man was formed out of the dust of the ground - so again, you cannot claim that bara means to create out of nothing when used to refer to the acts of divine beings. But let's say, for the sake of argument, that before he was born Jesus (aka Jehovah) really did create the entire universe out of nothing. If that is the case, then he has surely also created evil. Now perhaps you will argue that every being has free will, yet surely God in his omniscience could have said, ""I'm about to create Cain... but I see that he will team up with Satan and kill Abel and that will be bad... so maybe I'll skip making him."" But he did no such thing, so while you may be eager to let God wash his hands of the responsibility, we can still easily see that if the standard Christian story of creation is true, then God has created and is directly responsible for evil and that he knew ahead of time what he was doing. Now as for your links proving Mormonism wrong, logically, the only thing that is proved therein is that the author has no understanding of Mormon theology. Mormons believe, for example, that Jesus achieved exaltation after his earth life. Yet, you may ask, who exalted Jesus? Who saved him? Surely you and Mormons agree that Jesus saved himself - that he needed no expiacin (which for some unfathomable reason you call at-one-ment) and so the supposed infinite regression problem exists only in the mind of the author of the paper. So again, I challenge you to solve the two problems I have set for you: 1. How do you account for the existence of evil? This is the prime philosophical challenge for Christianity. 2. How do you account for your lack of belief in Mormonism, considering that their theology generates a greater present value calculation than that of your own faith? P.S.

And Moses received great strength from Christ, who spake to him in the appearance of fire."" Irenaeus wrote ""The Scripture is full of the Son of Gods appearing: sometimes to talk and eat with Abraham, at other times to instruct Noah about the measures of the ark; at another time to seek Adam; at another time to bring down judgment upon Sodom; then again, to direct Jacob in the way; and again, to converse with Moses out of the bush."" 2 is fine with me. God said in advance in Genesis that he was going to create man in the image and likeness of God, and that a knowledge of good and evil was one of the goals. So I'll ask you a question: How do you create man with free will (as opposed to a pre-programmed robot) and at the same time not have evil as one of the behaviors that man can choose to do?","Zosimus","467796","I think you have a very black-and-white view of the world. For example, imagine that I run into a homeless man. What are the choices I have in regards to this person? I can aid him, I can ignore him, I can kill him and rob him of what little he has collected from begging, and probably a horde of other choices (such as trying to aid him without giving him money, etc.). So to claim that people cannot make choices without giving them the option to do evil is not true. But to make sure we're on the same page, let me sum up your argument: God (aka Jesus) exists, has always existed, and always will exist. For countless eons this being was completely alone without even a universe existing for him to do anything with. While doing nothing but thinking and using his eyes to regard the vast emptiness around him, he suddenly decided to create the entire universe out of nothing complete with angels and humans. His primary motive in so doing was to have these newly created fans cluster around his freshly-created throne and adore him for all eternity. Unfortunately due to a personality quirk he decided that these things must have ""free will"" and so he created evil so that they could decide not to adore him for eternity but rather spend their time plundering, raping, and murdering one another. Then, because of another quirk of his personality, he would decide to save some of them (but not others) but felt that there should really be a price to pay for all of their ""sins"" against which he had established laws to compel them not to do things he had previously created for them to do. So he had a part of his personality be born to a virgin in Jerusalem for the express purpose of showing off to them that he could do it perfectly whereas the rest of them (who he had created) couldn't do it perfectly. Then he arranged for his other personality to be brutally slaughtered and to suffer a horrible, degrading death including abandoning it in the moment of its cruelest suffering causing it to exclaim, ""My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"" And meanwhile whenever God isn't amusing himself by having bets with Satan over whether or not Job will curse him if he lets Satan kill his entire family, steal his life's work, and torture him with diseases (that God created so that Satan could have something to torture people with) he is putting the final touches on a lake of endless fire that he plans to cast those people who he created with an evil streak into in order to enjoy watching them suffer for all eternity for not having chosen to cluster around his throne and sing praises to him for endless eons. Now I ask you: Is the above an accurate or an inaccurate portrayal of your faith? If it is inaccurate, please state clearly why and make the appropriate corrections.

We don't know what existed before this universe, only that this universe had a beginning. You're not recounting what I believe, but what you choose to believe. I hope this gets better. Is this around the same time as when your forefathers magically emerged as swamp slime? You need a lot of help with your theology. And you STILL have not provided a decent answer on how you, as God, would create man with free will and at the same time not allow him to do evil if he so chooses.

You create it to take actions according to a certain algorithm. In neither case does the created being have free will. Accordingly it is not possible that God created humans ex nihilo to have free will. Additionally, I note that you talked about swamp slime in your post. Apparently you felt so threatened and overwhelmed by the argument employed that you had to engage in wrong-headed personal attacks against me because you couldn't find a coherent reply. To sum up: I have been the one in this thread constantly attacking belief in Darwinism. For you to claim that my forefathers magically emerged as swamp slime makes no sense in light of the thread. Could I interest you in a remedial reading comprehension class? My rates are quite reasonable.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","11:40 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","169"
