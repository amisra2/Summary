"12-15-2012","21431",6,"Zosimus","467502","Databed, you couldnt own a rock even if you won the lottery. Ive already posted showing false positives for natural selection but I guess that doesnt convince you. Let me guess NOTHING AT ALL would convince you that evolution is false because its part of your religious worldview, isnt it? Or maybe you dont like to admit that evolution is a subset of biology so you think that looking at medical and biological studies are useless. Heres a simple study proving that Darwinism is false: Epigenesis: The New Biology | Dr. Pulos Intelligent rats were bred and placed into two cages. One cage had lots of interesting toys and opportunities to explore and learn whereas the other cage was boring with nothing but food and cage. The conclusion of the study was simple: The offspring of the rats in the interesting cage were more intelligent than their parents for three generations in a row whereas the offspring in the boring cage were less intelligent for three generations in a row. Remember, of course, that they all had the same genes . It was just a matter of which genes got expressed in the following generations. This explanation perfectly explains Darwins finches without the need for multiplying factors. How does 'natural selection' account for the epigenesis study? It can't because all the rats bred normally and had the same genes. Accordingly the theory of natural selection cannot account for the world as we know it.","Databed","467547","First off, you have yet to supply a ""false positive"" that is relevant to your claims in post #64. I am still waiting. Secondly, your newly referenced study is that of epigenetics. Just because you were duped into believing by the article you provided that epigenetics is at all at odds with evolution does not mean that I should have to waste my time explaining to you what epigenetics actually is. Why don't you go read up on it and stop bringing down the average intelligence of the members of this forum.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","03:14 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","82"
"12-15-2012","21431",6,"Databed","467548","Well thank you for that. As far as his claim goes, I would be very embarrassed if he came up with some evidence that made me think that evolution is wrong. And come on, are you, Freedom, buying his argument that evolution must be false because 90% of RESEARCH studies are biased? By the way, I don't doubt that the paper he provided has some validity and is at least partially true.","Freedom","467552","That would be nice to find, except one rarely finds evidence for negatives. No, I don't doubt that some bias exists in every research paper but that's why they keep the discussion sections away from conclusions and data. There is a bias in what people choose to study but that doesn't inevitably corrupt their conclusions. There are people who have told me all knowledge is merely expression of bias produced by individual perception and that it is nothing more than human arrogance when someone claims to know anything. Under such philosophical basis science cannot exist and for people who honestly believe that it doesn't. It would be news to me, I have never before heard of gene expression being so enduring that it could ever be inheritable. Even if it was that would simply be one more inherited characteristic it would not change the overall mechanics.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","06:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","84"

"12-17-2012","21431",6,"Easyrider","467505","Revelation. And there is no 4:18 in Revelation. Your source for your definition admits he has no formal education in theology or Hebrew, and he also admits many of his definitions are counter to established scholarship. And since I've also done my own investigations in Hebrew and Greek and have several degrees in Biblical theology, I can't give your source any credibility. Why is Mormonism a cult? Check it out yourself: A logical proof that Mormonism is false|Mormonism teaches an infinite regression of causes. | Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry Mormonism, LDS, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day saints | Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry You should also read the sub-links in the main link just above. If you've read what I just provided you can no long claim you have seen nothing. I'll tell you something else - if you're waiting for science to reveal God to you then you may have a long wait. The revelations of God are spiritually discerned, and the carnal mind cannot comprehend them. From Matthew chapter 16: 15 But what about you? Jesus asked. Who do you say I am? 16 Simon Peter answered, You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God. 17 Jesus replied, Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven . Also note 1 Corinthians 2:14 - ""The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are spiritually discerned."" If you wish to truly comprehend the things of God and who he is and what he does, then I recommend you submit yourself to Christ as your Lord and Savior for the remission of your sins, and ask for the Holy Spirit.","Zosimus","467631","You're right. I meant Rev. 4:8 not 18. In this we find that in heaven everyone stands round the throne of God praising him. While that may sound like great fun to you, it's not up my alley. You didn't like the link for bara. Fine. Try Old Testament Word Studies in which we find that bara means ""create, cut, shape, perforate, and strengthen, make well, make grow"" Now perhaps you think that it means to create out of nothing. Fine - believe as you wish. However, you cannot claim that the Bible supports this meaning. In the beginning of the creation story, for example, the spirit of the LORD is moving upon some waters and he exclaims, "" Sea la luz! "" (which for some reason you translate as ""Let there be light"" as if light was always going to be and he just let it happen. Strange...). Nevertheless it indicates that before God created there was something there that he was creating from. Now maybe you can argue that God created those waters before the story of creation really gets going. Still, you can argue anything you want. Now in Genesis 1:27 we see that God created man (also with the word bara) yet we see that man was formed out of the dust of the ground - so again, you cannot claim that bara means to create out of nothing when used to refer to the acts of divine beings. But let's say, for the sake of argument, that before he was born Jesus (aka Jehovah) really did create the entire universe out of nothing. If that is the case, then he has surely also created evil. Now perhaps you will argue that every being has free will, yet surely God in his omniscience could have said, ""I'm about to create Cain... but I see that he will team up with Satan and kill Abel and that will be bad... so maybe I'll skip making him."" But he did no such thing, so while you may be eager to let God wash his hands of the responsibility, we can still easily see that if the standard Christian story of creation is true, then God has created and is directly responsible for evil and that he knew ahead of time what he was doing. Now as for your links proving Mormonism wrong, logically, the only thing that is proved therein is that the author has no understanding of Mormon theology. Mormons believe, for example, that Jesus achieved exaltation after his earth life. Yet, you may ask, who exalted Jesus? Who saved him? Surely you and Mormons agree that Jesus saved himself - that he needed no expiacin (which for some unfathomable reason you call at-one-ment) and so the supposed infinite regression problem exists only in the mind of the author of the paper. So again, I challenge you to solve the two problems I have set for you: 1. How do you account for the existence of evil? This is the prime philosophical challenge for Christianity. 2. How do you account for your lack of belief in Mormonism, considering that their theology generates a greater present value calculation than that of your own faith? P.S. Quoting the Bible may make you feel good, but it's pointless. Not only does everyone's interpretation of said document vary, but you cannot hope to convince someone of Christianity by the Bible since, if they accept the Bible as true, they are already Christians.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","02:28 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","90"
