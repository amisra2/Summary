What exactly is you motivation, were you religious at one time like Freedom?","Zosimus","470216","Well, I'm still not sure I should reply to you because you normally turn into a troll on everyone who does. But let's play this out and see how it goes. I'm Peruvian but I was born in California and have dual citizenship. I lived in Los Angeles for 31 years before coming to Peru and I'm still here. I had planned to get a job working in a mine (I have a B.S.E.E. from Harvey Mudd) but I didn't realize until I got here that they want you to have several years of experience working in mines and the mining industry so I found it hard to get interviews. Almost immediately after arriving I got picked up by Business Links E.I.R.L. as an English Teacher and got trained by them on how to do it. They were paying $9-$12 and at the time the dollar/sol exchange rate was 3.5 so I lived quite well. Really, though, I knew nothing about teaching languages except what they'd taught me in a two-week 20-hour crash course. Still, I believed that I had been taught the best method available. One of my trainers had a CELTA and the other one had a TESOL. These are highly-recognized qualifications issued by top universities in the UK. So I figured, ""These guys are not slouches."" But one day I was contacted by a marketing guy. He had convinced a group of occupational therapists to sign up to get English language lessons from him but didn't have a teacher. He offered me S/.45 to teach them, which at that time and exchange rate was about double what Business Links was paying so I immediately accepted. Then he dropped the bombshell on me: He wanted me to use the ""natural approach."" I knew nothing about it, but I googled it and I found out it was invented in the 1970s. So here I was committed to teaching people using a method 40 years out of date!! All the guy did was go to the Voice of America website, download some audio and I had to get them to listen to it 2-3 times, explain the words they didn't know (in English) and then move on to the next audio. We didn't teach any grammar, all vocabulary was incidental, no pronunciation, no speaking, no writing - nothing! I really thought it would be a total crash-and-burn scenario. All my fellow teachers told me it wouldn't work and that I was a glutton for punishment but the money was good and my wife was pregnant with our second child so I figured that I should ""get while the gettin' 's good"" and I did exactly what he told me to do. Do you know what happened? They learned - that's what happened. From what I could see the very best, Oxford-blessed standard method was fundamentally no better than the natural approach. It also turned out that the communicative language approach was also popularized in the 1970s. I started to delve into it and a simple read of http://seas3.elte.hu/coursematerial/...olna/Swan2.pdf was rather sobering. So then I thought, ""Since this is my new profession, I need to learn to do it right. Let's do this scientifically"" (that was back when I believed in science). So I googled ""L2 language acquisition studies"" and found about 2.5 million hits and I started with the first link and worked my way down the list. Yet the more I read the less I knew. One study showed that the best way was to use extensive reading to add vocabulary (see http://www.ic.nanzan-u.ac.jp/tandai/...125_Harris.pdf ) ""The study is conclusive evidence that extensive reading increases readers sight vocabulary and improves the rate of readers schemata acquisition."" So I highlighted that and went on but the following studies like http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~kims/assi...sjkling550.pdf said things like, ""...the researchers did not measure whether a gain of two correct nadsat vocabulary answers was statistically significant"" and concluded ""One way to summarize this research is to conclude that unintentionally acquired words arrive in modest and unpredictable increments."" Cheerful. So that must mean the other way is the right way to do it, right? So then I learned about the Involvement Load Hypothesis only to find at the end: ""Interestingly, when participant scores were normalized to reflect time on task, there were no statistically significant differences in vocabulary learned per minute between the groups."" Well, isn't that great? We have two teams arguing back and forth about the best way to teach people something but when you put their studies side by side and take a serious look you see that fundamentally there's no difference anyway. "" So then when I complained to a friend he suggested that I take a look at PLOS Medicine: Why Most Published Research Findings Are False where I find out that most published research findings are false anyway! So not only was I trying to thread my way through the studies and figure out exactly what each one had to teach me about doing my job better, I also had to worry that they were probably wrong anyway! Then someone turned me onto Lawrence Bonjour's In Defense of Pure Reason which, at that time, was available on ebooks3000 for download and I realized that science can't give you the answers anyway so I stopped wasting my time. So no, it's not a religious thing. It's philosophical.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","01:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","331"
"02-11-2013","21431",23,"Zosimus","470215","Ok, first of all, Freedom, what you have ""hypothesized"" is not a theory. A theory seeks to explain not only what happens but why it happens. But I do want to talk about what is called the ""God of the Gaps"" logical fallacy. There are some people who say, ""Since you cannot think of an explanation for (x) you must agree with me when I claim that God did (x)."" This is a special form of the argumentum ad ignorantiam logical fallacy. Yet really what you are doing is basically the same thing. Let's suppose that tomorrow you come up with some other (non-electronic) argument and I cannot provide an alternate theory that explains why something occurs. This does not mean that your theory is the only one. There may be other people in the world who have alternate theories or, even if there aren't, someone may come up with an alternate theory tomorrow or a hundred years in the future that ends up being accepted as the real explanation long after we're dead. When Newton launched his Law of Universal Gravitation no one had thought that maybe space was curved or that atomic particles contained gravitons. It wasn't until after Einstein was born and Max Planck did his experiments that these ideas became popular.","Freedom","470229","First off I did read the whole thing even if I didn't include it in quotes. All right, you may have got me there. However in that case does it really matter if explanations remain unclosed books if we get to have absolute objective laws? I want to talk about what I like to call fallacy of expansion. In this fallacy someone confuses modification or expansion of a fact as an alternative version which replaces the old, and therefore the old is now false. If a baby sees a forest and does not know anything but that it is green, he knows far less than he will later; but that doesn't mean the forest is not green. So it is with with Newtonian mechanics (which is more interpretative law than theory).","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","08:52 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","332"

There is similarly no such thing as dark matter or dark energy. 2. The solar system did not form in the way most people think. Had it really happened the way I was told in high school then Mercury wouldn't have a magnetic field, Venus wouldn't have a retrograde motion, and the Earth and Venus would not be tidally locked. 3. Comets are not big balls of ice that melt as they get near the sun creating a long tail. A simple look at Comet Lovejoy Survives Fiery Plunge Through Sun, NASA Says | Comet Lovejoy (C/2011 W3) | Kreutz Sungrazing Comets | Space.com shows that. 4. The sun is not primarily fusion powered. The solar neutrino problem has made that obvious for decades. No standard model of the sun can explain why the sun goes through an 11-year sunspot cycle that also coincides with its power output, nor can it explain why the corona is hotter than the surface of the sun nor why when we see sunspots we see a darker (cooler) interior of the sun. That's not even touching on Birkeland Currents being observed in the corona. 5. There's no such thing as man-made global warming. The Earth is cooling and that's a very bad thing. I wish there were global warming - it would mean less dead children in Puno this year. Anyone who thinks that human beings, through their production of carbon dioxide can warm the whole planet are severely deluded. Insects produce more carbon dioxide than all human activities combined and anyway if carbon dioxide were a problem there already is a simple solution: Stop recycling paper. Every scrap of paper buried in a landfill is less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Yet every environmental whacko fully supports recycling. It sounds completely crazy until you realize that environmentalism is a religion. The earth is sacred and worthy of worship, humans sin just by breathing, recycling is an atoning ritual, and environmentalism even has holy days, food restrictions, and end-of-the-earth doomsday scenarios just like Christianity or Judaism. If you don't call it a religion, what are you going to call it? 6. No one can explain why the ocean is salty. It's true that the Earth's crust contains sodium, but not much chlorine. The vast majority of sodium flowing into the ocean is in the form of sodium carbonates at 80 percent with less than 7 percent being chlorides. Yet the ocean is composed of 89 percent chlorides and only 0.2 percent carbonates. The above plus neo-Darwinism and English language teaching theories are just subsets of my main theory of life and science: Science is wrong about almost everything and this is not a secret. A simple web search can show that every major scientific theory is not only wrong but known to be wrong. Science doesn't care because, at the end of the day, science is about making money not advancing truth.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","09:28 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","334"

The naivety in this statement is laughable. I would really like to hear your reasoning because with this statement alone it is clear you have no idea what dark matter and dark energy even refers to. That being said, please elaborate-I can't wait. You think that our models of solar system formation are not consistent with Mercury having a magnetic field and observed retrograde motion of Venus? What do you mean by Earth and Venus being tidally locked? Further, your back story totally rules out you being taught current solar system formation theories in high school. If you mean theories of star evolution, destruction and rebirth, maybe, but you've already dated yourself. Whatever the case, I would like to know why current theories are inconsistent with observations and what you think current theory is. It has long been known that comets likely have a rocky nucleus. The particular comet was thought to have formed in a way that makes it having a rocky nucleus unlikely. It is not a typical comet being a particular class of sungrazer, that is why astronomers were surprised to see it emerge from its close encounter with the sun in the way it did. The solar neutrino problem was figured out over a decade ago. Further, it was figured out way before that, but the solution was only proven in 2002. Are you really that far behind? As for solar cycles, so what? Scientists have never claimed to know everything. We have theories and a level of confidence associated with our theories. As for the sun not being primarily fusion powered, you are an idiot. Sounds just like typical creationist bs-always accusing people who aren't god fearers, those who base their opinions on what can be shown to be true, to only do so because they have faith in no religion. Um, well the oceans have salt, so there you have it. Not really concerned with what's locked up in the crust. Are you of the opinion that all salt originated from rocks and must maintain the same concentrations in water as that found in rocks? What do you base this on? And about making airplanes fly, placing astronauts on the moon, making your computer work, giving you almost instant communication to any spot on earth, building bridges that span thousands of feet and thousand foot buildings that can survive a >8 magnitude earthquake, making engines that can go more than 50 miles to a gallon of gasoline, making your tube tv picture clear, making cell phone technology work, guiding missiles around the earth, giving you instant coordinates of where you are on the planet anywhere on the planet, curing diseases, building the periodic table, powering entire cities with a single nuclear power plant, etc etc. oh, I bet you have no problem whatsoever with this science. Oh yeah, only the sciences that infringe on either your creation story or your religious philosophy is wrong now I bet. Only, modern cosmology, evolution and pretty much anything that seeks to explain what science hasn't already explained. Those sciences are ALL wrong. You really make me sick. I hate that there are people like you out there in our world.
