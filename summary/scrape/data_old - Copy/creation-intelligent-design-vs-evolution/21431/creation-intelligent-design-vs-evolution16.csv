I think any error is significant when it is claimed a written work is divine knowledge. You obviously don't. I am agreeing that it can't be a 24 hour day, it would be contradictory if it was. That is why my point stands, using the word day is either bad translation or a lie from the start. because a family is not an abstract human, it is a group of humans. You can say john, james, and bill are human but not that they are both three humans and one human. That is a contradiction. Once again you assert something about me you have no evidence for. I am ready right now, I can even get the interview in video when it happens. Yet still, he does not appear, he does not speak. If he is real I want to know about him. There are no excuses left easyrider, you say we are all sinners. Then I am a sinner, I want to know the truth, god is all powerful, he claims to come to earth for sinners like me, his chances of convincing me to change my behavior are directly proportional to the power he can display and the logic he can give, why does he still remain silent?","Easyrider","468200","Sometimes he will interject himself into people's lives, like Paul on the Road to Damascus. But then Paul believed in the OT God to begin with. Yes. Paul wrote the Church at Corinth before 70 AD. Here's when the scholars say the book of 1st Corinthians was written. Dating 1 Corinthians Again, one of the evidences of the divine is fulfilled prophecy, as we see in Matthew, etc. The OT also foretells a very special individual and covenant that will come in the future (Daniel 7:13-14; Jeremiah 23:5-6, Isaiah 53:6; Jeremiah 31:31-34; Isaiah chapter 9, and so on). Even in English you have time periods that are not fixed (i.e. a nuclear ""winter,"" the ""dawn"" of civilization, etc.). So you need to align yourself to the vernacular of the time, instead of trying to make it fit better in the 21st century. And once again, it's CONTEXT that helps identify the length of time being written about. CONTEXT and word studies are very important in Biblical studies. Nope. Consider humans one species and God another. Look at it in those terms. Then there's no contradiction. Your conscience (a work of God) testifies you have done wrong in your life. It will weigh on you until you die until you confess your sins and ask Jesus to forgive you and be your Lord and Savior for the remission of your sins. And ask him to come into your life. When you do that with all sincerity then in due time (if not immediately), you will have your evidence that God / Christ exist. One of the evidences that it has occurred is that you will have a new, inner longing and hunger for the Bible / New Testament that you never had before. That's what happened to me one morning.

"01-04-2013","21431",16,"Zosimus","468158","You seem to like to shoot the messenger. No, I am not claiming that scientific knowledge is 80 percent wrong; rather that is the conclusion of several studies. For example at Lies, Damned Lies, and Medical Science - David H. Freedman - The Atlantic we find, ""80 percent of non-randomized studies (by far the most common type)...were later convincingly refuted."" At Cancer industry total fraud exposed: Nearly all 'scientific' studies fail to be replicated we read that 47 of 53 studies could not be replicated. That's more than 88 percent wrong. Now I know what you want to say - you want to say that this is just concentrated in the medical industry. Are you really that naive? I say again: It can be proved that the majority of published research findings are false. This is a direct quote from PLOS Medicine: Why Most Published Research Findings Are False Now back to Spread Of Endogenous Retrovirus K Is Similar In The DNA Of Humans And Rhesus Monkeys wherein we read: ""...a surprising pattern was observed."" Now since you seem to be too much of a simpleton to understand clear English let me explain it to you: When something found is surprising that means that it was not previously predicted by theories. If it had been predicted, then the findings would not have been surprising. Now the researchers say, ""The data suggested that the humans and rhesus have been purging ERV-K copies from their genomes..."" This is speculation. The only way to know that humans have been purging ERV-K copies from their genomes is to get DNA from humans some 5,000 years ago and compare it to DNA from humans today. Needless to say 5,000 year old DNA is not something you can just pick up at WalMart. Instead we are seeing conclusions drawn from a questionable premise: That humans, chimps, and rheuses monkeys share a common ancestor. These surprising findings do not support that conclusion. That's when ad hoc hypothesizing comes into play. This is why Imre Lakatos said, ""...nobody to date has yet found a demarcation criterion according to which Darwin can be described as scientific."" One final note: You said, ""...this is not the same kind of evidence we use to verify evolution."" This sentence smacks of Verificationism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia the refuted logical positivist philosophy that claimed that statements are only legitimate if they can be verified to be either true or false (empirically). However, as almost everyone has pointed out, the statement that unverifiable statements are illegitimate is itself unverifiable (and therefore illegitimate according to its own reasoning).","Databed","468251","Are these scientific studies? Well then, 80% of them must be wrong. Take 80% of the 20% and 20% of the 80% percent and we find that only 16% + 16% = 32% that must be correct. But wait! Then that means 32% of those studies must be correct! So only 68% percent are actually wrong. So take 68% of the 32% and 32% of the 68% and we find that 22% + 22% = 44% are correct. With a p-value of .05 we should be able to keep iterating and get to somewhere around 95% of the studies we see are actually correct. There, is this biased? BTW, you are STILL, STILL, STILL, STILL using examples that pertain to MEDICAL STUDIES EXCLUSIVELY!!!!!!!!! Evolution is not part of the medical field. That is, unless you take into account epidemiology, where the rapidly evolving microbes are ONLY understood under the light of evolution. Why do we keep needing new antibiotics and new vaccines? Medical Yup, medical You are simply wrong about this. We do have >5,000 year old DNA from humans and probably from chimps as well. There is no problem here. Humans have been purging ERV-K. We know this because we have hundreds of DNA markers that tell us where and when certain markers within the genomes of primate species originated. In case you didn't know, evolution predicts that DNA changes over time. So why then is it some kind of problem for evolution when it is observed that the genome has actually changed? Why is this any different from hominids evolving from apelike ancestors? I think you misunderstand what this article is saying. It is NOT saying the ERV is absent in homo sapiens or rhesus monkeys. Please get that through your head. The study says that the ERV-K sequence is disappearing from these genomes suggesting that evolution is ""tinkering"" with this area of the two genomes. It is not understood why. Maybe I will let Freedom tackle why this is not verificationism. Basically, when you come in here and refute the validity of medical studies and then claim therefore evolution is false, I will stand by my statement that you are refuting the WRONG evidence both in content and in classification. I don't understand why you think you are being relevant. I guess maybe you had an angle, or a pitch, it failed, and now you are really trying to keep it alive even though NO ONE is buying into it. You really are a lunatic in my opinion.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","09:45 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","230"
"01-04-2013","21431",16,"Freedom","468199","If you would like some real debate present the argument used in that article here in your own words explaining what data was used and how. The paper itself is only for the raw data. Ah, so you post a link to an article to make a point; and then deny some of it's claims because it's probably wrong.... I do indeed. Man one is correct. Man 2 is correct, the sample size of ravens was zero. Induction occurs when a finite set of probabilities are assessed from a finite set of evidence. All non-black things and all non-ravens is not a finite set of evidence. If you had brought back a million ravens and all were black (there are a finite number of ravens) it would be perfectly proper induction to conclude that probably all ravens are black. His hypothesis was strengthened by repeated confirmations. Hypotheses are competing with each other. Very few findings are predicted by both. Therefore unequal harm can often appear like the advancement of one hypothesis over another. I must be missing something, but if the extent to which the evidence supports the hypothesis is the same as the deductive support it's 100%.","Zosimus","468260","The reasoning is very simple. First of all, let's assume that we are investigating a genetic line containing 10,000 different genes. Our previous research, or estimations, or whatever, suggests that perhaps some 500 of those are involved in cancer regulation. We are doing research in order to determine if the gene in question really does regulate cancer. As such our a priori opinion of the gene is 5 percent - that is any given gene, without doing any studies, has a 5 percent chance of being involved in cancer regulation. After this we apply a study that is 95 percent correct - that is, that it produces correct answers 95 percent of the time and false positives only 5 percent of the time. As such we can conclude that our study will produce (9,500 x 0.05)=475 false positives and (500x0.95)=475 true positives. Assuming that all of our positives are published, half of our work will be wrong right out of the gate. This does not even take into account bad study design, personal bias, or data dredging. There are programs on the market that can easily find a statistical match in data by manipulating the data in ways such as dropping one person from the study. Researchers may be highly motivated to get published and may use these programs in order to generate positive findings in order to advance their career. They may honestly (but mistakenly) believe that the result of the experiment should be true and be frustrated that their research shows the finding they need but not at a level that is considered statistically significant. The study may be poorly designed or may overlook crucial elements that results in a false positive. Additionally, what happens if 12 groups are studying the same thing? Just by chance one of the groups may get a false positive while the others rightly find the negative result. Peer-reviewed journals generally publish positive findings rather than negative ones, unless that negative refutes a previous finding. As such the false positive will get published but the three real negatives will not get published. These three factors together will result in non-randomized small-scale studies being wrong the vast majority of the time. If you look at PLOS Medicine: Why Most Published Research Findings Are False and search for ""schizophrenia"" you will see the author's math regarding a fairly typical research design that yields a chance of being right of about 4.4 10 4 Now Databed will say, as he always does, that this is all about medical discoveries as though researcher bias, publication bias, data mining, and low pre-study odds existed only in medical research. I'm sure that evolutionary biologists are completely unbiased when it comes to discussion of the prevailing (pro-Darwin) paradigm... not! I'm sure peer-reviewed journals in biology are just as pleased to publish negative results as opposed to new, exciting, positive findings that appear to bring new insight and advance scientific discovery... not! So why should I (or anyone) think that non-randomized small-scale studies published in evolutionary journals somehow magically avoid all the pitfalls that plague researchers in the medical field? Now as for ERV-K copies, you say that the researchers found fragments of the ERV-K that was being purged. Were these findings statistically significant? Was data-mining software used to find these statistical matches? Are the researchers completely unbiased? How many humans, monkeys, and chimps were used in the study? Are we talking 1,000s of chimps or perhaps just a handful? Has this study been replicated? Do we know that this study is not the only positive result of perhaps 10 teams working on the same problem where the other 9 had negative findings and didn't get published? The answer is simple: We don't know any of the above factors. So from an objective standpoint we can say that this study has not changed our opinion of the world much, if at all. So why does Databed rabidly support evolution whereas Easyrider is just as adamant against it? The answer is simple: Previous to this study they had already made up their mind about evolution/creationism. This leads me back to the original point of the thread: People who believe in evolution do so because of an a priori philosophical commitment to atheism and all that entails. Now as for Hempel's paradox, do I understand you correctly to be claiming that there are an infinite number of non-black birds on Earth at this moment? Surely you cannot mean that. If you believe that finding a black raven makes it more likely that all ravens are black then logically you must think that finding a green parrot also makes it more likely that all ravens are black since the green parrot is a non-black non-raven. You already said you agreed with Man 1 when he stated that saying ""All ravens are black"" is the same as saying ""All non-black birds are not ravens."" Logically the two statements are the same, but you think (for some unexplained reason) that finding a black raven increases the odds of ""All ravens are black"" and (we can assume) the theory that all non-black birds are not ravens. Is it because the conclusion violates your intuition? Furthermore you claim that bringing back large numbers of black ravens would increase the possibility of all ravens being black. Consider this possibility: The men are arguing over the color of ravens (as before) and I am entrusted to bring back evidence to prove the point once and for all. While leaving the island I use my phone to call Shaq's Shack of Black run by Shaq (a black man named after the famous basketball player) who believes that black is a deeply spiritual color. In his store he sells all kinds of black things - black clocks, black folders, black pens, black shoes, etc. He agrees to order as many ravens as he can get his hands on from a supplier and when I arrive at his shop (two days later) I make off with 193 black ravens and quickly return to the island. Do these black ravens really prove that all ravens are black or do they actually just prove that Shaq's Shack of Black only sells black things? I would tend to think the latter, although perhaps the men on the island will really be convinced of the former. The question that really needs to be asked is not what evidence was found but how that evidence was collected and whether that procedure had a legitimate non-zero chance of falsifying the hypothesis in question. Hopefully what we can agree on is that any finding that is surprising bodes ill for the claim that all ravens are black. If I show up with what appears to be a blue raven perhaps Man1 can insist that it's not really a raven at all, or that it's color is not authentic (that I'd had it dyed), or insist that it is actually black and that the blue color is a figment of our imagination, or that his claim was true at the moment he made it but that this raven is very young and wasn't born at that time or was left on the planet by extraterrestrials for no other reason than to confound him. These are all what we call ""ad hoc"" hypotheses - non-premeditated claims made for no other reason than to keep a cherished belief from being seriously called into question. Theories that use a large number of these hypotheses are simply not testable and therefore not scientific. Finally, back to Popper's Bayesian analysis of Hempel's Paradox. Imagine that we have a man who has a hypothesis (H) that when he cheers for his favorite team and his favorite player at the stadium that his team invariably wins. We can divide his claim into two parts (A and B). Let A = he is cheering and B = his favorite player is playing. Suppose we also know that his favorite player is the best player on the team, who only plays in home games because of some legal problems he has that have resulted in a restriction on travel for him. Therefore the evidence (E) can also be divided into B and C. Let B = the best player on the team is playing and C = his team wins. In this case we can see that when analyzing P(A and B|B and C) that deduction leads us to the conclusion that his team usually wins when the best player is playing and not when he is cheering. So although P(H|E) may seem to be greater than P(H) alone there are good reasons to believe that all of that probability is due to B and not to A.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","11:26 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","231"

You really are a lunatic in my opinion.","Zosimus","468261","First of all, no, it was not a scientific study. It was a mathematical proof. Second, the same logic you vainly tried to use to disprove the proof can easily be applied to induction. Imagine, for example, that we theorize that induction leads to knowledge. Our confidence in induction is 100 percent. However, after 10 tries, induction fails us once. Imagine, for example, that we used induction to calculate that the prices of houses would continue to go up in leaps and bounds in the USA and were quite disappointed. Our confidence in induction drops to 91 percent. But wait! We are using induction to measure how effective induction is. So really our confidence in induction should drop to 82.6 percent (10 2 /11 2 ) but wait that means our estimation of induction must drop further... until, finally, we come to the conclusion that induction is 0 percent likely to lead to knowledge. With that you must embrace falsificationism, as I have done. Third, you claim that all my examples relate to medical studies. Of course you neglected to read any part of the article I posted... which is not surprising since it seems to have disappeared from the forum. Perhaps someone considered it spam and erased it. I will not fault you for that, then, instead I will mention The decline effect and the scientific method : The New Yorker (which I had previously posted herein) that points out that the problem is not limited to medical studies. Examples are given ranging from ""verbal overshadowing"" in psychology to ""extrasensory perception"" in parapsychology to ""fluctuating asymmetry"" in zoology. What's the cause? ""Michael Jennions, a biologist at the Australian National University...argues that the decline effect is largely a product of publication bias, or the tendency of scientists and scientific journals to prefer positive data over null results, which is what happens when no effect is found....Richard Palmer, a biologist at the University of Alberta, who has studied the problems surrounding fluctuating asymmetry, suspects that an equally significant issue is the selective reporting of results....For instance, after Palmer plotted every study of fluctuating asymmetry, he noticed that the distribution of results with smaller sample sizes wasnt random at all but instead skewed heavily toward positive results. Palmer has since documented a similar problem in several other contested subject areas. 'Once I realized that selective reporting is everywhere in science, I got quite depressed,' Palmer told me. 'As a researcher, youre always aware that there might be some nonrandom patterns, but I had no idea how widespread it is.' In a recent review article, Palmer summarized the impact of selective reporting on his field: 'We cannot escape the troubling conclusion that someperhaps manycherished generalities are at best exaggerated in their biological significance and at worst a collective illusion nurtured by strong a-priori beliefs often repeated.'"" Finally, you claim that humans have been purging ERV-K because you have 5000+ year old DNA. The answer is, of course, that you think you have 5,000+ year old DNA. You make this claim, but this claim is unverifiable and suspect. Considering that science cannot accurately measure and demonstrate things we can easily see in front of our eyes on a daily basis, how in the world can you seriously make the claim that you can know about things that were going on 5,000 years ago? The bottom line is simple: The theory made certain predictions. An experiment was done. The results were surprising, i.e., not in line with the predictions. Later the predictions were modified in such a way as to make it seem that it was in line with the theory when it wasn't. Now you want to claim victory but sorry - I'm not buying it. P.S. I still think you're missing the point. I'm not here trying to disprove evolution - I'm here trying (and I believe, succeeding) in proving that you believe in evolution because you made up your mind before any of this evidence came around. All findings that have been made are inconclusive about evolution. P.P.S. Science doesn't need to develop new antibiotics or vaccines. Garlic annihilates all comers, as humans have known for thousands of years. Even super antibiotic resistant MRSA is killed instantly.

If I show up with what appears to be a blue raven perhaps Man1 can insist that it's not really a raven at all, or that it's color is not authentic (that I'd had it dyed), or insist that it is actually black and that the blue color is a figment of our imagination, or that his claim was true at the moment he made it but that this raven is very young and wasn't born at that time or was left on the planet by extraterrestrials for no other reason than to confound him. These are all what we call ""ad hoc"" hypotheses - non-premeditated claims made for no other reason than to keep a cherished belief from being seriously called into question. Theories that use a large number of these hypotheses are simply not testable and therefore not scientific. Finally, back to Popper's Bayesian analysis of Hempel's Paradox. Imagine that we have a man who has a hypothesis (H) that when he cheers for his favorite team and his favorite player at the stadium that his team invariably wins. We can divide his claim into two parts (A and B). Let A = he is cheering and B = his favorite player is playing. Suppose we also know that his favorite player is the best player on the team, who only plays in home games because of some legal problems he has that have resulted in a restriction on travel for him. Therefore the evidence (E) can also be divided into B and C. Let B = the best player on the team is playing and C = his team wins. In this case we can see that when analyzing P(A and B|B and C) that deduction leads us to the conclusion that his team usually wins when the best player is playing and not when he is cheering. So although P(H|E) may seem to be greater than P(H) alone there are good reasons to believe that all of that probability is due to B and not to A.","Freedom","468351","What if the test is 99%? 95 wrong 495 right 83% to overall identification.

"01-07-2013","21431",16,"Zosimus","468261","First of all, no, it was not a scientific study. It was a mathematical proof. Second, the same logic you vainly tried to use to disprove the proof can easily be applied to induction. Imagine, for example, that we theorize that induction leads to knowledge. Our confidence in induction is 100 percent. However, after 10 tries, induction fails us once. Imagine, for example, that we used induction to calculate that the prices of houses would continue to go up in leaps and bounds in the USA and were quite disappointed. Our confidence in induction drops to 91 percent. But wait! We are using induction to measure how effective induction is. So really our confidence in induction should drop to 82.6 percent (10 2 /11 2 ) but wait that means our estimation of induction must drop further... until, finally, we come to the conclusion that induction is 0 percent likely to lead to knowledge. With that you must embrace falsificationism, as I have done. Third, you claim that all my examples relate to medical studies. Of course you neglected to read any part of the article I posted... which is not surprising since it seems to have disappeared from the forum. Perhaps someone considered it spam and erased it. I will not fault you for that, then, instead I will mention The decline effect and the scientific method : The New Yorker (which I had previously posted herein) that points out that the problem is not limited to medical studies. Examples are given ranging from ""verbal overshadowing"" in psychology to ""extrasensory perception"" in parapsychology to ""fluctuating asymmetry"" in zoology. What's the cause? ""Michael Jennions, a biologist at the Australian National University...argues that the decline effect is largely a product of publication bias, or the tendency of scientists and scientific journals to prefer positive data over null results, which is what happens when no effect is found....Richard Palmer, a biologist at the University of Alberta, who has studied the problems surrounding fluctuating asymmetry, suspects that an equally significant issue is the selective reporting of results....For instance, after Palmer plotted every study of fluctuating asymmetry, he noticed that the distribution of results with smaller sample sizes wasnt random at all but instead skewed heavily toward positive results. Palmer has since documented a similar problem in several other contested subject areas. 'Once I realized that selective reporting is everywhere in science, I got quite depressed,' Palmer told me. 'As a researcher, youre always aware that there might be some nonrandom patterns, but I had no idea how widespread it is.' In a recent review article, Palmer summarized the impact of selective reporting on his field: 'We cannot escape the troubling conclusion that someperhaps manycherished generalities are at best exaggerated in their biological significance and at worst a collective illusion nurtured by strong a-priori beliefs often repeated.'"" Finally, you claim that humans have been purging ERV-K because you have 5000+ year old DNA. The answer is, of course, that you think you have 5,000+ year old DNA. You make this claim, but this claim is unverifiable and suspect. Considering that science cannot accurately measure and demonstrate things we can easily see in front of our eyes on a daily basis, how in the world can you seriously make the claim that you can know about things that were going on 5,000 years ago? The bottom line is simple: The theory made certain predictions. An experiment was done. The results were surprising, i.e., not in line with the predictions. Later the predictions were modified in such a way as to make it seem that it was in line with the theory when it wasn't. Now you want to claim victory but sorry - I'm not buying it. P.S. I still think you're missing the point. I'm not here trying to disprove evolution - I'm here trying (and I believe, succeeding) in proving that you believe in evolution because you made up your mind before any of this evidence came around. All findings that have been made are inconclusive about evolution. P.P.S. Science doesn't need to develop new antibiotics or vaccines.

Since HIV numbers are easily available on the net, I'll work with those. According to proponents of the Rapid ELISA test, the test is 99.5 percent effective (see How HIV is Diagnosed - Tests Used to Diagnose HIV Infection - ELISA, EIA and PCR Tests - HIVInfoSource.org ). I also note that out of the 315 million US residents an estimated 1.2 million are HIV+ while 240,000 of these don't know that (see CDC Vital Signs - New Hope for Stopping HIV ). Since this article was posted in December 2011 I'm going to tack on 50,000 more (see article) and say that none of them are aware that they are HIV+ - this means that out of every 10,000 people 9.23 are HIV+ and unaware of their condition. Since the Rapid ELISA test is 99.5 percent accurate that means that 499.5 false positives will be produced (0.05 x 9991) whereas 9 real positives will be produced. As such a person testing positive for HIV with the Rapid ELISA test is really only 1.77 percent likely to have the disease. So simply having a very, very accurate test is not a panacea to the problems plaguing researchers. In reality, of course, 99.5 percent accurate is an unfounded number (see HIV & AIDS - Factors Known to Cause False Positive HIV Antibody Test Results ) wherein a large number of known causes of false positives are stated. But really I want to delve deeper - past this instance and into the exact problems of determining how accurate a test is. Let's suppose, for example, that we have discovered a new virus and we have a test that tests for the antibodies produced to fight against this disease. How do we know how accurate the test is? Really the only way to know that the test (let's call it Test A) is accurate is to compare it against another test (Test B) that is known to be 100 percent accurate. The immediate problem jumps right out at us - if we already have a Test B that is 100 percent accurate, then why are we screwing around with a new test (Test A) with unknown accuracy? Additionally we can assume that we know Test B was 100 percent accurate because we compared it against Test C and it matched up 100 percent. Test C, of course, matched 100% with Test D, which was verified against Test E, and that against test F... ad infinitum . Obviously that is not done - so how do we really determine that Test A works at all? The answer is simple: Test A is compared against itself to see how often it agrees with itself. Now it's entirely possible that Test A routinely produces false positives if the person has, for example, AH1N1 influenza (and agrees with itself a very high percentage of the time). In short, just because the test agrees with itself very, very often doesn't mean that it's very accurate in the real world . Now let's talk about induction. Induction is a form of logic that is known to produce false outcomes even when all inputs are true. As such, I consider it to be extremely unreliable. You, on the other hand, think that it is reliable. Let's agree, for the sake of argument, that induction is accurate. If that's so, then that means that the past is a good guide to the future. As you can see at Medical Research Article: Lies, Damned Lies, and Medical Science Health and Medical News and Resources 80 percent of non-randomized studies turn out to be wrong. Since we believe in induction, we can conclude that 80 percent of all future non-randomized studies will also be wrong. With that in mind I challenge you to produce a randomized study that supports evolution. Don't just say ""...I do know the odds of similar DNA existing in two individuals without a common ancestor increases by the power of the matching base-pair positions."" If that study was not randomized we can safely conclude that it was wrong. Now you are trying to poke holes in Hempel's paradox through loopholes that can easily be eliminated. Let's change the hypothetical situation ever so slightly. We have two men (I'll call them Aaron and Charles). Aaron owns a nice, black raven and claims that all ravens are black. Charles claims to have once owned a white raven and says that he has also seen a white raven flying around the island. I go off and bring back large numbers of green parrots, red robins, and blue bluejays. Aaron claims that this greatly supports the contention that all ravens are black. ""Any of these birds,"" he reasons, ""could have been a raven. That would have falsified my claim. In fact, he says, it's entirely possible that the black raven you see in my office is the only raven in existence. That would positively prove that all ravens are black."" If he is wrong, please explain exactly why you think so and why that doesn't contradict your support of induction.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","11:07 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","235"

Let's ignore the fact that the above isn't a sentence and delve into this logic more deeply. Let's do so by imaginging a devout Marxist who is reading a newspaper next to me. He says, ""Millions have tried to disprove Marxism, but no one has succeeded."" He then proceeds to go to every news story in the paper and he easily draws out from the stories how the story is evidence of the class bias of the newspaper. Even the stories not printed are confirmations for the theory of Marxism, in his estimation. Everywhere he looks he sees confirmations of his theory. There has never been any observation that does not fit with the theory of Marxism. What does that prove, really? Nothing except that his theory accommodates all data. Let's compare this theory to Einstein's Theory of Relativity, which predicted gravitational lensing of light. This situation is quite different because the outcome was predicted ahead of time, people unenlightened by the theory would have predicted something else, and so when lensing was observed people were understandably far more impressed by that than by a Marxist (or evolutionist) twisting every finding into support for his pet theory through the use of ad hoc hypotheses. From Sir Karl Popper ""Science as Falsification,"" 1963 The most characteristic element in this situation seemed to me the incessant stream of confirmations, of observations which ""verified"" the theories in question; and this point was constantly emphasize by their adherents. A Marxist could not open a newspaper without finding on every page confirming evidence for his interpretation of history; not only in the news, but also in its presentation which revealed the class bias of the paper and especially of course what the paper did not say. The Freudian analysts emphasized that their theories were constantly verified by their ""clinical observations."" As for Adler, I was much impressed by a personal experience. Once, in 1919, I reported to him a case which to me did not seem particularly Adlerian, but which he found no difficulty in analyzing in terms of his theory of inferiority feelings, Although he had not even seen the child. Slightly shocked, I asked him how he could be so sure. ""Because of my thousandfold experience,"" he replied; whereupon I could not help saying: ""And with this new case, I suppose, your experience has become thousand-and-one-fold."" What I had in mind was that his previous observations may not have been much sounder than this new one; that each in its turn had been interpreted in the light of ""previous experience,"" and at the same time counted as additional confirmation. What, I asked myself, did it confirm? No more than that a case could be interpreted in the light of a theory. But this meant very little, I reflected, since every conceivable case could be interpreted in the light Adler's theory, or equally of Freud's. Now you claim that there are several methods of radioactive dating that are accurate out to the 5,000 year old timescale. I assume that you refer to carbon dating since we are unlikely to find radioactive argon in DNA samples. A simple look at Is Carbon Dating Accurate? shows that the answer is basically no. Scientists refer to C-14 dating if it supports their preconceived (aka biased) notions, but otherwise they just ignore it. And as for your claim that 5,000 years is nothing, I picked that date to cater to the young earth advocates (if any) in the forum. As for refuting evolution - I hardly need do that. The mere existence of the peacock refutes Darwinism outright. Finally, as for poking fun at garlic, and ignoring medical studies like Antibacterial activity of allicin from Allium sativum against antibiotic resistant uropathogens - ISPUB the mechanics of garlic administration is simple: Taking garlic pills is problematic because stomach acid destroys alliinase, the simple solution has been to pair the garlic with an acid neutralizer.

Not in evolutionary biology, however, you just make an exception for every species that doesn't fit your model, never revisit the underlying assumptions, and scream loudly if someone disagrees with you.
