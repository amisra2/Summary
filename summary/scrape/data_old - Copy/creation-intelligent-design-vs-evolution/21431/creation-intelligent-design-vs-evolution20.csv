"01-28-2013","21431",20,"Zosimus","469620","1. ERVs in the same location is proof of common descent. adding to this we note that: 2. There are certain ERVs shared by gorillas and chimps but not humans. 3. Therefore gorillas and chimps share a common ancestor that humans do not share. Accordingly gorillas, chimps, and humans do not have an ancestor in common. So if we just run by pro-evolutionist assumptions the discovery at A HERV-K provirus in chimpanzees, bonobos and gori... [Curr Biol. 2001] - PubMed - NCBI destroys the theory of common descent. The second problem is that in reality, the assumptions used by pro-evolutionists in the above argument are known to be false. At ScienceDirect.com - FEBS Letters - Perpetually mobile footprints of ancient infections in human genome we read: ""There were identified `hot spots' containing integration sites used up to 280 times more frequently than predicted mathematically.... A recent study of the de novo retroviral integration demonstrated also preference for scaffold- or matrix-attachment regions (S/MARs) flanked by DNA with high bending potential."" So no, the placement of ERVs in DNA is not ""purely random"" as claimed. There are certain locations that the virus is considerably more likely to select. Accordingly the pro-evolutionary calculation of P(E) as low is not consistent with the data. Regarding dendrochronology, and the article previously posted, the author obviously thought that PCAB Giertz Obergurgler was the master chronology most appropriate for his violin for two reasons: 1. Since it was strongly suspected that his Brescian viola was made by Gasparo da Salo, who died in 1609, he wanted to use a master chronology that started early enough to select a potential date during his lifetime; and 2. The wood that the violin makers were using is believed to have been drawn from the region that the PCAB Giertz Obergurgler covers. At any rate your ad hoc objections to the claim could not possibly apply against the Media 46 master chronology as it is ""a composite derived from over thirty chronologies, including the other three that I used"" and accordingly it will most certainly cover the Italian Alps directly north of Brescia. The author of the article also ruled out statistical problems with the software he used because ""...determining Gleichlufigkeit is fairly straightforward, and it is often the only measurement cited in dendrochronological reports, including those of Peter Klein."" The obvious problem is that it is not possible to have 52 matches of greater than 95 percent probability. Simple math will tell you that at least 50 percent of those matches must have a probability less than 1.92 percent as 1/52 is 1.92 percent. Really the Gleichlufigkeit that was highest (75.3 percent) shows a date of 1805 which is an impossible date since A) violas of that size were no longer being made in the 19th century and B) the varnish pattern closely matches that of other varnishes used in and around the early 18th century (see the varnish pictures on the right hand side of the link). In conclusion although you may think that dendrochronology is a wonderful thing that makes 14 C dating magically accurate, people who have actually tried to use the technique and had experts use it for them, such as the author of the article say, ""I would strongly advise violin historians, authenticators, appraisers, and purchasers to be wary of the dates that are being published in auction catalogs, certificates, and scholarly journals."" Taking his advice to heart I will say that I am also wary of the dates being supplied in scholarly journals such as the ones your supposed ancient DNA relies on.","Databed","469622","One of my cousins and I share a grandmother. I have a second cousin that does not share this grandmother. Are we then to conclude that the second cousin and I share no common ancestors? Of course not. The only thing that your example demonstrates is that chimps and gorillas share an ancestor that branched off more recently than the ancestor we all share together. THAT ancestor is the source of the ERV and not the one we all three share. This really isn't complicated. I almost feel like you are starting to play dumb. Not quite. You need to learn more about the subject before you come in here drawing conclusions from it. So what? Even if this particular ERV falls in a hotspot, the lack of it in humans and a preserved integration site within the human genome STILL proves that chimps and gorillas share an ancestor not common to humans. In addition, not all ERV's common to all three groups fall in a hotspot. Even further, the integration sites don't all have to contain the same ERV. The fact that the same ERV is always noted to fall in homologous locations would have to be a coincidence just as large as the location itself. Taken together, it must be an astronomical coincidence. So, your logic just doesn't add up. You are better off refuting the existence of ERV's altogether. It would be a little less futile on your part as your flawed logic would not need to be disclosed. Violins do not contain enough tree ring structure to make a reliable comparison. Further, the software he was using was clearly very generous with its matching. He even implies this in his article. When he says not to trust dates based on dendrochronology, he is only talking about a stringed instruments age reliability in an auction setting where people are obviously dating the instruments to maximize their selling point. You need to understand that the software he was using was giving false matches. End of story. He went over this in his article. That has little to do with carbon dating. Please find something more relevant to our topic. Further, you're wary because you already know the Earth can't be older than 10,000 years or so. As far as that goes, do you have an answer for the other dozen or so methods of radiometric dating that show ages much larger than 10,000 years for the Earth? What about star light that is billions of years old? I bet you will have absolutely nothing to say about that. You will ignore it as if I never said it. You will not answer the question of whether or not you trust these methods of determining the age of the Earth or the universe. Why?

"01-28-2013","21431",20,"Zosimus","469380","The reason why ""believe in evolution"" bugs you is because you don't know what knowledge is. Plato defined knowledge as ""justified true belief"" that is: 1. P is true. 2. Person S believes P. 3. Person S has good reason to believe P (or is justified in believing it). This is the theory of knowledge = justified true belief. This concept came under attack with the Gettier problems. For example, suppose that Farmer Bill has a cow (Daisy) who is commonly in a certain field eating sedately. Farmer Bill has a bad premonition about his cow and rushes out to the field where he sees a black and white paper in the distance that appears to be a cow eating. Relieved Farmer Bill goes back to the house ""knowing"" that his cow is safe and in the field. In reality his cow is safe and in the field, sleeping well out of sight of Farmer Bill. In this case all three of the above conditions are met, but most of us would feel that Farmer Bill doesn't really know that his cow is safe. He thinks she is because of a false observation that happens to lead him to the right answer. Most people who have thought about it therefore have tacked on an additional requirement, namely that the justifications must also be true and justifiable. In the case of the cow, Farmer Bill's observation of the cow grazing was not true (even though he thought it was) so his belief is not really justifiable and he didn't really know that the cow was safe (although she was).","Accipiter","469632","Suppose that Farmer Bill?

If that's what you mean to say then great - why are we arguing about it? Second, the fact that there are known ""hot spots"" where retroviruses try to attach means that humans sharing ERVs with chimps is no proof of common descent, rather the shared retrovirus may simply be the result of a retrovirus having a preferred insertion point that is preferred 280 times more than other sites. Third, when you say that violins don't have enough tree rings to date using dendrochronology, my answer is simple: http://www.mta.ca/madlab/2012-01.pdf and I'd like to further mention that you should stop making claims that can be refuted by anyone with Google in less than 5 seconds.

I'm sure databed knew that chimps and humans were supposed to be on a different tree than gorillas and this does cast doubt on that, but you present it as if it's casting doubt on common descent. If the common ancestor of all three were similar to modern humans and chimps and gorillas were the ones who changed more (in terms of genetics not phenotype) that would explain why chimps were more similar to humans than gorillas despite having a short common ancestry with gorillas that they do not have with humans.

I'm not sure why you posted that article because it clearly shows how well dendrochronology works. In this case, the experimenters actually determined their master chronology based on something other than how well it correlated to their tree-ring measurements. That being the case, you can see that it matched quite well and gave them a date. Now if you take a look at the way they word it in their conclusion, they did not give a date, but rather, exactly as I stated before, they were only able to say that at most the violin was as old as the most recent ring-year contained in the master chronology they were able to correlate the growth rings to. In other words, they are unable to say that the violin was not constructed in 1930 or even more recently. This is because the tree-source of the wood that the violin is made from could have continued to grow well after the most recent growth ring that is represented in the violin was formed. Also, though they do not mention it, the wood could have been stockpiled somewhere before it was used. In addition, the correlations that are given in the first article you posted are made using a particular software and only one set of measurements. The second article you linked to uses multiple measurement made by different people and multiple software titles. Also, the experiment seems to have been carried out in a much more professional and careful manner than that of the first. The point of the second article was to show the reliability of the methodology in determining the maximum age of a violin. The first article's point was to show that misuse of the methodology could easily yield unreliable dates.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","03:16 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","296"

Say you cut down a tree. You can count back rings to determine that it sprouted in 1840. Tree 1 1840-2013 Now look at some older wood, possibly some that was used in an old turn of the century lodge. You match its rings up with the new tree to determine its outermost rings correspond to the inner rings of Tree 1 and determine its life spanned from 1757-1905. Any time you have a severe drought or any climactic event it leaves an impression in the tree rings. You need quite an overlap to develop a reliable fingerprint and you need similar wood from similar areas (obviously). You don't have to start the process by going out and cutting down a tree. There are countless sources of old wood that have a known origin that you can start with. In the case of a violin which you are trying to date as opposed to connecting two chronologies together, you have no way of knowing at which stage of the tree's life the rings you find are from. It could be from the beginning or from the end of the tree's life. Since tree can grow for a long time, centuries, this can result in very uncertain measurements. However, one thing you do know is that it can't be older than any year-ring it contains.

Your growth rings always overlap. Otherwise, you get lost and can no longer work your way back any further. There will inevitably be some areas that are easier to identify than others. Many chronologies can be constructed and sometimes you need to fill some gaps with missing data - maybe you even make a couple of guesses just so you can keep going, but you will always associate with your chronology a level of confidence and you will always connect you data in the end or your older dates will not be valid. Keep in mind too, these are not just purely linear sequences. Many ""stacked"" chronologies can be associated with each other to provide a better basis for comparison. You are right. There are many factors that come into play. This is why when you present a case study where you get a range of possible dates as Zosimus has done, I don't count that against the science itself. The dating was poorly performed with several chronologies and too many assumptions. However, there are many sources of reliable data out there. Several of the great lakes have old growth logs that have sunk to the bottom from 300 to 400 years ago. They are the same wood, from the same area and even cut at the same time. This is a reliable source of growth rings to study. There are many old structures that also contain a wealth of data within the growth rings of the timbers used top construct them. There is a small variety of tree which can grown in upper elevations and in addition, wood is preserved well in low oxygen, cold climates. If you count all over the world, there are many many sources out there to obtain reliable data from to use in creating calibration curves for carbon dating.
