What positive stance have YOU taken?","Freedom","468074","It is not, I love the world because of all the life in it. Since I love it so I cannot but hate the inherently life-destroying evil of irrationality in every form especially self-imposed ignorance. Anyone who refuses to think is committing an act of irresponsibility and through the medium of forums like this there is not one difference between someone who won't think and someone who won't debate. There is only one good reason to be here, debate. I suppose accipiter could be acting out some sociopathic need to troll brought on by child abuse but the simplest answer is that he doesn't think , he sees anyone who does as a crackpot. People who spew opinions and think they are not responsible for backing them up are behaving in a hateful manner, they are abusing the unique and powerful tool of language by bombarding those around them with tripe and thus interfering with honest communication. The difference between people like accipiter or poet, and people like easyrider or daewoo are insignificant compared to their similarities. Blind fate determined what they believe based on what they happened to bump into in life, but the connection between truth and experience in them is a fragile mess and they know it given how desperately they hide it. http://www.4forums.com/political/for...ideal-one.html","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","05:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","202"

You said this in response to a global warming debate I believe. Well I think its safe to say that you agree with yourself. I meant more along the lines of something that exists in the world that you actually approve of, like in the context of your original statement.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","10:31 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","204"

If that's what it takes before you doubt them you're position can't be taken seriously. There is no non-contradictory interpretation of the bible as a whole, the catholic church has tried since it manufactured them. Therefore I can and have deductively proven that your religion is false, that's what all those questions about sin, afterlife, and God revealing himself were though you may not have noticed. I have no bias against the Bible as a historical document, I trust it the same as I would any other document. That includes the Illiad (no it doesn't matter how many historians think Jesus was a God). It includes the Koran, it Includes every other text which claimed something supernatural from the adventures of Thor to the Buddha ascending to another plane in front of his disciples. I wouldn't believe my neighbor if he told me he saw God in his backyard, why should I believe it if he writes it down and tells me to wait 3000 years?","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","01:00 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","210"
