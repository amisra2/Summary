"12-21-2012","21431",10,"obvious_child","467811","You and Archangel threatened everyone who disagreed with you with some of the worst statements ever made. None of them worked. Furthermore, you are a terrible fake Christian. If the Abrahamic God exists, only the Abrahamic God can make that judgement. Not you. You are directly usurping that sole judgement power. No one who actually accepts Jesus as their Lord and Savior argues that they, and they alone have the right to decide who is going to Hell. Just as Archangel never worshiped Christ, you never worshiped him either. You bow to your interpretation of the Bible. Not what Christ said, but what you believe to be key. Hinduism. Buddhism. Shinto. Zoroastrianism. Yezdism. I can keep going on naming religions and their respective Gods all day. Nothing you can do can prove that either they don't exist/aren't true and that yours is. Pascal's wager is so fundamentally retarded that only the mentally incompetent would actually use it. Your religion is based on faith. Just as theirs are. You have no actual evidence that your God actually exists (if you did, you wouldn't need faith as your God would be a fact). There is nothing saying that other Gods don't exist and they can't punish you. You are in the exact same boat as the very people you condemn in the name of your perverted interpretation of the Bible. Besides, Christianity hasn't made any predictive prophecies either that actually came true. Your threats are no more scary then people warning me that if I reject Odin, he'll punish me. Prove to me Odin doesn't exist. You can't. Look, right now you are falling back on idle threats of damnation. That's all you have left. Thanks for proving my point you psychopath. At least we do not worship our perverted interpretation of the Bible so much that we condemn people to hell for merely disagreeing with us. You and Archangel did this to actual Christians numerous times here. It's truly fracked up that you place acceptance of what is OBVIOUSLY a metaphorical story over the moral lessons Christ taught. But then again, you aren't actually a Christian. An actual Christian doesn't unsurp divine judgement from God. You've done this for years . The only religious sects that actually believe in Literal Creationism are the Taliban , Extremist Islamic groups that feed terrorists , Extremist Jews who want to segregate women and control every aspect of their lives and insane small groups of bat**** Protestants that are viewed as XXXXXX by the rest of the Christianity. See what I mean? You are not a Christian. And you are such a YEC. Unless you want to argue the past 4 years of your posts don't exist. Too bad I'm not an atheist. It's people like you that give actual Christians a bad name.","Easyrider","467817","I've always said if you don't repent and receive Christ as your Lord and Savior for the remission of sins then there's little doubt you will wind up in Hell. And I have the authority of the Word of God to warn you (Ezekiel chapter 33). If you don't like it go climb on a parking meter. Your lips are moving again... Horse manure. You flaming left-wing liberals can't stand the truth of Jesus Christ, can you? He's the only way to salvation (John 14:6, Acts 4:12, etc.). The rest of those you mentioned can't save you. The New Testament says you're a liar about that. That contrary spirit in you is not from God. It's more likely from your father, the devil. You might want to get that checked out with a Christian psychologist. Jesus warned you people that if you do not believe he is the one he claimed to be (Lord God, Savior, and Messiah) then you would indeed die in your sins (John 8:24). So you'd better pay attention and repent. I think you need to go change your diaper on that one because it was a pile of you-know-what. Liar. Show me the post(s) where I ever claimed to be a young earth creationist, or that the earth was only 6,000 or so years old. Otherwise shut your lying pie hole. Agnostic? Well don't wait up on your Sodom and Gomorrah friends to tell you to repent and receive Christ as your Savior. Nor anyone else around here. Jesus is Lord!","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","07:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","137"
