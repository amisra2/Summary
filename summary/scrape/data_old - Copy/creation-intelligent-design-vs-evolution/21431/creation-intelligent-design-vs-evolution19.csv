I am not going to have a conversation about probability when you state the premise of 5% probability which is based on a complete lie. At this point if you still claim humans do not possess ERV-K you are either stupid or lying. As for your claim above, I never said there were two genomes within one individual. You inserted that yourself because you are desperate. You have not one fact on your side so you resort to tearing down science and making things up. On top of that, you look really foolish when you mock something you don't understand. If you still don't get how one sequenced genome can be an indicator of overall population diversity, then you lose already. You are not smart enough to be having this discussion.","Zosimus","469322","Databed, What does ERV mean? ERV simply means endogenous retrovirus. Any creature could have an ERV in it. There are thousands of ERVs that have been identified so far and I've no doubt more are discovered every day. A simple look at Human Retroviruses - Medical Microbiology - NCBI Bookshelf reveals the claim that ""The human genome contains between 1001,000 copies of such viruses and many of them have become pseudogenes or have various defects."" Now in English when we put ""es"" on the end of the word ""virus"" this signifies the plural. In other words, we are not talking about one virus but rather many. Now you claim that humans have ERV-K in their genome but this just illustrates how little you truly understand about what you are talking about. All ERVs in humans are called HERVs (human endogenous retroviruses). A look at HERV-K: the biolo... [J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol. 1996] - PubMed - NCBI reveals the claim, ""The human genome contains a wide variety of endogenous retrovirus-like sequences. The human endogenous retrovirus type K (HERV-K) family comprises 30-50 members per haploid genome in humans and is highly conserved in Old World monkeys and apes."" A look at http://vir.sgmjournals.org/content/89/2/567.full.pdf shows information about HERV-K113 which is just one of 30 in the human genome. What does this mean, if anything? In my opinion, finding HERV-K doesn't mean much at all for several reasons. First of all, evolutionary theory never predicted finding HERV-K in humans and similar copies in apes so there is no way that this can be counted as confirmation for the theory of evolution. It is, rather, a sign that the theory of evolution is flexible enough to admit almost any evidence that is found. But what does this really prove? No more than that any event can be viewed through the paradigm of Darwinism. Now in your most-recent post you have indicated that you think that I believe that humans don't have ERV-K (as though there were only one and not many). May I be so bold as to suggest that you stop regurgitating evolutionary propoganda willy nilly without understanding it and instead actually do some reading and try to understand what you are spouting instead of just calling people who disagree with you liars? As I pointed out at http://vir.sgmjournals.org/content/89/2/567.full.pdf there is a (supposedly human) HERV-K provirus that is found in chimps, bonobos, and gorillas but not humans. This finding is not consistent with the theory of common descent as you find it in textbooks today. Undaunted our researchers have an ad hoc hypothesis to explain it all away. You see, the researcher argues, this finding makes perfect sense if at first humans and chimps diverged and later that chimp ancestor further diverged to create gorillas, bonobos, and chimps. This is not the only ad hoc hypothesis floating around. If you were smart and knew how to use Google instead of just babbling incoherently about how I must be a closet Christian, you would have found http://ervs-viruses-or-design.wikisp...but+not+humans in the which the author of the paper concludes, ""In other words, common ERVs testify to common ancestors, while the absence of a common ERV does not falsify common ancestry."" Now if you had a brain you would be able to make arguments like this. That would let this ""debate"" (if we can call it that) actually become interesting and intellectually stimulating and then I would be satisfied with this forum. Instead it seems like I must hold up both ends of the debate myself! This is really pathetic that I must search for and make your best arguments for you. But at any rate in the calculation I did in the previous post, I did not assume that one simply ERV shared between gorillas, chimps, and bonobos but not shared by humans automatically refuted evolution in its entirety. As I pointed out, the subjective probability of common descent (as outlined in books) dropped to 25 percent from which it might later go up again as new and better information was obtained. Really, however, neither you nor the author of the paper quoted have any interest in an objective and open-minded look at the theory of evolution because you have an a priori philosophical bias in favor of evolution as a result of your atheistic beliefs. Furthermore, I hasten to point out that the link reinforces that I've already said above, namely that the theory of evolution is constructed in such a way as to be unfalsifiable and then faithful believers in the theory want to take credit for supposed confirmations found along the way even though they are meaningless. To go back to our black raven argument, it would be similar to someone trying to prove that all ravens are black by getting large groups of black birds and finding that some of them are ravens. Every raven found is trumpeted as a confirmation for the theory while every non-raven found does not falsify the theory. In reality experiments like this in which no outcome could ever be considered to falsify the theory are meaningless. The reason for this is that the P(E|H) and the P(E) are always 1 and as such no change in the subjective probability of the hypothesis can be contemplated. Finally, I doubt you would hesitate to dispute with a Christian by using the Bible if they claimed, for example, that they were Christian but didn't believe that there had ever been a flood that wiped out the entire population of the world (save 8 persons).

So now that you have done a little reading and are no longer claiming that humans do not have ERVK within their genome, we can move on. You arbitrarily assigned a probability of 5% based on your misunderstanding that humans do not have ERVK. Now, lets look at the way it really is. ERVK, as I have pointed out previously, is not a point marker that is either present or not present, as you have implied, but rather, it is spread out, duplicated and modified. Each branch of the evolutionary tree since old world monkeys, apes and hominids diverged has its own distinct versions of what is clearly originated from an insertion event within an ancestor common to all three groups. The article you presented, which originated our discussion on specifically ERVK, discussed the scientific finding that human genomes, including that of Neandertal, have been purging ERVK whereas old world monkeys have highly preserved ERVK within their genome. That is it. Nothing inconsistent with evolution there. However, you are using this in an attempt to cast doubt on evolution as if we expect all bearers of ERVK to have exactly the same amount of modification to a genetic pattern and in the exact same way. This is ludicrous because obviously old world monkeys and humans have traversed very different evolutionary paths and you would expect, based on evolution, for them to demonstrate different patterns of genetic change within their genomes. However, evolution also says that since we are cousins, there should be more similarities between our genomes and that of an old world monkey than our genomes and that of a humpback whale. Obviously, this is strong support for evolution because this is in fact what we find. You are right. We have seen enough verification for evolution within scientific findings over our lifetimes. We do not feel the need to confirm evolution any further. In fact, we find people that do need more scientifically dimwitted. No, its like us having seen millions of ravens and each of them is black. Based on this, it is relatively safe to say that all ravens are black. However, since we have seen that all of many species are consistent in color to a very high degree, but sometime demonstrate anomalous coloring based on genetic mutation, we conclude that it cannot be ruled out that a raven could come along that is not black. If a Christian is going to argue that the Bible is infallible, then yes, I will use its obvious contradictions with their argument against them. The difference is that you claim science is not a good method to obtain truth yet you attempt to use it all the time to refute evolution. So, if I am to accept your arguments, I must accept that science can be used to disprove something but never to prove it. You are correct that nothing can ever be proven absolutely 100% without any possibility of ever being supplanted by a better explanation, but to think this way is really ignorant of what science actually does to advance our knowledge, quality of living and general understanding of the universe and everything in it. You can argue philosophy if you want, but you're not going to convince me of anything by doing so.

Yes, Databed, thats exactly what Im saying. Science is a good tool for detecting bad theories but not for detecting good ones! Thats what falsification means trying to falsify a theory experimentally. If Bill Gates owns Fort Knox, he will be rich. He is rich, therefore he owns Fort Knox. This is a logical fallacy. But if I say If my neighbor owns Fort Knox, he will be rich. He isnt rich, therefore he doesnt own Fort Knox then I am not committing a logical fallacy. This is the essence of Karl Poppers contribution to the philosophy of science. Thats why now everyone says (see Scientific Method ) Scientific theories must be falsifiable . In fact, this concept (falsifiability) is why Einsteins theory of relativity is accepted and Newtons law of gravity is no longer accepted. Newtons theory didnt predict gravitational lensing. Einsteins did and when gravitational lensing was observed Newtons Laws of Gravity were falsified . Now that doesnt mean that Einsteins theory of relativity is known to be right. Not at all! Rather we now know that Newtons Law of Gravity is wrong and that is how science progresses. Unfortunately you just dont seem to get it. You said, having seen millions of ravens and each of them is black. Based on this, it is relatively safe to say that all ravens are black. Well, you may think that all ravens are black but a simple look at http://www.vancouverislandbirds.com/...7ravens061.jpg shows you that millions of confirmations for your theory of all ravens being black didnt prove anything at all . With one single photo of a white raven your bad theory got falsified and thats how science really works. So you can say, The fact is, your religious world view is incompatible with my scientific world view and our ways of thinking are totally different all you want but the only thing I have ever done on this forum was to cite the best understanding and arguments of scientific philosophers like Karl Popper and Imre Lakatos. Then, when they dont agree with you, you fall back on personal attacks and strawman arguments like claiming that I said humans dont have ERV-K in them. Humans have some 30 HERVs. So what? What does that prove? Nothing at all. In fact, a simple look at Sir Karl Popper ""Science as Falsification,"" 1963 shows that Popper said, It is easy to obtain confirmations, or verifications, for nearly every theory if we look for confirmations.Confirming evidence should not count except when it is the result of a genuine test of the theory ; and this means that it can be presented as a serious but unsuccessful attempt to falsify the theory. Now maybe you dont like that idea. Maybe you think Karl Popper was a crackpot, but how do you explain that his essay is featured prominently on the website of a (deceased) evolutionary biologist and one of the most respected popular science writers of our time who spent most of his career teaching at Harvard University? Im sorry that youre so ignorant of what science really is and how it really works, but if you spent more time learning about science and less time putting blind faith in it you wouldnt keep getting pwned so badly in forums like this. Now if you will kindly direct your attention to A HERV-K provirus in chimpanzees, bonobos and gori... [Curr Biol. 2001] - PubMed - NCBI you will read the words: A HERV-K provirus in chimpanzees, bonobos and gorillas, but not humans. Now I realize that you are English-language challenged, but if you think about it for awhile you will come to the right conclusion: Not all of the ERV-Ks found in chimps and gorillas are in humans. This finding casts serious doubts on the claim that ERV-Ks in common among simians is a result of sharing a common ancestor. In short, this finding threatens to falsify the theory of common descent. Of course it is always possible that you (and the scientific world in general) will come up with ad hoc hypotheses in order to escape falsification. Once you start doing so, however, your theory is no better than the theory of astrology that sees numerous confirmations of their theory every day and conveniently ignores or explains away any finding that might falsify it. And this is the category into which I put your claim: obviously old world monkeys and humans have traversed very different evolutionary paths and you would expect, based on evolution, for them to demonstrate different patterns of genetic change within their genomes. However, evolution also says that since we are cousins, there should be more similarities between our genomes and that of an old world monkey than our genomes and that of a humpback whale. Obviously, this is strong support for evolution because this is in fact what we find. You may think that this is strong support for evolution but unless this was a legitimate attempt to falsify the theory of evolution experimentally then nothing found means anything at all. Finally, I mention that at At ""Dendrochronology: Tool of Truth or Deception?"" by Stewart Pollens we have the experience of one Stewart Pollens, violin expert, and his frustration with dendrochronology. In this experience he used a popular software and a book to measure the tree rings on his violin (believed to be aged somewhere between 1540 and 1609). His results came back with an excellent match at 1572 (G index 65.7%). Was this a smashing success for dendrochronology? Not quite his software also showed excellent wiggle matches at 1445, 1463, and 1758 with greater than 99 percent certainty! So if we assume that 1572 is the real date (uncertain) that is 440 years before present (BP). A date of 1758 of 254BP is 57.7 percent off and the 1445 date is 28.9 percent off. Is this the best we can expect from dendrochronology? Apparently so and so youll forgive me if I yawn with boredom instead of swooning with delight. Anyone with half a brain can see that you cannot have 4 dates with 99% certainty the numbers just dont add up. But the fun doesnt stop there! He later tried to match his violin up against another dendrochronology (the LADE Siebenlist Obergurgler) and found the best match in the 1830s!! Then he tried to match up his violin against PCAB Schweingruber Obersaxen and found the best match in 1953. Then he tried to match up his violin against Media 46 and found his best match at 1657. In short, the results were all over the place. So in light of his experiences you will excuse me while I remain skeptical in regard to dendrochronology and, by extension, 14 C dating.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","04:00 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","276"

Plato defined knowledge as ""justified true belief"" that is: 1. P is true. 2. Person S believes P. 3. Person S has good reason to believe P (or is justified in believing it). This is the theory of knowledge = justified true belief. This concept came under attack with the Gettier problems. For example, suppose that Farmer Bill has a cow (Daisy) who is commonly in a certain field eating sedately. Farmer Bill has a bad premonition about his cow and rushes out to the field where he sees a black and white paper in the distance that appears to be a cow eating. Relieved Farmer Bill goes back to the house ""knowing"" that his cow is safe and in the field. In reality his cow is safe and in the field, sleeping well out of sight of Farmer Bill. In this case all three of the above conditions are met, but most of us would feel that Farmer Bill doesn't really know that his cow is safe. He thinks she is because of a false observation that happens to lead him to the right answer. Most people who have thought about it therefore have tacked on an additional requirement, namely that the justifications must also be true and justifiable. In the case of the cow, Farmer Bill's observation of the cow grazing was not true (even though he thought it was) so his belief is not really justifiable and he didn't really know that the cow was safe (although she was).","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","10:20 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","282"
"01-28-2013","21431",19,"Databed","469511","The finding in no way falsifies common descent. Maybe you could explain how?","Zosimus","469620","Most of what you said in your previous post was nothing more than strawmen arguments. Accordingly I have selected the only crucial sections to reply to. Let us start by summarizing the pro-evolution explanation of HERVs. It is as follows: 1. Chimps and Humans share certain ERVs. 2. The ERVs are located in the same locations. 3. The ERVs entered into the DNA using the reverse transcriptase enzyme. 4. ERVs can enter DNA at any point. Their placement is purely random. 5. Therefore common ERVs between humans and chimps can only be explained by the theory of common descent because the probability that they entered at the exact same place in the DNA merely by chance is astronomically small. As you remember P(H|E) = (P(E|H) * P(H)) / P(E) so by arguing that it is highly unlikely that common ERV locations could have occurred due to chance the pro-evolution camp is arguing that P(E) is quite low and that because of this, P(H|E) will be quite high. The problem with this reasoning is two-fold. First, let's analyze the situation assuming that what they claim is true, to wit: 1. ERVs in the same location is proof of common descent. adding to this we note that: 2. There are certain ERVs shared by gorillas and chimps but not humans. 3. Therefore gorillas and chimps share a common ancestor that humans do not share. Accordingly gorillas, chimps, and humans do not have an ancestor in common. So if we just run by pro-evolutionist assumptions the discovery at A HERV-K provirus in chimpanzees, bonobos and gori... [Curr Biol. 2001] - PubMed - NCBI destroys the theory of common descent. The second problem is that in reality, the assumptions used by pro-evolutionists in the above argument are known to be false. At ScienceDirect.com - FEBS Letters - Perpetually mobile footprints of ancient infections in human genome we read: ""There were identified `hot spots' containing integration sites used up to 280 times more frequently than predicted mathematically.... A recent study of the de novo retroviral integration demonstrated also preference for scaffold- or matrix-attachment regions (S/MARs) flanked by DNA with high bending potential."" So no, the placement of ERVs in DNA is not ""purely random"" as claimed. There are certain locations that the virus is considerably more likely to select. Accordingly the pro-evolutionary calculation of P(E) as low is not consistent with the data. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Regarding dendrochronology, and the article previously posted, the author obviously thought that PCAB Giertz Obergurgler was the master chronology most appropriate for his violin for two reasons: 1. Since it was strongly suspected that his Brescian viola was made by Gasparo da Salo, who died in 1609, he wanted to use a master chronology that started early enough to select a potential date during his lifetime; and 2. The wood that the violin makers were using is believed to have been drawn from the region that the PCAB Giertz Obergurgler covers. At any rate your ad hoc objections to the claim could not possibly apply against the Media 46 master chronology as it is ""a composite derived from over thirty chronologies, including the other three that I used"" and accordingly it will most certainly cover the Italian Alps directly north of Brescia. The author of the article also ruled out statistical problems with the software he used because ""...determining Gleichlufigkeit is fairly straightforward, and it is often the only measurement cited in dendrochronological reports, including those of Peter Klein."" The obvious problem is that it is not possible to have 52 matches of greater than 95 percent probability. Simple math will tell you that at least 50 percent of those matches must have a probability less than 1.92 percent as 1/52 is 1.92 percent. Really the Gleichlufigkeit that was highest (75.3 percent) shows a date of 1805 which is an impossible date since A) violas of that size were no longer being made in the 19th century and B) the varnish pattern closely matches that of other varnishes used in and around the early 18th century (see the varnish pictures on the right hand side of the link). In conclusion although you may think that dendrochronology is a wonderful thing that makes 14 C dating magically accurate, people who have actually tried to use the technique and had experts use it for them, such as the author of the article say, ""I would strongly advise violin historians, authenticators, appraisers, and purchasers to be wary of the dates that are being published in auction catalogs, certificates, and scholarly journals."" Taking his advice to heart I will say that I am also wary of the dates being supplied in scholarly journals such as the ones your supposed ancient DNA relies on.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","10:02 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","284"
