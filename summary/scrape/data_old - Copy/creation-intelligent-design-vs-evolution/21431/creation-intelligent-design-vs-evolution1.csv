Let me start by saying that I'm not a believer in evolution unless you mean the biological definition of evolution, namely, a change in the frequency of alleles from generation to generation. I don't have a problem with that idea, rather I have a problem with the idea that humans and chimps share a common ancestor, a claim which I consider unproved and indeed unprovable. I am of the opinion that atheists believe these things because they're atheists and evidence (or lack of same) has little to do with it. In this, I point to Dawkin's claim that evolution makes it possible to be an ""intellectually satisfied atheist"" in the sense that it provides some sort of an explanation for life as we know it as long as you don't delve too deeply into it and adopt the standard, ""There are problems with the theory, of course, but science is all about welcoming problems and doing further research with the faith that the answers will be discovered eventually."" That being the case, to any person who admits that he's a beliver in evolution because of his atheistic beliefs, I say, ""I have no quarrel with thee. Go thy way in peace."" No, my beef is with those people who think that evolution is supported by the facts or even proved by the facts or even (more amazingly) that science and/or evolution has disproved God as I consider these claims to be completely indefensible. I'm also interested in anyone who thinks the Bible preaches evolution (that should be a hoot) so feel free to chime in. And please, don't forget to answer the poll.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","12:52 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","1"

If you are as persistent as you are ignorant of what evolution actually is, then you might stick around for a little bit. Lets see, lets see.... Came out firing, huh? Okay, so we're only dealing with the biological definition of evolution...gotcha. Do you mean as opposed to the evolution of the universe? I guess I can accept you definition, but it is way too simple to encompass all that evolution describes. Change in frequency of genes, expressed or not, is part of evolution. The science also deals with natural selection, which clearly you have left out in your description, but it is very important. There are many things that go into that ""change in frequency"" other than just blind chance which you seem to already be implying. Why is it unprovable? Indeed , it has been proven, but I can see that someone who, for whatever reason, believes this to be unprovable, would also be using the same reasoning to call unproven. So can you tell me why it is unprovable? All the above means is that atheists don't make things up. Should we just make things up to give ourselves intellectual satisfaction? Well then what good are you then? You're basically saying that as long as one's logic is bad you don't have a problem. No, you like to pick apart good logic. Okay. No one who isn't a complete idiot thinks that we have proven God not to exist...so are you just trying to get all the XXXXXX to come forth to debate you? don't care about what the Bible says.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","12:15 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","3"

However, these things are things that ""evolved"" due to the interaction and efforts of intelligent actors. Unless you're an intelligent design advocate, I doubt that would be profitable for either of us. I noted the tone of your response as rather insulting and so I hope you won't feel offended when I take the same tone. What comes around goes around, you know. What reason do you or does anyone have for thinking that chimps and humans share a common ancestor? You gave no reason, but you didn't object to Freedom mentioning that there is an apparent similarity between chimp and human DNA. Usually people tell me that it's 99 percent, but as you'll see if you look at (the url had to be deleted as my post count is less than 5) the latest numbers are closer to 96 percent. A deeper reading tells us that all of this information comes from one single male chimp named Clint who lived in Atlanta. Now I could easily go from there into questions as to why anyone would think that this one chimp is representative of all chimps(and I probably will, but in future posts, not this one. Rather in this post I will work around to my point by starting with this allegory: My wife believes (as do a great many Peruvians) that when a child is sick or uncomfortable that this problem can be cured by passing an egg over them and that this egg will draw out of them the fright or illness as it hovers over their body. Later the egg can be cracked open and inspected to see exactly what problem there is with the child. My wife routinely does this with my children and she is quite confident that it works. However, I'm not a believer and I believe I have good reasons not to be. I shall generalize the theory as follows: If I pass the egg over the child (hereinafter ""P"") then the child will feel better (hereinafter ""Q"") so the situation can be represented symbolically as P=>Q (P implies Q or if P then Q). Later the child feels better (Q) and we therefore determine that P has been confirmed. Unfortunately this is a classic example of the ""affirming the consequent"" logical fallacy. Nothing has been proved at all. Rather it seems likely to me (and perhaps to you too) that the child was likely to get better all on his own and so passing the egg over him had no bearing at all on the final outcome. I assume that we agree so far. The problem is that the chimpanzee-human-DNA-similarity argument follows fundamentally the same logical pattern. If humans and chimps share a common ancestor (P) then their DNA will be quite similar (Q). We find that their DNA is quite similar (Q) therefore P is confirmed. In reality the only thing that has been confirmed is that you are sorely in need of a remedial logic class. But wait, you may exclaim, yes it's true that nothing is proved per se but really it should be analyzed statistically. What are the chances that out of the 3 billion or so genes that 96 percent of them would be similar just by chance ? Really the odds are quite staggering, don't you think? Here we have the second logical fallacy: The strawman argument. You see, those people who oppose your claim do not believe that chimp and human DNA are similar just by chance but rather as a result of intelligent (often divine) design. In short, your argument has not accomplished anything at all except to reinforce the belief that you already had. Which leads me back to my original conclusion: You believe in evolution not because the facts support it but rather because of an a priori philosophical bias in favor of evolution due to your atheistic beliefs. You see, the only way that you could hope to prove that chimps and humans share a common ancestor is to prove that there was one (and only one) incident of spontaneous generation of life in the past. If that could be proved, then humans and chimps sharing a common ancestor would be fait accompli - however, evolution apologists normally back away from all discussion of abiogenesis as ""having nothing to do with evolution."" Now I don't know whether these people are dishonest, ignorant, or both, but the claim is demonstrably false. The (Neo-Darwin) theory of evolution has everything to do with abiogenesis. It seems to me that either the chance of life arising spontaneously for no reason is either so extremely remote that it could never happen even given an infinite stretch of time or that it is common enough that it did happen and that being the case, why not believe that it has happened not once but several times ? Either way the nail is in the coffin of the theory of common descent. But before I close I wanted to note your passing reference to the theory of natural selection. This theory has serious problems and a simple look at the peacock makes them glaringly evident. According to the theory of natural selection the peacock did not originally start with a long, ornate tail but rather it developed the same over generations of natural selection. Unfortunately for you, this is so ridiculous that it almost makes one laugh aloud. Who could seriously advance the idea that having a long and cumbersome tail like that makes the bird better at finding food or evading predators? Of course it does nothing of the sort, rather it makes the bird easier to be converted into some carnivore's lunch. This is, of course, why the theory is usually presented in such a way as to be tautological. ""Strange as it may seem,"" we are told, ""the peacock actually was the fittest, which we know because it survived."" Surival of the fittest where the ""fittest"" are those who have survived. So we have the remarkable theory of the survival of those who have survived. So while it may be hard to argue that this theory is false , we can at least argue that the theory is supremely unuseful as it provides no predictive value. It's untestable, unfalsifiable, and can hardly be considered scientific. Of course we usually have evolutionary apologists retreating to the tacking paradox. ""Evolution is falsifiable,"" they claim. ""All you have to do is find a rabbit fossil in the Cambrian period and voila !"" Of course they don't accept the same logic when Christians employ it. If someone were to say, ""We believe in Jesus the Christ, a god of order who has created an orderly universe. All you have to do to disprove our religion is to prove that the universe is disorderly and voila !"" then I seriously doubt that a good number of atheists would suddenly accept that Christianity is testable, falsifiable, and should be taught in science classes in public schools whereas they do think the theory of evolution should be taught. It's rather hypocritical, don't you think?","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","01:58 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","8"
