"01-16-2013","21431",18,"Freedom","468938","This is often true when the language used is ambigous or sensationalist but when you state something like ""the genome was sequenced"" either you are flat out lying or it was sequenced. The dating is frankly irrelevant. If it's a 100 years old that means we had a common ancestor a 100 years ago. The chances that similarities in the DNA exist by chance are too low to be considered a possibility. Why did you laugh, a species is very similar to itself genetically. Can you compare a jeep and a civic from two examples? Of course within the tolerance of diversity within the jeep or civic population. I'm sure they were testing it out on degraded modern DNA. If you want to speculate that modern degraded DNA is different in an important way than ancient degraded DNA be my guest. 3,000 years ago could be the latest time any living human can trace their ancestery and connect it to the rest of living humanity. If the humans who broke off from 'modern' humans are all dead these two reports are not contradictory.","Zosimus","468982","No, it's important to read the original source because newspapers give only general accounts. What I look for is not what was found but how it was found. For example the newspaper said that the group diverged from humans some 800,000 years ago. In the actual study it says, ""We estimated the... population divergence... to be 170,000-700,000 years."" This was done by comparing the number of differences between chimpanzees and modern-day West Africans and extrapolating. You'll excuse me if I'm not impressed by a method of dating divergence that is accurate plus or minus more than 60 percent. I also note, ""Assuming 6.5 million years of sequence divergence between humans and chimpanzees, the bone [can] be tentatively dated to between 74,000 and 82,000 years before present....However, we caution that multiple sources of error may affect this estimate."" Somehow the newspaper forgot to mention what the article really said: That multiple sources of error make what was reported to be more of a guess than a finding. Most of their estimates were made using the TreeMix software. The benefits of the software for researchers are simple in that it offers sustantial data mining opportunities and a number of flexible models that permit you to pick which model you want in order to get the results you desire as opposed to having a rigorous test that allows you to test whether the model fits the data. I wonder how much monkeying with parameters went on before they found the settings that gave them the results they were hoping to find. Apparently not enough because they admit, ""While this procedure does not provide a perfect fit to the data (for example, it does not model Neandertal admixture), it agrees with our previous finding that Denisovans have contributed to the genomes of present-day Melanesians, Australian Aborigines, and other South-East Asian islanders."" Well that's a relief that even though it doesn't fit the data that way that at least it does confirm their preconceived biases... er... findings. I also thought it was amusing that they determined that the DNA strands broke more often around guanine, according to their research, which means that ""guanine nucleotides are frequently lost from ancient DNA, possibly as the result of depurination."" This also permits them to throw guanine nucleotides in where needed to fill in the missing DNA. Of course where guanine doesn't match up well that could be one of the few times they throw in a different nucleotide so that things work out as they need them to. I also read with amusment this part: ""To estimate average per-base error rates in the Denisovan genome we counted differences between the sequenced DNA fragments and regions of the human genome that are highly conserved within primates [approximately 5.6 million bases, (8)]. The error rate is 0.13% for the Denisovan genome, 0.17% to 0.19% for the genome sequences from the eleven present-day humans, and 1.21.7% for the two trios sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Pilot project."" Isn't that amazing that they were able to obtain a lower error rate for 82,000 year old DNA than experts could with modern-day DNA freshly extracted from humans! They truly are skilled.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","10:31 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","256"
"01-16-2013","21431",18,"Zosimus","468922","You don't seem to get it at all. You say that I don't seem to understand the relevance of ERV-K findings. I do understand their relevance: They have none. You see, you have a theory (T) that predicts findings (F). Then when you find those things (F) you think that confirms T. This is a classic example of the ""affirming the consequent"" logical fallacy. Now maybe you are of the opinion that one logical fallacy proves nothing but several thousand of them can prove Darwinism. I, however, am of the opinion that large numbers of logical fallacies prove the exact same thing that one logical fallacy does, namely, nothing. But while we're on the subject of carbon 14, let's take a look at New Research Documents Extremely High Atmospheric Carbon 14 During Last Ice Age | UANews wherein we find that all evidence points to carbon 14 having been higher in the past. Now maybe you're shrugging your shoulders and saying, ""So what?"" Here's the point: The half-life of carbon 14 is believed to be around 5730 years. For simplicity sake, let's assume that we have a piece of wood that has a small amount of carbon 14. Now we start by saying, ""We believe this wood to be 9,000 years old."" So they go to ice core samples or dendrochronology work and tell us what the 14 C levels were estimated to be 9,000 years ago. Now I seriously doubt that they can really know that, but let's ignore that argument for the moment to hone in on the one I want to make. Let's imagine that they say that 9,000 years ago the 14 C levels were x and based on that the wood turns out to be 8,600 years old (plus or minus). Victory is proclaimed and everyone goes home. In reality, however, it is entirely possible that the wood is really only 2,870 years old. Why do I say that? Well, if 14 C levels were ""x"" 8,600 years ago and 0.5x 2,870 years ago then both samples will have the exact same amount of 14 C in them today (because of the half-life). Now the math here is simplified just to make a point but the point is this: As long as 14 C was higher in the past than it is now there will always be multiple possible dates for each fragment of wood tested. The date that is selected will always be the one that confirms what scientists already believe. This is what we call confirmation bias - The Skeptic's Dictionary - Skepdic.com Sorry but I remain a skeptic.","Databed","469020","No, it affirms T. Lot's of things affirm evolution. In fact, billions of little pieces of the puzzle have been uncovered and they all affirm evolution. Together, all these little affirmations start to look more and more like confirmation. However, in order to debunk evolution, all you need is one little piece of the puzzle that fits nowhere. You seem to have given up finding this little piece in favor of a philosophical assertion that no one can ever know anything. It is thinking like this that results in someone who does in fact know nothing and in doing this you demonstrate your total lack of understanding of what a theory actually does. If you think I need a mathematical proof to support my assertion that evolution is in fact the correct theory of how life developed, diversified and came to be in its present state, then you are a lunatic. Again, for the 47th time, it is NOT, NOT, NOT a deductive argument that I use to support my acceptance of evolution as a proper theory. We are speaking two different languages here: yours is that of an unthinking automaton and mine is that of a realist. Do you even understand how carbon dating is calibrated? We have a carbon bearing object whose age and source of carbon is known. We measure the carbon 14 content. We back calculate to obtain the atmospheric carbon 14 ratios for its known date of origin. We create a table containing lots of data for different objects of known date of origin. This is the calibration curve. Now, we have several different methods for dating a carbon bearing object. One is historical information associated with the object. Another is to use wood with an intact tree ring structure. This is dendrochronology and apparently you have a problem with it although the reasons you have expressed make no sense - I don't think you actually understand how it works. Another method of figuring out historical carbon 14 ratios is to use trapped gas within bubbles found in ice cores or from organic material found in ice sheets. Since ice sheet layers can be dated very reliably this method is fairly sound. One thing to keep in mind is that curves developed by different methods are more or less consistent with each other. However, no one claims that the curves are perfect. This is one reason why dates based on carbon 14 dating are given as a range. Now, once you have a calibration curve, you can measure the carbon 14 ratio and calculate how long ago it had a level consistent with atmospheric levels. Again, you could get more than one answer here, but only by a small bit and both numbers are necessarily within the age range expressed as the determined age of the object. The problem here is that you act like scientists are trying to hide all of this. You act like they don't already know there is error within their methodologies. The truth is, they do know what they're doing and they are honest with their answers. This isn't to say that mistakes are impossible and that nothing is assumed or extrapolated to fill in missing data. But to sit here and discount the science as completely false shows extreme ignorance as to how science actually works. By the way, I see that yet again you totally failed to respond to the bulk of my post. Again, I assert that you are a religious kook.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","04:56 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","257"
"01-17-2013","21431",18,"Zosimus","468920","Ok, first of all, when you post links don't post from sciencedaily.com or some other newspaper. These things are worthless. Rather than that post something like http://genetics.med.harvard.edu/reic...enisovaSeq.pdf which is the actual study summary because that lets me (and everyone else) read what is really being said instead of what the newspapers choose to tell us. The first thing I read was the big bold part, which says: ""We present a DNA library preparation method that has allowed us to reconstruct a high coverage (30X) genome sequence of a Denisovan, an extinct relative of Neandertals. The quality of this genome allows a direct estimation of Denisovan heterozygosity indicating that genetic diversity in these archaic hominins was extremely low. It also allows tentative dating of the specimen on the basis of missing evolution in its genome, detailed measurements of Denisovan and Neandertal admixture into present-day human populations, and the generation of a near-complete catalog of genetic changes that swept to high frequency in modern humans since their divergence from Denisovans."" Now I'm sure the authors of the study are very well meaning, intelligent, well read, unbiased, etc., etc., but when their dating method of the sequence is due to ""missing evolution in its genome"" then I think you can see how this quickly turns into a circular argument. I also laughed aloud when I saw that they were able to determine the level of genetic diversity of the entire sub-population due to a partial sample from one person. That's rich, man... really. Anyway we are to believe that they have a new, high-tech and very accurate method of recovering and reconstructing very old DNA. Now I ask you this: How do we know that it is very accurate? Did we take known DNA from today, put it in a time machine and warp it back several thousand years, bury it in a place where we could find it, dig it out, and run it through the system so we could know it worked well? Or what? I also laughed when I saw that these ancient humans branched off from modern humans some 800,000 years ago. Why just yesterday I read 'Most Recent Common Ancestor' Of All Living Humans Surprisingly Recent which indicates that the most recent common ancestor of all humans lived a mere 3,000 years ago. That sure makes it hard for them to have diverged 800,000 years ago.","Databed","469084","I missed this post by Zosimus - I was going to ignore, but there were of course some things that needed addressing. Look, you keep demanding information from me that you claim does not exist. All I do is go to Google, put in a quick search and post to you the first couple of links I find that verify that you have no clue. If you want to delve deeper into the subject matter, why don't you do that prior to posting such easily refutable claims? It's in no way circular. What are you even talking about? Secondly, if you think they only rely on this as a dating method, you are wrong again. I think that statement was more to demonstrate just how well the specimen they collected was sequenced. The sample contains genes from mother and father you clown. Over the many, many genes within the genome they are able to determine diversity to a fairly high degree. Are you seriously asking or just getting really desperate at this point? Do you honestly believe that they can't tell whether or not their sequencing is accurate? Just looking back at this, it actually makes sense. Now, i seriously doubt that this is correct because this guys mathematical model does not take into account that some groups have been completely isolated for thousands of years. Look at it this way. You have millions and millions of ancestors. In a perfectly dispersing population, mathematically, one of those ancestors should actually fall into every single persons ancestral tree. You are probably used to seeing a family tree that branches and becomes more complex as you move forward in generations. However, it actually does so in the reverse as well. In fact, in reverse there are no dead ends. By the way, I hope that you are able to grasp the difference between the last common ancestor of all LIVING humans and that of all humans and Neandertals. If If all the humans on Earth were to die except for a small family, then the mother and father of that family would then fit the bill.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","01:15 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","258"

Again, I assert that you are a religious kook.","Zosimus","469103","You think that it affirms (T) but you don't say what that affirmation consists of. Makes more probable? How so, exactly? Normally calculating probabilities like this are done using Bayes Theorm. I have already posted about this but perhaps you didn't understand it so let's start from the very, very beginning. In order to use Bayes Theorm we must know that probability of the hypothesis (H) a priori . Now we don't know this, but we have the Principle of indifference - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia which states that since there are two possibilities for Darwinism (either right or wrong) that our starting probability should be 50 percent (1/2). I am an open-minded person and so I adopt a 50-50 chance for Darwinism. Now we have a study showing that females do not prefer males with large, ornate trains. No relationship has been detected related to eyespot symmetry, size, number, or anything else that relates to male reproductive success. This is what we call the evidence (E). What we want to calculate is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence. We write this as P(H|E). Now Bayes Theorm says that: P(H|E) = ( P(E|H) * P(H) ) / P(E) Now I think we all agree that the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis is quite low. Darwinism theorizes that traits that do not foster survival and/or reproductive success do not endure. Accordingly the P(E|H) is less than 1 percent. Really, I would have to know how many genes are involved in creating the tail and how likely those genes are to have occurred purely by chance and then we'd have to measure how much the long train harms peacock survival. Now in order to do this calculation we need to know the probability that the evidence is true (from a Bayesian point of view). P(E) = P(H) x P(E|H) + P(H-wrong) x P(E|H-wrong) and that's (0.5 * .01 + .5 * 1) at most 50.5% P(H|E) < ( 1% * 50% ) / 50.5% P(H|E) < 0.99% So that's my calculation for how likely Darwinism is - at the most optimistic it is 1 percent. Now let's run the numbers for creationism. Again we start with P(H) = 50% Now we note that chimps and humans have 96 percent of their DNA similar to chimps. We'll consider P(E)=100% and run the numbers. P(H|E) = (100% * 50%) / 100% = 50% You see the probability of creationism hasn't changed at all. The reason for this is because the P(E) and P(E|H) are always 100 percent. There is no evidence that you can find that is not 100% compatible with creationism. All a creationist has to do is shrug his shoulders and say, ""God made it that way for a reason that only he can understand."" Accordingly no amount of experimentation can ever budge the chance of creationism away from our initial guess at its probability. That's why we say that creationism is not a subject for scientific inquiry . Since it cannot be empirically falsified our estimation of its probability will forever remain unchanged at whatever starting number we use. Of course your proposed solution for falsification in Darwinism is ad hoc hypotheses. If you take this route then the only thing that happens is that Darwinism becomes what creationism is: An unfalsifiable, non-scientific article of faith for the devout to accept as is. Now as for 14 C dating a simple look at Fluctuation of atmospheric C14 during the last six millennia - Damon - 2012 - Journal of Geophysical Research - Wiley Online Library shows that 14 C levels have fluctuated up to 30 percent just in the past 6,000 years. 14 C was higher in the past. Now the question is: How long does it take 14 C to drop by 30 percent? To do that we need to solve for x such that x 5730 = 0.5 So x = 0.999879 meaning approximately 0.0121% of 14 C is lost per year. So now the question is: How many years will we need before 14 C drops by 30 percent. In other words 0.999879 x = 0.7 So that means x (log(0.999879)) = log (0.7) so x = log (0.7) / log (0.999879) = 2,947 years is how long it will take 14 C to drop by 30 percent. What does this mean? That means that a piece of wood from a tree in the past that died on a specific day would have the same amount of 14 C in it as a piece of wood from a tree that died 2,947 years previously if the 14 C at that time in the atmosphere was 30% higher. Yet people will tell you that 14 C dating is very accurate considering that the half-life is known to within +/- 40 years. Ha! Anyway how are these 14 C concentrations calibrated? Yes, as we've already discussed it's from dendrochronology - but I certainly hope you don't think they cut down 1 tree that was 6,000 years old and got the 14 C out of it! No, no, that's not how it's done. First we can take a tree that's alive today and cut it down and maybe the tree is maximum 200 years old so that will (theoretically) give us the 14 C levels for 200 years. So then you have to find another tree was cut down maybe 100 years ago and match it up to the tree you have to extend back to 300 years. This is called ""wiggle matching."" Now problems with wiggle matching were first pointed out in 1986 in a paper by Yamaguchi in which he pointed out that a specific tree known to be in the 16th century could be wiggle matched with 99.9 percent confidence to 113 different places. This problem with wiggle matching was already pointed out previously in the link I had previously posted, but I guess you didn't read it or didn't understand it. You can try reading http://cio.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/roo...ronkRamsey.pdf which starts, 'The calibration of a single radiocarbon date from the notional "" 14 C age to the true calendar age almost always results in a considerable loss of precision.' No kidding. 'There is, therefore, no single valued, differentiable, inverse function which can be used for calibration.' It's worth reading. I especially enjoyed the part on 'measurement bias.' As you said in your post, it's not that scientists aren't aware that their measurements are probably wrong and rely on estimations, assumptions, and are often refuted by later field work. Of course they're aware, it's just that these admissions (which are so freely made in the actual studies) somehow rarely make it into the newspaper coverage of the purported ""finds."" No, my complaint is not just that science is completely unreliable. My complaint is not merely that scientists are biased. My complaint is not merely that the so-called 'scientific method' doesn't even exist. My complaint is not that even if the scientific method did exist then things like astronomy, which everyone agrees is 'science' wouldn't be classifiable as science since they don't do experiments - rather they watch the skies and report on what they observe. My complaint isn't even that the history of science is replete with examples of scientists persecuting other scientists and doing everything possible to prevent real advances in knowledge from occurring, like what happened with Doppler and what is currently happening with Halton Arp. My complaint is that no definition of 'science' can possibly include Darwinism because it just simply isn't science. It's not testable, falsifiable, or open to experimental exploration. It is, at best, a tautology. At worst it is a group of ad hoc hypotheses masquerading as science in order to give atheists a semi-plausible worldview with no epistemological basis. As such I don't see one lick of difference between Darwinism and creationism or even intelligent design. And I hereby reiterate my charge: You only believe in Darwinism because you have an a priori philosophical bias due to your atheistic mindset.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","03:44 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","261"

Let's see if we can reconstruct your argument. You know that evolution is true because ERV-K remains are found in human DNA as well as chimp DNA in sections of the genome that science has no clue what purpose it serves. When I pointed out that humans share ERV-K similarities with rhesus monkeys that are not shared with chimps - a finding that has the potential to falsify the claims you have made. In that you have responded with the claim that ERV-K copies are being purged from the genome. This is an unknowable speculation on your part and on that of the researcher. You would need to have human DNA that was thousands of years old that you could compare with DNA of a direct descendent to even begin to make that claim credible - something that you don't have and likely can't get as DNA starts to be degraded almost immediately. In response to that you state that DNA greater than 5,000 years old has already been obtained and this date is deduced by (drumroll) assuming that evolution is true! So you assume evolution is true, and reason around in a circle to prove that evolution is true? Why waste time? Just embrace the napkin religion: It's the only true religion, which you can know because it says so right on the napkin!! Now as for genetic diversity. How do you know, for example, that the child wasn't conceived as a result of an incestuous relationship between brother and sister or father and daughter?

So it is not surprising that the cracks in the edifice are showing up first in the biomedical realm, because research results are constantly put to the practical test of improving human health. Nor is it surprising, even if it is painfully ironic, that some of the most troubling research to document these problems has come from industry, precisely because industry's profits depend on the results of basic biomedical science to help guide drug-development choices. Scientists rightly extol the capacity of research to self-correct. But the lesson coming from biomedicine is that this self-correction depends not just on competition between researchers, but also on the close ties between science and its application that allow society to push back against biased and useless results. It would therefore be naive to believe that systematic error is a problem for biomedicine alone....

Ok, here is the conclusion of the link you provided on methodologies of creating calibration curves based on dendrochronology. What a bafoon you are. I did not say that - and I don-t care what newspapers print. Ok, so lets look at it then: I posted a whole host of predictions that evolution makes. They are confirmed all the time with new findings. Sooo, the predictions are tested all the time and so is the theory. Science does not require a theory to be tested in a laboratory. We can have this argument if you want, but you will lose if we do. Well this is an outright dumb thing to say. I can think of a million things we could find to falsify evolution. Its not fair to claim that something is no falsifiable just because you've been unable to falsify it! Sure it is. Lets experiment on the Neandertal genome. I hypothesize, based on fossil evidence that Neandertals were interbreeding with homo sapiens. This is based on a sudden explosion in Neandertal art at a time when their numbers were dwindling and homo sapiens numbers were increasing. Lets run an experiment that compares the two genomes to see. And......what do we find??? I think you know by now. Ok, and you are a religious nut. At least I back up why I believe what I believe. You just sit in denial... No, no, no no no, ....you fool . What is wrong with you?? You are a complete XXXXX. Listen very carefully, or read rather....ALL PRIMATES ALIVE TODAY POSSESS ERV K WITHIN THEIR GENOME. PLEASE GET THIS THROUGH YOUR THICK 2% NEANDERTAL SKULL. Wow, you are so desperate!! Ok, look at it this way (I feel like i'm explaining this to my 4 year old): Say I have 1,000 genes. Of those genes I have one copy from both parents - so two total copies. Now, some of the time I would expect those copies to be different, and sometimes the same. The frequency at which like genes occur will give me an idea as to how many different copies there are within the total genome. EVEN if the parents were brother and sister, their genes STILL reflect what THEY inherited from THEIR parents. So, are you getting it? Now, of those 1,000 genes, the copies are like 33% of the time. Therefore, I can deduce that there are on average three copies of each gene exist within the gene pool. So what happens if you have a father and daughter having a child? Well, it doesn't matter because it would be statistically the same as JUST looking at the father or just looking at the daughter!","Zosimus","469271","Dear Databed, You are using a system (science) that is known to be based on a logical fallacy. Nowadays almost every scientist that you speak to about the problem of induction will either shift uncomfortably in his seat and change the subject, go red in the face and insult you, or say that he is a Bayesian. Now you may be wondering exactly what the Bayesian approach to the philosophy of science is, exactly. Don't worry you can easily read it at http://www.strevens.org/research/sim...lity/Bayes.pdf and if you can't understand the math you can always go to https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability and watch a video on statistics and probability. What I posted in the post was my calculation of the subjective probability of neo-Darwinism (commonly called the modern evolutionary synthesis) which I have called ""evolution"" since the beginning of the thread. Now I am really surprised that I do some math and your only response is ""So stupid..."" Let's try again, but from your point of view. Since you are a true believer in evolution we will assign the probability of evolution P(H) to 100% i.e., 1. Now we will look at A HERV-K provirus in chimpanzees, bonobos and gori... [Curr Biol. 2001] - PubMed - NCBI in which we find that there is an HERV-K in chimps, bonobos, and gorillas but NOT in humans. Now since the theory of common descent argues that HERV-Ks found in chimps and gorillas should also show up in humans (since we theorize that the HERV-K infected first the ancestors of gorillas and chimps, this explaining why they both have the HERV-K), this finding obviously poses a problem for the theory of common descent, which is a subset of the theory of evolution. Now we want to do the calculation of the probability of evolution given the evidence, which we'll say P(H|E). Those of us who paid attention in statistics class know that P(H|E) = (P(H)*P(E|H)) / P(E). Now we need to figure out the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. I think we can agree that it's quite low. If humans, gorillas, chimps, and bonobos share a common ancestor then it's pretty unlikely that gorillas, chimps, and bonobos will share an HERV-K while humans don't. Let's say 5 percent. Now we need to calculate the probability of the evidence. Since P(H)=1 the math is quite easy. We know that 80 percent of non-randomized published studies are wrong so we can just use P(E) at 0.2. Now the math! P(H|E) = 5% / 20% = 25 percent. So if you were a rational, well-informed and open-minded human being, that's the subjective probability you should assign to evolution after seeing this study. Now, of course, you're not. Evolution is absolutely essential to your worldview so you have zero interest in a rational response to this study, especially if it might require you to take non-evolutionary theories seriously. Now regarding 14 C concentrations in the atmosphere, I tried searching for them by going to Google but as you can see no information springs to hand immediately. So I tried another search and only found New Research Documents Extremely High Atmospheric Carbon 14 During Last Ice Age | UANews which doesn't contain actual data. Now if you have the actual data, then let's put it up here so we can go over the math until everyone is satisfied. As for 14 C and dendrochronology I refer you back to the original link I posted when this whole thing started: Carbon Dating 2 and I quote: Unfortunately, this method of calibrating Carbon dating by using tree-ring dating is itself flawed. Dr Walt Brown explains, ""links are established based on the judgment of a tree-ring specialist. Sometimes 'missing' rings are added Standard statistical techniques could establish how well the dozen supposedly overlapping tree-ring sequences fit. However, tree ring specialists have refused to subject their judgments to these statistical tests and would not release their data so others can do these statistical tests"" (Walt Brown, In the Beginning, 2001, p. 246). This refusal to submit their work to close scrutiny raises a reasonable concern, especially in light of the apparent circular reasoning employed by the researchers. ""Wood specimens considered for 'long chronologies' are first radiocarbon dated. If the date is old enough (perhaps by an erroneous reading), tree-ring specialists look at ring thicknesses for a way to extend the 'long chronology'. This chronology is then used to assure the public that radiocarbon dating has been calibrated by a continuous sequence of tree rings. So I ask you now: If these matches are so good, what's wrong with releasing the data so they can be analyzed statistically to ensure that everything is on the up and up and that they're not just fabricating what they need to make things work out as they want? Sorry if this seems tedious to you, but I want my science to be clear, unbiased, and reproducible. Finally, as I have said before, evolution is unfalsifiable. Let's look at the theory of natural selection. It is supposed that those animals who are fittest will tend to survive and produce more offspring. The question is: Which ones are the fittest? To test this let's suppose that we take an island with certain finches and release a breeding pair of domestic housecats on that island. What will happen? Well, perhaps the cats will fail to get enough food and will die without breeding. Perhaps the finches will be completely wiped out. Perhaps the cats will reach a certain equilibrium state where they eat some finches but some finches survive. Perhaps finches with certain features will survive. The problem is this: No matter what outcome is determined, pro-evolutionist apologists will claim that their theory has been 'confirmed.' No matter what happens the results will be judged as perfectly in line with the theory of natural selection. This is because the theory of natural selection makes no predictions ahead of time; rather it is a method for rationalizing the results after they have been found. Finally, I must completely misunderstand what you mean in terms of a child having two sets of the genome. They do not, of course, they have one set - half from each parent. Accordingly there is no way of knowing from a child's DNA more than half of what his parents' DNA was comprised of, and this will be no more than 25 percent of what his grandparents' DNA was like.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","10:23 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","266"
