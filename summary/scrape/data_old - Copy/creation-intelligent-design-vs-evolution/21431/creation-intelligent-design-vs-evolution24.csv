"02-15-2013","21431",24,"Freedom","470397","Actually he said it was a religion. I agree, or at least it fills the same function as religion in many leftist brains. A cause around which to base all moral judgements, a fairy tale world of happiness called ""before man stopped acting like the rest of the animals"", and like Zosimus said a doomsday scenario in which man will pay for his sins and die while mother earth lives on without the infection (except for the happy few who saw the light and live in stone age communes forever more).","Databed","470422","It's not a cause to base moral decisions on except in the sense that it is moral to leave something in the same condition you acquired it in. If you really think man is powerless to cause changes on a global scale, YOU are the one who is deluded. Were we not just having a discussion where the claim was made that man has offset the C14 ratios? Did we totally miss the Exxon Valdez? What if we had not been able to plug the well in the Gulf of Mexico? And then for this guy to come in here and claim that insects create more atmospheric co2 than that of man who pumps 10 trillion pounds of oil a year from under ground is so misinformed, so naive to any of the science behind global warming it is embarrassing that I am contributing to the same forum this bafoon is on. Like I have said before, my stance on global warming is that of being aware and not finding yourself powerless to reverse course. I would add that if it is stupid to claim that you can predict that global warming will occur as a result of dumping carbon it is many times more stupid to claim that it will be a good thing to dump carbon. To claim that continued dumping of carbon will have no effect at all is just idiotic. All that being said, either side of the argument is somewhat weak and I don't want to continue on the subject. I just wanted to say that saying environmentalism itself is a religion is extremely arrogant and so far off base it's obvious all of this is coming from the clear insecurities in the op's obvious religious background.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","01:41 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","348"

Miller, Jr., MD Second, you have questions about what I've posted. Let's start there. Supposedly in 1929 Edwin Hubble determined that the universe is expanding. From The Expanding Universe we read: ""In 1929 Edwin Hubble, working at the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, California, measured the redshifts of a number of distant galaxies. He also measured their relative distances by measuring the apparent brightness of a class of variable stars called Cepheids in each galaxy. When he plotted redshift against relative distance, he found that the redshift of distant galaxies increased as a linear function of their distance. The only explanation for this observation is that the universe was expanding. ""Once scientists understood that the universe was expanding, they immediately realized that it would have been smaller in the past. At some point in the past, the entire universe would have been a single point. This point, later called the big bang, was the beginning of the universe as we understand it today."" The problem with this theory is a galaxy known as NGC 7319. As you can see below: We have a high redshift quasar (z=2.11) visible in the middle of the NGC 7319 galaxy (z=0.0225). Now according to the Big Bang theory this is simply not possible because the quasar must have been ejected from the Big Bang first and must be travelling at a very high relativistic speed in order to generate that much red shift. As such it must be far beyond the low redshift galaxy yet it is clearly visible. Some comment about the photo can be found at Observation of a high redshift quasar in the low redshift galaxy NGC 7319 could refute black hole theory The explanation for what we see is unknown. The person who took the photo (Halton Arp) is actually a very accomplished astronomer with a Ph.D. from CalTech. Thanks to his Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies we know a lot more about what's going on out there than we would without him. However, science is never happy when you discover things that aren't on the approved discovery list so he has been denied any further access to telescopes in the US but has found a home in exile at the Max Planck Institute in Germany. Of course, anyone who knows much about science realizes that this is standard operating procedure for science. Just take a look at Ohm, Doppler, or Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. Finally Venus is tidally locked with the Earth. If you don't know what that means, let me explain: Venus's 583.92-day interval between successive close approaches to the Earth is equal to 5.001444 Venusian solar days, making the same face visible from Earth at each close approach and that's what I mean when I say ""tidally locked."" If you need to know more, try Tidal locking - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia which also explains how this happens. Now anyone who knows much about tidal locking will tell you that this happens when two planets are very close (as close as a moon and a planet) and gravity causes this lock to happen in the same way that our own moon is tidally locked. However science denies that Venus ever made close passes on the Earth and those people who suggest that it may have happened get their own ""Velikovsky affair"" wherein scientists exerted such extreme pressure on his publisher (Macmillan) through threatening to stop buying their textbooks unless they censored him. They even went to far as to have Carl Sagan supposedly debate him, but in reality Sagan simply launched an attack on his ideas and when Velikovsky showed up Sagan made himself scarce so no debate actually happened.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","12:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","353"

Why do you always feel the need for the remedial lecture on such basic concepts? First off, I want to point out that NGC 7319 is part of its own local group. Comparing red shift between the group, objects within the group, objects within a galaxy or objects within our own galaxy does not follow Hubble's law as these are gravitationally bound bodies. Therefore, they can influence each other and relative red shifts will not be inherited from the original Big Bang event. I want to point this out because you seem to be implying that all objects in the universe must follow Hubble's law. Another lesson for you: galaxies, though they appear solid, are extremely diffuse. Think about how tiny our sun is compared to vast distance to the next closest star. The numbers are actually astronomically in favor of the Sun, given the eventual collision of the Milky Way and Andromeda, surviving unscathed. It's not just likely that the Sun will survive, it's just about guaranteed. That being said, why would it be surprising to see a quasar, an immensely energetic celestial object that can be seen from clear across the universe, peeking from behind another galaxy? The answer is that it is not at all surprising and actually, not sure why you would choose this particular instance, but it happens all the time. Halton Arp was active in astronomy decades ago. While his ideas may have carried some promise in the sixties, trust me, we now understand what quasars are. If quasars really did still exist locally, we would know it 100%. Believe me, they don't. Halton Arp's theory of red shift relies on quasars being completely mischaracterized today. Yes! You are right! Science often starts off with much doubt in theories that later come to be accepted. Unlike your religious beliefs, scientific theories have to fight, survive, struggle and eventually be right in order to come out on top. There are many that don't make it. Halton Arp falls in this category. Wow, you would bring up Velikovsky, a man who's life mission was to discredit scientific explanation of pretty much anything that didn't agree with biblical history. What's more, of course, he's a very religious man who claimed that Venus is actually a comet ejected by Jupiter. I wasn't aware of a debate with Sagan, but trust me, if Sagan turned down the opportunity it was because Veikovsky was not worth his time. I know what tidal locking is. I would like to start by saying that you can't see the face of Venus and I can find no source that says Venus always faces Earth in the same way on each close encounter. There is an 8 year cycle between Venus and Earth due to the peculiar fact that 8 Earth years is almost exactly equal to 13 Venusian years, give or take a day or two. Not sure why this is, but it certainly doesn't discredit our theories on how solar systems are formed. I'd like to clear something up, unless you specifically state ""theories of OUR solar system formation,"" anyone who knows anything is going to take that to mean in the general sense. That is, how solar systems are formed in general . Arguing over the specifics of how our solar system was formed is pointless to our line of discussion and does nothing to change how we think about the evolution of the universe, the theories explaining it or the laws governing it. I think you might want to choose a different angle of attack here. I promise that if this is the best you got, recycling something you've grabbed off of the website of some philosopher who has some kind of crazy electrical fetish, it is just not going to cut it here. The best you have done is to raise a couple of peculiarities - there are many more I'm sure you could find, but you're not debunking any major scientific theory and you're certainly not wowing me.","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","09:11 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","355"

Maybe you should do a little research into what tidal locking actually is. Even a quick read of the wiki link you seemed to think that I needed in order to understand what tidal locking is would serve you well? Secondly, the fact that Venus shows us roughly the same face at every closest approach is merely a coincidence. Maybe if you did a little research you into the actual numbers (please don't use a bunch of whole numbers as these are not precise enough for this) you would find that you are in fact wrong. Venus rotates very slowly and every time we do come to our closest approach, it has rotated a little further compared to the previous approach. So, you are, yet again, wrong. Both reasons are laughable. To say ""the dust in this part of the galaxy is so dense"" without being able to see it is never done, especially for an object located so far from the galactic center. I can't see any dust in that picture in that area - I can see some near that area, but not where the quasar is. No astronomer who knows anything would ever make this statement or agree with the conclusion drawn from it. I do see the trail of dust referenced, but it terminates before it gets to the quasar. It points to it, but it doesn't even seem to reach it. Further, there are trails of dust all over galaxies and they are clearly visible. Just because a quasar, which there are literally millions visible, happens to fall near the end of one of them, some quack from the 60's and 70's is going to jump on this and start claiming that comets get ejected by gas giants and that high red shift quasars are spit out of local galactic centers.

Secondly, if there is a resonance that has developed due to billions of years of slight gravitational tugging, which i believe is likely the case, it still wouldn't be tidal locking.
