Easyrider is still unaware of what blue links are. By the way, I see you are still refusing to answer the question how old the Earth is. Not that I'm surprised. You are, after all, a YEC. You just lie about not being one despite the following: He's not a YEC...but threatens everyone who argues evolution is true with internal damnation He's not a YEC...but backed up Archangel for years on his YEC claims He's not a YEC...but argues everyone who thinks evolution is true is an atheist He's not a YEC...but attacked Christians who thought Genesis is metaphorical weren't Christians and were going to hell He's not a YEC...but attacks people who think evolution us true for thinking their ancestors were ""cave-dwelling, large-foreheaded knuckle-draggers, etc.""","why-do-you-believe-not-believe-evolution","06:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","156"

In fact, here's a post where I previously responded directly to your YEC question and confirmed to you I wasn't a YEC . http://www.4forums.com/political/rel...tml#post361250 So not only are you a liar but you're a friggin dead head, where responses go in your eyeballs and then right out your lying butt.[/B]","obvious_child","467859","If you actually believed that, why did you back up archangel for years in his attack on evolution? Why did you make attack people who backed evolution for believing that their ancestors were ""cave-dwelling, large-foreheaded knuckle-draggers, etc?"" Why do you still refuse to answer how old the Earth is? Why did you for years threaten eternal damnation to everyone who argued the Earth is old and YEC is wrong? You can pretend you aren't a YEC, but that doesn't erase years of your postings. You won't answer any of my questions , because you are in fact, a YEC. If you think you're fooling anyone here about your actual beliefs, you're kidding yourself.

And you STILL can't produce a single post where I ever claimed to be a young earth creationist. In spite of you claiming there are ""thousands"" of them.

EZ has stated many times on this forum that the 6 days of creation in the Bible is not 6 actual days but six ' periods of indefinable time'( my definition). Any Christian must believe in a more or less ' creationist' world even if they believe that God created the mechanism of evolution.
