So I'm going to hit back. 1) A global flood, if it did occur, would have left fossils of every species in every strata as it laid down sediment. We should find all over the world, the same species in the same strata. No where on Earth do you find fossils of dinosaurs, mastodons, Precambrian shellfish and primates in the same strata. The flood was thought to have been extremely violent; churning up huge volumes of water this would have mixed the carcasses of species into one homogenous layer, advanced creatures with less advanced all whirling around in the cacophony of death together. While heavier species would have sunk faster, we should see more or less homogenous strata all over the Earth. This occurs nowhere on the planet. 2) The global flood should have left homogenous sediment layers across the world, similar to the Iridium layer that the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs left on the Earth. No such layer of sediment exists for that time period. 3) The necessary water to cover the Earth would have been astronomical. The oceans cover roughly 2/3rds of the Earth. That is sea level, to cover the highest point, Everest (29,028 feet feet above sea level), would require JUST to raise sea level, 756,821,205 Cubic miles of water. The fundemental problem is that the Oceans, seas and bays make up 96.5% of total water on the Earth and they only have 321,000,000 cubic miles. That leaves a huge amount of water that would need to come from somewhere. http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/DanielChen.shtml There's simply isn't that much water on Earth to allow such a flood. Some argue that the mountains werent that tall yet. That makes no sense whatsoever given the rates of tectonic plate drift. Plates move at 1 inch a year. Thats 500 feet over 6,000 years. Everest is by far taller then that. Some argue that plates moved faster. To create Everest in 6,000 years would mean plates would have to move almost five feet every year in the same direction. While plate movements are related to the Earths core heat, the necessary heat to have that much movement would mean the Earths core would have to be hundreds of times hotter. Thats way more then the surface of the Sun. 4) The global flood says that the world was covered by water. The problem with that is such an infusion of water would have created brine. As the water receded and evaporated, huge amounts of salt would have remained on the land. Very few plants can grow on salted Earth, and those who can are not agricultural crops. Virtually every creature in the oceans has a low tolerance for salinity change. A slight change can result in massive dieoffs. That would mean, as the salinity rapidly changed, that many creatures, if not virtually all would have died from osmosis. That means Noah would have had to keep two of every species of oceanic creatures onboard the ship. Given the measurements, the boat cannot hold two of every whale and shark. Even worse, as most of the oxygen comes from algea and seaweed, the change in salinity and pressure would have killed off the producers of oxygen. Life simply couldn't exist after a flood of such proportions. While some modern species can survive in salinity conditions very different then their norm, most cannot survive for extended periods of time, such as 40 days. Furthermore, their prey sources often cannot survive that long as well. Even more alarming is that if the alga managed to survive, the death of billions of life on Earth would have resulted in decay which results in nutrients which would have resulted in alga explosions like no other, removing oxygen from the oceans, suffocating every living thing left. 5) Some say that the water came from underground, a mile to be percise. The problem with that is the water would be superheated. Releasing 756,821,205 cubic miles of superheated water would have boiled everything to death almost instantly. The oceans would have also boiled away, killing all marine life, fresh water lakes would have done the same. The mantle of the Earth is 100 Celsius. Therefore the steam would be roughly that hot. Thats 212 degrees Fahrenheit. 756,821,205 cubic miles of 212 degree Fahrenheit water in a world that is typically no hotter then 80 degrees average would be instant death to everything. 6) Finally, flood geology requires the compaction of 4.5 billion years of comet, asteroid and meteor strikes into a single year. The problem with that is the energy from such impacts would have to be compacted as well, and we all know that the energy is converted into heat. 3 x 107 kg x 4.5 x 109 years worth of meteorite flux =1.35 x 1017 kg of meteoritic material fell during the flood year. The energy imparted by this amount of material is equal to: 1/2 M V2, where M is the mass of the extraterrestrial material, and V is the velocity at which it falls to the Earth (equal to the escape velocity, or 11200 m/s). This gives: 1/2 (1.35 x 1017 kg) * (11200 m/s)2 = 8.5 x 1024 Joules. So the Earth's atmosphere would have had to accomodate 8 x 1024 J of energy from this falling meteorite matter. We can do a quick calculation to determine the amount of heating this would cause: Energy = Matmo * Cp *(T), where Matmo is the mass of the atmosphere (5 x 1018 kg), Cp is the pressure constant for air (about 716 J/kg * K for N2), and T is the temperature change of the atmosphere. Solve for T: T = Energy/ (Matmo * Cp) = 8 x 1024 J / ((5 x 1018 kg) *716 J /kg * K) = 2,400 K. So the temperature change of the Earth's atmosphere would be about a 2,40 K increase in a single year. That's over 3860 Fahrenheit. The flood never happened and by proxy creation as well. That however, does not invalidate Christanity as many Christians view the bible as a moral and value oriented book, not a accurate history book.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","03:38 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","1"

The King Kong argument? If the Med had been flooded there would be a lot of evidence. There is none. The closest thing is a supposed flooding of the Black Sea at the end of the last glaciation, which hasn't gone away. We can go through a lot of the old testament this way, Archaeology directly contradicts the account untill David and Soloman. That means no Exodus, People have been over the Egyptian heiroglyphs since they were decoded looking for the accounts of that episode. They aren't there. What's more if you look at the archaeology of Isreal the Isrealites weren't monotheists. There were polytheistic temples untill they return from Babylon (which is where the Epic of Gilgamesh came from) and the temples are violently destroyed. This would apear to be the beginning of monotheism and it is a pattern we've seen repeated across Europe. The adoption of monotheism is never peaceful.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","06:15 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","3"

I'm just so thankful that you have come along to help me. How could I ever argue against creationist nonsense without you? Thank you so much! Exactly correct. In fact, not many creationists claim that the entire geologic column was produced by the flood. However, none of them can point out, at any location, the bottom of the flood deposit, or the top of the flood deposit. These should be evident. I see I jumped the gun. That was well stated. I've done this calculation several times. I even saved it for some years. I guess I threw it away. At any rate, your calculations are quite conservative. As I recall, it would require about 4 times the total water on earth to cover the mountains, and my calculations were on the conservative side. So the question still is, where did the water come from and where did it go. OK. That's probably correct. I did the calculations in cubic kilometers. True. But even worse, even if there were some unknown mechanism to cause such movement, it would generate heat. The heat generated by the creation of the mountains of the world would be more than enough to reduce the entire surface to molten lava. Add to that the fact that the condensation of the ""vapor canopy"" would release enough heat to boil all of the water on earth. The flood did not last 40 days - it rained for 40 days. The flood lasted for a bit over a year. However, I think that you need to rethink your algae bloom scenario. Above you state that algae are the oxygen producers, and now you state that they remove the oxygen. Make up our mind. But thank god that you have come to rescue us from these wise, intelligent, educated, and lucid creationists. Ah. More heat. Just what creationists need. Yet more heat. However, creationists deny that there are any sign of meteor or comet impact. That is one of the Hovendites favorite arguments. If the earth is old, then why aren't there craters like on the moon? The craters on the moon were caused, of course, by the battle between Satan and St. Michael (really! so said John Morris of the ICR). OK. However, in another thread you talked about ""proof"" of science. Talking about ""proof"" and science in the same sentence is pretty much a creationist thing. When one asks for or claims proof of a scientific theory, it is a pretty good sign that we are dealing with a scientific illiterate. Science does not prove, it explains.

I have yet to meet a creationists who used a honest argument, granetd many are ignorant but many are massive frauds who betray and abandon the teachings of Jesus. I guess the more you talk about him and the related issues the less you have to act like him eh? They are conservative for a single reason. The Earth's land is not the same altitudes. Some places are extremely high, some lower then sea level. There's no way I could figure it out correctly. However, sealevel is uniform and it makes up 70% of the surface area anyways. Simply proving that if if the oceans necessary requirements are ridiculous is enough. The extra 30% is just a extra kick in the ribs, unnecessary. It was magic water! not the alchohol kind and God snapped his fingers and it all happened!, pardon me while I laugh so loudly the creationists in the 1400s can hear me Well, then I'd have to convert everest to kilometers. I live in the US. Metric is alien. haahh. True, not to mention the energy released from that much water falling, which apparently comes out to something like 6 inchs a minute for 40 days and night straight. 6 inches a MINUTE! Sick, and that's apply the total earth's surface, so it's really more as my calcs have excluded the earth's land surface that would need to be covered by water. The flood did not last 40 days - it rained for 40 days. The flood lasted for a bit over a year. Gotcha. Well, they actually do both. Remember algae produces energy through photosynthesis but like all other plants, consumes oxygen as well. My point is such a massive growth would remove huge amounts of oxygen initially killing everything. Sure they would eventually replace it as algae died off, but it wouldn't matter then. Are you serious? How do they explain away the iridium layers in addition to the fossils that no longer appear once such layers appear in the geological record? And aren't they forgetting that the moon has no atmosphere or life to degrade the impact craters and cover them with plants and etc? But you need proof to back up a explantion.

In science, our acceptance is always tentative - which is not to say in doubt. It's just that in order to prove a scientific hypothesis it would be necessary to examine every case in every place in every time that the hypothesis might apply. We can't do that, so we can't ""prove"" an hypothesis correct. Of course, an hypothesis is just a guess, based on experience and/or intuition. From that hypothesis we make a prediction of an observation that must necessarily be true if the hypothesis is correct. We then devise a test or experiment to test the prediction. If we observe the predicted phenomena, then we have supported the hypothesis. With enough severe testing our hypothesis may become a theory. However, at least in principle, there may exist conditions somewhere under which our theory will not hold. It has happened before. Take Newton's theory of gravitation. They held under all possible cases for 200 years or so. By your judgement, Newton's theory was proven. However, Einstein found conditions under which Newton's theories were wrong. So Newtonian gravitation was amended to take relativity into consideration. Then again the theories of gravitation were amended to account for quantum mechanics. Newtonian physics became a special case in the larger theory. Se what I mean? Theories are explanations that have been supported to the extent that it would be foolish not to grant them provisional acceptance.

Perhaps I should have used evidence rather then proof no? The fundemental problem with explaning that to creationists is that they immediately interpret it as science can't back anything because the basis of it is tentative rather then rationally realize what normal people do: that science is improves based upon new evidence. Then they go into the bull**** claims about how their specific religion's dogma hasn't changed (falsely of course) and the circle starts all over again, it is ultimately futile gesture. Still I think you got hung over my interchangable use of proof and evidence. There is always something new to learn.","pandion","230549","That would have been better.

Maybe it is because I have struggled in teaching the concept to students that I react to ""science has been proved"" statements. I certainly jump all over creationists who ask for proof of scientific theories. They don't understand that it is theoretical that the earth orbits the sun, that hydrogen fusion is the source of the energy from the sun, that gravity (always called a law by creationists) is only a good guess (hypothesis) at this point as far as science knows.

D = mass / volume. so we've got 1 = x / 700,000,000 anything divided by itself is one. so that means for every cc (cubic centimeter or millimeter), water weighs one gram. 700,000,000 cubic miles. I convert it to cubic feet, which is 3.696E12. convert to cubic centimeters, and you've got 1.04659065004E17. or 104,659,065,004,000,000. 104.5 quadrillion cm^3. just replace cm^3 with grams, yuo've got your wieght. it's 1.04659065004E14, or 104,659,065,004,000 trillion kilograms. 104.6 trillion kilograms < 6 heptillion (?) kilograms. the earth's wieght is 57,329,004,418, or 57 billion, times heavier.","obvious_child","230665","It won't.

This suggests that the text was rewriten at some date after the introduction of monotheism. Going by the archaeology this would be about 600BC. 4) Perhaps, but then you would be disputing the text...

I am sure there was a bit of cross cultural contact between Juddah and the biggest empire in the area. If the contact was mundane enough, it can no way be 'The Exodus'. There have been several waves of immigrations and emigrations over the 2000 years since the decline of Ancient Egypt, not to mention the great influx of foreign peoples during the 3,000 years of the classical period. Ancient Egypt was an attractive place, and traders came from every country of northern Africa, the Middle East and many European countries as well. Many settled, and some left their trace on the Egyptian population from sexual relations with locals. Egypt was also attractive to invading armies, soldiers of which often settled in the conquered land and married Egyptian women. Slaves represented the third type of immigration. Slaves came from foreign lands, either as trading merchandise or as war prisoners. As both male and female slaves could marry and have children, they also left their mark on the Egyptian population.","Another opinion","231035","No one here is arguing that ""The Exodus"" happened (here I am assuming that you mean something akin to what was written in the Bible), so I don't know why you keep bringing up that point. As for there being a more mundane incident, I am sure there were thousands of mundane incidents - most of which did not involve Israelis - that were too mundane to record in the manner that would be readable thousands of years later. The population of ancient Egypt apparently ranged from about 1.5 to 6 million, depending on the period. If foreign workers from other lands were also coming and going, a few thousand Israelis coming and going, spread out over tens of years would probably not register a tremendous amount of interest. Things that were mundane for the great civilization of Egypt might well have been very significant for the small and relatively insignificant state of Israel. We have to look at perspective here. As an outline of the changing population of Egypt, from http://lexicorient.com/e.o/egypt_a.htm: With so many people coming and going, why would the Egyptians have considered the fate of a relatively small number of Israeli traders, workers or slaves (hundred or thousands perhaps) as significant? Only significant things were purposely recorded for posterity. That leaves accidental evidence, where the discovery of the Israeli-style home, though admittedly just a small clue, could still reveal the presence of Israelis in Egypt. Is simply makes sense that a poor people living in a harsh climate might at certain times have had workers working in a neighboring rich country. It happens all the time today. I don't know why you seem to have a mind-set against any Israeli workers being in Egypt.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","10:24 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","46"

I think we can probably agree that a mass migration of many thousands of people in one go as described in Exodus is unlikely. Often the nomadic groups in those days were fairly small in numbers individually, although there could well be a large number of such groups I would think it extremely possible that over a number of years a number of the groups may have left Egypt for whatever reason. Could have been religious. Some may have been chased by Egyptian troops. Eventually after much wandering I believe that they became united under one leader and off they went. No doubt a long oral tradition remained of this and in the making of the book of Exodus the various journeys became amalgamated into one mass migration under the protection of the Lord arriving and conquering the Holy Land. AS we ourselves in this day and age can spin and exaggerate small events for political purposes, I do not see that there is any reason why the Exodus could not have been similarly created. The Exodus as a whole was clearly an important part of Jewish history, but the movemement of small groups of nomads would be utterly unimportant to the Egyptians. They might have been somewhat annoyed if a part of their labour force (i.e. a specific group) took off and sent a force after them, but without much luck. The Good Lord delivered them. So an exodus and thence joining of many groups probably did take place and takes a revered part in Jewish history even if it didn't occur exactly as written.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","10:32 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","47"

Anyway, the parallel between the two stories mostly seems to be in the ordering of the stages of creation - six stages followed by rest. Though certain stages and certain orders would have to exist for any creation myth that subdivided creation in to sections, the fact that it was six and not five or ten or three stages does suggest some cultural communication. Such a connection is especially easy to believe since I understand that Abraham started off in Mesopotamia where he and his people certainly would have had access to these stories. I have always found it fascinating to discover the origins of beliefs and customs and to try to understand the context in which certain customs and beliefs arose. Where Christianity is concerned, the range of early Christian beliefs is amazing - far, far wider than exists today.

Where does the article indicate that this water ever came to the surface? And if it did, why did it and how and why is it back below the earth. Science is more than just making claims about unrelated hypotheses. You should be laughed at (rightfully) for making such claims without offering any mechanism that brought the water to the surface, dispersed the heat, and returned it to the mantle. Just because you want to believe it doesn't mean it isn't silly. As has been pointed out, the water, if it came to the surface, would have been superheated and flashed to steam immediately. There is also the fact that the condensation of water in the atmosphere into rain would also have released enough heat to boil the ocean. In order to flood the earth would above the mountains would have required more than 4 times the water now present on earth. If you try to claim that the mountains were just low hills that arose after the flood, then you run into even more heat problems, since mountains are either tectonic (which causes heat) or volcanic (the result of the heat from tectonics). Then you have to find a solution to the problem of the various biota that had to migrate across oceans - if you wish to claim that the continents were all together and them moved at super speeds, then you again run into heat problems.

Syracusia [Ships of the World: An Historical Encyclopedia] Ships of the World: An Historical Encyclopedia ^ | prior to 2006 | Houghton Mifflin Posted on 01/28/2006 8:46:55 PM PST by SunkenCiv One of the most complete descriptions of a ship from antiquity is that described by the Greek writer Athenaeus. Writing in the second century ce, but basing his account on more contemporary descriptions (now lost), he described a huge grain ship built by Hieron II, king of Syracuse from 269 to 215 bce. Lionel Casson considers this to be the largest ship built in antiquity... There were cabins for 142 first-class passengers on the second deck in addition to accommodations for steerage, the lower deck being reserved for cargo and the upper deck for soldiers, said to number 400. The first-class passengers could use a library, a gymnasium, promenades lined with flower beds, a chapel dedicated to Aphrodite, a reading room, and a bath. Twenty horses could be carried in separate stalls, and there was ample provision for fresh water and a saltwater fish tank for the cook's use. The ship was also heavily armed, being defended by marines stationed in eight deck towers who could fight the ship from the bronze tops of the three masts or from a raised fighting deck. The latter was fitted with a catapult of Archimedes' design capable of hurling an 18-foot dart or 180-pound stone 600 feet. The number of crew is not specified, but the account says that ""although the bilge was extraordinarily deep, it was bailed by only one man using a screw pump, one of Archimedes' inventions."" (Excerpt) Read more at college.hmco.com ... TOPICS: History; Science; Travel KEYWORDS: godsgravesglyphs The Roman emperor Caligula had a number of 200 ton columns moved from Egyptian quarries to Rome, by ship, suggesting ships larger than this! Lionel Casson notes that the large grain haulers running wheat from the Nile Valley to Rome were also very popular methods of transport for travellers. Here's another tidbit that speaks to pauls ship wreck that is documented in the book of Acts. This just goes to confirming the accuracy of the bible. Finding one of these giant grain haulers would add a great deal of knowledge of ancient shipbuilding. Examining the Evidence for the Shipwreck on the Munxar Reef Associates for Biblical Research Mr. Cornukes investigations on the island of Malta led to the conclusion that the shipwreck occurred on the eastern end of the island of Malta, rather than the traditional site at St. Pauls Bay on the northern side of the island. His view is that the Alexandrian grain ship containing the Apostle Paul and his traveling companion, Luke, was shipwrecked on the Munxar Reef near St. Thomas Bay on the eastern side of the island. Mr. Cornuke claims that he located local spear fishermen and divers who told him about six anchor stocks that were located near or on the Munxar Reef. Mr. Cornuke has suggested that these six anchor stocks came from the shipwreck of Paul (Acts 27:29,40). Four of the anchor stocks were found at fifteen fathoms, or ninety feet of water (Acts 27:28), these would have been the ones the crew threw over first. The other two were found at a shallower depth and he thinks these were the anchors the sailors were pretending to put out from the prow (Acts 27:30). He identifies the ""place where two seas meet"" (Acts 27:41) as the Munxar Reef and the ""bay with the beach"" as St. Thomas Bay (Acts 27:39). He concluded that neither the sea captain, nor his crew, would have recognized the eastern shoreline of the Maltese coast.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","08:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","136"

You might be interested in educating yourself further by reading THAT BOAT DON'T FLOAT . Notice the the ships under discussion in that article were 329 ft. and 325 ft. in length. Along with the other 8 wooden keel & hull ships built around this time, they all leaked badly. They were all lost in rough seas. None were ever used as ocean crossing transports. Most were used as coastal haulers. The Great Republic foundered less than 640 miles from the North American coast when she was almost to Bermuda. Indeed, it is. It's called engineering; in this case nautical engineering (or naval architecture). It has a lot to do with understanding the limits of the materials with which one is working. Wood is just too flexible to serve as either keel or hull of ships of around 300 ft. or more. Certainly. The Syracusia probably wasn't the largest ship from antiquity. I don't know why everyone always ignores the Chinese who had an advanced civilization and a written language long before the alleged flood of Noah. They build huge ships that actually rivaled the ark in size. But they were not constructed according to the plan for the ark in the Bible. They were built from several smaller, water tight modules that were then lashed together. Thus, they could snake and hog without springing the hull. And of course, the Egyptians also build ships much larger than the Syracusia. They did it by building a series of hulls that were then fastened together with struts that formed several trimarans. On top of this was laid a huge platform that accommodated gardens and temples, etc. As for the Syracusia, she was undoubtedly impressive for the age in which she was built, but not all that impressive against the Chinese, Egyptian, or American offerings. The Syracusia was about 180 ft. long and has no relevance to the argument that a 450 ft. wooden vessel that exceeds by 50% the structural limits of wood could have survived a 40 day storm and a year at sea. Nice try. Your other ships aren't that large either. Why do you think that ""large grain haulers"" were as large as the ark? As for your tidbit about Paul, who cares? How does that show that Genesis is not pure mythology? I suspect that Paul embellished a bit to boot, just as every evangelist from then to now has done.

Syracusia [Ships of the World: An Historical Encyclopedia] Ships of the World: An Historical Encyclopedia ^ | prior to 2006 | Houghton Mifflin Posted on 01/28/2006 8:46:55 PM PST by SunkenCiv One of the most complete descriptions of a ship from antiquity is that described by the Greek writer Athenaeus. Writing in the second century ce, but basing his account on more contemporary descriptions (now lost), he described a huge grain ship built by Hieron II, king of Syracuse from 269 to 215 bce. Lionel Casson considers this to be the largest ship built in antiquity... There were cabins for 142 first-class passengers on the second deck in addition to accommodations for steerage, the lower deck being reserved for cargo and the upper deck for soldiers, said to number 400. The first-class passengers could use a library, a gymnasium, promenades lined with flower beds, a chapel dedicated to Aphrodite, a reading room, and a bath. Twenty horses could be carried in separate stalls, and there was ample provision for fresh water and a saltwater fish tank for the cook's use. The ship was also heavily armed, being defended by marines stationed in eight deck towers who could fight the ship from the bronze tops of the three masts or from a raised fighting deck. The latter was fitted with a catapult of Archimedes' design capable of hurling an 18-foot dart or 180-pound stone 600 feet. The number of crew is not specified, but the account says that ""although the bilge was extraordinarily deep, it was bailed by only one man using a screw pump, one of Archimedes' inventions.""","Archangel","260530","Why would I admit such foolishness ?

It could very well have existed. Noah would just be one of those drowned in the flood, but the ark very well might have existed - it just couldn't have served its actual purpose: you know that whole FLOATING and not breaking up part of its purpose . And yes, the little noah myth was copied from the Epic of Gilgamesh, and yes, on this thread, and I believe many others while discussing just with you (not to mention our discussions with SS and other, earlier creationist nuts) have posted multiple, if not innumerable links for you and them. Ah, so now you are implying that Noah had a bilge on board as well (sure didn't see THAT in the flood myth of the Bible)? And you're ignoring all of them animals (two of EVERY kind - or was it SEVEN, wait, I forgot that the bible can't keep its stories straight)? This does nothing to destroy any claim - this ship is over half as small as the ark is claimed to be, and even here you can see all of the leaking problems. So, apparently, you have to twist the Bible, and add to it (wasn't there a few verses about that being a big no-no?), to maintain your ridiculous views. I'm really not suprised - hint: the bible shouldn't be taken literally, nor seriously - those who do end up twisting and adding to it to maintain their beliefs (not to mention outright lying). I didn't think you would make any apologies - you don't seem to be one that accepts reality. Noah's Ark is accepted by literalists to have been around 450 feet long. That is WELL OVER TWICE AS ING BIG as your ""example"" here - as such, it well exceeds the structural limit of wood.

There were many wooden keel/hull ships that exceeded 180 ft. For example, Cutty Sark at 212.5 ft., Thermopylae at 212 ft., USS Constitution at 204 ft., HMS Victory at 227 ft. (the gun deck was 186 ft). Victory had a total of 6 decks (guns on 4 of them). And, of course, there was the Wyoming, at 329 ft., as well as her 6 sister ships - all over 300 ft. - all leakers - all foundered in rough seas when the hulls sprung and the pumps could not keep up with the water. None of them are evidence that the ark was possible. The ark was supposed to be 450 ft. long. I'm not claiming that 180 ft. wooden ships were not possible. Clearly they were. But the structural limits of wood are exceeded at about 300 ft., even if the hull is reinforced with steel cross-bracing, as was the case with the Wyoming, her sister ships, and the Great Republic. In other words, THAT BOAT DON'T FLOAT . But wait! There's more! The Bible describes the ark as a big box with no means of propulsion that was supposed to have endured a violent storm for 40 days. In Dec of 1944 the U.S. Navy lost 3 destroyers in a single day from a storm (2 Farregut class destroyers at 341', and one Fletcher class destroyer at 376'). All three of these ships had headway until their engine rooms were flooded. When that happened, the waves turned them sideways to the wave front. Since the wave height was greater than the beam of the ships (34 and 39 ft) they capsized. Only 35 of the crews survived - 775 (or more) perished. So tell me.

Windjammers had to turn stern to the wave front, but no matter how bad the storm, and no matter how many sails were shredded, they still had to fly enough sail to maintain steerage. Modern ships turn bow to the wave front. The three destroyers lost power due to flooding and were unable to keep their bows into the waves. The were turned broadside and capsized.

And what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?"" Mat 24:4 And Jesus answered and said to them: ""Take heed that no one deceives you. Mat 24:5 ""For many will come in My name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will deceive many. Mat 24:6 ""And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled; for all[fn1] these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. Mat 24:7 ""For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences,[fn2] and earthquakes in various places. Mat 24:8 ""All these are the beginning of sorrows. Mat 24:9 ""Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name's sake. Mat 24:10 ""And then many will be offended, will betray one another, and will hate one another. Mat 24:11 ""Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many. Mat 24:12 ""And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold. Mat 24:13 ""But he who endures to the end shall be saved. Mat 24:14 ""And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come. You interjected yourself by wrongly accusing me of misstating that this Age will end by fire. You implied I was in error and I defended that principle. And since then you have attempted to make me out to be some charlatan who doesn't really know what the bible say's when it is you who has misquoted and misrepresented it at every single turn. I will defend the Word of God against anyone who misrepresents it. If you don't want me to expose your lies about Gods Word then don't challenge me. The problem with this verse in using it to judge me, is that it is speaking to those who are in rebellion to God which would mean it is better directed at you rather than me. See ? So charlie, I must conclude by the numerous verses that you have posted, all of them out of context and misrepresenting their true meaning that you lied about attending a bible College and about ever being a devout Christian. You my friend are a fraud. Now I don't want to be at odds with you so I'm willing to start over if you are.

"04-30-2007","8816",14,"charlie horse","261031","@ Arch - why is Matt. 24:13 out of context? Have we reached the end, or are we still in the last days? Either way, how do you account for being eternally saved? Nope. Read 2 Cor. 5:20 again. You should be an ambassador for Christ trying to reconcile people to God. Such ambassador you are not. 2Cr 5:20 Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore you on Christ's behalf, be reconciled to God.","Archangel","261049","We are in the last days. But if one truly receives the Holy Spirit, they must literally command it to leave them and it then would do it meaning they have committed the unforgivable sin and would be lost forever. But here are some verses that speak to being saved. Ask yourself if a murderer can be saved. Can He ? You tell me what you think is scriptural and then I'll tell you what I think is scriptural. Rom 5:10 For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life. Rom 8:24 For we were saved in this hope, but hope that is seen is not hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees? Rom 9:27 Isaiah also cries out concerning Israel: ""Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, The remnant will be saved. Rom 10:1 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for *Israel is that they may be saved. Rom 10:9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. Rom 10:13 For ""whoever calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved."" Rom 11:26 And so all Israel will be *saved, as it is written: ""The Deliverer will come out of Zion, And He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob; 1Cr 1:18 For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 1Cr 3:15 If anyone's work is burned, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire. 1Cr 5:5 deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. 1Cr 10:33 just as I also please all [men] in all [things], not seeking my own profit, but the [profit] of many, that they may be saved. Note the bolded. Paul is speaking to the Church at Corinth and telling them to be reconciled to God. It isn't even about reaching out to the unsaved who seek to disprove God and mock Him or the believers who follow Him. Here's verses 15-21. See if you can understand it in its proper context. 2Cr 5:15 and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again. 2Cr 5:16 Therefore, from now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him thus no longer. 2Cr 5:17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new. 2Cr 5:18 Now all things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation, 2Cr 5:19 that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation. 2Cr 5:20 Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore you on Christ's behalf, be reconciled to God. 2Cr 5:21 For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. So what does this have to do with being nice to people who distort and lie about what the bible say's ? Didn't Jesus throw the money changers out of the Temple when they were treating it like a business ? There's such a thing as righteous indignation and it isn't a sin.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","07:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","204"

That's not the problem here. Arch argues that Genesis happened in a literal sense. The problem is that there is no evidence for Genesis in a literal sense. Therefore we have a problem. So either God did Genesis as the bible states in a literal fashion and he covered all evidence up (which makes him a deceiver), or that he created a world different from Genesis again which makes him a deceiver. God as a deceiver is heretical to Christanity. This point has been made to Arch several times. He refuses to deal with it. When he posts Fox tv props as proof of creation and uses known lies, calling him a liar is merely stating the obvious. We all know that no one is going to convince Arch of anything. The poor man can't tell the difference between a petri dish and welsh Corgi. What we can do is expose the flaws in his evidence and his beliefs. His outright hostility towards people examining his belief scares me though. Also one can be honest with believing that God is a liar. Arch has huge gapping holes in his theological beliefs in the context of reality. He has stated that sciences that deal with billion year old things are 'fairy tales.' I made several comments about geology to him the context of finding fossil fuels. He hasn't addressed a single one.

"05-01-2007","8816",15,"Archangel","261003","For correction and further clarification, you have completely misrepresented what this verse means. Here it is in context with the verses that come before and after it. Mar 3:26 (Jesus speaking) ""And if Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end. Mar 3:27 ""No one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. And then he will plunder his house. Mar 3:28 ""Assuredly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they may utter; Mar 3:29 ""but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation""-- The bolded is the passage you posted to imply that Christians can lose their salvation. The passage actually is about blaspheming the Holy Spirit and how that is an unforgivable sin, which a believer would never do. Now ask yourself this !

"05-01-2007","8816",15,"charlie horse","261120","@ Arch - Interesting that 'proper context' is your version. You've really lost the plot, Arch. And obfuscating a Biblical passage does you no credit. Yes, surrounding verses can supply a context, but not always necessary. Let me enlighten you. I'm sure you can recall 2 Tim. 3:16 - All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness. WHY? ... that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work. Clearly you should be able to see that more than one piece of learning can be had from a particular Scripture. If you want to learn about certain problems within the congregation at Corinth, you can view surrounding verses. If you want to learn about the qualities expected of a Christian, you can look at 2 Cor. 5:20 and see that Paul and other evangelisers considered themselves ambassadors for Christ. Now link that to 2 Tim. 3:16 and you may begin to see what qualities are expected of a true Christian. Christ overturning the tables of the money changers was a display of righteous anger. So remind us again who displayed this anger. That's right. Christ. Your's isn't righteousness indignation, your's is self-righteous anger. Prov. 21:23 - He that is keeping his mouth and his tongue is keeping his soul from distresses. Eph.4:29 Let a rotten saying not proceed out of YOUR mouth, but whatever saying is good for building up as the need may be, that it may impart what is favorable to the hearers. 31 Let all malicious bitterness and anger and wrath and screaming and abusive speech be taken away from YOU along with all badness. Romans 12:17 Return evil for evil to no one. Provide fine things in the sight of all men. 18 If possible, as far as it depends upon YOU, be peaceable with all men. James 3:13 Who is wise and understanding among YOU? Let him show out of his fine conduct his works with a mildness that belongs to wisdom. Why, Arch? Col. 1:10 in order to walk worthily of Jehovah to the end of fully pleasing [him] as YOU go on bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the accurate knowledge of God, You're not a Christian, Arch. None of the above Scriptures apply to you. You just enjoy stirring up contention. And what sort of Christian has the temerity, pretentiousness and self-righteous arrogance to call themselves Archangel ? By what stretch of the imagination can you equate yourself to Christ? If you want to debate, then debate. But you need to regain the plot you lost a long time ago.","Archangel","261124","Ok, now these verses are much better and in context to the message you're trying to send. As a Christian we are to gently use the Word to draw people to the truth. And if you and I met and spoke of spiritual things that is how I am at all times. But charlie, this is a debate board so bone up. And I responded directly to you condescendingly correcting me as I shared the spiritual principle that the World was destroyed by Water once but will be destroyed by Fire the next time. You attempted to say that wasn't true when it is totally true. I produced the passage in second Peter and you have continued to rip passages out of context and try to say things with them they never intended to say. Sorry if hearing that bothers you. But you have been doing with Gods word exactly what the great deceiver did in the Garden and when he tried to tempt Jesus in the Wilderness. And what he does everyday to the average person, and that is to use the Word to draw people away from God rather than use it to draw people toward His truth. You may not like the tone of my posts but you can't deny that I'm defending God and His Word against rabid anti christian sentiments as promoted by you and others like child and sp whom I have on ignore now. So don't judge me on this cyber World as you would in the real World because this isn't who I am, nor is this forum the real World. And I marvel at how judgmental and condemning of me you are while totally giving the secular attackers who twist what the bible really say's a total pass for their crude and irresponsible statements. Why the hypocrisy and double standards if elevating the quality of debate is your goal charlie ? Why judge just the Christian and hold us to a higher standard when on the other hand you spend all your time disproving our beliefs ?

And if its true that God created us with free will which even the Angels don't have, then how would we know we were free to reject Him if evil did not exist as an opposing option for humanity ? This is why the bible points out that we are in a Spiritual Battle and uses so many military comparisons to our lives as children of God. Life can simply be defined as a battle between Good and Evil, and Jesus said that you are either for me or against me. There is no in between, no sideline so to speak. If on thinks they can go through life in neutral, they are in for a rude awakening. So consider this. We are the only creatures in Gods creation with free will. And our struggle with the sinful nature is the battle field upon which we must choose and determine which NATURE/WILL we will follow. And the temptations and struggles with the sins of this World are the price we must pay to determine which nature we will follow, which will determine our eternal destination, which for those who choose the higher nature will be above the Angels in Eternity. Those who choose the lower nature will suffer with them in the hell that was created for Fallen Angels, not Man. But the people who end up there will have consciously chosen seperation from God by mocking and rejecting Him in life just as you do constantly in so many posts. You have every right and freedom to reject Him, just understand that it is you rejecting Him and not the other way around when you find eternal seperation from Him is your reality. Eph 1:4 just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love, This verse plainly say's that God chose us who will follow Him through Christ before the foundation of the World. Which means He knew us before He created us or the World we live in. 1Pe 1:20 He indeed was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you This verse say's plainly that God foreordained Messiah/the Christ, before the foundation of the World, which means He always understood our struggle with sin would force a choice by us to choose Good or Evil while in this body of flesh. And Jesus was the answer to the sin nature who would defeat death and give eternal life to all who believed in Him. As for causing Adam and Eve's Fall from Grace. He didn't cause them to eat the forbidden fruit of the knowledge of Good and Evil that cost humanity our innocence. He plainly warned them that on the day that they ate of its fruit they would SURELY die. They understood clearly the price for disobeying that one warning in the garden. And His reason was to protect them from the pollution of a sinful nature which we fully understand the downside of possessing as their descendants. As to the Great Flood, it is clearly your personal judgment as a person with a sinful nature that the flood was a sinful act. If satan himself were being interviewed, he, no doubt, would say the same thing. But that doesn't make it a true statement at all, only your opinion. The bible say's that Fallen Angels/sons of God as they were referred to, mated with human women creating a so called super race of humans which infected and corrupted humanity so that it had to be destroyed and purified. This was the reason for the Flood; to save humanity, not to destroy it. If God wanted to destroy you and me, He would have wiped out all life, not just the infected and corrupted life on Earth. But of course from your limited and Worldly perspective you would also have a shallow and limited perspective of Gods reasoning and actual true agenda which motivated His actions. Gen 6:2 that the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves of all whom they chose. Gen 6:4 There were giants on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men and they bore [children] to them. Those [were] the mighty men who [were] of old, men of renown. His only other option was to destroy all of humanity all together but that would have meant satan would have succeeded in destroying Man who was made in Gods image which has been his goal since our creation. He promised that he would never serve man which got him bannished as heavens #1 Archangel. On a side note, the fact that a race of Giants was produced from this activity means that God didn't destroy them imediately at all. He allowed this to existe for a period of time which no one knows the amount of time of. But I personally believe this explains the ancient, yet unexplained ruins of great Cities found by Archeologists and under the Oceans that we have no historical records of. They are pre flood civilizations that no descendants existed any longer to speak of. You can be sure that Evolutionists have no explanations for the existence of the unknown, yet rediscovered ruins of such Civilizations.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","10:30 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","234"

They are mindless organisms. I would like to see you prove your postulate, especially if its extended (as it must be) to include all organisms across all time. I think that you will have considerable difficulty proving a negative assertion such as that. The truth is that we do not know when or how the first organisms evolved, nor do we know exactly how life arose from non-life. But its rather obvious that abiogenisis did occur - even if it was due to divine intervention (assuming GOD is not a living organism and thus had to arise somehow himself). The best odds are on ordinary chemistry having done the job. Certainly there are zip reasons to believe otherwise so far. And then there are still those troubling poilo viruses which we have made. They reproduce, vary, have genes, have enzymes, and can control metabolic machinery.

It could a be a fruitfly or a clergyman. I wasn't referring to origins of life, but to notions of ""free will"". First of all, life had to have a beginning somewhere, and that beginning is in prebiotic chemistry. Where else could it come from? Someone waving a magic wand? If so, where did that someone come from? Second, science isn't a religion. It's method even you could use, only you have to choose to use it rather than ignore it. Your the religion specialist here. Apparently this will come as a total shock to you, but you too are an organism acting and existing within physical laws that you can't over-rule according to your will. If you think you can, I invite to live without eating, or try stepping off a high building and floating gently to the ground without a parachute. You can use the laws of nature to accomplish takss with tools that you couldn't do otherwise, but you cannot go outside them. A number of animal species have similar tricks to extend their unaided abilities. Does this limitation mean that you are a mindless organism? Sorry, but the reason a bacterium is mindless is because it doesn't have a brain, but it can process and transduce information, and it is capable of initiating actions, though without a brain it can't be conscious of them. A clergyman, on the other hand, has a brain and therefore a mind, though often they aren't put to much use. Of course, it's much easier to demonstrate cause and effect in a bacterium than in a clergymen, for example, but still, materialism is still at the root of both their actions. If a clergyman has ""free will"", so does a bug. Of course, if you want to dispense with the notion of ""free will"", I'm ok with that, too. Of course all animals are bound by their natures, and operate within them. This is as true of humans as of dogs or fruitflies. No, Archie, that isn't a good definition of ""free will"". It's in the nature of humans to learn, to understand and use the laws of physics, and to make tools. But lots of other animals have similar faculties, only not nearly as well developed. Chimps make and use simple tools; so do some birds. It isn't a uniquely human trait, as you would know if you kept abreast of the lit. Nope. No animal can act ""outside its design"", not even humans, and I'm a lot closer to understanding the nature of life than any bibliolator who worships the bible and ignores science. So far as anyone can tell, animals have as much freedom of will as people. What they don't share to the same extent is consciousness, but even there, many are pretty self-aware. Consciousness is not the same as freedom of will. All freedom of will means, so far as I know, is that volition is internally activated, according to the laws of physics and chemistry, without an external stimulus. IOW, volition is autonomous (meaning free from external causation), and humans and certain other animals experience consciousness of this volition. That's all we know for now. We do not know for sure, for example, whether consciousness drives activity or is merely aware of it afterwards. Usually you write about religion, theology and nebulous stuff like that.

(One has to discount silly expeditions to Middle East or south west Asian mountains looking for bits of the Ark.) Scientists do know what a flood signature looks like, even vast floods such as the release of the glacial Lake Missoula that scoured the channeled scablands of Idaho, Washington and Oregon. They can even date real events such as the flooding of the Mediterranean and the Black Seas -- much, much longer ago than the Noachic flood was supposed to have happened. There is just nothing like that on a global scale dating to a single event a handful of thousand years ago. The notion of all the animals willingly boarding an Ark, being supported by a small human family for months (can you imagine!), then being released at one point to return (by wing, foot and a prayer!) to their points of origin is so absurd that it need not be taken seriously. Either the Noah myth is an embroidery of some more local event, or a complete fabrication. Or god has since lost his early taste for total miracles. In short, there is nothing in biology or geology to support the myth of Noah, so we needn't ask Creationists to find it. One might as well ask them to square a circle or find the square root of (-1).","GiantOreo","266616","I believe the whole Flood story is basically from a place where there was a large flood that wiped out an entire area - over time it was expanded and eventually became the impossible tale it is today.

Decades and decades ago, I went to a small Presbyterian Girls college. We had to take Bible studies. What we learned, then, was modern Biblical scholarship. We learned that there were 4 primary writers of the Torah: The first is the Yahwist, who is the oldest writer. For him, Yahweh is a very anthropomorphic being who walks around on earth with Abraham and Adam and others. Writings from this very early period are not clearly monotheist. Yahweh is the God of the Jews, but there are other gods, that Jews are forbidden to worship. The Yahwist wrote the second creation story in the Bible: The Adam and Eve Myth. The second is the Elohist, who wrote much later. For him, G*d is not so anthropomorphic, much more ethereal. You will find the Yahwist and the Elohist woven throughout Genesis and Exodus. The third is the Priestly Writer. He is later than both the Yahwist and the Elohist. He is generally concerned with writings about Temple practice, but he wrote the creation story you find in the first verses of Genesis: In the beginning . . . . In this version of creation, Man and Woman are created simultaneously in the Image of God. In the vision of this writer, G*d is neither male nor female a much more sophisticated vision of the Divine. The fourth writer is the Deuteronomist, who, well, wrote the Book of Deuteronomy. Anyway, I have recently become interested in Jewish thought, and one of the best books I have read is Jonathan Kirschs The Woman who Laughed At God. He verifies what I learned years ago, and provides much more detail. I would suggest that you read him.

The name pantheist was introduced by John Toland (1670-1722) in his ""Socinianism truly Stated"" (1705), while pantheism was first used by his opponent Fay in ""Defensio Religionis"" (1709). Toland published his ""Pantheisticon"" in 1732. The doctrine itself goes back to the early Indian philosophy; it appears during the course of history in a great variety of forms, and it enters into or draws support from so many other systems that, as Professor Flint says (""Antitheistic Theories"", 334), ""there is probably no pure pantheism"". Taken in the strictest sense, i.e. as identifying God and the world, Pantheism is simply Atheism. In any of its forms it involves Monism, but the latter is not necessarily pantheistic.

For starters there is simply not enough water on the planet to cover the surface: Even if the ice caps melted, about 20% of the planet's surface would still be land covered. Okay let's assume that water magically appeared and disappeared within forty days. How does this explain the millions of giant natural structures, such as mountains and caves? We've all been to the beach when we were kids, and we've all made sand castles with walls that we thought would repel the incoming tide. But within half an hour, the sand is completely level with the surrounding beach, the original structure gone. Same goes for a flood. How does a structure such as, say, uluru, or roraima? The point is, a flood of such porportions is just impossible. Remember who wrote Genesis: the Jews. They lived in Levant - an area near the place where asian - african - arabian tectonic plates collide with eachother. All this activity could lead to tsunamis of massive sizes - any survivor would have thought that the world had undergone the same cataclysmic fate. All it takes is a scholar to record the history, and we don't know how much later one came about - until then, the story circulated by word of mouth. This leaves plenty of room for error (a funny example is the story of how much weight George Clooney gained to play his role in Syriana - I was told it was 50 pounds or so, and when the topic came about a few weeks later I didn't really remember how much it was so I said 55 - I later checked online only to see it was thirty pounds, what a letdown). By the way, don't forget a similar story - Atlantis. Some people have become so obsessed by its mystery that they forgot who wrote the original text - Plato. Locations of Atlantis range from the Caribbean to Borneo, but who wrote the original idea? A Greek philosopher. We have to limit the areas to what he knew - the Old World knew nothing about Indonesia.

The flood was thought to have been extremely violent; churning up huge volumes of water this would have mixed the carcasses of species into one homogenous layer, advanced creatures with less advanced all whirling around in the cacophony of death together. While heavier species would have sunk faster, we should see more or less homogenous strata all over the Earth. This occurs nowhere on the planet. 2) The global flood should have left homogenous sediment layers across the world, similar to the Iridium layer that the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs left on the Earth. No such layer of sediment exists for that time period. 3) The necessary water to cover the Earth would have been astronomical. The oceans cover roughly 2/3rds of the Earth. That is sea level, to cover the highest point, Everest (29,028 feet feet above sea level), would require JUST to raise sea level, 756,821,205 Cubic miles of water. The fundemental problem is that the Oceans, seas and bays make up 96.5% of total water on the Earth and they only have 321,000,000 cubic miles. That leaves a huge amount of water that would need to come from somewhere. http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/DanielChen.shtml There's simply isn't that much water on Earth to allow such a flood. Some argue that the mountains werent that tall yet. That makes no sense whatsoever given the rates of tectonic plate drift. Plates move at 1 inch a year. Thats 500 feet over 6,000 years. Everest is by far taller then that. Some argue that plates moved faster. To create Everest in 6,000 years would mean plates would have to move almost five feet every year in the same direction. While plate movements are related to the Earths core heat, the necessary heat to have that much movement would mean the Earths core would have to be hundreds of times hotter. Thats way more then the surface of the Sun. 4) The global flood says that the world was covered by water. The problem with that is such an infusion of water would have created brine. As the water receded and evaporated, huge amounts of salt would have remained on the land. Very few plants can grow on salted Earth, and those who can are not agricultural crops. Virtually every creature in the oceans has a low tolerance for salinity change. A slight change can result in massive dieoffs. That would mean, as the salinity rapidly changed, that many creatures, if not virtually all would have died from osmosis. That means Noah would have had to keep two of every species of oceanic creatures onboard the ship. Given the measurements, the boat cannot hold two of every whale and shark. Even worse, as most of the oxygen comes from algea and seaweed, the change in salinity and pressure would have killed off the producers of oxygen. Life simply couldn't exist after a flood of such proportions. While some modern species can survive in salinity conditions very different then their norm, most cannot survive for extended periods of time, such as 40 days. Furthermore, their prey sources often cannot survive that long as well. Even more alarming is that if the alga managed to survive, the death of billions of life on Earth would have resulted in decay which results in nutrients which would have resulted in alga explosions like no other, removing oxygen from the oceans, suffocating every living thing left. 5) Some say that the water came from underground, a mile to be percise. The problem with that is the water would be superheated. Releasing 756,821,205 cubic miles of superheated water would have boiled everything to death almost instantly. The oceans would have also boiled away, killing all marine life, fresh water lakes would have done the same. The mantle of the Earth is 100 Celsius. Therefore the steam would be roughly that hot. Thats 212 degrees Fahrenheit. 756,821,205 cubic miles of 212 degree Fahrenheit water in a world that is typically no hotter then 80 degrees average would be instant death to everything. 6) Finally, flood geology requires the compaction of 4.5 billion years of comet, asteroid and meteor strikes into a single year. The problem with that is the energy from such impacts would have to be compacted as well, and we all know that the energy is converted into heat. 3 x 107 kg x 4.5 x 109 years worth of meteorite flux =1.35 x 1017 kg of meteoritic material fell during the flood year. The energy imparted by this amount of material is equal to: 1/2 M V2, where M is the mass of the extraterrestrial material, and V is the velocity at which it falls to the Earth (equal to the escape velocity, or 11200 m/s). This gives: 1/2 (1.35 x 1017 kg) * (11200 m/s)2 = 8.5 x 1024 Joules. So the Earth's atmosphere would have had to accomodate 8 x 1024 J of energy from this falling meteorite matter. We can do a quick calculation to determine the amount of heating this would cause: Energy = Matmo * Cp *(T), where Matmo is the mass of the atmosphere (5 x 1018 kg), Cp is the pressure constant for air (about 716 J/kg * K for N2), and T is the temperature change of the atmosphere. Solve for T: T = Energy/ (Matmo * Cp) = 8 x 1024 J / ((5 x 1018 kg) *716 J /kg * K) = 2,400 K. So the temperature change of the Earth's atmosphere would be about a 2,40 K increase in a single year. That's over 3860 Fahrenheit. The flood never happened and by proxy creation as well....","feindslayer","284015","1) The simple answer to this statement is that when the flood did arrive, it did not only mix up thousands of species of animals and plants, but also the many layers of strata in the Earth. This would have caused a severe change in the appearance of the strata, which has obviously confused modern scientists all over the world. 2) Like stated above, everything would have been mixed up, not just the creatures. 3a) If you do the math, severe earthquakes (caused by God) could have very easily covered the Earth in approximately 2 miles of water at some points. Also, with these severe earthquakes, not all of the Earth would have to be covered equally at one time. There could have been some parts shallow enough to actually see the ground below. 3b) Who said the Earth started out as a flat super continent?

Its sheer size would have stopped it from condensing or evaporating until the time when God chose for the flood to come. Any animals currently in fresh or slightly salty bodies of water could have made the simple survival adaptations on there own for a month, or with God's help. 5) I have answered most of this statement above, but you must also take into account the incredible cooling that must have occurred when boiling-hot water came into contact with billions of cubic miles of next-to-freezing rainy air.

Aaah! It all makes so much sense now!!!!! 2) Like stated above, your idea of a logical reasoned argument would have been mixed up, not just the creatures. 3a) So it was a flood that happened everywhere, just not all at the same time. A big wave perhaps. The bible mentions that it lasted for a year, so it must have been a really big wave. And the ark, which was big enough to carry millions of species (the dimensions given in the bible prove this to be impossible) picked up the animals as this wave went round the globe. And when it finally settled back to earth all the animals walked home. Yeeeeeesss! 3b) And I believe that the moon is made of cheese!!! 4) Soooo, the waters for the flood came from under the surface (some great big water bubble) and when the flood was over they went . . . . . . er . . . . to . . . . . . .

Just think of the amount of energy that would be released into the atmosphere if that amount of super-heated water suddenly burst forth (I know, I used the word think - sorry). The temperature would have risen enormously and very suddenly. Very little would have survived. Even if it was on a big boat. Ooooh!

Now, this is a really good example of why one shouldn't attempt to mix science and religion. If god 'could have' supplied the earth with the hydrosphere you describe, then he 'could have' magicked the water into existence as it was required. Why isn't that your answer? Why this absurd pseudoscience? Well, let's think about that for a moment. The earth's atmosphere has a mass estimated at 5x10^18 kg, and that's if we count all of it, right up to the troposphere. Three quarters of a billion cubic miles of water would have a mass of around 3x10^21kg, almost a thousand times greater.

If the earth was then much as it is today, then there isn't enough water on earth to cover it in any fashion. I have done the math. Do you have any idea of how high the Himalayas, the Alps, the Andes, and the Rockies are? Besides, the Bible talks about a flood that lasted a year, not a series of tsunamis. Typical of ""creation science"". ""It cudda happened!"" Is there a single item of empirical evidence that supports your fantasy? As has bee pointed out, you propose too much water to be cooled below the temperature of superheated steam. If the ""waters of the deep"" were under great pressure, then upon release to the atmosphere, it would have flashed to steam, thus greatly heating the atmosphere. The ""rain cooled atmosphere"" wouldn't have existed simply because the temperature would already have been above boiling because of the release of latent heat from the condensation of all that water that was falling as rain. Contrary to what you believe, the condensation of rain from vapor heats the atmosphere at altitude. So you have condensation of water both above and below that is releasing latent heat. Your turn to do the math. There is approximately 332,500,000 cubic miles (1,386,000,000 cubic kilometers) of water on earth. If you calculate how much additional water would be required to cover Mt. Everest (about 4 times existing water), you will have the total amount of water that condensed from vapor. Now calculate the amount of latent heat that would have been released from that water (80 cal/cc if all of it were at exactly 0 degrees C.) And there are other heat problems for ""creation science"". Of course, you have already denied the heat from runaway tectonics (that most ""creation scientists find necessary). It seems that you don't realize the huge problem of bio-geography that such an idea would cause you. How did the kangaroos and wombats get to Australia? And then there's the problem of the heat released by cramming 3.6 billion years of radioactive decay into 6,000 years. You can find a discussion (complete with the math) in the article Were Adam and Eve Toast? by Dr. Joe Meert, a geologist at the U. of Florida. Notice that scientists actually ""do the math"" and show it to you. They don't just make claims. If you want, I'll show you the math involved in all of the water calculations - I just figured that you wouldn't understand it anyway. OK.

The flood never happened and by proxy creation as well. That however, does not invalidate Christanity as many Christians view the bible as a moral and value oriented book, not a accurate history book.","Gup20","284529","Many modern creationists would argue that the strata is a deposition order, and the fossil order is a burial order. They might say that specific places on earth where volcanoes and tectonic action were likely to occur had similar climates and therefore similar biological systems. Gen 7:17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth. 18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. 19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that [were] under the whole heaven, were covered. 20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. Gen 7:24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days. It seems to indicate that it took 40 days for the whole earth to flood. Creationists would interpret this to mean that the water levels increased for 40 days until all the earth was covered. That means there would have been opportunity for some animals (perhaps those with more stamina -- such as mamals) to find higher ground for about a month's time. The bigger, slower animals (such as dinosaurs) would not have been able to keep up. The Bible says ""the fountains of the great deep"" were broken up and water came out of the earth. Creationists would probably say that the order of sediment layers represents the order of catestrophic deposit. For example, when Mt. St. Helen blew in the 80's it laid down layers that looked very much like ""yearly"" strata layers... but thousands of them in just hours. Creationists would predict finding different layering based on the different types of catestrophic forces in that area. Was there volcanic activity in that area? Was there tectonic activity in that area? Was there earthquakes, how fast did that area flood... these would all have varying effects on the sedimentation process. Additionally, creationists would argue that water run off from the continents would have also played a significant role in sedimentation (ie Grand Canyon). [/quote] Mt Everest - at its very tip - has marine fossils. Why? Well simply put, it wasn't always there. Creationist models show a much more level earth. They would argue the oceans were not as deep, and the mountains were not as high. They would argue that there isn't a place on earth you can go and NOT find marine fossils, suggesting that at some point every place on earth was covered with water. It doesn't prove that they were all covered at once, however. Creationists use an illustration. Lets say you are bending a metal bar. It's very difficult and the place where the bend occurs builds heat. However, once you reach a certain point, it becomes incredibly easy to bend, very little force is needed as long as it keeps moving. The friction is exponentially decreased. Heat remains constant, no longer building. However, if you slow down too much, your piece of metal will loose it's heat and begin to harden. Creationists would also argue that you are using a common fallacy called ""uniformitarianism"". That is to say you are taking a measured value and extrapolating it back into the past. The problem with this is there is no way to tell that the rate has remained constant throuout time. For example, if we take a look at the earth's magnetic field, we see that it is shrinking at a regular rate each year. However, if we simply extrapolated that backwards at the same rate, the field would have been too powerful for life to exist just 15,000 years ago. The same goes with the Moon's orbit. It is gettting farther and farther away from the earth at a measurable rate. If we assumed (as the uniformitarian does) that the rate never changed, the moon would be touching the earth less than 50,000 years ago. Creationists use this argument effectively against millions of years of strata deposition. Creationists would argue that for this to be measured and calculated, one would have to know how much salt was in the oceans when they were created. Perhaps they were created without any salt in them. Perhaps the salinity of the oceans is a result of the solution that would have occured at a cataclysmic global flood. Creationists would argue that rain has a super-cooling effect. Additionally, any solution has a higher boiling point than water alone. What would be the cooling effect of a rain storm over the entire surface of the earth for 40 days and 40 nights? As a matter of fact, many ice age models begin with the flooding of an area. 6) Finally, flood geology requires the compaction of 4.5 billion years of comet, asteroid and meteor strikes into a single year. The problem with that is the energy from such impacts would have to be compacted as well, and we all know that the energy is converted into heat. [/quote] You have a lot of calculations there, and the creationist would ask what assumptions you are making. For example, are you assuming - as the uniformitarian does - that the rate of compaction has always been the same as what is seen today? Are you making any assumptions as to how much material was here to start with? Are you making assumptions about the material itself? Who observed all this material falling to the earth? I would disagree with you. I would say that if any part of the Bible were untrue, that would discredit the whole. You see the Bible claims to be the infalible Word of God. If it's claims about itself are wrong, how can we trust that it's claims regarding morality carry any weight?

With new evidence, or better interpretation of existing evidence comes a change in the popular perception of the truth. Each of us has an opinion on the truth based on our worldview.

But there is no harm in your attacking me, provided you point out that it is the proof I deny, not the probability of a beginning.

Scrope (fellow uniformitarian geologist and Member of Parliament), Lyell wrote on 14 June 1830: ""I am sure you may get into Q.R. [Quarterly Review] what will free the science [of geology] from Moses, for if treated seriously, the [church] party are quite prepared for it. A bishop, Buckland ascertained (we suppose [Bishop] Sumner), gave Ure a dressing in the British Critic and Theological Review. They see at last the mischief and scandal brought on them by Mosaic systems. Probably there was a beginningit is a metaphysical question, worthy of a theologianprobably there will be an end. Species, as you say, have begun and endedbut the analogy is faint and distant. Perhaps it is an analogy, but all I say is, there are, as Hutton said, no signs of a beginning, no prospect of an end. All I ask is, that at any given period of the past, dont stop inquiry when puzzled by refuge to a beginning, which is all one with another state of nature, as it appears to me. But there is no harm in your attacking me, provided you point out that it is the proof I deny, not the probability of a beginning. I was afraid to point the moral, as much as you can do in the Q.R. about Moses. Perhaps I should have been tenderer about the Koran. Dont meddle much with that, if at all. If we dont irritate, which I fear that we may (though mere history), we shall carry all with us. If you dont triumph over them, but compliment the liberality and candour of the present age, the bishops and enlightened saints will join us in despising both the ancient and modern physico-theologians. It is just the time to strike, so rejoice that, sinner as you are, the Q.R. is open to you. P.S. I conceived the idea five or six years ago [1824-25], that if ever the Mosaic geology could be set down without giving offence, it would be in an historical sketch, and you must abstract mine, in order to have as little to say as possible yourself. Let them feel it, and point the moral."" (Lyell, 1881, I:268-271, bracketed words added). sinjin- I don't see any ""goal"" to discredit the Bible.

A creationist might wonder how any empiracle process can be based on such little observation. A creationist might point out the number of ""missing links"", and wonder how something that is missing and unobserved can be considered empiracle. To the creationist, the evolutionary worldview looks like the mythos, and their creationist view is supported not only by their interpretation of the evidence, but by eyewitness testimony (the Bible claiming to be the Word of God). The creationist models have the sea floor lowering over time, while mountainous regions lift, yes. There are deep crevaces in the middle of the pacific ocean.

A scientist might point out how many mistakes there are in the bible if it is read literally.

"09-26-2007","8816",23,"Gup20","284529","Many modern creationists would argue that the strata is a deposition order, and the fossil order is a burial order. They might say that specific places on earth where volcanoes and tectonic action were likely to occur had similar climates and therefore similar biological systems. Gen 7:24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days. It seems to indicate that it took 40 days for the whole earth to flood. Creationists would interpret this to mean that the water levels increased for 40 days until all the earth was covered. That means there would have been opportunity for some animals (perhaps those with more stamina -- such as mamals) to find higher ground for about a month's time. The bigger, slower animals (such as dinosaurs) would not have been able to keep up. The Bible says ""the fountains of the great deep"" were broken up and water came out of the earth. Creationists would probably say that the order of sediment layers represents the order of catestrophic deposit. For example, when Mt. St. Helen blew in the 80's it laid down layers that looked very much like ""yearly"" strata layers... but thousands of them in just hours. Creationists would predict finding different layering based on the different types of catestrophic forces in that area. Was there volcanic activity in that area? Was there tectonic activity in that area? Was there earthquakes, how fast did that area flood... these would all have varying effects on the sedimentation process. Additionally, creationists would argue that water run off from the continents would have also played a significant role in sedimentation (ie Grand Canyon). Mt Everest - at its very tip - has marine fossils. Why? Well simply put, it wasn't always there. Creationist models show a much more level earth. They would argue the oceans were not as deep, and the mountains were not as high. They would argue that there isn't a place on earth you can go and NOT find marine fossils, suggesting that at some point every place on earth was covered with water. It doesn't prove that they were all covered at once, however. Creationists use an illustration. Lets say you are bending a metal bar. It's very difficult and the place where the bend occurs builds heat. However, once you reach a certain point, it becomes incredibly easy to bend, very little force is needed as long as it keeps moving. The friction is exponentially decreased. Heat remains constant, no longer building. However, if you slow down too much, your piece of metal will loose it's heat and begin to harden. Creationists would also argue that you are using a common fallacy called ""uniformitarianism"". That is to say you are taking a measured value and extrapolating it back into the past. The problem with this is there is no way to tell that the rate has remained constant throuout time. For example, if we take a look at the earth's magnetic field, we see that it is shrinking at a regular rate each year. However, if we simply extrapolated that backwards at the same rate, the field would have been too powerful for life to exist just 15,000 years ago. The same goes with the Moon's orbit. It is gettting farther and farther away from the earth at a measurable rate. If we assumed (as the uniformitarian does) that the rate never changed, the moon would be touching the earth less than 50,000 years ago. Creationists use this argument effectively against millions of years of strata deposition. Creationists would argue that for this to be measured and calculated, one would have to know how much salt was in the oceans when they were created. Perhaps they were created without any salt in them. Perhaps the salinity of the oceans is a result of the solution that would have occured at a cataclysmic global flood. Creationists would argue that rain has a super-cooling effect. You have a lot of calculations there, and the creationist would ask what assumptions you are making. For example, are you assuming - as the uniformitarian does - that the rate of compaction has always been the same as what is seen today? Are you making any assumptions as to how much material was here to start with? Are you making assumptions about the material itself? Who observed all this material falling to the earth? I would disagree with you. I would say that if any part of the Bible were untrue, that would discredit the whole.","obvious_child","285379","Except that the flood story is massively violent with a ocean covering sea. Too bad that we have absolutely no evidence of this and we have a fossil layer that in no way supports such as asinine view of the world. The burial layer alone refutes the flood. If it was true, we should see similar mass organisms in the same layer. That means all of the similar sized shell fish, primitive and complex in the same layer and we should see larger organisms at the bottom and smaller at the top. What we actually have is a completely different burial layer with large organisms spread through out the entire column and only found in specific parts. We see a burial column by complexity, not by mass. Fluid mechanics has always screwed up flood models. This alone ends life almost entirely on the planet as salts deposited would prevent plant life and the change in salinity killing off most of the algea and sea weed. You haven't done much research have you. Water from within the earth would be superheated. Releasing double to fourtimes the amount of water we have now would have killed all but the most thermophilic bacteria. No more Noah. Secondly, the whole stamina argument makes even less sense as marine organisms would have all had the same chances, and therefore should be in the same layer. Not true. Are you seriously putting that forward? The grand canyon was not flood formed. http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CH/CH581.html http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CH/CH550.html The necessary volcanic activity to produce even sediment layers on par with the Iridium would be somewhere on a super volcano which hasn't erupted in over 600,000 years. No, it but it does prove that plates move. The creationist model, primarily burmagarder's (SP?) relies on miracles. He even admitted it. To make Everest that tall in less then 5,000 years requires movement on the scale of feet per year, and I mean over 5 feet per year. The accompaying earthquakes, tidal waves, volcanic activity and general rise in heat would have been noticed by someone. Furthermore, we'd be seeing it today. There's no way it could stop so suddenly after moving so fast for thousands or so years. What are you talking about? How can heat remain constant when the rate of movement is steadily increasing? And how are you going to explain the massive slowing of plates from 6 feet a year to 1 inch? Aside from their being evidence that it did. Besides, if there was a change in rate, we'd see the evidence similar to how the magenetic field has switched every couple hundred million years or so. There's no reason to assume there was a change without evidence. You are either lying or are decieved. http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/magfields.html http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/moonrec.html Are you serious? No salt? Right because the fossils we found have structures that are designed for salt water when there was no salt. And salt found in old rocks known to have been on the ocean floor didn't exist? Are you insane? Ever try putting a fresh water fish in a salt water tank? Seriously. Creationism = retardation. Except that it doesn't http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-...ark.html#flood You're right, I'm off. it should be higher as there was more rock material in the solar system then before. Uniformitarianism is wrong here was we know there was more material. Thus the heat issue is even greater.
