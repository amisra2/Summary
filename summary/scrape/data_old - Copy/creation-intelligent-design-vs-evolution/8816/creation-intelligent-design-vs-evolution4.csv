I am sure there was a bit of cross cultural contact between Juddah and the biggest empire in the area. If the contact was mundane enough, it can no way be 'The Exodus'. There have been several waves of immigrations and emigrations over the 2000 years since the decline of Ancient Egypt, not to mention the great influx of foreign peoples during the 3,000 years of the classical period. Ancient Egypt was an attractive place, and traders came from every country of northern Africa, the Middle East and many European countries as well. Many settled, and some left their trace on the Egyptian population from sexual relations with locals. Egypt was also attractive to invading armies, soldiers of which often settled in the conquered land and married Egyptian women. Slaves represented the third type of immigration. Slaves came from foreign lands, either as trading merchandise or as war prisoners. As both male and female slaves could marry and have children, they also left their mark on the Egyptian population.","Another opinion","231035","No one here is arguing that ""The Exodus"" happened (here I am assuming that you mean something akin to what was written in the Bible), so I don't know why you keep bringing up that point. As for there being a more mundane incident, I am sure there were thousands of mundane incidents - most of which did not involve Israelis - that were too mundane to record in the manner that would be readable thousands of years later. The population of ancient Egypt apparently ranged from about 1.5 to 6 million, depending on the period. If foreign workers from other lands were also coming and going, a few thousand Israelis coming and going, spread out over tens of years would probably not register a tremendous amount of interest. Things that were mundane for the great civilization of Egypt might well have been very significant for the small and relatively insignificant state of Israel. We have to look at perspective here. As an outline of the changing population of Egypt, from http://lexicorient.com/e.o/egypt_a.htm: With so many people coming and going, why would the Egyptians have considered the fate of a relatively small number of Israeli traders, workers or slaves (hundred or thousands perhaps) as significant? Only significant things were purposely recorded for posterity. That leaves accidental evidence, where the discovery of the Israeli-style home, though admittedly just a small clue, could still reveal the presence of Israelis in Egypt. Is simply makes sense that a poor people living in a harsh climate might at certain times have had workers working in a neighboring rich country. It happens all the time today. I don't know why you seem to have a mind-set against any Israeli workers being in Egypt.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","10:24 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","46"
"09-15-2006","8816",4,"None","None","None","peteratwar","231036","I think we must be careful about using the word Exodus with the biblical connotations. I think we can probably agree that a mass migration of many thousands of people in one go as described in Exodus is unlikely. Often the nomadic groups in those days were fairly small in numbers individually, although there could well be a large number of such groups I would think it extremely possible that over a number of years a number of the groups may have left Egypt for whatever reason. Could have been religious. Some may have been chased by Egyptian troops. Eventually after much wandering I believe that they became united under one leader and off they went. No doubt a long oral tradition remained of this and in the making of the book of Exodus the various journeys became amalgamated into one mass migration under the protection of the Lord arriving and conquering the Holy Land. AS we ourselves in this day and age can spin and exaggerate small events for political purposes, I do not see that there is any reason why the Exodus could not have been similarly created. The Exodus as a whole was clearly an important part of Jewish history, but the movemement of small groups of nomads would be utterly unimportant to the Egyptians. They might have been somewhat annoyed if a part of their labour force (i.e. a specific group) took off and sent a force after them, but without much luck. The Good Lord delivered them. So an exodus and thence joining of many groups probably did take place and takes a revered part in Jewish history even if it didn't occur exactly as written.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","10:32 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","47"

The exodus, Moses' relationship with god and the promise of the land of Canaan are fundamental to the whole idea of a special contract between god and the Israelites, and hence to most of the rest of the history of Judaism. Denying the literal truth of the biblical exodus puts all of that in jeopardy.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","12:20 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","48"

Denying the truth of the Exodus would give a problem, I do not agree that doubting whether it happened exactly as stated in all its details does give any problem. The description clearly wasn't written at the time, but many centuries later!","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","03:36 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","49"

There is no evidence for any large number of people in the Sinia. There are no evidence for the military battles. The IS evidence that the hebews arose from the northern Caananites.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","07:58 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","50"
"09-18-2006","8816",4,"None","None","None","peteratwar","231326","As I have said before the fact that evidence has not as yet been found (because that is all it is) is only evidence that 'no evidence has been found'. You have the problem that no-one has yet reliably dated the pharoahs' reigns not where the Israelites would have fitted in What evidence would you expect in the Sinai, thousands of years later, of a nomadic people constantly on the move and probably in a number of small groups. Again if the Egyptians weren't involved in battles then you would not expect them to record such battles. Those who were defeated and probably pushed out/away are unlikely to have left records. You do of course have the evidence of the Bible for the battles. Never forget the Israelites were a semitic people amongst many semitic races so their origins may well have been in the North. Doesn't preclude a large group from wandering in to Egypt and then moving out later.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","08:58 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","51"

I would be quite curious about any cultural origins of the Genesis story. Thanks.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","09:47 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","52"

For example, we know that the Exodus, as described in the bible, can not have existed. There are two factors. 1) The evidence of that number of people living in the Sinia for 40 years does not exist. If it was there, there would be plenty of signs of people where there are none. 2) The Sinia desert did not have the resources to support the number of people the bible describes.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","08:01 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","55"
"09-26-2006","8816",4,"None","None","None","peteratwar","232460","No you cannot prove a negative, neither of your suggestions are any more than stating no evidence has been found. That is totally different from saying the Israelis were not there. Firstly as a nomadic people they would be moving around not stationery. There is no direct evidence of exactly where they were in the Sinai. Secondly as I have suggested if they were moving around in small groups then they could probably scratch a living in those times. Thirdly, manna from heaven. No sorry, there is no proof that the Exodus did not exist. I would concede that it probably didn't happen exactly as written but I suspect that something of the sort did take place.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","10:04 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","56"
"09-26-2006","8816",4,"peteratwar","232460","No you cannot prove a negative","Hi_Its_Me","232509","Only true in the sense that nothing can be completely proven. You can come only as close to proving a negative as you can come to proving a positive. An example is that we don't know gravity exists; we have just noted an attraction between matter that is constant throughout the universe. It is possible that there is a different explanation, but that is unlikely.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","04:55 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","57"

From curiousity, do most modern Israelis seriously view that they have a right to the land of Israel on religious grounds, or do they mainly view it as their historical homeland? In other words, what justifications do most modern Israelis give themselves for having taken over that land?","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","09:41 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","58"
