Seems like a rather inefficient way of doing things (which would make Arch's God incompetent AND a liar).","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","02:31 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","169"

Didn't God say that the rainbow was a sign that He wouldn't again destroy the Earth by flood? That's totally different to saying that the rainbow is a sign that the next destruction is by fire. (Gen 9: 11 - 17.) Anyway, that aside, as we know that rainbows are formed by the refraction of light through multiple prisms, i.e. the raindrops, was this law of physical refraction only created after the flood? Did we have a world before the flood with incomplete laws of physics?","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","07:28 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","170"

They base this on Gen 2:5-6. ""And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and [there was] not a man to till the ground. But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground."" It's as reasonable as anything else about the creation and flood mythology. Never mind that this magic being created man (man and woman) in Gen 1:27. He creates only man in Gen 2:7 and woman in Gen 2:22. If they can't recognize that as mythology, do you think a little thing like a rainbow and the laws of physics is going to bother them?","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","11:18 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","171"

"04-29-2007","8816",12,"ShadowPikachu","260869","So, where, exactly is the verse that says what you claimed here: All I see is that it is going to be laid bare and the elements destroyed by fire - nothing about the rainbow being a promise that the world will be destroyed by fire, which is what you claimed in the first place. Then, I also noticed this little tidbit in your rant: So, you believe in a literal Bible and yet believe that some people do not have souls. Funny how that isn't in the bible, now isn't it. However, I do believe these verses that you posted are correct about one thing - the earth will be razed and end by ""fire"" - about 4-5 billion years from now, the sun will enter its red giant phase, and the outer layers will extend to the earth's orbit, and will do just that to the earth (even if the earth's orbit gets pushed out as the sun expands, the oceans will still boil away, and most of the atmosphere will escape from the earth.) So, yes, the earth will end by ""fire"", but not nearly as soon as you and your doomsday cult of christians claim (4-5 billion years more, pretty much, since your cult keeps claiming that this century is it - but then your ilk has been saying that since the early Christian church, so it really shows their predictive abilities)","Archangel","260879","Wow, either you really are stupid or you just have no ability to make the simplest deductions. The rainbow is Gods promise that the World will never again be destroyed by Water. Other passages such as the one in Peter speak to how then next time it will be by fire. Amazing that it is beyond you to deduce that. And as to you not having a soul. I see you can take someone literally when it suits you huh ? But you don't get off that easily, you do have a soul. Because you're so simple minded and unable to comprehend english I should have clarified for those who "" Aren't aware they have a soul. "" And what a christian you are to ignore all that the bible say's about the end of this AGE and take the secular perspective that life will go on uninterrupted for another 4.5 billion years or so. How many souls have you saved lately SP ?","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","09:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","176"

Therefore, if by your posting records you take such things literally, it is sensible for me to assume that you were being literal in this case. 3) The Bible gives no timeline as to these evets, so your rant really does nothing for you. It's funny how when I admit the Bible is right about something (in this case the world burning, etc. - which will happen), you still attack me. Get a life, Archie.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","09:08 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","177"

It really doesn't matter what I say or how I say it because you will lie, distort and twist it to mean something I never intended it to mean. You are an ignorant specious child who is more interested in appearing to win some stupid word game than actually debating an issue with the truth as the final goal. I wash my hands at trying to reason or even communicate with you or child as you disgust me as human beings. Ignoring you two is much more preferable to the frustration of having you lie in response to everything I post.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","10:14 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","178"
"04-29-2007","8816",12,"None","None","None","thelmoose","260885","Reading through these threads, a memory flashed through my head. I was in second grade in Catholic school, and Sister Marlene was talking about Noah's Ark. Already some of the kids were beginning to question whether such a thing could actually be true. The good Sister had to be tactful so as to not disillusion some too soon in their lives. You do not want to be the one to break the news that their is no Santa Claus, if you are an elementary school teacher. She was also an honest person who clearly didn't think the story was anything more than allegory. She sidestepped the question and raised the issue if it really matters if a story is true, when maybe the most important thing we can take from stories like this are the lessons we learn. That stuck with me. I don't remember if I was one of the more astute kids who was questioning the veracity of the tale, but I am sure I started to question after that. My point is that 7 and 8 year old children are smart enough to understand what is and what is not a tall tale. Yet we have adults here who not only believe it, but have to justify it to themselves by making up elaborate side stories and pretend science. Too bad not everyone grew up.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","10:20 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","179"

I realize that at 53 years old I'm still an infant in my knowledge compared to the Alpha and the Omega who is my Heavenly Father and Creator. I am humbled by His Majesty and His Glory and His Love that created me in his image. But I understand that in this human form how limited we are in what we can grasp. And then there are those who think they grasp the secrets of the universe when they are too blind to even realize they are spiritual creatures themselves. Of course this is all foolishness to you and because you are deaf and blind to the Spiritual World that surrounds you I can't prove what I know to you. But because you too are made in God's image just as I am, you too will surely know what i am saying is true one day. You'll know the Great Flood in the bible is to be taken literally. But it will be a moot point then as you will have already determined your own fate by then. And remember I said that it is you who will determine your fate. I'm not condemning you in any way and neither will God. But all who reject Him in this life will condemn themselves to separation from Him in the next. That is a spiritual law just as gravity is a physical law. Whether or not one accepts it is irrelevant.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","11:11 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","180"
