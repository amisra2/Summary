Cheers.","pandion","268045","That's probably because all of the issues you raise have been brought up in the past and the fundamentalist faux-christians haven't been able to come up with any answers. There have been some attempts, but they ended in embarrassment for creationists when their efforts to represent mythology as science didn't measure up. They succeeded in making their religion look foolish and they realized it. Thus they have abandoned the field. Don't gloat too much since the faux-christians will be back with the same arguments, as if you never reduced them to nonsense. The really pathetic thing is that it is quite likely that the same people will be back with the same debunked arguments. Creationists are so pathetic.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","11:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","287"

"09-15-2007","8816",20,"obvious_child","230139","It looks like the science based people here need some help. So I'm going to hit back. 1) A global flood, if it did occur, would have left fossils of every species in every strata as it laid down sediment. We should find all over the world, the same species in the same strata. No where on Earth do you find fossils of dinosaurs, mastodons, Precambrian shellfish and primates in the same strata. The flood was thought to have been extremely violent; churning up huge volumes of water this would have mixed the carcasses of species into one homogenous layer, advanced creatures with less advanced all whirling around in the cacophony of death together. While heavier species would have sunk faster, we should see more or less homogenous strata all over the Earth. This occurs nowhere on the planet. 2) The global flood should have left homogenous sediment layers across the world, similar to the Iridium layer that the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs left on the Earth. No such layer of sediment exists for that time period. 3) The necessary water to cover the Earth would have been astronomical. The oceans cover roughly 2/3rds of the Earth. That is sea level, to cover the highest point, Everest (29,028 feet feet above sea level), would require JUST to raise sea level, 756,821,205 Cubic miles of water. The fundemental problem is that the Oceans, seas and bays make up 96.5% of total water on the Earth and they only have 321,000,000 cubic miles. That leaves a huge amount of water that would need to come from somewhere. http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/DanielChen.shtml There's simply isn't that much water on Earth to allow such a flood. Some argue that the mountains werent that tall yet. That makes no sense whatsoever given the rates of tectonic plate drift. Plates move at 1 inch a year. Thats 500 feet over 6,000 years. Everest is by far taller then that. Some argue that plates moved faster. To create Everest in 6,000 years would mean plates would have to move almost five feet every year in the same direction. While plate movements are related to the Earths core heat, the necessary heat to have that much movement would mean the Earths core would have to be hundreds of times hotter. Thats way more then the surface of the Sun. 4) The global flood says that the world was covered by water. The problem with that is such an infusion of water would have created brine. As the water receded and evaporated, huge amounts of salt would have remained on the land. Very few plants can grow on salted Earth, and those who can are not agricultural crops. Virtually every creature in the oceans has a low tolerance for salinity change. A slight change can result in massive dieoffs. That would mean, as the salinity rapidly changed, that many creatures, if not virtually all would have died from osmosis. That means Noah would have had to keep two of every species of oceanic creatures onboard the ship. Given the measurements, the boat cannot hold two of every whale and shark. Even worse, as most of the oxygen comes from algea and seaweed, the change in salinity and pressure would have killed off the producers of oxygen. Life simply couldn't exist after a flood of such proportions. While some modern species can survive in salinity conditions very different then their norm, most cannot survive for extended periods of time, such as 40 days. Furthermore, their prey sources often cannot survive that long as well. Even more alarming is that if the alga managed to survive, the death of billions of life on Earth would have resulted in decay which results in nutrients which would have resulted in alga explosions like no other, removing oxygen from the oceans, suffocating every living thing left. 5) Some say that the water came from underground, a mile to be percise. The problem with that is the water would be superheated. Releasing 756,821,205 cubic miles of superheated water would have boiled everything to death almost instantly. The oceans would have also boiled away, killing all marine life, fresh water lakes would have done the same. The mantle of the Earth is 100 Celsius. Therefore the steam would be roughly that hot. Thats 212 degrees Fahrenheit. 756,821,205 cubic miles of 212 degree Fahrenheit water in a world that is typically no hotter then 80 degrees average would be instant death to everything. 6) Finally, flood geology requires the compaction of 4.5 billion years of comet, asteroid and meteor strikes into a single year. The problem with that is the energy from such impacts would have to be compacted as well, and we all know that the energy is converted into heat. 3 x 107 kg x 4.5 x 109 years worth of meteorite flux =1.35 x 1017 kg of meteoritic material fell during the flood year. The energy imparted by this amount of material is equal to: 1/2 M V2, where M is the mass of the extraterrestrial material, and V is the velocity at which it falls to the Earth (equal to the escape velocity, or 11200 m/s). This gives: 1/2 (1.35 x 1017 kg) * (11200 m/s)2 = 8.5 x 1024 Joules. So the Earth's atmosphere would have had to accomodate 8 x 1024 J of energy from this falling meteorite matter. We can do a quick calculation to determine the amount of heating this would cause: Energy = Matmo * Cp *(T), where Matmo is the mass of the atmosphere (5 x 1018 kg), Cp is the pressure constant for air (about 716 J/kg * K for N2), and T is the temperature change of the atmosphere. Solve for T: T = Energy/ (Matmo * Cp) = 8 x 1024 J / ((5 x 1018 kg) *716 J /kg * K) = 2,400 K. So the temperature change of the Earth's atmosphere would be about a 2,40 K increase in a single year. That's over 3860 Fahrenheit. The flood never happened and by proxy creation as well....","feindslayer","284015","1) The simple answer to this statement is that when the flood did arrive, it did not only mix up thousands of species of animals and plants, but also the many layers of strata in the Earth. This would have caused a severe change in the appearance of the strata, which has obviously confused modern scientists all over the world. 2) Like stated above, everything would have been mixed up, not just the creatures. 3a) If you do the math, severe earthquakes (caused by God) could have very easily covered the Earth in approximately 2 miles of water at some points. Also, with these severe earthquakes, not all of the Earth would have to be covered equally at one time. There could have been some parts shallow enough to actually see the ground below. 3b) Who said the Earth started out as a flat super continent? I believe that God made the Earth only a few thousand years ago, not that much geographically different from the way it is now. 4) The 'waters of the deep', as the Bible puts it, could have very well been the supply (with the correct salinity levels) of the first oceans. In the beginning, God could have supplied the Earth with a large 'hydrosphere', between the crust and the outer layer of the mantel. Its sheer size would have stopped it from condensing or evaporating until the time when God chose for the flood to come. Any animals currently in fresh or slightly salty bodies of water could have made the simple survival adaptations on there own for a month, or with God's help. 5) I have answered most of this statement above, but you must also take into account the incredible cooling that must have occurred when boiling-hot water came into contact with billions of cubic miles of next-to-freezing rainy air. You get the picture. 6) Actually, all it really required is a small tap from God's little toe.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","02:14 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","289"

Aaah! It all makes so much sense now!!!!! 2) Like stated above, your idea of a logical reasoned argument would have been mixed up, not just the creatures. 3a) So it was a flood that happened everywhere, just not all at the same time. A big wave perhaps. The bible mentions that it lasted for a year, so it must have been a really big wave. And the ark, which was big enough to carry millions of species (the dimensions given in the bible prove this to be impossible) picked up the animals as this wave went round the globe. And when it finally settled back to earth all the animals walked home. Yeeeeeesss! 3b) And I believe that the moon is made of cheese!!! 4) Soooo, the waters for the flood came from under the surface (some great big water bubble) and when the flood was over they went . . . . . . er . . . . to . . . . . . . I give up. The Coca-Cola Company? 5) ???Billions??? of cubic miles of rainy air?? If I'm supposed to get the picture, I'm not sure I'll find a frame big enough. Just think of the amount of energy that would be released into the atmosphere if that amount of super-heated water suddenly burst forth (I know, I used the word think - sorry). The temperature would have risen enormously and very suddenly. Very little would have survived. Even if it was on a big boat. Ooooh! Are you suggesting that god invented evolution after that to replace the Earth's population that he just wiped out by accident? It's a thought . . . . I suppose. Perhaps his knowledge of thermodynamics is lacking something. 6) Now we get to the truth . It was just MAAAAAA AAGGG GIIIII IIIIIII IIIICCC CCCC . Now where did I put my pot of pixie dust.

Once again, why do you think ""the flood mixed up all the layers"" is an answer to the question ""why don't we see one big thick mixed up (homogenous) layer""? Now, this is a really good example of why one shouldn't attempt to mix science and religion. If god 'could have' supplied the earth with the hydrosphere you describe, then he 'could have' magicked the water into existence as it was required. Why isn't that your answer? Why this absurd pseudoscience? Well, let's think about that for a moment. The earth's atmosphere has a mass estimated at 5x10^18 kg, and that's if we count all of it, right up to the troposphere. Three quarters of a billion cubic miles of water would have a mass of around 3x10^21kg, almost a thousand times greater. So even if the heat from the emerging floodwaters was dissipated into the entire atmosphere, the water would only be cooled by about 0.1 degrees before atmospheric temperatures reached equilibrium and no more cooling could occur. Then again, I ask you, why all this silly pseudoscience?","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","08:42 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","296"

If the earth was then much as it is today, then there isn't enough water on earth to cover it in any fashion. I have done the math. Do you have any idea of how high the Himalayas, the Alps, the Andes, and the Rockies are? Besides, the Bible talks about a flood that lasted a year, not a series of tsunamis. Typical of ""creation science"". ""It cudda happened!"" Is there a single item of empirical evidence that supports your fantasy? As has bee pointed out, you propose too much water to be cooled below the temperature of superheated steam. If the ""waters of the deep"" were under great pressure, then upon release to the atmosphere, it would have flashed to steam, thus greatly heating the atmosphere. The ""rain cooled atmosphere"" wouldn't have existed simply because the temperature would already have been above boiling because of the release of latent heat from the condensation of all that water that was falling as rain. Contrary to what you believe, the condensation of rain from vapor heats the atmosphere at altitude. So you have condensation of water both above and below that is releasing latent heat. Your turn to do the math. There is approximately 332,500,000 cubic miles (1,386,000,000 cubic kilometers) of water on earth. If you calculate how much additional water would be required to cover Mt. Everest (about 4 times existing water), you will have the total amount of water that condensed from vapor. Now calculate the amount of latent heat that would have been released from that water (80 cal/cc if all of it were at exactly 0 degrees C.) And there are other heat problems for ""creation science"". Of course, you have already denied the heat from runaway tectonics (that most ""creation scientists find necessary). It seems that you don't realize the huge problem of bio-geography that such an idea would cause you. How did the kangaroos and wombats get to Australia? And then there's the problem of the heat released by cramming 3.6 billion years of radioactive decay into 6,000 years. You can find a discussion (complete with the math) in the article Were Adam and Eve Toast? by Dr. Joe Meert, a geologist at the U. of Florida. Notice that scientists actually ""do the math"" and show it to you. They don't just make claims. If you want, I'll show you the math involved in all of the water calculations - I just figured that you wouldn't understand it anyway. OK. Now we are looking for you to do the math from your original claim, and the math that answers my objections. Right.
