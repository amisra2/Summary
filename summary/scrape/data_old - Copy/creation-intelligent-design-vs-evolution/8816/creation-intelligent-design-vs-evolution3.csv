None of which proclaim the capture of the Hebrews, despite specific intrest groups searching for them for the past 2 centuries. 2/3) Exodus is supposed to occur about 1200BC, Solomon is supposed to create Isreal about 925BC (This has some archaelogical backing in that there is a slab dedicating a settlement to Solomon) However even here there are problems because Isreal is clearly polytheistic at this time by the Archaeology. This suggests that the text was rewriten at some date after the introduction of monotheism. Going by the archaeology this would be about 600BC. 4) Perhaps, but then you would be disputing the text... Personally I'm inclined to the view that the text pre-600BC is propaganda, (This also coincides with dissappearance of Prophets from the text) Exodus never occured and was made up for political reasons. Solomon to the return from Babylon was doctored history.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","09:26 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","31"
"09-13-2006","8816",3,"peteratwar","230806","So what happened ? Probably a rather insignificant (to the Egyptians) group of Israelites took off without permission for Canaan/Israel/Palestine. A small company of the Egyptian army probably went after them and never found them. Result when Exodus came to be written was a great propaganda boost for the Israelites. 'We fled from the might of the Pharaoh who pursued us with all his force and the Lord God saved us' . Well doesn't take too much to see how a small kernel of truth can get embellished.","Another opinion","230817","There do seem to be some pieces of evidence of the Exodus.

From the second link: ""Finkelstein says the Bible isn't just fantasy, though. He thinks the first books of the Bible were written in the seventh and sixth centuries B.C., long after the Exodus might have happened.

Even with our modern press, you still can see this effect. After all, did we (the US) invade Iraq to free the Iraqi people or did we invade Iraq because of the supposed threat it posed to us with its weapons of mass destruction ...

As far as the Usnews report. The guy found a single hut. That is hardly proof of the exodus. There is no artifact to show that the inhabinates of that hut were the Israeli's.

I am not claiming that any of these pieces of evidence is proof of the Exodus. I am only pointing out some pieces of evidence, flimsy as they are, that point to the possibility of Egypt having defeated a tribe called the Isrealites and some pieces of evidence that may suggest that Israelis were working as workers or as slaves in Egypt. I personally am 100% certain that the Exodus, if there was one, did not happen as described in the Bible. However, I am curious about any evidence that might point to what the reality might have been that was then distorted into the Biblical story. As a side note, perhaps I am wrong in this impression, but I get the impression that you are thinking of me as the representative of the religious side that is arguing for the validity of the Exodus. Since nobody has shown up on this thread to argue that validity and since I am arguing that there might be some underlying reality underneeth the myth (be it simply that Israelis might have been defeated by the Egyptians and that there might have been Israeli workers or slaves in Egypt), you seem to be pinpointing me as the opposition. That is simply incorrect. My view is a moderate one. Ancient myths and legends are often based on a kernel of truth that is distorted and exaggerated, they are no always outright lies. I am simply interested in finding out what that kernel of truth might be.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","01:20 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","36"

My view is that there was probably some true underlying situation, event or set of events that were then exaggerated and distorted through the oral tradition to become the Exodus story of the Bible. I get the impression that you feel that the question of the Exodus is an all or nothing scenario - either the Exodus happened as explained in the Bible or there was no validity to any part of the story (Israelis were not in Egypt, no group of such Israelis left Egypt, etc.). That view is too black and white. Very often in history - such as with the story of Troy - myths and legends are simply distortions of true events that happened. True events are far less noble, grand and glorious than their mythical counterparts. I am simply curious about what kernel of truth might underlie the mythical story of the Exodus and simply presented the two web sites to show some pieces of evidence that might point to that kernel of truth. I agree that the first web site doesn't prove the Exodus, but some of its evidence does give some clues about the historical reality. I personally like peteratwar's guess that a small group of Israelis left Egypt without permission and were pursued by a small detachment of Egyptian troups and that story was grossely distorted into the Biblical Exodus. That is just one guess, but I can imagine a wide range of rather mundane stories that could have been similarly distorted.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","10:03 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","41"

Maybe, suggests historian Baruch Halpern at Pennsylvania State University, the Exodus actually happened over and over. Everyone knew someone who'd gone to Egypt and come back complaining. ""That's basically what the story is about,"" Halpern says. ""God, you know how much taxes they make us pay in Egypt?""
